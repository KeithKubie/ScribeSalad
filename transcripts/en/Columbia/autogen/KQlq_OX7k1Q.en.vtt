careful to make sure that it's being
 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.080
careful to make sure that it's being
played around with well and this is an

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.090
played around with well and this is an
 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.810
played around with well and this is an
interesting image because I think that

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:01.820
interesting image because I think that
 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:08.170
interesting image because I think that
this is really right there so if you

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:08.180
this is really right there so if you
 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.700
this is really right there so if you
want to see this image in its glory you

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:09.710
want to see this image in its glory you
 

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.850
want to see this image in its glory you
can go over the fabrication lab the the

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:12.860
can go over the fabrication lab the the
 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.560
can go over the fabrication lab the the
idea of the hand I think is kind of

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:14.570
idea of the hand I think is kind of
 

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.230
idea of the hand I think is kind of
interesting in the concept of digital

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240
interesting in the concept of digital
 

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.910
interesting in the concept of digital
fabrication this is where I want to kind

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:18.920
fabrication this is where I want to kind
 

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.400
fabrication this is where I want to kind
of want to go with with a little bit of

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.410
of want to go with with a little bit of
 

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.980
of want to go with with a little bit of
this discussion you know the hand has a

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:23.990
this discussion you know the hand has a
 

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.500
this discussion you know the hand has a
long history of course architecture and

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:26.510
long history of course architecture and
 

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.030
long history of course architecture and
so on this is what the hand you should

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.040
so on this is what the hand you should
 

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.420
so on this is what the hand you should
look like a fabrication lab so I want to

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.430
look like a fabrication lab so I want to
 

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.400
look like a fabrication lab so I want to
show a few projects that we've done in

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.410
show a few projects that we've done in
 

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.920
show a few projects that we've done in
the lab in different methods you know

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:35.930
the lab in different methods you know
 

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.790
the lab in different methods you know
research student work and so on you'll

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800
research student work and so on you'll
 

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.409
research student work and so on you'll
notice there's always the the pretty

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:41.419
notice there's always the the pretty
 

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.140
notice there's always the the pretty
object right and then and then how it

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.150
object right and then and then how it
 

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.070
object right and then and then how it
you know how it has to be done right

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080
you know how it has to be done right
 

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.370
you know how it has to be done right
how we were yes right everybody seems

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380
how we were yes right everybody seems
 

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.480
how we were yes right everybody seems
happy there's Tohru gotcha usually it's

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:53.490
happy there's Tohru gotcha usually it's
 

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.410

we're doing things we're not supposed to

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420
we're doing things we're not supposed to
 

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.280
we're doing things we're not supposed to
be doing in the school sometimes things

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:10.290
be doing in the school sometimes things
 

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.930
be doing in the school sometimes things
are not quite all that digitally

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940
are not quite all that digitally
 

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.620
are not quite all that digitally
fabricated sometimes it's dangerous and

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:18.630
fabricated sometimes it's dangerous and
 

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.590
fabricated sometimes it's dangerous and
basically usually involves a lot of

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600
basically usually involves a lot of
 

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.410
basically usually involves a lot of
people right sometimes it's a small

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420
people right sometimes it's a small
 

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.790
people right sometimes it's a small
amount but for larger projects there's a

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800
amount but for larger projects there's a
 

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.860
amount but for larger projects there's a
lot of people what I want to talk about

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:27.870
lot of people what I want to talk about
 

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.800
lot of people what I want to talk about
is a couple of projects we've done very

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:30.810
is a couple of projects we've done very
 

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.320
is a couple of projects we've done very
quickly related to trips that we do we

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.330
quickly related to trips that we do we
 

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.190
quickly related to trips that we do we
go abroad and we build something with

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200
go abroad and we build something with
 

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.220
go abroad and we build something with
another school this is the first one in

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.230
another school this is the first one in
 

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.750
another school this is the first one in
Torino and then we also did one that

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760
Torino and then we also did one that
 

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.640
Torino and then we also did one that
you'll see in Madrid the interesting

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:43.650
you'll see in Madrid the interesting
 

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.140
you'll see in Madrid the interesting
thing about that and the reason why it's

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.150
thing about that and the reason why it's
 

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.300
thing about that and the reason why it's
it struck me is what I should show for

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:47.310
it struck me is what I should show for
 

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.150
it struck me is what I should show for
how we work is the goal behind it is

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160
how we work is the goal behind it is
 

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.980
how we work is the goal behind it is
that it's not just about digital

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:51.990
that it's not just about digital
 

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.020

having the design work fed into it and
 

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.850
having the design work fed into it and
then it prints out something in a way

00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860
then it prints out something in a way
 

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.500
then it prints out something in a way
right it's not about letting the machine

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:00.510
right it's not about letting the machine
 

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.420
right it's not about letting the machine
actually takeover has a lot to do with

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:02.430
actually takeover has a lot to do with
 

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.600
actually takeover has a lot to do with
people in fact a lot of these projects a

this was the bike I rode around Torino

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:20.190
this was the bike I rode around Torino
 

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.590
this was the bike I rode around Torino
right since it's gonna be a little bit

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600
right since it's gonna be a little bit

basically you know we get somebody to

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:29.400
basically you know we get somebody to
 

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.010
basically you know we get somebody to
donate material we get somebody to

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.020
donate material we get somebody to
 

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.110
donate material we get somebody to
donate a space in an event and so on and

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120
donate a space in an event and so on and
 

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.000
donate a space in an event and so on and
then we go and build something right at

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.010
then we go and build something right at
 

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.100
then we go and build something right at
these locations and and it's a little

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.110
these locations and and it's a little
 

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.150
these locations and and it's a little
bit different than digitally fabricated

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160
bit different than digitally fabricated
 

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.150
bit different than digitally fabricated
we deal with the same concepts right

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160
we deal with the same concepts right
 

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.950
we deal with the same concepts right
parametric's surprisingly and you don't

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:42.960
parametric's surprisingly and you don't
 

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.530
parametric's surprisingly and you don't
have to digitally output them we deal

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540
have to digitally output them we deal
 

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.360
have to digitally output them we deal
with a lot of solid modelling a lot of

as you'll see we all get together and

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:53.310
as you'll see we all get together and
 

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.190
as you'll see we all get together and
build stuff and take a look at it the

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200
build stuff and take a look at it the
 

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.060
build stuff and take a look at it the
same way you would do on the computer

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.070
same way you would do on the computer

they look in the context and then this

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:11.209
they look in the context and then this
 

00:11:11.209 --> 00:11:13.179
they look in the context and then this
is the location that in this case we

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:13.189
is the location that in this case we
 

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:15.429
is the location that in this case we
were building an info center so we're

00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:15.439
were building an info center so we're
 

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:17.319
were building an info center so we're
building a pavilion for an event it's

the World Design Capital this was in

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:19.939
the World Design Capital this was in
 

00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:22.629
the World Design Capital this was in
Italy that was let's say 12 Italian

Italy in a summer right so we learn a

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:27.769
Italy in a summer right so we learn a
 

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:29.169
Italy in a summer right so we learn a
lot about the fact that you have to stay

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:29.179
lot about the fact that you have to stay
 

00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:30.790
lot about the fact that you have to stay
in the shade so everybody's over here on

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800
in the shade so everybody's over here on
 

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.369
in the shade so everybody's over here on
the side but finally somebody has to get

00:11:33.369 --> 00:11:33.379
the side but finally somebody has to get
 

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:34.929
the side but finally somebody has to get
to work and this is typical of anything

00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:34.939
to work and this is typical of anything
 

00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:37.540

so Ingrid finally picked up the first

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:37.550
so Ingrid finally picked up the first
 

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.090
so Ingrid finally picked up the first
piece and everybody got to work digital

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.100
piece and everybody got to work digital
 

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.850
piece and everybody got to work digital
prints a little bit of analog work right

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:42.860
prints a little bit of analog work right
 

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.559

it's not all digital but there's digital

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:44.569
it's not all digital but there's digital
 

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:47.290
it's not all digital but there's digital
involved and all kinds of fabrication as

well I was sitting in the Sun I'm not

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:48.769
well I was sitting in the Sun I'm not
 

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:52.329
well I was sitting in the Sun I'm not
sure who that is but eventually we come

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:52.339
sure who that is but eventually we come
 

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:54.100
sure who that is but eventually we come
up with some detailing that has to deal

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.110
up with some detailing that has to deal
 

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.590
up with some detailing that has to deal
with how we would create something with

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600
with how we would create something with
 

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.989
with how we would create something with
the same sort of effect that we talked

00:11:58.989 --> 00:11:58.999
the same sort of effect that we talked
 

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:00.280

about this is really a two week project

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.290
about this is really a two week project
 

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.040
about this is really a two week project
were there for two weeks only the same

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.050
were there for two weeks only the same
 

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.019
were there for two weeks only the same
sort of effect that we've that we've

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:05.029
sort of effect that we've that we've
 

00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:06.369
sort of effect that we've that we've
used for a lot of the digital

00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:06.379
used for a lot of the digital
 

00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:08.439
used for a lot of the digital
fabrication projects that come straight

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:08.449
fabrication projects that come straight
 

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:11.439
fabrication projects that come straight
from the machinery but if you notice

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:11.449
from the machinery but if you notice
 

00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:13.269
from the machinery but if you notice
there's a lot of handwork this is a I

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279
there's a lot of handwork this is a I
 

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:14.949
there's a lot of handwork this is a I
think it's an interesting project or set

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959
think it's an interesting project or set
 

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:17.290
think it's an interesting project or set
of projects because it allows people to

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:17.300
of projects because it allows people to
 

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.340
of projects because it allows people to

what you would do just faster

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.050
what you would do just faster

what you would do just faster
differently more precise and so on so we

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160
differently more precise and so on so we
 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.759
differently more precise and so on so we
start building things right it's going

00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:30.769

in taking photos so this was the you

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:37.579
in taking photos so this was the you

like how to work at night right because

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:44.449
like how to work at night right because
 

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:46.360
like how to work at night right because
they did not have any lights at our

us construction workers so we can show

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160
us construction workers so we can show
 

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.090

the Italians and we had a nice large

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.100
the Italians and we had a nice large
 

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.710
the Italians and we had a nice large
location where we were able to give our

00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720
location where we were able to give our
 

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.179
location where we were able to give our
presentation which we don't have here in

00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:01.189
presentation which we don't have here in
 

00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:04.280

going on to Madrid at this location what

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120
going on to Madrid at this location what
 

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.250
going on to Madrid at this location what
happened is this was the second event

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:11.260
happened is this was the second event
 

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.490
happened is this was the second event
that we did with the fabrication lab so

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500
that we did with the fabrication lab so
 

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.990
that we did with the fabrication lab so
we started to play a little bit of an

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000
we started to play a little bit of an
 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.530
we started to play a little bit of an
idea about how we could how we could

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:19.540
idea about how we could how we could
 

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.910
idea about how we could how we could
engage with the culture how we could

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920
engage with the culture how we could
 

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.250
engage with the culture how we could
deal with how things are constructed

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:23.260
deal with how things are constructed
 

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.420
deal with how things are constructed
differently how the material is

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.430
differently how the material is
 

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.160
differently how the material is
different in another location and so on

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:26.170
different in another location and so on
 

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.140
different in another location and so on
so this is where how we work sort of

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.150
so this is where how we work sort of
 

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.990
so this is where how we work sort of
started to gel as far as the idea of

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000
started to gel as far as the idea of
 

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.910
started to gel as far as the idea of
what these summer workshops would be

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920
what these summer workshops would be
 

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.770
what these summer workshops would be
Torino was the first one it was an

experiment in sorts we still had bikes

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:36.700
experiment in sorts we still had bikes
 

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.350
experiment in sorts we still had bikes
right

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360

and we all we all went the same way sat

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:43.990
and we all we all went the same way sat
 

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.140

down started to do design work in paper

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:46.150
down started to do design work in paper
 

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.480
down started to do design work in paper
same way as we do here as well and then

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:48.490
same way as we do here as well and then
 

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.530
same way as we do here as well and then
started to become more digital as things

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540
started to become more digital as things
 

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.360
started to become more digital as things
as things proceeded an interesting thing

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:54.370
as things proceeded an interesting thing
 

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.990
as things proceeded an interesting thing
that this this involves is the idea that

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000
that this this involves is the idea that
 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.140
that this this involves is the idea that
a lot of the fabrication projects that

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.150
a lot of the fabrication projects that
 

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.640
a lot of the fabrication projects that
we've dealt with have to do of course

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:02.650
we've dealt with have to do of course
 

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.880
we've dealt with have to do of course
with computational files right and a lot

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:05.890
with computational files right and a lot
 

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.950
with computational files right and a lot
of the methods of production and so on

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:07.960
of the methods of production and so on
 

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.630
of the methods of production and so on
and a lot of this gets split up and

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:09.640
and a lot of this gets split up and
 

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.700
and a lot of this gets split up and
brought together into different groups

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:11.710
brought together into different groups
 

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.900
brought together into different groups
of you're working on a project together

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:12.910
of you're working on a project together
 

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.460
of you're working on a project together
of course on a large project you

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:14.470
of course on a large project you
 

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.650
of course on a large project you
understand how you separate the work how

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:16.660
understand how you separate the work how
 

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.970
understand how you separate the work how
you bring it all back together how you

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:17.980
you bring it all back together how you
 

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.380
you bring it all back together how you
deal with this with the computer it's no

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:19.390
deal with this with the computer it's no
 

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.910

different when you're doing this by hand

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920
different when you're doing this by hand
 

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.740
different when you're doing this by hand
in a way and then it is when you're

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:22.750
in a way and then it is when you're
 

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.060
in a way and then it is when you're
doing this digitally with digital

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.070
doing this digitally with digital
 

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.950

fabrication I guess I should say right

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:28.960
fabrication I guess I should say right
 

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.950
fabrication I guess I should say right
so we had the same the same issues when

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:31.960
so we had the same the same issues when
 

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.210
so we had the same the same issues when
you get to the material you have to pick

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:33.220
you get to the material you have to pick
 

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.560
you get to the material you have to pick
it up you have to move it around you

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.570
it up you have to move it around you
 

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.290
it up you have to move it around you
have to get out the saw cut things up

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:37.300
have to get out the saw cut things up
 

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.320
have to get out the saw cut things up
play around with it lay things out for

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:40.330
play around with it lay things out for
 

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.990
play around with it lay things out for
have discussions right about what we're

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000
have discussions right about what we're
 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.640
have discussions right about what we're
doing and so I'll go back to the drawing

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:44.650
doing and so I'll go back to the drawing
 

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.950
doing and so I'll go back to the drawing
board as the old phrase goes right

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:46.960
board as the old phrase goes right
 

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.960
board as the old phrase goes right
eventually come up with well they were a

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:48.970
eventually come up with well they were a
 

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.210
eventually come up with well they were a
little clunky at first the details but

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:51.220
little clunky at first the details but
 

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.040
little clunky at first the details but
started to play around with how to make

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.050
started to play around with how to make
 

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.350
started to play around with how to make
these things right completely out of the

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360
these things right completely out of the
 

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.570
these things right completely out of the
computer to our hands in a way and not

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:57.580
computer to our hands in a way and not
 

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.329
computer to our hands in a way and not
necessarily through all of the machinery

00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:00.339
necessarily through all of the machinery
 

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:03.900
necessarily through all of the machinery
there's Luke lifting and then we all had

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:03.910
there's Luke lifting and then we all had
 

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.110
there's Luke lifting and then we all had
to join in on the game right so the idea

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120
to join in on the game right so the idea
 

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.660
to join in on the game right so the idea
is exactly the same the production is is

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:09.670
is exactly the same the production is is
 

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.000
is exactly the same the production is is
relatively similar but we learned a lot

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.010
relatively similar but we learned a lot
 

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.670
relatively similar but we learned a lot
about the precision and the method

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680
about the precision and the method
 

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.300
about the precision and the method
of dividing up how things work in these

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:16.310
of dividing up how things work in these
 

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.360
of dividing up how things work in these
in these workshops right so it was an

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.370
in these workshops right so it was an
 

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.079
in these workshops right so it was an
exhibit for for Museum so we eventually

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:24.089
exhibit for for Museum so we eventually
 

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:28.220
exhibit for for Museum so we eventually
clad it just the same way as as we do in

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:28.230
clad it just the same way as as we do in
 

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.670
clad it just the same way as as we do in
those project and the head tapas right

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680
those project and the head tapas right
 

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.720
those project and the head tapas right
but a few things that we're interesting

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:32.730
but a few things that we're interesting
 

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.410
but a few things that we're interesting
about this this is this is a a very

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420
about this this is this is a a very
 

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.360
about this this is this is a a very
important point that I learned in Spain

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:38.370
important point that I learned in Spain
 

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.760
important point that I learned in Spain
they vote about everything had no idea

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:40.770
they vote about everything had no idea
 

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.579
they vote about everything had no idea
of why but I just didn't I just didn't

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:43.589
of why but I just didn't I just didn't
 

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:45.560
of why but I just didn't I just didn't
quite understand it being as we always

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:45.570
quite understand it being as we always
 

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.720
quite understand it being as we always
say we're the democracy right in the

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:47.730
say we're the democracy right in the
 

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.449
say we're the democracy right in the
world it's not it really true we had to

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459
world it's not it really true we had to
 

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:52.850
world it's not it really true we had to
vote about every move we made so it was

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860
vote about every move we made so it was
 

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.440

a it became very interesting that you

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:54.450
a it became very interesting that you
 

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.850

method of production right so this is a

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:01.020
method of production right so this is a
 

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.600
method of production right so this is a
new way of working for me which usually

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:02.610
new way of working for me which usually
 

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.519
new way of working for me which usually
you know we don't vote on the computer

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:04.529
you know we don't vote on the computer
 

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:06.740
you know we don't vote on the computer
right it's more than drinking we learned

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.750
right it's more than drinking we learned
 

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.750
right it's more than drinking we learned
how to cut things a little differently

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760
how to cut things a little differently
 

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.949
how to cut things a little differently
and here we're drinking and and as you

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959
and here we're drinking and and as you
 

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:14.780
and here we're drinking and and as you
can see it's all by hand again I showed

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:14.790
can see it's all by hand again I showed
 

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.420
can see it's all by hand again I showed
all of the digital stuff previously and

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:17.430
all of the digital stuff previously and
 

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.980
all of the digital stuff previously and
I'll show some more at the end we

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:18.990
I'll show some more at the end we
 

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.829
I'll show some more at the end we
learned about the Vitruvius man we

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839
learned about the Vitruvius man we
 

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:24.230
learned about the Vitruvius man we
learned a little bit of self-defense how

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240
learned a little bit of self-defense how
 

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.510
learned a little bit of self-defense how
to break things if you don't have any

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:26.520
to break things if you don't have any
 

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.150
to break things if you don't have any
any machines to break them with and how

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160
any machines to break them with and how
 

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.380
any machines to break them with and how
to be careful that you don't cut your

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.390
to be careful that you don't cut your
 

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.060
to be careful that you don't cut your
hand off right so there's still a lot of

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.070
hand off right so there's still a lot of
 

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.310
hand off right so there's still a lot of
danger involved in all of this

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320
danger involved in all of this
 

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.440
danger involved in all of this
so I guess to sort of wrap up is very

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.450
so I guess to sort of wrap up is very
 

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.019
so I guess to sort of wrap up is very
quick presentation and and if anybody

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:39.029
quick presentation and and if anybody
 

00:16:39.029 --> 00:16:41.660
quick presentation and and if anybody
has questions of course will be free to

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:41.670
has questions of course will be free to
 

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.100
has questions of course will be free to
ask in order to answer them at the end

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.110
ask in order to answer them at the end
 

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.410
ask in order to answer them at the end
one thing that all of this has taught a

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420
one thing that all of this has taught a
 

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.079
one thing that all of this has taught a
lot of us that work on these is in a way

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:48.089
lot of us that work on these is in a way
 

00:16:48.089 --> 00:16:50.600
lot of us that work on these is in a way
the difference between between the

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:50.610
the difference between between the
 

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.430
the difference between between the
digital the precision of the digital and

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440
digital the precision of the digital and
 

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.610
digital the precision of the digital and
the imprecision of the hand which or the

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620
the imprecision of the hand which or the
 

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.199
the imprecision of the hand which or the
body or whatever we want to call it

body or whatever we want to call it
 

00:16:57.209 --> 00:16:58.760
body or whatever we want to call it
which i think is very interesting right

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:58.770
which i think is very interesting right
 

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.440
which i think is very interesting right
some of these projects that we've done

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.450
some of these projects that we've done
 

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.030
some of these projects that we've done
that showed at the beginning of the

precision that the only way to really
 

00:17:06.689 --> 00:17:08.179
precision that the only way to really
get them to work is to break out the

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:08.189
get them to work is to break out the
 

00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:10.220
get them to work is to break out the
hammer and actually start like forcing

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.230
hammer and actually start like forcing
 

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.500

them to go together right there's a lot

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:12.510
them to go together right there's a lot
 

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.240
them to go together right there's a lot
of things that are incorrect it's hard

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.250
of things that are incorrect it's hard
 

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.679
of things that are incorrect it's hard
to keep track of all this stuff even

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:15.689
to keep track of all this stuff even
 

00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:17.600
to keep track of all this stuff even
with the computer a lot of problems a

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:17.610
with the computer a lot of problems a
 

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.449
with the computer a lot of problems a
lot of missing things a lot of Bend

pieces that should have been astray
 

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.780
pieces that should have been astray
right a lot of things are just plain

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:23.790
right a lot of things are just plain
 

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.960
right a lot of things are just plain
wrong right so nonetheless all of this

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:26.970
wrong right so nonetheless all of this
 

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.210
wrong right so nonetheless all of this
digital fabrication has the ability to

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.669
digital fabrication has the ability to
go drastically wrong even with the

go drastically wrong even with the
 

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.470
go drastically wrong even with the

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.530
extent I'll just kind of wait until this
ends but the the kind of focal point

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:21.540
ends but the the kind of focal point
 

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.820
ends but the the kind of focal point
again is kind of this media or this

kind of start thinking of what is

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:33.570
kind of start thinking of what is
 

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.810
kind of start thinking of what is
potentially possible because it is

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:35.820
potentially possible because it is
 

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.930

somewhat unkind of explored terrain for
us so we're kind of putting that onto

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980
us so we're kind of putting that onto
 

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.450
us so we're kind of putting that onto
the table and and we're we're kind of

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460
the table and and we're we're kind of

Moreau which is probably one of the
 

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.320
Moreau which is probably one of the
most pioneered person in this kind of

so as humans we would just become a part

00:25:13.989 --> 00:25:13.999
so as humans we would just become a part
 

00:25:13.999 --> 00:25:16.599
so as humans we would just become a part
of that ecology of objects so not only

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:16.609
of that ecology of objects so not only
 

00:25:16.609 --> 00:25:19.269
of that ecology of objects so not only
you speaking to object objects would be

00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279
you speaking to object objects would be

through this kind of medium of software
 

00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:27.009
through this kind of medium of software
so that's probably the best description

00:25:27.009 --> 00:25:27.019
so that's probably the best description
 

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:29.499
so that's probably the best description
I can give at this point so our research

00:25:29.499 --> 00:25:29.509
I can give at this point so our research

what are what are the issues that we can

00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:50.299
what are what are the issues that we can
 

00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:52.299
what are what are the issues that we can
bring up and what are the kind of things

00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:52.309
bring up and what are the kind of things

we can start kind of computing so this

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:55.850
we can start kind of computing so this
 

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:00.070
we can start kind of computing so this
is cloud lab and I guess the extent is

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080
is cloud lab and I guess the extent is
 

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.080
is cloud lab and I guess the extent is
that people will kind of start joining

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.090
that people will kind of start joining
 

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.979
that people will kind of start joining

mean I guess it's pretty self-evident

00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:39.769
mean I guess it's pretty self-evident
 

00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:42.430
mean I guess it's pretty self-evident
from our mission statement but we're

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440
from our mission statement but we're
 

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.019
from our mission statement but we're
really interested in looking at the city

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:44.029
really interested in looking at the city
 

00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:46.960
really interested in looking at the city
through the lens of of landscape and and

diversity of cities and our work really

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:01.309
diversity of cities and our work really
 

00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:03.820
diversity of cities and our work really
has been diverse in terms of its

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:03.830
has been diverse in terms of its
 

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.500
has been diverse in terms of its
methodology and output and Jeanette's

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:05.510
methodology and output and Jeanette's
 

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.700
methodology and output and Jeanette's
gonna talk a little bit about the

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:06.710
gonna talk a little bit about the
 

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.360
gonna talk a little bit about the
methodology but before we get to that I

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:10.370
methodology but before we get to that I
 

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.980
methodology but before we get to that I
thought it might be just interesting to

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:11.990
thought it might be just interesting to
 

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:16.980
thought it might be just interesting to
see a cross-section of the past work our

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:16.990
see a cross-section of the past work our
 

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:20.519
see a cross-section of the past work our
collaborations have kind of included

also now working on combining the work
of our studios and seminars towards

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:57.490
of our studios and seminars towards
 

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.960
of our studios and seminars towards
generating sort of new forms of

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:00.970
generating sort of new forms of

generating sort of new forms of
educational dialogue and research and I

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.260
educational dialogue and research and I
 

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.470
educational dialogue and research and I
guess with that went oh I wanted to say

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480
guess with that went oh I wanted to say
 

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.080
guess with that went oh I wanted to say
importantly though that I think may be

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.090
importantly though that I think may be
 

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.480
importantly though that I think may be
very very important for our lab is also

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:13.490
very very important for our lab is also
 

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.820
very very important for our lab is also
this notion of collaboration and

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:15.830
this notion of collaboration and
 

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.370
this notion of collaboration and
actually the network of people who work

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:18.380
actually the network of people who work
 

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.430
actually the network of people who work
with us because and very important to us

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440
with us because and very important to us
 

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.769
with us because and very important to us
is this notion that in order to kind of

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:23.779
is this notion that in order to kind of
 

00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:26.080
is this notion that in order to kind of
create cultural change which I know that

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:26.090
create cultural change which I know that
 

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.060
create cultural change which I know that
sounds kind of crazy but but you know in

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:28.070
sounds kind of crazy but but you know in
 

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.799
sounds kind of crazy but but you know in
order to like engage with the world you

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:29.809
order to like engage with the world you
 

00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:31.419
order to like engage with the world you
actually have to build a sort of

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:31.429
actually have to build a sort of
 

00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:35.830
actually have to build a sort of
networks of dialogue and so not only an

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840
networks of dialogue and so not only an
 

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.450
networks of dialogue and so not only an
intelligence that exists within the

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:37.460
intelligence that exists within the

thing though is that through the kind of

00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:32.349
thing though is that through the kind of
 

00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:37.190
thing though is that through the kind of
comments and added knowledge and kind of

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200
 
 

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.809

this is a failed broken mashup but the
 

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.759
this is a failed broken mashup but the
the the project included sort of a map

00:36:59.759 --> 00:36:59.769
the the project included sort of a map
 

00:36:59.769 --> 00:37:04.259
the the project included sort of a map
table these sort of sections and mashups

00:37:04.259 --> 00:37:04.269
table these sort of sections and mashups
 

00:37:04.269 --> 00:37:06.210
table these sort of sections and mashups
that that talked about they sort of in

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:06.220
that that talked about they sort of in
 

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.279
that that talked about they sort of in
you know it collisions if you will of

00:37:08.279 --> 00:37:08.289
you know it collisions if you will of
 

00:37:08.289 --> 00:37:09.809
you know it collisions if you will of
sort of urban systems and natural

00:37:09.809 --> 00:37:09.819
sort of urban systems and natural
 

00:37:09.819 --> 00:37:13.349
sort of urban systems and natural
systems and so this is our first kind of

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359
systems and so this is our first kind of
 

00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:15.630
systems and so this is our first kind of
attempt at outreach which is a party and

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640
attempt at outreach which is a party and
 

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.990
attempt at outreach which is a party and
so we had a really big party

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000
so we had a really big party
 

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.060
so we had a really big party
downtown and with the idea that this

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.070
downtown and with the idea that this
 

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.010
downtown and with the idea that this
Safari 7 Reading Room was essentially

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020
Safari 7 Reading Room was essentially
 

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.660
Safari 7 Reading Room was essentially
kind of an orientation space where you

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:23.670
kind of an orientation space where you
 

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.890
kind of an orientation space where you
can sort of learn about the city

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:24.900
can sort of learn about the city
 

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.780
can sort of learn about the city
download some podcasts and then go out

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:26.790
download some podcasts and then go out
 

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.550
download some podcasts and then go out
and ride the train and take the safari

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560
and ride the train and take the safari
 

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.720
and ride the train and take the safari
and so that was a sort of place where

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:32.730
and so that was a sort of place where
 

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.940
and so that was a sort of place where
you can get oriented and here's some of

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:34.950
you can get oriented and here's some of
 

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:40.010
you can get oriented and here's some of
those elements on display and so now

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020
those elements on display and so now
 

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.110
those elements on display and so now
we're again we want to understand you

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:42.120
we're again we want to understand you
 

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.270
we're again we want to understand you
know what what is the future of safari 7

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280
know what what is the future of safari 7
 

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.980
know what what is the future of safari 7
we have this sort of database and

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:45.990
we have this sort of database and
 

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.910
we have this sort of database and
mapping project and we've also reached

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920
mapping project and we've also reached
 

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.250
mapping project and we've also reached
an agreement with the MTA here in New

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260
an agreement with the MTA here in New
 

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.730
an agreement with the MTA here in New
York to now actually incorporate Safari

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740
York to now actually incorporate Safari
 

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.430
York to now actually incorporate Safari
7 as their kind of Keystone project for

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440
7 as their kind of Keystone project for
 

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.740
7 as their kind of Keystone project for
MTA for Earth Day so we we have a

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:00.750
MTA for Earth Day so we we have a
 

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.240
MTA for Earth Day so we we have a
million metro cards that are being

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:02.250
million metro cards that are being
 

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.910
million metro cards that are being
printed next month and we have an

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920
printed next month and we have an
 

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.680
printed next month and we have an
exhibit now that's going to be up in

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:06.690
exhibit now that's going to be up in
 

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.930
exhibit now that's going to be up in
Vanderbilt so we're really interested in

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940
Vanderbilt so we're really interested in
 

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.180
Vanderbilt so we're really interested in
reaching out to students and to all of

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:11.190
reaching out to students and to all of
 

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.090
reaching out to students and to all of
you to help us lead some tours and and

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:14.100
you to help us lead some tours and and
 

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.190
you to help us lead some tours and and
kind of brainstorm about what that sort

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200
kind of brainstorm about what that sort
 

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.670
kind of brainstorm about what that sort
of Earth Day event could be another

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680
of Earth Day event could be another
 

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.650
of Earth Day event could be another
direction that's been very exciting for

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660
direction that's been very exciting for
 

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.690
direction that's been very exciting for
us in terms of thinking about the future

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700
us in terms of thinking about the future
 

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.090
us in terms of thinking about the future
of this project is how we can take the

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:26.100
of this project is how we can take the
 

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.910
of this project is how we can take the
frame of Safari 7 and start to engage

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920
frame of Safari 7 and start to engage
 

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.790
frame of Safari 7 and start to engage
other global cities where Columbia is

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800
other global cities where Columbia is
 

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.010
other global cities where Columbia is
now establishing a sort of studio-x

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020
now establishing a sort of studio-x
 

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.560
now establishing a sort of studio-x
presence so I'm sure that the studio-x

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:36.570
presence so I'm sure that the studio-x
 

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.360
presence so I'm sure that the studio-x
will be a topic of great discussion

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:38.370
will be a topic of great discussion
 

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.040
will be a topic of great discussion
hopefully when we're up here at the

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:40.050
hopefully when we're up here at the
 

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.010
hopefully when we're up here at the
front but that's another direction that

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020
front but that's another direction that
 

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.380
front but that's another direction that
we're fascinated with it that we really

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:45.390
we're fascinated with it that we really
 

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.260
we're fascinated with it that we really
love to engage students or a our

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.270
love to engage students or a our
 

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.510
love to engage students or a our
students with in terms of brainstorming

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520
students with in terms of brainstorming
 

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.700
students with in terms of brainstorming
about how this frame could begin to

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:52.710
about how this frame could begin to
 

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.180
about how this frame could begin to
engage other cities other environments

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.190
engage other cities other environments
 

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:59.780
engage other cities other environments
and so finally before we close a new

00:38:59.780 --> 00:38:59.790
and so finally before we close a new
 

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:02.630
and so finally before we close a new
another new initiative of the the lab is

been working with people in the city of
 

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.690
been working with people in the city of
New York and trying to develop prototype

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700
New York and trying to develop prototype
 

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.430
New York and trying to develop prototype
projects that engage artists and

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440
projects that engage artists and
 

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.480
projects that engage artists and
scientists along Broadway as a kind of

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:23.490
scientists along Broadway as a kind of
 

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:27.859
scientists along Broadway as a kind of
a way of reframing New York City as a

00:39:27.859 --> 00:39:27.869
a way of reframing New York City as a
 

00:39:27.869 --> 00:39:30.350
a way of reframing New York City as a
sort of a 21st century sustainable city

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:30.360
sort of a 21st century sustainable city
 

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.080
sort of a 21st century sustainable city
so another potential in terms of a our

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:33.090
so another potential in terms of a our
 

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.910

the spatial information design lab with

00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619
the spatial information design lab with
 

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:11.300
the spatial information design lab with
Laura kurgan and what I thought I would

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:11.310
Laura kurgan and what I thought I would
 

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:16.940
Laura kurgan and what I thought I would
focus on the talk today is about our

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:16.950
focus on the talk today is about our
 

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.960
focus on the talk today is about our
methodology in the lab we asked about

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:20.970
methodology in the lab we asked about
 

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.820
methodology in the lab we asked about
how we work and I think one of the

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:22.830
how we work and I think one of the
 

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.440
how we work and I think one of the
interesting things about the spatial

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:24.450
interesting things about the spatial
 

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.620
interesting things about the spatial
information design lab is some of the

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:27.630
information design lab is some of the
 

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:31.780
information design lab is some of the
methods that we use and our methods are

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:31.790
methods that we use and our methods are
 

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.910
methods that we use and our methods are
our methodological put uses data about

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920
our methodological put uses data about
 

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.800
our methodological put uses data about
places to expose social and

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:36.810
places to expose social and
 

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.630
places to expose social and
environmental issues that might not have

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640
environmental issues that might not have
 

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.830
environmental issues that might not have
otherwise been seen and really at the

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:42.840
otherwise been seen and really at the
 

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.410
otherwise been seen and really at the
core of that definition I would say is

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420
core of that definition I would say is
 

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:49.930
core of that definition I would say is
the use of data to expose the underlying

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:49.940
the use of data to expose the underlying
 

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.870
the use of data to expose the underlying
systems of the place and so some of the

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880
systems of the place and so some of the
 

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.790
systems of the place and so some of the
methods I think that our core methods in

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800
methods I think that our core methods in
 

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.060
methods I think that our core methods in
the lab are techniques for collection of

00:40:59.060 --> 00:40:59.070
the lab are techniques for collection of
 

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.760
the lab are techniques for collection of
unique data sets unique forms of

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:01.770
unique data sets unique forms of
 

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.070
unique data sets unique forms of
analysis particularly spatial analysis

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:04.080
analysis particularly spatial analysis
 

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.740
analysis particularly spatial analysis
and unique forms of visualization and

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:08.750
and unique forms of visualization and
 

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.359
and unique forms of visualization and
when we kind of bring those even further

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:11.369
when we kind of bring those even further
 

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:14.030
when we kind of bring those even further
down we have we use I think what's

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040
down we have we use I think what's
 

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.740
down we have we use I think what's
really special about some of the

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:15.750
really special about some of the
 

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.599
really special about some of the
methodological approaches of the lab is

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:17.609
methodological approaches of the lab is
 

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:20.210
methodological approaches of the lab is
the use of quantitative analysis or

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220
the use of quantitative analysis or
 

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.560
the use of quantitative analysis or
quantitative techniques that you might

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:21.570
quantitative techniques that you might
 

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.560
quantitative techniques that you might
find in statistics or social sciences or

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:24.570
find in statistics or social sciences or
 

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:26.840
find in statistics or social sciences or
quantitative methods combined with

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:26.850
quantitative methods combined with
 

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:27.740
quantitative methods combined with
visual reference

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:27.750
visual reference
 

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.520
visual reference
and so so in each project that we work

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:31.530
and so so in each project that we work
 

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.770
and so so in each project that we work
on we really try to think about the

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780
on we really try to think about the
 

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.200
on we really try to think about the
economy between those two and I think

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:36.210
economy between those two and I think
 

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.430
economy between those two and I think
often in data visualization projects you

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440
often in data visualization projects you
 

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.500
often in data visualization projects you
see just visualization you don't see

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:42.510
see just visualization you don't see
 

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.740
see just visualization you don't see
kind of the quantitative methods behind

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:45.750
kind of the quantitative methods behind
 

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.320
kind of the quantitative methods behind
it so I always try to do the statistical

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:48.330
it so I always try to do the statistical
 

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.330
it so I always try to do the statistical
analysis and also do the visualization

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:50.340
analysis and also do the visualization
 

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.520
analysis and also do the visualization
so that the hard sciences is gonna look

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:52.530
so that the hard sciences is gonna look
 

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.570
so that the hard sciences is gonna look
at our data it makes sense them but it

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:56.580
at our data it makes sense them but it
 

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.500
at our data it makes sense them but it
also looks representational and

00:41:59.500 --> 00:41:59.510
also looks representational and
 

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.990
also looks representational and
interesting so if we take one project

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000
interesting so if we take one project
 

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.390
interesting so if we take one project
that I think that might explain that the

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400
that I think that might explain that the
 

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.760
that I think that might explain that the
best and one of the things that Mabel

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:07.770
best and one of the things that Mabel
 

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.280
best and one of the things that Mabel
asked us to do is kind of think about

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:10.290
asked us to do is kind of think about
 

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.820
asked us to do is kind of think about
where you draw your methods from and so

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:13.830
where you draw your methods from and so
 

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:17.150
where you draw your methods from and so
I think one place that we draw a lot of

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160
I think one place that we draw a lot of
 

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.980
I think one place that we draw a lot of
methods from our from social sciences

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:18.990
methods from our from social sciences
 

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.800
methods from our from social sciences
and geography I'm a geographer and by

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:21.810
and geography I'm a geographer and by
 

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.520
and geography I'm a geographer and by
training so that makes a lot of sense

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:25.530
training so that makes a lot of sense
 

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:30.850
training so that makes a lot of sense
and one project that we often look at a

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:30.860
and one project that we often look at a
 

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.940
and one project that we often look at a
different phenomenon in space and so one

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:34.950
different phenomenon in space and so one
 

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.190
different phenomenon in space and so one
of the statistics that I employ a lot in

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200
of the statistics that I employ a lot in
 

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.430
of the statistics that I employ a lot in
my work is the Geddes org or hot spot

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440
my work is the Geddes org or hot spot
 

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.370
my work is the Geddes org or hot spot
statistic maybe I'll just explain what

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380
statistic maybe I'll just explain what
 

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.210
statistic maybe I'll just explain what
that is through approachment so here's a

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220
that is through approachment so here's a
 

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.010
that is through approachment so here's a
project that we did which was the

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020
project that we did which was the
 

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.610
project that we did which was the
geography of buzz and in this project

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:52.620
geography of buzz and in this project
 

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:56.710
geography of buzz and in this project
this is a this map actually shows the

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720
this is a this map actually shows the
 

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.290
this is a this map actually shows the
the hot spot statistic and is showing

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300
the hot spot statistic and is showing
 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.350
the hot spot statistic and is showing
that there's a clustering of theater

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:03.360
that there's a clustering of theater
 

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.040
that there's a clustering of theater
events in Midtown or what do you think

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.050
events in Midtown or what do you think
 

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.720
events in Midtown or what do you think
of as the theater district which makes

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:08.730
of as the theater district which makes
 

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.910
of as the theater district which makes
sense but what's unique about this

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920
sense but what's unique about this
 

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.070
sense but what's unique about this
project is that we collected the data

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:13.080
project is that we collected the data
 

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.710
project is that we collected the data
from the Getty image repository so we

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720
from the Getty image repository so we
 

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.600
from the Getty image repository so we
actually went into the database scraped

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:17.610
actually went into the database scraped
 

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.990
actually went into the database scraped
of their information out of the Getty

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000
of their information out of the Getty
 

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.420
of their information out of the Getty
photos to tell us where events were

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:23.430
photos to tell us where events were
 

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:26.660
photos to tell us where events were
happening in the city and we created a

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:26.670
happening in the city and we created a
 

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:30.440
happening in the city and we created a
database out of those events and we had

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:30.450
database out of those events and we had
 

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.030
database out of those events and we had
latitude and longitude which is our

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040
latitude and longitude which is our
 

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.830
latitude and longitude which is our
spatial points which allowed us to plot

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:33.840
spatial points which allowed us to plot
 

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.500
spatial points which allowed us to plot
each event and these are all kind of all

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:36.510
each event and these are all kind of all
 

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.450
each event and these are all kind of all
the events in New York

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:37.460
the events in New York
 

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.609
the events in New York
city the circles represent how many

00:43:39.609 --> 00:43:39.619
city the circles represent how many
 

00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:41.890
city the circles represent how many
photos were taking at different events

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:41.900
photos were taking at different events
 

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.370
photos were taking at different events
so once we had those that data plotted

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:45.380
so once we had those that data plotted
 

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.370
so once we had those that data plotted
about arts and culture events in the

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:48.380
about arts and culture events in the
 

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.940
about arts and culture events in the
city we were able to make maps such as

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:51.950
city we were able to make maps such as
 

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.060
city we were able to make maps such as
this that shows us where the events

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:55.070
this that shows us where the events
 

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.010
this that shows us where the events
clusters and what we did is we actually

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:57.020
clusters and what we did is we actually
 

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.910
clusters and what we did is we actually
ran a spatial statistics on this and

00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920
ran a spatial statistics on this and
 

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.190
ran a spatial statistics on this and
this is probably not as interesting to

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200
this is probably not as interesting to
 

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.660
this is probably not as interesting to
some people but is really interesting

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:04.670
some people but is really interesting
 

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.780
some people but is really interesting
the social sciences is that we found

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:06.790
the social sciences is that we found
 

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.700
the social sciences is that we found
using the global brands I statistic that

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:09.710
using the global brands I statistic that
 

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.030
using the global brands I statistic that
we had to miss a significant clustering

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040
we had to miss a significant clustering
 

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.770
we had to miss a significant clustering
and different types of Arts and Culture

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:14.780
and different types of Arts and Culture
 

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:21.370
and different types of Arts and Culture
events which was illustrated through our

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:21.380
events which was illustrated through our
 

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.380
events which was illustrated through our
different visualization so that's one

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:23.390
different visualization so that's one
 

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:27.310
different visualization so that's one
way that we use methods and what we

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:27.320
way that we use methods and what we
 

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.310
way that we use methods and what we
found was that arts and culture events

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:30.320
found was that arts and culture events
 

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.849
found was that arts and culture events
in New York and Los Angeles tend to

00:44:33.849 --> 00:44:33.859
in New York and Los Angeles tend to
 

00:44:33.859 --> 00:44:38.440
in New York and Los Angeles tend to
cluster around what people would think

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:38.450
cluster around what people would think
 

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.079
cluster around what people would think
of as iconic architecture in those

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:41.089
of as iconic architecture in those
 

00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:44.079
of as iconic architecture in those
spaces so they might not be hotspots of

00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:44.089
spaces so they might not be hotspots of
 

00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:46.410
spaces so they might not be hotspots of
one of the hotspots that we found is

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:46.420
one of the hotspots that we found is
 

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.790
one of the hotspots that we found is
Times Square in New York how many people

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800
Times Square in New York how many people
 

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.710
Times Square in New York how many people
really think of Times Square as a place

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720
really think of Times Square as a place
 

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.170
really think of Times Square as a place
to go as New Yorkers so what we found is

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:53.180
to go as New Yorkers so what we found is
 

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.650
to go as New Yorkers so what we found is
that the Getty image database is really

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:55.660
that the Getty image database is really
 

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.300
that the Getty image database is really
clustering around places that you

00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:58.310
clustering around places that you
 

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.670
clustering around places that you
iconically think of in those cities so

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680
iconically think of in those cities so
 

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.280
iconically think of in those cities so
in New York it was Fifth Avenue Midtown

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:03.290
in New York it was Fifth Avenue Midtown
 

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.770
in New York it was Fifth Avenue Midtown
Times Square in Los Angeles it was

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:05.780
Times Square in Los Angeles it was
 

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:08.770
Times Square in Los Angeles it was
Hollywood Beverly Hills and Sunset Strip

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:08.780
Hollywood Beverly Hills and Sunset Strip
 

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.430
Hollywood Beverly Hills and Sunset Strip
and so what we found by mapping the

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440
and so what we found by mapping the
 

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.980
and so what we found by mapping the
places where images were taken we found

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:14.990
places where images were taken we found
 

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:17.740
places where images were taken we found
out how media represents space and/or

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:17.750
out how media represents space and/or
 

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:20.800
out how media represents space and/or
uses architecture as a way to sell

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:20.810
uses architecture as a way to sell
 

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:27.040
uses architecture as a way to sell
product through the images as I

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.050
product through the images as I
 

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.200
product through the images as I
mentioned before so one of the things

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:29.210
mentioned before so one of the things
 

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.000
mentioned before so one of the things
that I think is unique about what we do

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:31.010
that I think is unique about what we do
 

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.760
that I think is unique about what we do
is quantitative analysis but also

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:32.770
is quantitative analysis but also
 

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.260
is quantitative analysis but also
collection techniques or different types

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:35.270
collection techniques or different types
 

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.670
collection techniques or different types
of collection techniques so the Getty is

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680
of collection techniques so the Getty is
 

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.890
of collection techniques so the Getty is
one example of an interesting collection

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:38.900
one example of an interesting collection
 

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.839
one example of an interesting collection
technique in that we scrape data off of

00:45:40.839 --> 00:45:40.849
technique in that we scrape data off of
 

00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:43.150
technique in that we scrape data off of
a database but we also draw from other

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160
a database but we also draw from other
 

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.450
a database but we also draw from other
types other fields for collection

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:46.460
types other fields for collection
 

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.820
types other fields for collection
techniques and so we draw from computer

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:48.830
techniques and so we draw from computer
 

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.380
techniques and so we draw from computer
science and geography again

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:50.390
science and geography again
 

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.440
science and geography again
this project in Beijing we created air

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:53.450
this project in Beijing we created air
 

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.200
this project in Beijing we created air
quality sensors that collect information

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:56.210
quality sensors that collect information
 

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:59.980
quality sensors that collect information
about air quality by place and so as

00:45:59.980 --> 00:45:59.990
about air quality by place and so as
 

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.370
about air quality by place and so as
you're moving through the city you're

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:03.380
you're moving through the city you're
 

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.990
you're moving through the city you're
collecting different air quality

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000
collecting different air quality
 

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.690
collecting different air quality
information so this is actually Jen's

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:07.700
information so this is actually Jen's
 

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.420
information so this is actually Jen's
path one day with the air quality sensor

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:10.430
path one day with the air quality sensor
 

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.900
path one day with the air quality sensor
that we created for her and this is

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:13.910
that we created for her and this is
 

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:18.789
that we created for her and this is
another path that she took one day and

00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:18.799
another path that she took one day and
 

00:46:18.799 --> 00:46:21.279
another path that she took one day and
we hooked these up with a cell phone

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:21.289
we hooked these up with a cell phone
 

00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:24.670
we hooked these up with a cell phone
technology so that once the data is

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680
technology so that once the data is
 

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.220
technology so that once the data is
collected by the GPS in air quality it's

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:27.230
collected by the GPS in air quality it's
 

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.700
collected by the GPS in air quality it's
submitted back to main server using SMS

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:30.710
submitted back to main server using SMS
 

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.769
submitted back to main server using SMS
message technology or cell phone

00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:32.779
message technology or cell phone
 

00:46:32.779 --> 00:46:37.029
message technology or cell phone
technology and the sensors use GPS

00:46:37.029 --> 00:46:37.039
technology and the sensors use GPS
 

00:46:37.039 --> 00:46:39.750
technology and the sensors use GPS
devices and this is a particulate matter

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760
devices and this is a particulate matter
 

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.930
devices and this is a particulate matter
sensor and one of the things that we did

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:43.940
sensor and one of the things that we did
 

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.000
sensor and one of the things that we did
in this project would really measure

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.010
in this project would really measure
 

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.480
in this project would really measure
smog and we looked at the particles

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:49.490
smog and we looked at the particles
 

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:54.190
smog and we looked at the particles
during the Beijing Olympics and so the

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200
during the Beijing Olympics and so the
 

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.720
during the Beijing Olympics and so the
way that this works is similar in that

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:55.730
way that this works is similar in that
 

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:59.920
way that this works is similar in that
you collect the X&amp;Y coordinate by time

00:46:59.920 --> 00:46:59.930
you collect the X&amp;Y coordinate by time
 

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.380
you collect the X&amp;Y coordinate by time
and then this is actually a reading of

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:02.390
and then this is actually a reading of
 

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:06.130
and then this is actually a reading of
the CEO at that time and so the data

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:06.140
the CEO at that time and so the data
 

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.609
the CEO at that time and so the data
base is then translated spatially these

00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:09.619
base is then translated spatially these
 

00:47:09.619 --> 00:47:11.589
base is then translated spatially these
maps were featured in the New York Times

00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599
maps were featured in the New York Times
 

00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:14.680
maps were featured in the New York Times
this is actually during the Beijing

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:14.690
this is actually during the Beijing
 

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:18.970
this is actually during the Beijing
Olympics they put in a reduction of cars

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:18.980
Olympics they put in a reduction of cars
 

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.539
Olympics they put in a reduction of cars
on the road so some days had if your

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:22.549
on the road so some days had if your
 

00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:24.069
on the road so some days had if your
license plate had an even number you

00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079
license plate had an even number you
 

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:25.359
license plate had an even number you
would be on the road and if you had an

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:25.369
would be on the road and if you had an
 

00:47:25.369 --> 00:47:28.029
would be on the road and if you had an
odd number this is before the car

00:47:28.029 --> 00:47:28.039
odd number this is before the car
 

00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:30.099
odd number this is before the car
mandate was put in place this was after

00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:30.109
mandate was put in place this was after
 

00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:34.660
mandate was put in place this was after
so you saw some decrease in carbon

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:34.670
so you saw some decrease in carbon
 

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:37.240
so you saw some decrease in carbon
emissions and this is new york for the

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:37.250
emissions and this is new york for the
 

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.950
emissions and this is new york for the
same time so we were able to use the

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960
same time so we were able to use the
 

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.789
same time so we were able to use the
device to follow and this is the

00:47:42.789 --> 00:47:42.799
device to follow and this is the
 

00:47:42.799 --> 00:47:46.480
device to follow and this is the
marathon route to get an idea how the

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:46.490
marathon route to get an idea how the
 

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:50.079
marathon route to get an idea how the
athletes might feel as they run along

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:50.089
athletes might feel as they run along
 

00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:52.269
athletes might feel as they run along
the limpid route so when we found with

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:52.279
the limpid route so when we found with
 

00:47:52.279 --> 00:47:56.289
the limpid route so when we found with
the carbon admissions data is that air

00:47:56.289 --> 00:47:56.299
the carbon admissions data is that air
 

00:47:56.299 --> 00:47:58.210
the carbon admissions data is that air
quality for carbon improved but we

00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:58.220
quality for carbon improved but we
 

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.180
quality for carbon improved but we
actually found that

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:00.190
actually found that
 

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.180
actually found that
we also did another reading at the

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:03.190
we also did another reading at the
 

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.519
we also did another reading at the
Olympic Park tenement square in the

00:48:05.519 --> 00:48:05.529
Olympic Park tenement square in the
 

00:48:05.529 --> 00:48:07.829
Olympic Park tenement square in the
temple of heaven and we found readings

00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839
temple of heaven and we found readings
 

00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:09.599
temple of heaven and we found readings
that were much higher for particulate

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:09.609
that were much higher for particulate
 

00:48:09.609 --> 00:48:10.019
that were much higher for particulate
matter

00:48:10.019 --> 00:48:10.029
matter
 

00:48:10.029 --> 00:48:14.489
matter
so the enforcement for cars helped with

00:48:14.489 --> 00:48:14.499
so the enforcement for cars helped with
 

00:48:14.499 --> 00:48:18.059
so the enforcement for cars helped with
carbon emissions but particular matter

00:48:18.059 --> 00:48:18.069
carbon emissions but particular matter
 

00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:20.400
carbon emissions but particular matter
was still very high so the red here is

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:20.410
was still very high so the red here is
 

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.099
was still very high so the red here is
actually showing you particulate matter

00:48:23.099 --> 00:48:23.109
actually showing you particulate matter
 

00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:25.829
actually showing you particulate matter
and you can see in some cases it's you

00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839
and you can see in some cases it's you
 

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:27.979
and you can see in some cases it's you
know 20 times higher than it would be in

00:48:27.979 --> 00:48:27.989
know 20 times higher than it would be in
 

00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:32.160
know 20 times higher than it would be in
New York is yellow and London is orange

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:32.170
New York is yellow and London is orange
 

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.890
New York is yellow and London is orange
this is the World Health Organization

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:34.900
this is the World Health Organization
 

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.930
this is the World Health Organization
standards for developing countries right

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:36.940
standards for developing countries right
 

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.930
standards for developing countries right
here you can see how much higher the

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:39.940
here you can see how much higher the
 

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.969
here you can see how much higher the
particulate matter was and this is the

00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:41.979
particulate matter was and this is the
 

00:48:41.979 --> 00:48:44.719
particulate matter was and this is the
AMA Beck start I mean actually see the

00:48:44.719 --> 00:48:44.729
AMA Beck start I mean actually see the
 

00:48:44.729 --> 00:48:46.920
AMA Beck start I mean actually see the
during the track and field events and I

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:46.930
during the track and field events and I
 

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.079
during the track and field events and I
don't know if anybody remember the

00:48:49.079 --> 00:48:49.089
don't know if anybody remember the
 

00:48:49.089 --> 00:48:51.539
don't know if anybody remember the
Olympics but it was raining a lot during

00:48:51.539 --> 00:48:51.549
Olympics but it was raining a lot during
 

00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:53.999
Olympics but it was raining a lot during
that time and so that's why the levels

00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:54.009
that time and so that's why the levels
 

00:48:54.009 --> 00:48:58.319
that time and so that's why the levels
are much lower during that and data can

00:48:58.319 --> 00:48:58.329
are much lower during that and data can
 

00:48:58.329 --> 00:49:01.620
are much lower during that and data can
be quantitative but it can also be

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:01.630
be quantitative but it can also be
 

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.890
be quantitative but it can also be
visual so we took images every day and

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:04.900
visual so we took images every day and
 

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.380
visual so we took images every day and
so these images are a part of our what

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:07.390
so these images are a part of our what
 

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:10.559
so these images are a part of our what
we consider data when we talk about the

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:10.569
we consider data when we talk about the
 

00:49:10.569 --> 00:49:13.049
we consider data when we talk about the
lab being focused on data but you can

00:49:13.049 --> 00:49:13.059
lab being focused on data but you can
 

00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:17.400
lab being focused on data but you can
see on opening day it was a particular

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:17.410
see on opening day it was a particular
 

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.249
see on opening day it was a particular
matter was 13 times higher than it was

00:49:20.249 --> 00:49:20.259
matter was 13 times higher than it was
 

00:49:20.259 --> 00:49:23.940
matter was 13 times higher than it was
in New York City but in some cases it

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:23.950
in New York City but in some cases it
 

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.160
in New York City but in some cases it
was actually lower and there's lots of

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:26.170
was actually lower and there's lots of
 

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:29.579
was actually lower and there's lots of
speculation of why that is and one of

00:49:29.579 --> 00:49:29.589
speculation of why that is and one of
 

00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:31.979
speculation of why that is and one of
the speculations is that the Chinese

00:49:31.979 --> 00:49:31.989
the speculations is that the Chinese
 

00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:33.450
the speculations is that the Chinese
government was actually seeding the

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:33.460
government was actually seeding the
 

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.809
government was actually seeding the
clouds during the last week to - if it

00:49:36.809 --> 00:49:36.819
clouds during the last week to - if it
 

00:49:36.819 --> 00:49:38.759
clouds during the last week to - if it
rains and the particulate matter would

00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:38.769
rains and the particulate matter would
 

00:49:38.769 --> 00:49:42.120
rains and the particulate matter would
actually come down the ground but those

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:42.130
actually come down the ground but those
 

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:46.109
actually come down the ground but those
are speculation visualization is also

00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119
are speculation visualization is also
 

00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:49.559
are speculation visualization is also
another component of kind of how we

00:49:49.559 --> 00:49:49.569
another component of kind of how we
 

00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:51.959
another component of kind of how we
think are our methods and we really draw

00:49:51.959 --> 00:49:51.969
think are our methods and we really draw
 

00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:53.789
think are our methods and we really draw
I think also from art design and I

00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799
I think also from art design and I
 

00:49:53.799 --> 00:49:55.400
I think also from art design and I
always put geography because there's

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:55.410
always put geography because there's
 

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:58.709
always put geography because there's
kind of a history of cartographic

00:49:58.709 --> 00:49:58.719
kind of a history of cartographic
 

00:49:58.719 --> 00:50:00.390
kind of a history of cartographic
representation that comes out of

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400
representation that comes out of
 

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.309
representation that comes out of
geography which I think very much

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319
geography which I think very much
 

00:50:02.319 --> 00:50:05.609
geography which I think very much
relates to art and design and so in this

00:50:05.609 --> 00:50:05.619
relates to art and design and so in this
 

00:50:05.619 --> 00:50:07.499
relates to art and design and so in this
project the million dollar blocks

00:50:07.499 --> 00:50:07.509
project the million dollar blocks

where people texted what were they

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:48.460
where people texted what were they
 

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.840
where people texted what were they
interested in and so forth and so it

interested in and so forth and so it
 

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:54.420

how people observe space because what we
 

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.430
how people observe space because what we
found is their particular locations

00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440

to send their information back in some
 

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.830
to send their information back in some
way and so when they got a response they

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:13.840
way and so when they got a response they
 

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.990
way and so when they got a response they
wanted to respond back so we got a lot

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000
wanted to respond back so we got a lot
 

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.640

would argue that the interests are

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:12.320

actually quite central to architecture

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:13.910
actually quite central to architecture
 

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:15.460
actually quite central to architecture
and design and hopefully that'll be

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:15.470
and design and hopefully that'll be
 

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:17.230
and design and hopefully that'll be
illustrated through some of the work

the practice as well so I'll provide
 

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.140
the practice as well so I'll provide
some context to explain all this

work here and AZ so but what needs to be
 

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:31.150

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.960
practitioners in the end remain
operating in their own disciplines so

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:36.970
operating in their own disciplines so

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:43.130
architecture and there's certainly a
 

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:45.339
architecture and there's certainly a
number of architecture schools I'd say

00:59:45.339 --> 00:59:45.349
number of architecture schools I'd say
 

00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:47.890
number of architecture schools I'd say
the majority that have some underlying

the majority that have some underlying
 

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.589
the majority that have some underlying

curriculum that does engage in this
 

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.000
curriculum that does engage in this
relationship between film and

many places that are looking at it very

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720
many places that are looking at it very
 

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.740
many places that are looking at it very
critically that have been trying to

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:08.750
critically that have been trying to
 

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.210
critically that have been trying to
explore what that actually means deeply

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:12.220
explore what that actually means deeply
 

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.710
explore what that actually means deeply
so I'm going to show you a couple of

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720
so I'm going to show you a couple of
 

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.589
so I'm going to show you a couple of
examples of the work and describe why we

01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599
examples of the work and describe why we
 

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:23.890
examples of the work and describe why we
call that research as kate has and

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:23.900
call that research as kate has and
 

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.020
call that research as kate has and
jeanette have talked about I agree it is

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:26.030
jeanette have talked about I agree it is
 

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.540
jeanette have talked about I agree it is
incredibly important to talk about the

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:28.550
incredibly important to talk about the
 

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.400
incredibly important to talk about the
shoulders and people that you stand on

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:30.410
shoulders and people that you stand on
 

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:33.010

none of this work it's created by you

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:33.020
none of this work it's created by you

none of this work it's created by you
know in in a vacuum or in isolation and

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:35.660
know in in a vacuum or in isolation and
 

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:42.250
know in in a vacuum or in isolation and
so at the moment so there's a number of

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:42.260
so at the moment so there's a number of
 

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.800
so at the moment so there's a number of
things so looking for milk out you know

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:44.810
things so looking for milk out you know
 

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:46.130
things so looking for milk out you know
of course have a relation

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140
of course have a relation
 

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.630
of course have a relation
with the school and a lot of the the

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640
with the school and a lot of the the
 

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.950
with the school and a lot of the the
knowledge that sort of created gets

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960
knowledge that sort of created gets
 

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.569
knowledge that sort of created gets
shared back through the visionary

01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:53.579
shared back through the visionary
 

01:00:53.579 --> 01:00:56.589

methods of practice of course that I run

01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599
methods of practice of course that I run
 

01:00:56.599 --> 01:01:01.130
methods of practice of course that I run
and then so then there's places like

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140
and then so then there's places like
 

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.779
and then so then there's places like
within columbia like the Earth Institute

01:01:02.779 --> 01:01:02.789
within columbia like the Earth Institute
 

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:04.220
within columbia like the Earth Institute
where we're currently working on a

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:04.230
where we're currently working on a
 

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:06.380
where we're currently working on a

whole other design school patterns that

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:13.170
whole other design school patterns that
 

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.720
whole other design school patterns that
we're working with as well

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:14.730
we're working with as well
 

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:16.880
we're working with as well
this isn't I don't see this in any way

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:16.890
this isn't I don't see this in any way
 

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.920
this isn't I don't see this in any way
as a conflict of interest in terms of

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:18.930
as a conflict of interest in terms of
 

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.599
as a conflict of interest in terms of
which score we privilege it's more

01:01:20.599 --> 01:01:20.609
which score we privilege it's more
 

01:01:20.609 --> 01:01:23.539
which score we privilege it's more
really about that it offers an

01:01:23.539 --> 01:01:23.549
really about that it offers an
 

01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:29.059
really about that it offers an
intellectual plurality that you know

01:01:29.059 --> 01:01:29.069
intellectual plurality that you know
 

01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:30.259
intellectual plurality that you know
because there are some things that can

01:01:30.259 --> 01:01:30.269
because there are some things that can
 

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:31.579
because there are some things that can
be done at Parsons that can't be done

01:01:31.579 --> 01:01:31.589
be done at Parsons that can't be done
 

01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:33.829
be done at Parsons that can't be done
here and some of the things that here

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839
here and some of the things that here
 

01:01:33.839 --> 01:01:37.069
here and some of the things that here
they can't be done there and then

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079
they can't be done there and then
 

01:01:37.079 --> 01:01:39.440
they can't be done there and then
there's various projects that have come

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:39.450
there's various projects that have come
 

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.839
there's various projects that have come
through that we're currently involved in

01:01:41.839 --> 01:01:41.849
through that we're currently involved in
 

01:01:41.849 --> 01:01:45.109
through that we're currently involved in
with NGO organizations like the Red

and and and I'm just gonna speak today

01:01:57.859 --> 01:01:57.869
and and and I'm just gonna speak today
 

01:01:57.869 --> 01:01:59.960
and and and I'm just gonna speak today
about two of the projects which is

01:01:59.960 --> 01:01:59.970
about two of the projects which is
 

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:02.200
about two of the projects which is

cities of preference and the park tower
 

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:07.640
cities of preference and the park tower
animation but before I do I think it's

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:07.650
animation but before I do I think it's
 

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:09.769
animation but before I do I think it's
worth professing those with the labs

01:02:09.769 --> 01:02:09.779
worth professing those with the labs
 

01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:12.710
worth professing those with the labs
research agenda just to lay out some

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720
research agenda just to lay out some
 

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.160
research agenda just to lay out some
ground work and I once heard research

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:16.170
ground work and I once heard research
 

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.769
ground work and I once heard research
described very immediately with this

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:18.779
described very immediately with this
 

01:02:18.779 --> 01:02:23.440
described very immediately with this
diagram and that is that on the one side

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:23.450
diagram and that is that on the one side
 

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:27.259
diagram and that is that on the one side
of this line is everything that we know

01:02:27.259 --> 01:02:27.269
of this line is everything that we know
 

01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:29.599
of this line is everything that we know
and on the other side is everything that

01:02:29.599 --> 01:02:29.609
and on the other side is everything that
 

01:02:29.609 --> 01:02:33.799
and on the other side is everything that
we don't know and this is us you me

01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:33.809
we don't know and this is us you me
 

01:02:33.809 --> 01:02:38.269
we don't know and this is us you me
everyone and the point of research is to

01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279
everyone and the point of research is to
 

01:02:38.279 --> 01:02:40.640
everyone and the point of research is to
be able to push this line further into

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:40.650
be able to push this line further into
 

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:44.239
be able to push this line further into
the unknown this is a very simple and at

01:02:44.239 --> 01:02:44.249
the unknown this is a very simple and at
 

01:02:44.249 --> 01:02:46.460
the unknown this is a very simple and at
the most generic level of talking about

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:46.470
the most generic level of talking about
 

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:49.759
the most generic level of talking about
research across all disciplines not just

01:02:49.759 --> 01:02:49.769
research across all disciplines not just
 

01:02:49.769 --> 01:02:50.680
research across all disciplines not just
within architect

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:50.690
within architect
 

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:56.200
within architect
and so in looking more specifically at

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:56.210
and so in looking more specifically at
 

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.660
and so in looking more specifically at
what the labs trying to do now there are

01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:58.670
what the labs trying to do now there are
 

01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:02.200
what the labs trying to do now there are
basically two forms of paradigms of

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:02.210
basically two forms of paradigms of
 

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.560
basically two forms of paradigms of
research if you like that a privilege

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:04.570
research if you like that a privilege
 

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:07.690
research if you like that a privilege
within the Academy and that is the model

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:07.700
within the Academy and that is the model
 

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.620
within the Academy and that is the model
adopted by the sciences so largely

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:10.630
adopted by the sciences so largely
 

01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:14.740
adopted by the sciences so largely
qualitative and and then the model by

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:14.750
qualitative and and then the model by
 

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.250
qualitative and and then the model by
the humanities which is sorry Sciences

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:18.260
the humanities which is sorry Sciences
 

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.430
the humanities which is sorry Sciences
in quantitative and objective and the

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440
in quantitative and objective and the
 

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.530
in quantitative and objective and the
humanities being qualitative and

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:23.540
humanities being qualitative and
 

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:27.250
humanities being qualitative and
subjective this is you know an

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:27.260
subjective this is you know an
 

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:31.540
subjective this is you know an
epistemological concern about different

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:31.550
epistemological concern about different
 

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:33.580
epistemological concern about different
ways of knowing so you know if we talk

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:33.590
ways of knowing so you know if we talk
 

01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.680
ways of knowing so you know if we talk
about what's known and what's unknown

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:35.690
about what's known and what's unknown
 

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:38.530
about what's known and what's unknown
then we really have to talk about how do

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:38.540
then we really have to talk about how do
 

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.420
then we really have to talk about how do
we actually come to know something how

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:40.430
we actually come to know something how
 

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:45.400
we actually come to know something how
is knowledge actually created and you

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:45.410
is knowledge actually created and you
 

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:52.030
is knowledge actually created and you
know these two what generally being you

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:52.040
know these two what generally being you
 

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.540
know these two what generally being you
know considered as dichotomies do leave

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:55.550
know considered as dichotomies do leave
 

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:58.180
know considered as dichotomies do leave
out a lot of other things where

01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:58.190
out a lot of other things where
 

01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.690
out a lot of other things where
invention actually happens and so

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:00.700
invention actually happens and so
 

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.790
invention actually happens and so
because in the lab what's created is

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:03.800
because in the lab what's created is
 

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.460
because in the lab what's created is
actual work films animations and so on

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:06.470
actual work films animations and so on
 

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:08.950
actual work films animations and so on
it doesn't we don't really explore

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960
it doesn't we don't really explore
 

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.260
it doesn't we don't really explore
things technically about films through

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:11.270
things technically about films through
 

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:16.390
things technically about films through
numbers nor do we write about films you

make work and so it means that through

make work and so it means that through
 

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:29.380

the making we're also exploring and

well it's complicated in that it takes a
 

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:45.240
well it's complicated in that it takes a
while to do them so this is a really

modeled up really sort of simply and

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680
modeled up really sort of simply and
 

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.530
modeled up really sort of simply and
crudely without too much detail and then

01:06:58.530 --> 01:06:58.540
crudely without too much detail and then
 

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.030
crudely without too much detail and then
rendered with just a single light source

01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:00.040
rendered with just a single light source
 

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.510
rendered with just a single light source
and then it's printed out or plotted out

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520
and then it's printed out or plotted out
 

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.210
and then it's printed out or plotted out
in this case and traced over by hand

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:07.220
in this case and traced over by hand
 

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.950
in this case and traced over by hand
and then you get these really beautiful

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960
and then you get these really beautiful
 

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.259

so we've got a rendering drawing

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:31.220
so we've got a rendering drawing
 

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:34.299

now for the studio it's it's you know
the work is often I think quite

01:07:47.739 --> 01:07:47.749
the work is often I think quite
 

01:07:47.749 --> 01:07:50.219
the work is often I think quite
beautiful that comes out quite laborious

01:07:50.219 --> 01:07:50.229
beautiful that comes out quite laborious
 

01:07:50.229 --> 01:07:52.930
beautiful that comes out quite laborious
but then how would it actually migrate

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:52.940
but then how would it actually migrate
 

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.839
but then how would it actually migrate
over to animation and so the problem was

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:55.849
over to animation and so the problem was
 

01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:59.079
over to animation and so the problem was
you can't draw every single frame like

you can't draw every single frame like
 

01:07:59.089 --> 01:08:01.390
you can't draw every single frame like
this so another technique had to be

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400
this so another technique had to be
 

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.309
this so another technique had to be
developed and so we wanted to find a

01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319
developed and so we wanted to find a
 

01:08:03.319 --> 01:08:05.759
developed and so we wanted to find a
sort of digital technique that could

01:08:05.759 --> 01:08:05.769
sort of digital technique that could
 

01:08:05.769 --> 01:08:08.019
sort of digital technique that could
that could replicate this at it

01:08:08.019 --> 01:08:08.029
that could replicate this at it
 

01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:11.289
that could replicate this at it

actually share it with other people and
I think the having a lab certainly

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040
I think the having a lab certainly
 

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.060
I think the having a lab certainly
allows for a number of things to happen

01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:58.070
allows for a number of things to happen
 

01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:59.740
allows for a number of things to happen
and it's worth talking about the

01:18:59.740 --> 01:18:59.750
and it's worth talking about the
 

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:03.070
and it's worth talking about the
potential of each lab as this in-between

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080
potential of each lab as this in-between
 

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.060
potential of each lab as this in-between
space between practice and the Academy

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:07.070
space between practice and the Academy
 

01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.000
space between practice and the Academy
where our students are able to also get

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.010
where our students are able to also get
 

01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:12.790
where our students are able to also get
involved in in different ways it's

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800
involved in in different ways it's
 

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.430
involved in in different ways it's
something I think will start to go into

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440
something I think will start to go into
 

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.010
something I think will start to go into
in more detail

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:18.020
 
 

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.300
 
so the idea is to be able to open up

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:21.310
so the idea is to be able to open up
 

01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:23.860
so the idea is to be able to open up
just start a conversation off and then

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:23.870
just start a conversation off and then
 

01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:26.410
just start a conversation off and then
you know ten minutes into it open it up

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:26.420
you know ten minutes into it open it up
 

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.720
you know ten minutes into it open it up
to the audience and have you ask

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:28.730
to the audience and have you ask
 

01:19:28.730 --> 01:20:17.730
to the audience and have you ask
questions directly thank you

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:17.740
 
 

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:23.680
 
okay so everyone can hear me okay great

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:23.690
okay so everyone can hear me okay great
 

01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:27.310
okay so everyone can hear me okay great
I think it might be worth just for the

01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320
I think it might be worth just for the
 

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.690
I think it might be worth just for the
benefit of all the students that are

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:28.700
benefit of all the students that are
 

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:33.160
benefit of all the students that are
here to perhaps talk about if maybe each

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:33.170
here to perhaps talk about if maybe each
 

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:36.190
here to perhaps talk about if maybe each
of us could talk about how students

01:20:36.190 --> 01:20:36.200
of us could talk about how students
 

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.990
of us could talk about how students
actually get involved in the labs what

01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000
actually get involved in the labs what
 

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.420
actually get involved in the labs what
they do specifically because I think

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:40.430
they do specifically because I think
 

01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:42.100
they do specifically because I think
it's a given that we all teach courses

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:42.110
it's a given that we all teach courses
 

01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:46.630
it's a given that we all teach courses
here and that's one way to come across

01:20:46.630 --> 01:20:46.640
here and that's one way to come across
 

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.520
here and that's one way to come across
the same body of knowledge but then

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:48.530
the same body of knowledge but then
 

01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:50.650
the same body of knowledge but then
obviously the lab should offer something

01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:50.660
obviously the lab should offer something
 

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.980
obviously the lab should offer something
else something different too taking a

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:53.990
else something different too taking a
 

01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:57.160
else something different too taking a
studio or a seminar so perhaps we could

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:57.170
studio or a seminar so perhaps we could
 

01:20:57.170 --> 01:21:00.040
studio or a seminar so perhaps we could
just illustrate that to everyone just

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:00.050
just illustrate that to everyone just
 

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:01.900
just illustrate that to everyone just
what exactly it is that people get

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:01.910
what exactly it is that people get
 

01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:04.570
what exactly it is that people get
involved in when they are taking get

01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:04.580
involved in when they are taking get
 

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:10.350
involved in when they are taking get
involved with the lives

01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:10.360
 
 

01:21:10.360 --> 01:22:00.939
 
yeah after we have I have four students

01:22:00.939 --> 01:22:00.949
 
 

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:08.470
 
we're interested in research information

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480
 
 

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.760
 
one of the great things about working in

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:10.770
one of the great things about working in
 

01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:25.520
one of the great things about working in
the lab is you would say for us as we

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:25.530
the lab is you would say for us as we
 

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:26.959
the lab is you would say for us as we
follow a lot of different models of

01:22:26.959 --> 01:22:26.969
follow a lot of different models of
 

01:22:26.969 --> 01:22:28.280
follow a lot of different models of
research I think it really depends on

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:28.290
research I think it really depends on
 

01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:32.270
research I think it really depends on
the project if it's I think we've had

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280
the project if it's I think we've had
 

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.220
the project if it's I think we've had
some really amazing people work with us

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:34.230
some really amazing people work with us
 

01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:35.959
some really amazing people work with us
in the past year especially I mean

01:22:35.959 --> 01:22:35.969
in the past year especially I mean
 

01:22:35.969 --> 01:22:37.879
in the past year especially I mean
that's really when we started me to say

01:22:37.879 --> 01:22:37.889
that's really when we started me to say
 

01:22:37.889 --> 01:22:39.410
that's really when we started me to say
but some we really started to work with

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420
but some we really started to work with
 

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:44.270
but some we really started to work with
people like that and I think it runs the

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280
people like that and I think it runs the
 

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.790
people like that and I think it runs the
range from larger projects where we

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800
range from larger projects where we
 

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.859
range from larger projects where we
really are working as a team and kind of

01:22:50.859 --> 01:22:50.869
 
 

01:22:50.869 --> 01:22:53.810
 
you know we're working for example to

01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820
you know we're working for example to
 

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.700
you know we're working for example to
make the table that was in the studio X

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:55.710
make the table that was in the studio X
 

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.959
make the table that was in the studio X
show or working to kind of broadcast the

01:22:58.959 --> 01:22:58.969
show or working to kind of broadcast the
 

01:22:58.969 --> 01:23:01.640
show or working to kind of broadcast the
podcasts of the maps

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:01.650
podcasts of the maps
 

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:03.500
podcasts of the maps
so I think in that way we work in a very

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:03.510
so I think in that way we work in a very
 

01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:05.810
so I think in that way we work in a very
coordinated way in other ways

01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820
coordinated way in other ways
 

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.520
coordinated way in other ways
there have been projects that we've

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:07.530
there have been projects that we've
 

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.939
there have been projects that we've
worked on that are really student-led

01:23:09.939 --> 01:23:09.949
worked on that are really student-led
 

01:23:09.949 --> 01:23:12.379
worked on that are really student-led
one example that comes to mind is the

01:23:12.379 --> 01:23:12.389
one example that comes to mind is the
 

01:23:12.389 --> 01:23:15.229
one example that comes to mind is the
website we have this page called the

01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239
website we have this page called the
 

01:23:15.239 --> 01:23:17.570
website we have this page called the
urban landscape encyclopedia that was

01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580
urban landscape encyclopedia that was
 

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:18.979
urban landscape encyclopedia that was
started by Evan sharp and that was

01:23:18.979 --> 01:23:18.989
started by Evan sharp and that was
 

01:23:18.989 --> 01:23:20.899
started by Evan sharp and that was
definitely his project that he started

01:23:20.899 --> 01:23:20.909
definitely his project that he started
 

01:23:20.909 --> 01:23:23.209
definitely his project that he started
and kids continued to maintain and it's

01:23:23.209 --> 01:23:23.219
and kids continued to maintain and it's
 

01:23:23.219 --> 01:23:24.779
and kids continued to maintain and it's
been really great to see

01:23:24.779 --> 01:23:24.789
been really great to see
 

01:23:24.789 --> 01:23:26.549
been really great to see
his own interpretation of the lab and

01:23:26.549 --> 01:23:26.559
his own interpretation of the lab and
 

01:23:26.559 --> 01:23:29.549
his own interpretation of the lab and
its potential come out of that so I

01:23:29.549 --> 01:23:29.559
its potential come out of that so I
 

01:23:29.559 --> 01:23:31.409
its potential come out of that so I
think we're interested in all sorts of

01:23:31.409 --> 01:23:31.419
think we're interested in all sorts of
 

01:23:31.419 --> 01:23:36.029
think we're interested in all sorts of
ranges of involvement just especially in

01:23:36.029 --> 01:23:36.039
ranges of involvement just especially in
 

01:23:36.039 --> 01:23:38.699
ranges of involvement just especially in
the case of with the safari seven tours

01:23:38.699 --> 01:23:38.709
the case of with the safari seven tours
 

01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:40.229
the case of with the safari seven tours
and you Jeanette gave these great

01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239
and you Jeanette gave these great
 

01:23:40.239 --> 01:23:41.879
and you Jeanette gave these great
examples with the safari seven tours I

01:23:41.879 --> 01:23:41.889
examples with the safari seven tours I
 

01:23:41.889 --> 01:23:43.949
examples with the safari seven tours I
think we definitely have opportunities

01:23:43.949 --> 01:23:43.959
think we definitely have opportunities
 

01:23:43.959 --> 01:23:46.649
think we definitely have opportunities
for sort of you know strategic strike

01:23:46.649 --> 01:23:46.659
for sort of you know strategic strike
 

01:23:46.659 --> 01:23:48.359
for sort of you know strategic strike
interactions like if you have a free

01:23:48.359 --> 01:23:48.369
interactions like if you have a free
 

01:23:48.369 --> 01:23:53.219
interactions like if you have a free
weekend definitely have opportunities

01:23:53.219 --> 01:23:53.229
weekend definitely have opportunities
 

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:56.219
weekend definitely have opportunities
for interaction and and on the other

01:23:56.219 --> 01:23:56.229
for interaction and and on the other
 

01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:59.429
for interaction and and on the other
hand it's very exciting for us to think

01:23:59.429 --> 01:23:59.439
hand it's very exciting for us to think
 

01:23:59.439 --> 01:24:02.639
hand it's very exciting for us to think
about having longer-term inter you know

01:24:02.639 --> 01:24:02.649
about having longer-term inter you know
 

01:24:02.649 --> 01:24:05.009
about having longer-term inter you know
relationships with an AR students

01:24:05.009 --> 01:24:05.019
relationships with an AR students
 

01:24:05.019 --> 01:24:07.709
relationships with an AR students
student or students in the sense of kind

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719
student or students in the sense of kind
 

01:24:07.719 --> 01:24:09.539
student or students in the sense of kind
of taking something and really seeing it

01:24:09.539 --> 01:24:09.549
of taking something and really seeing it
 

01:24:09.549 --> 01:24:12.599
of taking something and really seeing it
all the way through based on your your

01:24:12.599 --> 01:24:12.609
all the way through based on your your
 

01:24:12.609 --> 01:24:15.389
all the way through based on your your
expertise and your knowledge and so I

01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:15.399
expertise and your knowledge and so I
 

01:24:15.399 --> 01:24:17.250
expertise and your knowledge and so I
guess it's really that dynamic between

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:17.260
guess it's really that dynamic between
 

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.669
guess it's really that dynamic between
the the weekend warrior and the sort of

01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679
the the weekend warrior and the sort of
 

01:24:20.679 --> 01:24:29.660
the the weekend warrior and the sort of
year-long exploration

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:29.670
 
 

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:33.370
 
I guess the the fabrication that we have

01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:33.380
I guess the the fabrication that we have
 

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:35.330
I guess the the fabrication that we have
there are some classes that are

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340
there are some classes that are
 

01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.580
there are some classes that are
specifically related to digital

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:37.590
specifically related to digital
 

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:40.100
specifically related to digital
fabrication and then studios and some

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:40.110
fabrication and then studios and some
 

01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:42.220
fabrication and then studios and some
people just bring work to do in the lab

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:42.230
people just bring work to do in the lab
 

01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:47.830
people just bring work to do in the lab
we also have connections through

01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840
we also have connections through
 

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.630
we also have connections through
projects or so on that happen and so

01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640
projects or so on that happen and so
 

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.120
projects or so on that happen and so
sometimes the students that work they're

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:56.130
sometimes the students that work they're
 

01:24:56.130 --> 01:25:02.360
sometimes the students that work they're
coming from someplace and we do over the

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:02.370
coming from someplace and we do over the
 

01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:04.340
coming from someplace and we do over the
summer where we advertise and so on but

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:04.350
summer where we advertise and so on but
 

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.740
summer where we advertise and so on but
there are an occasion you know very

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:06.750
there are an occasion you know very
 

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:08.450
there are an occasion you know very
small I didn't show a lot of the smaller

01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.460
small I didn't show a lot of the smaller
 

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.480
small I didn't show a lot of the smaller
projects but just a student or to come

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:11.490
projects but just a student or to come
 

01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:15.800
projects but just a student or to come
up with an idea that's about as much

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:15.810
up with an idea that's about as much
 

01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:17.480
up with an idea that's about as much
morgan ization as it actually it takes

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:17.490
morgan ization as it actually it takes
 

01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:21.820
morgan ization as it actually it takes
right so there's a wide variety of ways

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:21.830
right so there's a wide variety of ways
 

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:26.960
right so there's a wide variety of ways
that since our cloud lab just started

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:26.970
that since our cloud lab just started
 

01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:33.410
that since our cloud lab just started
and get the students but somewhat for us

01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420
and get the students but somewhat for us
 

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.930
and get the students but somewhat for us
it's definitely this kind of awareness

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940
it's definitely this kind of awareness
 

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:43.460
it's definitely this kind of awareness
of this front the kind of new space

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:43.470
of this front the kind of new space
 

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:46.150
of this front the kind of new space
filtering right I mean obviously we've

01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:46.160
filtering right I mean obviously we've
 

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.140
filtering right I mean obviously we've
horizontally connect a lot right like a

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:48.150
horizontally connect a lot right like a
 

01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:53.870
horizontally connect a lot right like a
lot of data media resources and not to

01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880
lot of data media resources and not to
 

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.940
lot of data media resources and not to
kind of split hairs that I think we all

01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:55.950
kind of split hairs that I think we all
 

01:25:55.950 --> 01:26:00.110
kind of split hairs that I think we all
kind of reach this point where there's

01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120
kind of reach this point where there's
 

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.260
kind of reach this point where there's
all this there's this new front of kind

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:03.270
all this there's this new front of kind
 

01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:06.820
all this there's this new front of kind
of spatial let's say terrain that's

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:06.830
of spatial let's say terrain that's
 

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:10.160
of spatial let's say terrain that's
somewhat opening so fast that we don't

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:10.170
somewhat opening so fast that we don't
 

01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:12.410
somewhat opening so fast that we don't
even see the edge and we're just kind of

01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420
even see the edge and we're just kind of
 

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:15.880
even see the edge and we're just kind of
jumping in at least for our end I think

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:15.890
jumping in at least for our end I think
 

01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:19.520
jumping in at least for our end I think
to even develop a software it's not

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:19.530
to even develop a software it's not
 

01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:22.100
to even develop a software it's not
somewhat of a you know a quick

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:22.110
somewhat of a you know a quick
 

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:24.920
somewhat of a you know a quick
turnaround so I do see as a kind of long

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:24.930
turnaround so I do see as a kind of long
 

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.740
turnaround so I do see as a kind of long
term project and especially in the kind

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:27.750
term project and especially in the kind
 

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:31.060
term project and especially in the kind
of community of like developing

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:31.070
of community of like developing
 

01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:35.529
of community of like developing
I think the kind of culture in software

01:26:35.529 --> 01:26:35.539
I think the kind of culture in software
 

01:26:35.539 --> 01:26:38.169
I think the kind of culture in software
development is that you kind of extend a

01:26:38.169 --> 01:26:38.179
development is that you kind of extend a
 

01:26:38.179 --> 01:26:41.290
development is that you kind of extend a
previous research so if there's anything

01:26:41.290 --> 01:26:41.300
previous research so if there's anything
 

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.839
previous research so if there's anything
that we would distinct from running a

01:26:43.839 --> 01:26:43.849
that we would distinct from running a
 

01:26:43.849 --> 01:26:47.529
that we would distinct from running a
studio is that it kind of extends the

01:26:47.529 --> 01:26:47.539
studio is that it kind of extends the
 

01:26:47.539 --> 01:26:49.989
studio is that it kind of extends the
previous so the research doesn't get

01:26:49.989 --> 01:26:49.999
previous so the research doesn't get
 

01:26:49.999 --> 01:26:50.350
previous so the research doesn't get
lost

01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360
lost
 

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.109
lost
usually with studios one body keeps one

01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119
usually with studios one body keeps one
 

01:26:53.119 --> 01:26:56.319
usually with studios one body keeps one
projects and goes to the next so even

01:26:56.319 --> 01:26:56.329
projects and goes to the next so even
 

01:26:56.329 --> 01:26:58.379
projects and goes to the next so even
though the professor may have an agenda

01:26:58.379 --> 01:26:58.389
though the professor may have an agenda
 

01:26:58.389 --> 01:27:00.879
though the professor may have an agenda
the body of knowledge is somewhat lost

01:27:00.879 --> 01:27:00.889
the body of knowledge is somewhat lost
 

01:27:00.889 --> 01:27:03.430
the body of knowledge is somewhat lost
but I think what these labs the beauty

01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440
but I think what these labs the beauty
 

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.890
but I think what these labs the beauty
of it is that there's a kind of growing

01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:05.900
of it is that there's a kind of growing
 

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.950
of it is that there's a kind of growing
knowledge in every of them and the

01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960
knowledge in every of them and the
 

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.779
knowledge in every of them and the
moment that you kind of participate in

01:27:10.779 --> 01:27:10.789
moment that you kind of participate in
 

01:27:10.789 --> 01:27:13.479
moment that you kind of participate in
any of these is that you already have a

01:27:13.479 --> 01:27:13.489
any of these is that you already have a
 

01:27:13.489 --> 01:27:15.700
any of these is that you already have a
reservoir of knowledge that you can tap

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:15.710
reservoir of knowledge that you can tap
 

01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:17.770
reservoir of knowledge that you can tap
into and you're there to kind of extend

01:27:17.770 --> 01:27:17.780
into and you're there to kind of extend
 

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:21.009
into and you're there to kind of extend
it so as much as there's not much on the

01:27:21.009 --> 01:27:21.019
it so as much as there's not much on the
 

01:27:21.019 --> 01:27:24.189
it so as much as there's not much on the
table for the cloud lab it is already

01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199
table for the cloud lab it is already
 

01:27:24.199 --> 01:27:26.759
table for the cloud lab it is already
open to that kind of context because

01:27:26.759 --> 01:27:26.769
open to that kind of context because
 

01:27:26.769 --> 01:27:29.680
open to that kind of context because
whoever is directing the lab I think for

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:29.690
whoever is directing the lab I think for
 

01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:32.379
whoever is directing the lab I think for
futures I think directors start changing

01:27:32.379 --> 01:27:32.389
futures I think directors start changing
 

01:27:32.389 --> 01:27:35.129
futures I think directors start changing
too and there is this kind of consistent

01:27:35.129 --> 01:27:35.139
too and there is this kind of consistent
 

01:27:35.139 --> 01:27:37.569
too and there is this kind of consistent
agency of the laboratory but not the

01:27:37.569 --> 01:27:37.579
agency of the laboratory but not the
 

01:27:37.579 --> 01:27:39.370
agency of the laboratory but not the
director so the directors could change

01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:39.380
director so the directors could change
 

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:53.700
director so the directors could change
or perhaps shouldn't change the point

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:53.710
or perhaps shouldn't change the point
 

01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:57.520
or perhaps shouldn't change the point
the kind of platform is not so much

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:57.530
the kind of platform is not so much
 

01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:59.439
the kind of platform is not so much
there's this kind of director meeting

01:27:59.439 --> 01:27:59.449
there's this kind of director meeting
 

01:27:59.449 --> 01:28:02.350
there's this kind of director meeting
something but it is a kind of big kind

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360
something but it is a kind of big kind
 

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.089
something but it is a kind of big kind
of platform for things to develop

01:28:04.089 --> 01:28:04.099
of platform for things to develop
 

01:28:04.099 --> 01:28:06.520
of platform for things to develop
further so there's a knowledge that's

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:06.530
further so there's a knowledge that's
 

01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:10.149
further so there's a knowledge that's
kept in the lab the laboratory that Kent

01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159
kept in the lab the laboratory that Kent
 

01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:12.669
kept in the lab the laboratory that Kent
gets extended by more students and the

01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679
gets extended by more students and the
 

01:28:12.679 --> 01:28:15.550
gets extended by more students and the
participation length can vary

01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560
participation length can vary
 

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.180
participation length can vary
could be a whole year I think that scale

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:19.190
could be a whole year I think that scale
 

01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:21.730
could be a whole year I think that scale
is kind of dependent on the kind of

01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:21.740
is kind of dependent on the kind of
 

01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:30.370
is kind of dependent on the kind of
project just to kind of answer my own

01:28:30.370 --> 01:28:30.380
project just to kind of answer my own
 

01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:35.680
project just to kind of answer my own
question at least my own though I think

01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:35.690
question at least my own though I think
 

01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:41.650
question at least my own though I think
there's being three types of work three

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:41.660
there's being three types of work three
 

01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:42.970
there's being three types of work three
different ways that students have got

01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:42.980
different ways that students have got
 

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.030
different ways that students have got
involved in the work so there's been the

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040
involved in the work so there's been the
 

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:49.990
involved in the work so there's been the
lab initiated project we've conceived of

01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000
lab initiated project we've conceived of
 

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.170
lab initiated project we've conceived of
one and then people into the involved

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:53.180
one and then people into the involved
 

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.470
one and then people into the involved
there's the other kind which is that

01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480
there's the other kind which is that
 

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.990
there's the other kind which is that
it's externally asked of us

01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000
it's externally asked of us
 

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.480
it's externally asked of us
so like the cities' of preferences and

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:01.490
so like the cities' of preferences and
 

01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:04.540
so like the cities' of preferences and
then there's the there's another example

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:04.550
then there's the there's another example
 

01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:06.640
then there's the there's another example
of a project which I didn't show today

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:06.650
of a project which I didn't show today
 

01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:09.160
of a project which I didn't show today
but a student Cheryl Wong who I've

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:09.170
but a student Cheryl Wong who I've
 

01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:10.960
but a student Cheryl Wong who I've
taught in the past approached me

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:10.970
taught in the past approached me
 

01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:12.460
taught in the past approached me
afterwards and said I'd like to do an

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:12.470
afterwards and said I'd like to do an
 

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:15.460
afterwards and said I'd like to do an
independent study you know can this come

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:15.470
independent study you know can this come
 

01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:18.070
independent study you know can this come
through and and we've worked on it and

01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080
through and and we've worked on it and
 

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.260
through and and we've worked on it and
it's something that the independent

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:20.270
it's something that the independent
 

01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:22.000
it's something that the independent
study has officially finished in for

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:22.010
study has officially finished in for
 

01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:23.710
study has officially finished in for
academic purposes but we're still

01:29:23.710 --> 01:29:23.720
academic purposes but we're still
 

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.910
academic purposes but we're still
working on the film it's ongoing and for

01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920
working on the film it's ongoing and for
 

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.290
working on the film it's ongoing and for
her it's just a way being out of

01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:29.300
her it's just a way being out of
 

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.330
her it's just a way being out of
authored work that couldn't really

01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:31.340
authored work that couldn't really
 

01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:35.980
authored work that couldn't really
happen anywhere else and looking at the

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:35.990
happen anywhere else and looking at the
 

01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:38.260
happen anywhere else and looking at the
work in all three ways they have very

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:38.270
work in all three ways they have very
 

01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:40.210
work in all three ways they have very
different values in terms of the people

01:29:40.210 --> 01:29:40.220
different values in terms of the people
 

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:43.570
different values in terms of the people
that they're supposed to speak to and as

01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:43.580
that they're supposed to speak to and as
 

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:46.930
that they're supposed to speak to and as
Tora mentioned the kind of the agency of

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:46.940
Tora mentioned the kind of the agency of
 

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:49.870
Tora mentioned the kind of the agency of
them and that's I think a really

01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880
them and that's I think a really
 

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.370
them and that's I think a really
interesting point to actually talk about

01:29:51.370 --> 01:29:51.380
interesting point to actually talk about
 

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:54.010
interesting point to actually talk about
because I think in today's presentation

01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:54.020
because I think in today's presentation
 

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:56.770
because I think in today's presentation
what presentations what's come up is

01:29:56.770 --> 01:29:56.780
what presentations what's come up is
 

01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:02.740
what presentations what's come up is
that it's it's probably not it wasn't

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:02.750
that it's it's probably not it wasn't
 

01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:06.610
that it's it's probably not it wasn't
made so clear and deliberate but I think

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:06.620
made so clear and deliberate but I think
 

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.590
made so clear and deliberate but I think
it is an under the surface so I'd like

01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600
it is an under the surface so I'd like
 

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.130
it is an under the surface so I'd like
to ask everyone to kind of talk about it

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:12.140
to ask everyone to kind of talk about it
 

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.350
to ask everyone to kind of talk about it
but really for each of us to describe

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360
but really for each of us to describe
 

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.729
but really for each of us to describe
what the agency of our work is

01:30:18.729 --> 01:30:18.739
 
 

01:30:18.739 --> 01:30:21.670
 
- I mean I could sort of meet

01:30:21.670 --> 01:30:21.680
- I mean I could sort of meet
 

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.860
- I mean I could sort of meet

01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:23.870
presumptuous and say you know Sarah and
 

01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:25.870
presumptuous and say you know Sarah and
Kaitlyn Jeanette your work you know

01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880
Kaitlyn Jeanette your work you know
 

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.610
Kaitlyn Jeanette your work you know
you've already talked about the way that

01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:27.620
you've already talked about the way that
 

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:29.680
you've already talked about the way that
it started to influence policy for

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:34.940
example and has these sort of what you

example and has these sort of what you
know talks to these other communities

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:36.140
know talks to these other communities
 

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:39.880
know talks to these other communities
that we don't often engage directly and

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:39.890
that we don't often engage directly and
 

01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:40.959
that we don't often engage directly and

01:30:40.969 --> 01:30:44.890
Tauro
you know you I always thought that a lot

01:30:44.890 --> 01:30:44.900
you know you I always thought that a lot
 

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.360
you know you I always thought that a lot
of the work that you've done and having

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:46.370
of the work that you've done and having
 

01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:48.040
of the work that you've done and having
known you work over the years it's

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:48.050
known you work over the years it's
 

01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:51.550
known you work over the years it's
really so much about it's a bit hard to

01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560
really so much about it's a bit hard to
 

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:54.280
really so much about it's a bit hard to
say but it's more more about looking at

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:54.290
say but it's more more about looking at
 

01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:56.350
say but it's more more about looking at
different types of practices as well

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360
different types of practices as well
 

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360
different types of practices as well
amongst other things and charting out

01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:58.370
amongst other things and charting out
 

01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.820
amongst other things and charting out
new terrain of well if all this stuff is

01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:00.830
new terrain of well if all this stuff is
 

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.350
new terrain of well if all this stuff is
happening then surely there are these

01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360
happening then surely there are these
 

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.330
happening then surely there are these
spaces being created and opportunities

01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:04.340
spaces being created and opportunities
 

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.180
spaces being created and opportunities
for new types of studios and a way of

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:07.190
for new types of studios and a way of
 

01:31:07.190 --> 01:31:13.030
for new types of studios and a way of
practicing and I think for what fill lab

01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040
practicing and I think for what fill lab
 

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.160
practicing and I think for what fill lab
the Fab Lab and my lab would have in

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:15.170
the Fab Lab and my lab would have in
 

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:16.630
the Fab Lab and my lab would have in
common is that it's really learning

01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:16.640
common is that it's really learning
 

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.240
common is that it's really learning
through making so making films or making

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:19.250
through making so making films or making
 

01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:21.520
through making so making films or making
actual objects that that's where the

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:21.530
actual objects that that's where the
 

01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:24.400
actual objects that that's where the
learning and the research and discovery

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:24.410
learning and the research and discovery
 

01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:27.940
learning and the research and discovery
is actually made but again I don't want

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:27.950
is actually made but again I don't want
 

01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:29.440
is actually made but again I don't want
to be too presumptuous it's more just to

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:29.450
to be too presumptuous it's more just to
 

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.000
to be too presumptuous it's more just to
kind of get the ball rolling about if

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:31.010
kind of get the ball rolling about if
 

01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:32.650
kind of get the ball rolling about if
you could talk about where you've had

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:32.660
you could talk about where you've had
 

01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:39.479
you could talk about where you've had
the most influence where you believe the

01:31:39.479 --> 01:31:39.489
 
 

01:31:39.489 --> 01:31:45.540
 
kind of nature from mark and I that we

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:45.550
kind of nature from mark and I that we
 

01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:48.070
kind of nature from mark and I that we
already opens this kind of notion of

01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080
already opens this kind of notion of
 

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:50.950
already opens this kind of notion of
you're designing an application so

01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960
you're designing an application so
 

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.790
you're designing an application so
application somewhat focuses really

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800
application somewhat focuses really
 

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.800
application somewhat focuses really
clearly who your audience is and like

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:56.810
clearly who your audience is and like
 

01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:59.680
clearly who your audience is and like
what the kind of software should be

01:31:59.680 --> 01:31:59.690
what the kind of software should be
 

01:31:59.690 --> 01:32:02.229
what the kind of software should be
doing so some what the audience is

01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239
doing so some what the audience is
 

01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:05.680
doing so some what the audience is
somewhat clear and who the user is clear

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:05.690
somewhat clear and who the user is clear
 

01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:09.100
somewhat clear and who the user is clear
and I think that's

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:09.110
and I think that's
 

01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:10.510
and I think that's
just coming from this kind of background

01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520
just coming from this kind of background
 

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.350
just coming from this kind of background
of coding it implies that kind of nature

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:14.360
of coding it implies that kind of nature
 

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.070
of coding it implies that kind of nature
so and just to kind of answer that I

01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080
so and just to kind of answer that I
 

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:23.560
so and just to kind of answer that I
think more so for you know what what

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:23.570
think more so for you know what what
 

01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:26.050
think more so for you know what what
what is kind of opening up this is

01:32:26.050 --> 01:32:26.060
what is kind of opening up this is
 

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.680
what is kind of opening up this is
really just again I repeatedly say this

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:29.690
really just again I repeatedly say this
 

01:32:29.690 --> 01:32:31.840
really just again I repeatedly say this
kind of new form of practice is that

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:31.850
kind of new form of practice is that
 

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:34.629
kind of new form of practice is that
it's really ubiquitous like you can

01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639
it's really ubiquitous like you can
 

01:32:34.639 --> 01:32:39.700
it's really ubiquitous like you can
change one day of literally filming or

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:39.710
change one day of literally filming or
 

01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:43.540
change one day of literally filming or
algorithmically making a film all of a

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:43.550
algorithmically making a film all of a
 

01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:46.060
algorithmically making a film all of a
sudden that data can be transformed to a

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:46.070
sudden that data can be transformed to a
 

01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:48.280
sudden that data can be transformed to a
certain individual that communicates

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:48.290
certain individual that communicates
 

01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:51.520
certain individual that communicates
radically across many people at the same

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:51.530
radically across many people at the same
 

01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:56.229
radically across many people at the same
time so the agency is not so much about

01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239
time so the agency is not so much about
 

01:32:56.239 --> 01:33:00.040
time so the agency is not so much about
the kind of the kind of lab but it's the

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:00.050
the kind of the kind of lab but it's the
 

01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:03.459
the kind of the kind of lab but it's the
agency of that one person is so large

01:33:03.459 --> 01:33:03.469
agency of that one person is so large
 

01:33:03.469 --> 01:33:06.820
agency of that one person is so large
now that can reach so diversity to so

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:06.830
now that can reach so diversity to so
 

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:09.760
now that can reach so diversity to so
many people I think that's that still

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:09.770
many people I think that's that still
 

01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:14.560
many people I think that's that still
kind of remains many people right now I

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:14.570
kind of remains many people right now I
 

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:16.090
kind of remains many people right now I
think especially for like an

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:16.100
think especially for like an
 

01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.209
think especially for like an
architectural practice since some what's

01:33:19.209 --> 01:33:19.219
architectural practice since some what's
 

01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:21.879
architectural practice since some what's
considered the kind of global brain

01:33:21.879 --> 01:33:21.889
considered the kind of global brain
 

01:33:21.889 --> 01:33:25.200
considered the kind of global brain
right that we know so many things that

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:25.210
right that we know so many things that
 

01:33:25.210 --> 01:33:28.300
right that we know so many things that
once that that kind of ties to this kind

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:28.310
once that that kind of ties to this kind
 

01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:37.170
once that that kind of ties to this kind
of agency I think we have the most

01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:37.180
 
 

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:39.240
 
I would just say one of the things that

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:39.250
I would just say one of the things that
 

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:42.840
I would just say one of the things that
is exciting for me about the lab concept

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:42.850
is exciting for me about the lab concept
 

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.400
is exciting for me about the lab concept
too is that you're not necessarily

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:44.410
too is that you're not necessarily
 

01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:46.650
too is that you're not necessarily
thinking about the receivers of the

01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:46.660
thinking about the receivers of the
 

01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:49.230
thinking about the receivers of the
information as you are conceptualizing

01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:49.240
information as you are conceptualizing
 

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.900
information as you are conceptualizing
it and when Janette and Glenn tonight

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:51.910
it and when Janette and Glenn tonight
 

01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:55.170
it and when Janette and Glenn tonight
sat down and we were brainstorming about

01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:55.180
sat down and we were brainstorming about
 

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:57.060
sat down and we were brainstorming about
what eventually became safari 7 it

01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:57.070
what eventually became safari 7 it
 

01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:59.820
what eventually became safari 7 it
wasn't it had so much you know now that

01:33:59.820 --> 01:33:59.830
wasn't it had so much you know now that
 

01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:03.240
wasn't it had so much you know now that
we have made it has so many aspects or

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:03.250
we have made it has so many aspects or
 

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:04.230
we have made it has so many aspects or
different audiences that have

01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:04.240
different audiences that have
 

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.480
different audiences that have
essentially discovered it but I think

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:06.490
essentially discovered it but I think
 

01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:09.120
essentially discovered it but I think
that's one of the great things about the

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:09.130
that's one of the great things about the
 

01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:11.340
that's one of the great things about the
lab format is that it's basically to

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:11.350
lab format is that it's basically to
 

01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:13.440
lab format is that it's basically to
some degree an experimentation based on

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:13.450
some degree an experimentation based on
 

01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:16.140
some degree an experimentation based on
a set of concepts or shared ideas and

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:16.150
a set of concepts or shared ideas and
 

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:19.860
a set of concepts or shared ideas and
and that somehow that that finds its own

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:19.870
and that somehow that that finds its own
 

01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:22.080
and that somehow that that finds its own
voice or it finds its own audience and

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:22.090
voice or it finds its own audience and
 

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:24.660
voice or it finds its own audience and
the same thing with the bird the bird

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:24.670
the same thing with the bird the bird
 

01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:26.940
the same thing with the bird the bird
guidelines came out of basically like

01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:26.950
guidelines came out of basically like
 

01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:29.040
guidelines came out of basically like
volunteering with the Audubon Society

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:29.050
volunteering with the Audubon Society
 

01:34:29.050 --> 01:34:30.900
volunteering with the Audubon Society
and then kind of finding something that

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:30.910
and then kind of finding something that
 

01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:33.090
and then kind of finding something that
was there and that could be expressed

01:34:33.090 --> 01:34:33.100
was there and that could be expressed
 

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.310
was there and that could be expressed
and then that and it turned from its own

01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320
and then that and it turned from its own
 

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.710
and then that and it turned from its own
audience in a sort of likeliness of the

01:34:37.710 --> 01:34:37.720
audience in a sort of likeliness of the
 

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.350
audience in a sort of likeliness of the
kind of green building industry but it

01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360
kind of green building industry but it
 

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.420
kind of green building industry but it
seems like that that's something that is

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:42.430
seems like that that's something that is
 

01:34:42.430 --> 01:35:07.040
seems like that that's something that is
particularly exciting to me

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:07.050
 
 

01:35:07.050 --> 01:35:09.210
 
basically becomes a way for us to

01:35:09.210 --> 01:35:09.220
basically becomes a way for us to
 

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.740
basically becomes a way for us to
establish the projects that we want to

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:10.750
establish the projects that we want to
 

01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:15.740
establish the projects that we want to
start doing and kind of be advocates for

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:15.750
start doing and kind of be advocates for
 

01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:26.629
start doing and kind of be advocates for
what it is that designers do best

01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639
 
 

01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:27.900
 
it's

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:27.910
it's
 

01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:29.940
it's
it's a similar way we're in the

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:29.950
it's a similar way we're in the
 

01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:32.730
it's a similar way we're in the
fabrication that because typically when

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:32.740
fabrication that because typically when
 

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:33.930
fabrication that because typically when
you're constructing something you do

01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:33.940
you're constructing something you do
 

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.630
you're constructing something you do
have a client right and you have

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:36.640
have a client right and you have
 

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.310
have a client right and you have
somebody to answer to for certain things

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320
somebody to answer to for certain things
 

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:47.020
somebody to answer to for certain things
this allows us

01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:47.030
 
 

01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:58.320
 
it's chilled but it's also usually

01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:58.330
 
 

01:35:58.330 --> 01:36:00.460
 
research that comes you know from

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:00.470
research that comes you know from
 

01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:22.750
research that comes you know from
another person it's one of the things

01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.760
another person it's one of the things
 

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.780
another person it's one of the things
that we're trying to do is effect change

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:25.790
that we're trying to do is effect change
 

01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:31.030
that we're trying to do is effect change
I think highlight underlying cards in

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040
I think highlight underlying cards in
 

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:47.170
I think highlight underlying cards in
the community that might help but I

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:47.180
the community that might help but I
 

01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:49.470
the community that might help but I
think on the other side we have a

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480
think on the other side we have a
 

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.979
think on the other side we have a
research community that's interested

01:36:53.979 --> 01:36:53.989
 
 

01:36:53.989 --> 01:36:59.319
 
new forms of data and there's growing

01:36:59.319 --> 01:36:59.329
new forms of data and there's growing
 

01:36:59.329 --> 01:37:01.700
new forms of data and there's growing
community that's thinking about how can

01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:01.710
community that's thinking about how can
 

01:37:01.710 --> 01:37:03.979
community that's thinking about how can
we use crowd-sourced data or how can we

01:37:03.979 --> 01:37:03.989
we use crowd-sourced data or how can we
 

01:37:03.989 --> 01:37:08.180
we use crowd-sourced data or how can we
use data that's collected on the web and

01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:08.190
use data that's collected on the web and
 

01:37:08.190 --> 01:37:10.069
use data that's collected on the web and
what are we different what can we say

01:37:10.069 --> 01:37:10.079
what are we different what can we say
 

01:37:10.079 --> 01:37:13.490
what are we different what can we say
about it scientifically and I think so I

01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:13.500
about it scientifically and I think so I
 

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.160
about it scientifically and I think so I
think our projects also have that as an

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:16.170
think our projects also have that as an
 

01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:18.950
think our projects also have that as an
agent so we're writing in developing

01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960
agent so we're writing in developing
 

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:21.919
agent so we're writing in developing
papers for those journals well at the

01:37:21.919 --> 01:37:21.929
papers for those journals well at the
 

01:37:21.929 --> 01:37:25.399
papers for those journals well at the
same time as thinking about how we can

01:37:25.399 --> 01:37:25.409
same time as thinking about how we can
 

01:37:25.409 --> 01:37:27.259
same time as thinking about how we can
use our visualizations to tell us the

01:37:27.259 --> 01:37:27.269
use our visualizations to tell us the
 

01:37:27.269 --> 01:37:33.020
use our visualizations to tell us the
story about place yeah but I'm not sure

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:33.030
story about place yeah but I'm not sure
 

01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:34.609
story about place yeah but I'm not sure
how many people actually know how the

01:37:34.609 --> 01:37:34.619
how many people actually know how the
 

01:37:34.619 --> 01:37:43.370
how many people actually know how the
labs started and drives them but it

01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380
labs started and drives them but it
 

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.160
labs started and drives them but it
really was because there were a large

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:46.170
really was because there were a large
 

01:37:46.170 --> 01:37:48.709
really was because there were a large
number of teaching faculty adjuncts that

01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719
number of teaching faculty adjuncts that
 

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:50.149
number of teaching faculty adjuncts that
we're doing really interesting things

01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159
we're doing really interesting things
 

01:37:50.159 --> 01:37:51.919
we're doing really interesting things
but they were only teaching a couple of

01:37:51.919 --> 01:37:51.929
but they were only teaching a couple of
 

01:37:51.929 --> 01:37:53.629
but they were only teaching a couple of
courses here and so they had a very

01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639
courses here and so they had a very
 

01:37:53.639 --> 01:37:56.930
courses here and so they had a very
limited capacity in which in how they

01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940
limited capacity in which in how they
 

01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:59.029
limited capacity in which in how they
could engage with the school and so the

01:37:59.029 --> 01:37:59.039
could engage with the school and so the
 

01:37:59.039 --> 01:38:00.709
could engage with the school and so the
labs were set up as this kind of middle

01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719
labs were set up as this kind of middle
 

01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:11.170
labs were set up as this kind of middle
ground between practice

01:38:11.170 --> 01:38:11.180
 
 

01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:13.570
 
as well and being able to do things that

01:38:13.570 --> 01:38:13.580
as well and being able to do things that
 

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:18.760
as well and being able to do things that
didn't fit in the curriculum and so if

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:18.770
didn't fit in the curriculum and so if
 

01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:21.400
didn't fit in the curriculum and so if
you look at it the labs have a very

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:21.410
you look at it the labs have a very
 

01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:24.880
you look at it the labs have a very
interesting place because at the school

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:24.890
interesting place because at the school
 

01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:31.300
interesting place because at the school
here we have coursework masters and then

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:31.310
here we have coursework masters and then
 

01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:34.090
here we have coursework masters and then
we have a ph.d program which is largely

01:38:34.090 --> 01:38:34.100
we have a ph.d program which is largely
 

01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:37.390
we have a ph.d program which is largely
thesis or policy raised but there's

01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:37.400
thesis or policy raised but there's
 

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.730
thesis or policy raised but there's
nothing that's kind of project centered

01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:39.740
nothing that's kind of project centered
 

01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:43.270
nothing that's kind of project centered
and so a lot of that's great projects

01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280
and so a lot of that's great projects
 

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:46.450
and so a lot of that's great projects
and I think I can probably say this that

01:38:46.450 --> 01:38:46.460
and I think I can probably say this that
 

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.060
and I think I can probably say this that
for all of us it really begins with a

01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:49.070
for all of us it really begins with a
 

01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:57.479
for all of us it really begins with a
kind of an enthusiasm

01:38:57.479 --> 01:38:57.489
 
 

01:38:57.489 --> 01:39:00.959
 
and so you really do see how that stuff

01:39:00.959 --> 01:39:00.969
and so you really do see how that stuff
 

01:39:00.969 --> 01:39:41.990
and so you really do see how that stuff
enthusiasm can be sculpted

01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000
 
 

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.190
 
I mean there are groups there are

01:39:49.190 --> 01:39:49.200
I mean there are groups there are
 

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.230
I mean there are groups there are
quantitative methodologies that really

01:39:51.230 --> 01:39:51.240
quantitative methodologies that really
 

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.880
quantitative methodologies that really
require certain ways of working and

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:52.890
require certain ways of working and
 

01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:55.190
require certain ways of working and
adherence to certain models in which and

01:39:55.190 --> 01:39:55.200
adherence to certain models in which and
 

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.540
adherence to certain models in which and
they have specific names I mean you

01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:56.550
they have specific names I mean you
 

01:39:56.550 --> 01:40:00.050
they have specific names I mean you
describe very succinctly I am using this

01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060
describe very succinctly I am using this
 

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:03.110
describe very succinctly I am using this
particular method to basically work

01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:03.120
particular method to basically work
 

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.430
particular method to basically work
through that data and I don't think

01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440
through that data and I don't think
 

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.320
through that data and I don't think
anybody else really said you know

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:06.330
anybody else really said you know
 

01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:07.820
anybody else really said you know
there's this particular method and I was

01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:07.830
there's this particular method and I was
 

01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:10.280
there's this particular method and I was
curious given that architectural

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:10.290
curious given that architectural
 

01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:12.470
curious given that architectural
methodologies a far more elastic in

01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480
methodologies a far more elastic in
 

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.950
methodologies a far more elastic in
terms of how it works how you found

01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960
terms of how it works how you found
 

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.290
terms of how it works how you found
working with kind of these quantitative

01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300
working with kind of these quantitative
 

01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:21.500
working with kind of these quantitative
methods in relationship to other kinds

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:21.510
methods in relationship to other kinds
 

01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:24.200
methods in relationship to other kinds
of methods working because you said

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:24.210
of methods working because you said
 

01:40:24.210 --> 01:40:25.340
of methods working because you said
particularly like on the visualization

01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:25.350
particularly like on the visualization
 

01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:28.700
particularly like on the visualization
side you start to do with a whole other

01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:28.710
side you start to do with a whole other
 

01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:32.000
side you start to do with a whole other
kind of set of criteria right that

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:32.010
kind of set of criteria right that
 

01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:33.680
kind of set of criteria right that
affects the work and it seems like

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:33.690
affects the work and it seems like
 

01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:36.140
affects the work and it seems like
you're really negotiating I think that

01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:36.150
you're really negotiating I think that
 

01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:38.300
you're really negotiating I think that
and I think that's been really hard or

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:38.310
and I think that's been really hard or
 

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:40.160
and I think that's been really hard or
difficult given the kinds of education

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:40.170
difficult given the kinds of education
 

01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:41.630
difficult given the kinds of education
that we have for architecture that's

01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:41.640
that we have for architecture that's
 

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.980
that we have for architecture that's
what I think is very interesting and

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:42.990
what I think is very interesting and
 

01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:44.990
what I think is very interesting and
that's what I wanted to know given you

01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000
that's what I wanted to know given you
 

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.910
that's what I wanted to know given you
know the survey of the labs how is that

01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920
know the survey of the labs how is that
 

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.100
know the survey of the labs how is that
inflecting back on educational models

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:49.110
inflecting back on educational models
 

01:40:49.110 --> 01:40:50.600
inflecting back on educational models
because I think we're still trapped in a

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:50.610
because I think we're still trapped in a
 

01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:53.510
because I think we're still trapped in a
much older model of Education about how

01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520
much older model of Education about how
 

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.210
much older model of Education about how
practice works and then I think practice

01:40:56.210 --> 01:40:56.220
practice works and then I think practice
 

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:58.010
practice works and then I think practice
particularly through NAB is trying to

01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020
particularly through NAB is trying to
 

01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.230
particularly through NAB is trying to
clamp down on the deliverables of the

01:41:00.230 --> 01:41:00.240
clamp down on the deliverables of the
 

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.360
clamp down on the deliverables of the
degree but the reality of the field is

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:02.370
degree but the reality of the field is
 

01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:04.730
degree but the reality of the field is
that practices are in fact diversifying

01:41:04.730 --> 01:41:04.740
that practices are in fact diversifying
 

01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:06.890
that practices are in fact diversifying
how they work so that you have in firms

01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:06.900
how they work so that you have in firms
 

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:09.560
how they work so that you have in firms
research laboratories you know that are

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:09.570
research laboratories you know that are
 

01:41:09.570 --> 01:41:11.240
research laboratories you know that are
operating and so what I think is very

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:11.250
operating and so what I think is very
 

01:41:11.250 --> 01:41:12.680
operating and so what I think is very
interesting is that all of a sudden even

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:12.690
interesting is that all of a sudden even
 

01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:14.300
interesting is that all of a sudden even
in practice you're getting these other

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:14.310
in practice you're getting these other
 

01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:17.870
in practice you're getting these other
ways of working that are now there and

01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880
ways of working that are now there and
 

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.170
ways of working that are now there and
so how do we start to negotiate you know

01:41:20.170 --> 01:41:20.180
so how do we start to negotiate you know
 

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:23.510
so how do we start to negotiate you know
and I think you Suzy represented exactly

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520
and I think you Suzy represented exactly
 

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.310
and I think you Suzy represented exactly
kind of where that maybe future a

01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320
kind of where that maybe future a
 

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:31.699
kind of where that maybe future a
fracture actually is yeah I mean I think

01:41:31.699 --> 01:41:31.709
 
 

01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:35.479
 
for me I guess I was trained and both

01:41:35.479 --> 01:41:35.489
for me I guess I was trained and both
 

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:43.609
for me I guess I was trained and both
method so it's easy for me represents

01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619
method so it's easy for me represents
 

01:41:43.619 --> 01:41:47.359
method so it's easy for me represents
twice the amount of for almost two

01:41:47.359 --> 01:41:47.369
twice the amount of for almost two
 

01:41:47.369 --> 01:41:50.120
twice the amount of for almost two
projects right I mean I guess mic for it

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:50.130
projects right I mean I guess mic for it
 

01:41:50.130 --> 01:41:51.620
projects right I mean I guess mic for it
if you take the Getty project for

01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:51.630
if you take the Getty project for
 

01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:53.779
if you take the Getty project for
example the amount of work it takes to

01:41:53.779 --> 01:41:53.789
example the amount of work it takes to
 

01:41:53.789 --> 01:41:57.439
example the amount of work it takes to
run you know science statistics and what

01:41:57.439 --> 01:41:57.449
run you know science statistics and what
 

01:41:57.449 --> 01:42:00.020
run you know science statistics and what
you would typically see in a geographic

01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:00.030
you would typically see in a geographic
 

01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:02.569
you would typically see in a geographic
geography paper is just that final chart

01:42:02.569 --> 01:42:02.579
geography paper is just that final chart
 

01:42:02.579 --> 01:42:05.540
geography paper is just that final chart
of the Marines I which isn't that

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:05.550
of the Marines I which isn't that
 

01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:08.719
of the Marines I which isn't that
compelling and so I guess for me it's

01:42:08.719 --> 01:42:08.729
compelling and so I guess for me it's
 

01:42:08.729 --> 01:42:10.819
compelling and so I guess for me it's
really important to include the visuals

01:42:10.819 --> 01:42:10.829
really important to include the visuals
 

01:42:10.829 --> 01:42:13.009
really important to include the visuals
because I think it helps bring the

01:42:13.009 --> 01:42:13.019
because I think it helps bring the
 

01:42:13.019 --> 01:42:19.370
because I think it helps bring the
message to a larger so I think that's

01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:19.380
message to a larger so I think that's
 

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:22.029
message to a larger so I think that's
why taking the quantitative and then

01:42:22.029 --> 01:42:22.039
why taking the quantitative and then
 

01:42:22.039 --> 01:42:26.569
why taking the quantitative and then
applying the visualization for me

01:42:26.569 --> 01:42:26.579
applying the visualization for me
 

01:42:26.579 --> 01:42:29.569
applying the visualization for me
because it brings the idea to more

01:42:29.569 --> 01:42:29.579
because it brings the idea to more
 

01:42:29.579 --> 01:42:33.799
because it brings the idea to more
people than have otherwise but I also

01:42:33.799 --> 01:42:33.809
people than have otherwise but I also
 

01:42:33.809 --> 01:42:36.290
people than have otherwise but I also
think in my teaching I have always

01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300
think in my teaching I have always
 

01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:38.959
think in my teaching I have always
emphasized the need to think about the

01:42:38.959 --> 01:42:38.969
emphasized the need to think about the
 

01:42:38.969 --> 01:42:41.779
emphasized the need to think about the
quantitative and qualitative because if

01:42:41.779 --> 01:42:41.789
quantitative and qualitative because if
 

01:42:41.789 --> 01:42:44.179
quantitative and qualitative because if
you only approach a project in the

01:42:44.179 --> 01:42:44.189
you only approach a project in the
 

01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:49.100
you only approach a project in the
quantity this is my idea but I feel like

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:49.110
quantity this is my idea but I feel like
 

01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:50.209
quantity this is my idea but I feel like
if you only approach something

01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219
if you only approach something
 

01:42:50.219 --> 01:42:56.330
if you only approach something
quantitatively you're going to miss so I

01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340
quantitatively you're going to miss so I
 

01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:59.089
quantitatively you're going to miss so I
think that GIS or different kinds of

01:42:59.089 --> 01:42:59.099
think that GIS or different kinds of
 

01:42:59.099 --> 01:43:01.040
think that GIS or different kinds of
spatial statistics programs help

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:01.050
spatial statistics programs help
 

01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:02.959
spatial statistics programs help
highlight areas

01:43:02.959 --> 01:43:02.969
highlight areas
 

01:43:02.969 --> 01:43:07.479
highlight areas
concern or areas interest but it's the

01:43:07.479 --> 01:43:07.489
concern or areas interest but it's the
 

01:43:07.489 --> 01:43:09.589
concern or areas interest but it's the
qualitative information that really

01:43:09.589 --> 01:43:09.599
qualitative information that really
 

01:43:09.599 --> 01:43:14.779
qualitative information that really
layers that place and can tell us more

01:43:14.779 --> 01:43:14.789
layers that place and can tell us more
 

01:43:14.789 --> 01:43:30.529
layers that place and can tell us more
about one one question that kind of

01:43:30.529 --> 01:43:30.539
about one one question that kind of
 

01:43:30.539 --> 01:43:33.350
about one one question that kind of
probably is useful is you know the

01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360
probably is useful is you know the
 

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.219
probably is useful is you know the
measurement in in kind of recognizing

01:43:37.219 --> 01:43:37.229
measurement in in kind of recognizing
 

01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:40.120
measurement in in kind of recognizing
the kind of degree of innovation so

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:40.130
the kind of degree of innovation so
 

01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:43.100
the kind of degree of innovation so
because all project is in some way or

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:43.110
because all project is in some way or
 

01:43:43.110 --> 01:43:45.049
because all project is in some way or
another innovation right i kind of

01:43:45.049 --> 01:43:45.059
another innovation right i kind of
 

01:43:45.059 --> 01:43:47.049
another innovation right i kind of
iterated or evolved through a kind of

01:43:47.049 --> 01:43:47.059
iterated or evolved through a kind of
 

01:43:47.059 --> 01:43:50.600
iterated or evolved through a kind of
condition now the question is probably

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:50.610
condition now the question is probably
 

01:43:50.610 --> 01:43:54.259
condition now the question is probably
for me once that's kind of I mean I've

01:43:54.259 --> 01:43:54.269
for me once that's kind of I mean I've
 

01:43:54.269 --> 01:43:56.299
for me once that's kind of I mean I've
heard to a certain degree architectural

01:43:56.299 --> 01:43:56.309
heard to a certain degree architectural

education trains everyone to become kind

01:43:59.779 --> 01:43:59.789
education trains everyone to become kind
 

01:43:59.789 --> 01:44:02.239
education trains everyone to become kind
of entrepreneur innovator or I mean a

01:44:02.239 --> 01:44:02.249

finger right finger constantly thinks of

01:44:05.569 --> 01:44:05.579
finger right finger constantly thinks of
 

01:44:05.579 --> 01:44:08.930
finger right finger constantly thinks of
the next situation now I think even

01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940
the next situation now I think even
 

01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.219
the next situation now I think even
though that said the creations have a

01:44:13.219 --> 01:44:13.229
though that said the creations have a
 

01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:15.979
though that said the creations have a
fitness right somewhat is put into the

01:44:15.979 --> 01:44:15.989
fitness right somewhat is put into the
 

01:44:15.989 --> 01:44:19.100
fitness right somewhat is put into the
world and see what laughter what's more

01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:19.110
world and see what laughter what's more
 

01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:20.930
world and see what laughter what's more
recognized or there's a kind of degree

01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:20.940
recognized or there's a kind of degree
 

01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:23.899
recognized or there's a kind of degree
of evaluation now I think that process

01:44:23.899 --> 01:44:23.909
of evaluation now I think that process
 

01:44:23.909 --> 01:44:28.219
of evaluation now I think that process
is rarely discussed like we let the

01:44:28.219 --> 01:44:28.229
is rarely discussed like we let the
 

01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:31.399
is rarely discussed like we let the
fitness of the world kind of let our

01:44:31.399 --> 01:44:31.409
fitness of the world kind of let our
 

01:44:31.409 --> 01:44:33.169
fitness of the world kind of let our
things go right so we put it out there

01:44:33.169 --> 01:44:33.179
things go right so we put it out there
 

01:44:33.179 --> 01:44:36.469
things go right so we put it out there
and see we can mark it etc but to a

01:44:36.469 --> 01:44:36.479
and see we can mark it etc but to a
 

01:44:36.479 --> 01:44:39.919
and see we can mark it etc but to a
certain degree couldn't we even then I

01:44:39.919 --> 01:44:39.929
certain degree couldn't we even then I
 

01:44:39.929 --> 01:44:44.359
certain degree couldn't we even then I
mean doesn't that turn back and kind of

01:44:44.359 --> 01:44:44.369
mean doesn't that turn back and kind of
 

01:44:44.369 --> 01:44:47.689
mean doesn't that turn back and kind of
evaluate the projects in a sense so this

01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:47.699
evaluate the projects in a sense so this
 

01:44:47.699 --> 01:44:50.089
evaluate the projects in a sense so this
is the feedback part of like putting a

01:44:50.089 --> 01:44:50.099
is the feedback part of like putting a
 

01:44:50.099 --> 01:44:51.950
is the feedback part of like putting a
project up there and then you have a

01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960
project up there and then you have a
 

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.020
project up there and then you have a
version to version 3 someone like

01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:54.030
version to version 3 someone like
 

01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:55.729
version to version 3 someone like
software where there's always another

01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739
software where there's always another
 

01:44:55.739 --> 01:44:58.129
software where there's always another
version sometimes like Autodesk it

01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139
version sometimes like Autodesk it
 

01:44:58.139 --> 01:45:00.589
version sometimes like Autodesk it
becomes worse right but at least there's

01:45:00.589 --> 01:45:00.599
becomes worse right but at least there's
 

01:45:00.599 --> 01:45:03.469
becomes worse right but at least there's
a kind of iterative idea of like going

01:45:03.469 --> 01:45:03.479
a kind of iterative idea of like going
 

01:45:03.479 --> 01:45:05.359
a kind of iterative idea of like going
back to that project and what would be

01:45:05.359 --> 01:45:05.369
back to that project and what would be
 

01:45:05.369 --> 01:45:08.180
back to that project and what would be
different I think many cases of I guess

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:08.190
different I think many cases of I guess
 

01:45:08.190 --> 01:45:08.989
different I think many cases of I guess
architecture

01:45:08.989 --> 01:45:08.999
architecture
 

01:45:08.999 --> 01:45:12.020
architecture
it's a one-off there's not a moment to

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:12.030
it's a one-off there's not a moment to
 

01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:13.939
it's a one-off there's not a moment to
iterate but I think with researchers

01:45:13.939 --> 01:45:13.949
iterate but I think with researchers
 

01:45:13.949 --> 01:45:15.859
iterate but I think with researchers
there's the moment to iterate because

01:45:15.859 --> 01:45:15.869
there's the moment to iterate because
 

01:45:15.869 --> 01:45:18.500
there's the moment to iterate because
there is a kind of case of a topic I

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:18.510
there is a kind of case of a topic I
 

01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:27.140
there is a kind of case of a topic I
think that's why because there's a

01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:27.150
think that's why because there's a
 

01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:30.319
think that's why because there's a
platform to identify something now the

01:45:30.319 --> 01:45:30.329
platform to identify something now the
 

01:45:30.329 --> 01:45:33.589
platform to identify something now the
success again I think that you'll have a

01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:33.599
success again I think that you'll have a
 

01:45:33.599 --> 01:45:39.529
success again I think that you'll have a
different iteration first so I think

01:45:39.529 --> 01:45:39.539
different iteration first so I think
 

01:45:39.539 --> 01:45:42.890
different iteration first so I think
that's kind of potentially what I see in

01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900
that's kind of potentially what I see in
 

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:45.140
that's kind of potentially what I see in
the lab is that there's an opportunity

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:45.150
the lab is that there's an opportunity
 

01:45:45.150 --> 01:45:48.589
the lab is that there's an opportunity
to iterative project rather than not

01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599
to iterative project rather than not
 

01:45:48.599 --> 01:45:50.989
to iterative project rather than not
being a one-off project that's the usual

01:45:50.989 --> 01:45:50.999
being a one-off project that's the usual
 

01:45:50.999 --> 01:45:53.689
being a one-off project that's the usual
architecture project become and again I

01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:53.699
architecture project become and again I
 

01:45:53.699 --> 01:45:55.430
architecture project become and again I
repeat that kind of notion of studio

01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440
repeat that kind of notion of studio
 

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.680
repeat that kind of notion of studio
projects also becoming a one-off the

01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:57.690
projects also becoming a one-off the
 

01:45:57.690 --> 01:46:00.770
projects also becoming a one-off the
other one case studio not having the

01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780
other one case studio not having the
 

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:03.739
other one case studio not having the
potential to iterate again so in this

01:46:03.739 --> 01:46:03.749
potential to iterate again so in this
 

01:46:03.749 --> 01:46:05.719
potential to iterate again so in this
laboratory I think it is an opportunity

01:46:05.719 --> 01:46:05.729
laboratory I think it is an opportunity
 

01:46:05.729 --> 01:46:08.239
laboratory I think it is an opportunity
when I say you extend the previous

01:46:08.239 --> 01:46:08.249
when I say you extend the previous
 

01:46:08.249 --> 01:46:10.549
when I say you extend the previous
knowledge is that you're kind of

01:46:10.549 --> 01:46:10.559
knowledge is that you're kind of
 

01:46:10.559 --> 01:46:35.710
knowledge is that you're kind of
refining it or iterating through

01:46:35.710 --> 01:46:35.720
 
 

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.760
 
so I guess my question is I'm not sure

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:40.770
so I guess my question is I'm not sure
 

01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:44.440
so I guess my question is I'm not sure
how many and I don't have a background

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:44.450
how many and I don't have a background
 

01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:48.170
how many and I don't have a background
before architecture or I mean I know the

01:46:48.170 --> 01:46:48.180
before architecture or I mean I know the
 

01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:51.160
before architecture or I mean I know the
kid or you did landscape right

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:51.170
kid or you did landscape right
 

01:46:51.170 --> 01:46:54.310
kid or you did landscape right
architecture and Sara you had one in

01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320
architecture and Sara you had one in
 

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.850
architecture and Sara you had one in
geography so I wonder how the kind of

01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860
geography so I wonder how the kind of
 

01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:03.220
geography so I wonder how the kind of
research that you're doing now whether

01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:03.230
research that you're doing now whether
 

01:47:03.230 --> 01:47:06.350
research that you're doing now whether
weather is an X is it an extent

01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360
weather is an X is it an extent
 

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.930
weather is an X is it an extent
extension of something you that you had

01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:08.940
extension of something you that you had
 

01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:15.710
extension of something you that you had
prior like how do I say I know it's a

01:47:15.710 --> 01:47:15.720
prior like how do I say I know it's a
 

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.960
prior like how do I say I know it's a
very research oriented but is it like an

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:17.970
very research oriented but is it like an
 

01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:19.280
very research oriented but is it like an
extension of something you had prior

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:19.290
extension of something you had prior
 

01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:21.050
extension of something you had prior
like in the discipline of landscape

01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.060
like in the discipline of landscape
 

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.850
like in the discipline of landscape
architecture I did my undergrad in

01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860
architecture I did my undergrad in
 

01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:24.830
architecture I did my undergrad in
landscape architecture and there's not

01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840
landscape architecture and there's not
 

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.390
landscape architecture and there's not
many projects when you would say that

01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400
many projects when you would say that
 

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:30.050
many projects when you would say that
are very similar to 47 at least in terms

01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060
are very similar to 47 at least in terms
 

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:34.730
are very similar to 47 at least in terms
of discipline and in geography there is

01:47:34.730 --> 01:47:34.740
of discipline and in geography there is
 

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:38.090
of discipline and in geography there is
a history of I guess visualization but

01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.100
a history of I guess visualization but
 

01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:42.260
a history of I guess visualization but
now I'm not sure like how is it cutting

01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:42.270
now I'm not sure like how is it cutting
 

01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:45.260
now I'm not sure like how is it cutting
edge isms is it something different from

01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:45.270
edge isms is it something different from
 

01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:47.210
edge isms is it something different from
the discipline and is that influenced by

01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:47.220
the discipline and is that influenced by
 

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.870
the discipline and is that influenced by
the kind of like by the mingling with

01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880
the kind of like by the mingling with
 

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.640
the kind of like by the mingling with
architecture I guess by that

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:54.650
 
 

01:47:54.650 --> 01:47:57.170
 
I mean they're both that I mean the

01:47:57.170 --> 01:47:57.180
I mean they're both that I mean the
 

01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:00.590
I mean they're both that I mean the
design disciplines the same way but I'm

01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:00.600
design disciplines the same way but I'm
 

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.790
design disciplines the same way but I'm
not sure like do your friends back in

01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800
not sure like do your friends back in
 

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.920
not sure like do your friends back in
like your undergraduate friends are they

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:06.930
like your undergraduate friends are they
 

01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:08.759
like your undergraduate friends are they
doing the same thing

01:48:08.759 --> 01:48:08.769
doing the same thing
 

01:48:08.769 --> 01:48:15.029
doing the same thing
I think it raises a great question

01:48:15.029 --> 01:48:15.039
I think it raises a great question
 

01:48:15.039 --> 01:48:27.540
I think it raises a great question
question which is funky boundary that

01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:27.550
question which is funky boundary that
 

01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:30.270
question which is funky boundary that
exists you know that requires a

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280
exists you know that requires a
 

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.060
exists you know that requires a
discipline to be coherent and have

01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:33.070
discipline to be coherent and have
 

01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:34.669
discipline to be coherent and have
standards

01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679
standards
 

01:48:34.679 --> 01:48:36.989
standards
license and registration all the things

01:48:36.989 --> 01:48:36.999
license and registration all the things
 

01:48:36.999 --> 01:48:39.600
license and registration all the things
that are involved calling something a

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:39.610
that are involved calling something a
 

01:48:39.610 --> 01:48:41.700
that are involved calling something a
discipline and then I think there's

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:41.710
discipline and then I think there's
 

01:48:41.710 --> 01:48:43.770
discipline and then I think there's
what's so exciting about the lab is that

01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:43.780
what's so exciting about the lab is that
 

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:46.229
what's so exciting about the lab is that
you're kind of not approaching things

01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239
you're kind of not approaching things
 

01:48:46.239 --> 01:48:50.729
you're kind of not approaching things
through a disciplinary perspective of

01:48:50.729 --> 01:48:50.739
through a disciplinary perspective of
 

01:48:50.739 --> 01:48:59.759
through a disciplinary perspective of
course so I might look at something

01:48:59.759 --> 01:48:59.769
course so I might look at something
 

01:48:59.769 --> 01:49:02.489
course so I might look at something
differently but but I think that's what

01:49:02.489 --> 01:49:02.499
differently but but I think that's what
 

01:49:02.499 --> 01:49:04.410
differently but but I think that's what
is so exciting is that taking about the

01:49:04.410 --> 01:49:04.420
is so exciting is that taking about the
 

01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:06.450
is so exciting is that taking about the
lessons that you're coming at something

01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:06.460
lessons that you're coming at something
 

01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:21.209
lessons that you're coming at something
through the perspective organized where

01:49:21.209 --> 01:49:21.219
through the perspective organized where
 

01:49:21.219 --> 01:49:24.450
through the perspective organized where
I'm coming from in general so the lab is

01:49:24.450 --> 01:49:24.460
I'm coming from in general so the lab is
 

01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:30.560
I'm coming from in general so the lab is
a great forum I think it's particularly

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:30.570
a great forum I think it's particularly
 

01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:33.479
a great forum I think it's particularly
I think there's always an

01:49:33.479 --> 01:49:33.489
I think there's always an
 

01:49:33.489 --> 01:49:37.319
I think there's always an
autobiographical elements Lamson because

01:49:37.319 --> 01:49:37.329
autobiographical elements Lamson because
 

01:49:37.329 --> 01:49:40.109
autobiographical elements Lamson because
we initiate them ourselves so we kind of

01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119
we initiate them ourselves so we kind of
 

01:49:40.119 --> 01:49:43.919
we initiate them ourselves so we kind of
try to bring something unique that's

01:49:43.919 --> 01:49:43.929
try to bring something unique that's
 

01:49:43.929 --> 01:49:47.009
try to bring something unique that's
worth doing but the other thing is of

01:49:47.009 --> 01:49:47.019
worth doing but the other thing is of
 

01:49:47.019 --> 01:49:48.989
worth doing but the other thing is of
course you know I remember hearing a

01:49:48.989 --> 01:49:48.999
course you know I remember hearing a
 

01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:52.290
course you know I remember hearing a
statistic truth there is that for all

01:49:52.290 --> 01:49:52.300
statistic truth there is that for all
 

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:56.189
statistic truth there is that for all
the accreditation

program has to jump through the skull
 

01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:01.140
program has to jump through the skull
here is kind of interesting because at

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:01.150
here is kind of interesting because at
 

01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:03.270
here is kind of interesting because at
least in the aad program people coming

01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280
least in the aad program people coming
 

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.649
least in the aad program people coming
here to get a masters that they don't

here to get a masters that they don't
really need to in order to practice so

01:50:08.009 --> 01:50:08.019
really need to in order to practice so
 

01:50:08.019 --> 01:50:09.719
really need to in order to practice so
then it's all about saying well can we

01:50:09.719 --> 01:50:09.729
then it's all about saying well can we
 

01:50:09.729 --> 01:50:11.129
then it's all about saying well can we
explore all the things on the roof

01:50:11.129 --> 01:50:11.139
explore all the things on the roof
 

01:50:11.139 --> 01:50:12.689
explore all the things on the roof
because we know the things that

01:50:12.689 --> 01:50:12.699
because we know the things that
 

01:50:12.699 --> 01:50:14.000
because we know the things that
essential because we've already got

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:14.010
essential because we've already got
 

01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:20.219
essential because we've already got
accreditation but then whilst you can do

01:50:20.219 --> 01:50:20.229
accreditation but then whilst you can do
 

01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:25.229
accreditation but then whilst you can do
all these things for us you know so some

01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239
all these things for us you know so some
 

01:50:25.239 --> 01:50:26.939
all these things for us you know so some
people come here so that they're no

01:50:26.939 --> 01:50:26.949
people come here so that they're no
 

01:50:26.949 --> 01:50:29.729
people come here so that they're no
longer having so they can do things they

01:50:29.729 --> 01:50:29.739
longer having so they can do things they
 

01:50:29.739 --> 01:50:32.219
longer having so they can do things they
can't do it practice and this is

01:50:32.219 --> 01:50:32.229
can't do it practice and this is
 

01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:35.549
can't do it practice and this is
students but then at the same time we

01:50:35.549 --> 01:50:35.559
students but then at the same time we
 

01:50:35.559 --> 01:50:48.419
students but then at the same time we
then go and set up labs so we try and

01:50:48.419 --> 01:50:48.429
then go and set up labs so we try and
 

01:50:48.429 --> 01:50:51.359
then go and set up labs so we try and
occupy this sort of space where we can

01:50:51.359 --> 01:50:51.369
occupy this sort of space where we can
 

01:50:51.369 --> 01:51:06.069
occupy this sort of space where we can
try

01:51:06.069 --> 01:51:06.079
 
 

01:51:06.079 --> 01:51:17.169
 
I think that's you know so at the same

01:51:17.169 --> 01:51:17.179
I think that's you know so at the same
 

01:51:17.179 --> 01:52:10.890
I think that's you know so at the same
time you can go back and other times

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:10.900
 
 

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:13.030
 
it's a different type of way of looking

01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040
it's a different type of way of looking
 

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:26.729
it's a different type of way of looking
at which which is good because

01:52:26.729 --> 01:52:26.739
 
 

01:52:26.739 --> 01:52:30.609
 
I'll kind of say this one question just

01:52:30.609 --> 01:52:30.619
I'll kind of say this one question just
 

01:52:30.619 --> 01:52:40.350
I'll kind of say this one question just
because there's so few people you know

01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360
because there's so few people you know
 

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.270
because there's so few people you know
this question of like cutting edge or

this question of like cutting edge or
 

01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:46.839
this question of like cutting edge or

question I'm questioning into myself
 

01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:52.570
question I'm questioning into myself
does innovation happen at this school

01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:52.580
does innovation happen at this school
 

01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.060
does innovation happen at this school
right is the school the real innovation

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:55.070
right is the school the real innovation
 

01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:58.149
right is the school the real innovation
cutting edge just a question I mean

01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159
cutting edge just a question I mean
 

01:52:58.159 --> 01:53:01.540
cutting edge just a question I mean
Columbia or institution in general right

Columbia or institution in general right
 

01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:04.419
Columbia or institution in general right
like just just developing apps you know

01:53:04.419 --> 01:53:04.429
like just just developing apps you know
 

01:53:04.429 --> 01:53:06.419
like just just developing apps you know
for us it's part of our kind of

experimental you know terrain I mean

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:09.710
experimental you know terrain I mean
 

01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:13.109
experimental you know terrain I mean
you'll have these crazy you know

twelve-year-old doing the YouTube

01:53:15.490 --> 01:53:15.500
twelve-year-old doing the YouTube
 

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.979
twelve-year-old doing the YouTube
tutorial on making an app not that the

01:53:17.979 --> 01:53:17.989
tutorial on making an app not that the
 

01:53:17.989 --> 01:53:19.689
tutorial on making an app not that the
kind of tutorial part it's an important

01:53:19.689 --> 01:53:19.699
kind of tutorial part it's an important
 

01:53:19.699 --> 01:53:23.109
kind of tutorial part it's an important
part but the kind of in innovation can

01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119
part but the kind of in innovation can
 

01:53:23.119 --> 01:53:26.979
part but the kind of in innovation can
happen so fast now in outside the school

01:53:26.979 --> 01:53:26.989
happen so fast now in outside the school
 

01:53:26.989 --> 01:53:30.010
happen so fast now in outside the school
that you know I think it's questioning

01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:30.020
that you know I think it's questioning
 

01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:33.669
that you know I think it's questioning
well how do we catch up or how do we

01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679
well how do we catch up or how do we
 

01:53:33.679 --> 01:53:38.520
well how do we catch up or how do we
rethink the kind of role of innovation

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:38.530
rethink the kind of role of innovation
 

01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:41.109
rethink the kind of role of innovation
so how does the school kind of think of

01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119
so how does the school kind of think of
 

01:53:41.119 --> 01:53:43.990
so how does the school kind of think of
institution and really kind of gauge

01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000
institution and really kind of gauge
 

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.220
institution and really kind of gauge
that because the reality is the the real

01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:48.230
that because the reality is the the real
 

01:53:48.230 --> 01:53:50.589
that because the reality is the the real
kind of fitness function is outside

01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599
kind of fitness function is outside
 

01:53:50.599 --> 01:53:53.470
kind of fitness function is outside
practice right I mean somehow there's

01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480
practice right I mean somehow there's
 

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:56.680
practice right I mean somehow there's
then the practice of you know PhDs in

01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:56.690
then the practice of you know PhDs in
 

01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:59.530
then the practice of you know PhDs in
like you know thesis statements with

01:53:59.530 --> 01:53:59.540
like you know thesis statements with
 

01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:02.020
like you know thesis statements with
kind of all this kind of other kind of

01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:02.030
kind of all this kind of other kind of
 

01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:05.370
kind of all this kind of other kind of
standards that things are evaluated now

01:54:05.370 --> 01:54:05.380
standards that things are evaluated now
 

01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:09.550
standards that things are evaluated now
that being separated I think can be

01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:09.560
that being separated I think can be
 

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:16.300
that being separated I think can be
spoken that school institution because

01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:16.310
spoken that school institution because
 

01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:17.800
spoken that school institution because
there's a standard of measurement right

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:17.810
there's a standard of measurement right
 

01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:21.220
there's a standard of measurement right
the right kind of did wrong or fee you

01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:21.230
the right kind of did wrong or fee you
 

01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:23.109
the right kind of did wrong or fee you
know facts they're aligned

01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119
know facts they're aligned
 

01:54:23.119 --> 01:54:27.879
know facts they're aligned
to define the kind of paper but when I'm

01:54:27.879 --> 01:54:27.889
to define the kind of paper but when I'm
 

01:54:27.889 --> 01:54:30.009
to define the kind of paper but when I'm
not so kind of make the economic

01:54:30.009 --> 01:54:30.019
not so kind of make the economic
 

01:54:30.019 --> 01:54:32.589
not so kind of make the economic
measurement of the project the kind of

01:54:32.589 --> 01:54:32.599
measurement of the project the kind of
 

01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:35.679
measurement of the project the kind of
bar but I think the question of that you

01:54:35.679 --> 01:54:35.689
bar but I think the question of that you
 

01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:36.969
bar but I think the question of that you
know the innovation happened at the

01:54:36.969 --> 01:54:36.979
know the innovation happened at the
 

01:54:36.979 --> 01:54:40.000
know the innovation happened at the
school can you kind of mutate into what

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:40.010
school can you kind of mutate into what
 

01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:41.649
school can you kind of mutate into what
are what are the standards are we

01:54:41.649 --> 01:54:41.659
are what are the standards are we
 

01:54:41.659 --> 01:54:44.319
are what are the standards are we
measuring all these projects by that's

01:54:44.319 --> 01:54:44.329
measuring all these projects by that's
 

01:54:44.329 --> 01:54:47.709
measuring all these projects by that's
kind of like if we take the academic

01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:47.719
kind of like if we take the academic
 

01:54:47.719 --> 01:54:49.659
kind of like if we take the academic
standards and we value I mean all

01:54:49.659 --> 01:54:49.669
standards and we value I mean all
 

01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:51.790
standards and we value I mean all
projects are so innovative but then we

01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800
projects are so innovative but then we
 

01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.069
projects are so innovative but then we
go outside then have a different

01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079
go outside then have a different
 

01:54:54.079 --> 01:54:55.989
go outside then have a different
standard broaden in measured it'll be a

01:54:55.989 --> 01:54:55.999
standard broaden in measured it'll be a
 

01:54:55.999 --> 01:54:58.540
standard broaden in measured it'll be a
different kind of evaluation so I think

01:54:58.540 --> 01:54:58.550
different kind of evaluation so I think
 

01:54:58.550 --> 01:55:02.649
different kind of evaluation so I think
that has to somewhat be clear somewhat I

01:55:02.649 --> 01:55:02.659
that has to somewhat be clear somewhat I
 

01:55:02.659 --> 01:55:04.750
that has to somewhat be clear somewhat I
mean maybe it's just a self kind of

01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:04.760
mean maybe it's just a self kind of
 

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.939
mean maybe it's just a self kind of
clarification but at least that's an

01:55:06.939 --> 01:55:06.949
clarification but at least that's an
 

01:55:06.949 --> 01:55:11.500
clarification but at least that's an
issue that has to be discussed more as a

01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:11.510
issue that has to be discussed more as a
 

01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:14.259
issue that has to be discussed more as a
kind of institution because everything

01:55:14.259 --> 01:55:14.269
kind of institution because everything
 

01:55:14.269 --> 01:55:18.239
kind of institution because everything
is becoming more faster more you know

01:55:18.239 --> 01:55:18.249
is becoming more faster more you know
 

01:55:18.249 --> 01:55:22.389
is becoming more faster more you know
instantaneous we don't have time to wait

01:55:22.389 --> 01:55:22.399
instantaneous we don't have time to wait
 

01:55:22.399 --> 01:55:25.689
instantaneous we don't have time to wait
you know so seem to be kind of two parts

01:55:25.689 --> 01:55:25.699
you know so seem to be kind of two parts
 

01:55:25.699 --> 01:55:27.939
you know so seem to be kind of two parts
of that too because one is like what is

01:55:27.939 --> 01:55:27.949
of that too because one is like what is
 

01:55:27.949 --> 01:55:32.709
of that too because one is like what is
the role of institution to not just be

01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719
the role of institution to not just be
 

01:55:32.719 --> 01:55:41.109
the role of institution to not just be
an institution

01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119
 
 

01:55:41.119 --> 01:55:44.479
 
and then on the other hand you know how

01:55:44.479 --> 01:55:44.489
and then on the other hand you know how
 

01:55:44.489 --> 01:55:47.389
and then on the other hand you know how
I would say you know you had all these

01:55:47.389 --> 01:55:47.399
I would say you know you had all these
 

01:55:47.399 --> 01:55:50.020
I would say you know you had all these
charts I was impressed by your charts

01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:50.030
charts I was impressed by your charts
 

01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:52.909
charts I was impressed by your charts
you know like how does innovation happen

01:55:52.909 --> 01:55:52.919
you know like how does innovation happen
 

01:55:52.919 --> 01:56:07.159
you know like how does innovation happen
I'm sure there's like the particle

01:56:07.159 --> 01:56:07.169
I'm sure there's like the particle
 

01:56:07.169 --> 01:56:10.129
I'm sure there's like the particle
accelerator 50 years underground that

01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:10.139
accelerator 50 years underground that
 

01:56:10.139 --> 01:56:14.109
accelerator 50 years underground that
slack there's certainly another

01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119
slack there's certainly another
 

01:56:14.119 --> 01:56:17.449
slack there's certainly another
methodology which is innovation happens

01:56:17.449 --> 01:56:17.459
methodology which is innovation happens
 

01:56:17.459 --> 01:56:26.299
methodology which is innovation happens
when people talk to each other

01:56:26.299 --> 01:56:26.309
 
 

01:56:26.309 --> 01:56:29.299
 
the economists and so you know I think

01:56:29.299 --> 01:56:29.309
the economists and so you know I think
 

01:56:29.309 --> 01:56:31.279
the economists and so you know I think
it's interesting to think how Columbia

01:56:31.279 --> 01:56:31.289
it's interesting to think how Columbia
 

01:56:31.289 --> 01:56:34.189
it's interesting to think how Columbia
you know how its succeeding in those

01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199
you know how its succeeding in those
 

01:56:34.199 --> 01:56:38.359
you know how its succeeding in those
realms and I guess I'm just flashing

01:56:38.359 --> 01:56:38.369
realms and I guess I'm just flashing
 

01:56:38.369 --> 01:56:39.919
realms and I guess I'm just flashing
back to this question about the disc

01:56:39.919 --> 01:56:39.929
back to this question about the disc
 

01:56:39.929 --> 01:56:41.689
back to this question about the disc
disciplinarity because certainly that's

01:56:41.689 --> 01:56:41.699
disciplinarity because certainly that's
 

01:56:41.699 --> 01:56:43.250
disciplinarity because certainly that's
something that I think Columbia could

01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260
something that I think Columbia could
 

01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:46.729
something that I think Columbia could
use a lot more because you know when you

01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739
use a lot more because you know when you
 

01:56:46.739 --> 01:56:50.000
use a lot more because you know when you
are admired and the academic kind of

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:50.010
are admired and the academic kind of

would say both of those novels and so

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:07.530
would say both of those novels and so
 

01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:09.770

know these different models of

01:57:32.439 --> 01:57:32.449
 
 

01:57:32.449 --> 01:57:37.770

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:51.310
 
it's definitely one one kind of designer

01:57:51.310 --> 01:57:51.320
it's definitely one one kind of designer
 

01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:53.080
it's definitely one one kind of designer
to that it's like computer science

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:53.090
to that it's like computer science

because it's getting integrated to all
departments so you know medical biology

01:58:01.330 --> 01:58:01.340
departments so you know medical biology
 

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:04.320
departments so you know medical biology
chemistry they just you absorb that and

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:04.330
chemistry they just you absorb that and
 

01:58:04.330 --> 01:58:06.490
chemistry they just you absorb that and
discipline itself but just talking about

01:58:06.490 --> 01:58:06.500
discipline itself but just talking about
 

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:08.770
discipline itself but just talking about
Turing machine it's just a crazy thing

01:58:08.770 --> 01:58:08.780
Turing machine it's just a crazy thing
 

01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:11.020
Turing machine it's just a crazy thing
you know I mean we only need a few

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:11.030
you know I mean we only need a few
 

01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:13.960
you know I mean we only need a few
people for that right but I think that

01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:13.970
people for that right but I think that
 

01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:16.030
people for that right but I think that
just has to happen almost for all

01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040
just has to happen almost for all
 

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.630
just has to happen almost for all
disciplines in the sense that you know

01:58:18.630 --> 01:58:18.640
disciplines in the sense that you know
 

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:21.310
disciplines in the sense that you know
architecture is about human body so we

01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:21.320
architecture is about human body so we
 

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.080
architecture is about human body so we
should be doctors you know like the the

01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:23.090
should be doctors you know like the the
 

01:58:23.090 --> 01:58:26.140
should be doctors you know like the the
cross pollenization of the departments

01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:26.150
cross pollenization of the departments
 

01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:28.240
cross pollenization of the departments
almost happen has to happen like

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:28.250
almost happen has to happen like
 

01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:30.520
almost happen has to happen like
computer science in the sense that you

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:30.530
computer science in the sense that you
 

01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:33.160
computer science in the sense that you
know which which is this kind of cross

01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:33.170
know which which is this kind of cross
 

01:58:33.170 --> 01:58:36.729
know which which is this kind of cross
right if the focusing of that research

01:58:36.729 --> 01:58:36.739
right if the focusing of that research
 

01:58:36.739 --> 01:58:39.910
right if the focusing of that research
has been this kind of century of

01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920
has been this kind of century of
 

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:42.070
has been this kind of century of
institution because there was like

01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.080
institution because there was like
 

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:44.320
institution because there was like
cutting up departments right you do

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:44.330
cutting up departments right you do
 

01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:46.840
cutting up departments right you do
medicine you do biology it's actually

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:46.850
medicine you do biology it's actually
 

01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:49.180
medicine you do biology it's actually
not true everything's interconnected so

01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:49.190
not true everything's interconnected so
 

01:58:49.190 --> 01:58:50.920
not true everything's interconnected so
in some ways we just have to break that

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:50.930
in some ways we just have to break that
 

01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:53.890
in some ways we just have to break that
walls like I think that is the modern

01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:53.900
walls like I think that is the modern
 

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:55.570
walls like I think that is the modern
time the specialist computation where

01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:55.580
time the specialist computation where
 

01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:58.180
time the specialist computation where
everything's becoming Flint everything

01:58:58.180 --> 01:58:58.190
everything's becoming Flint everything
 

01:58:58.190 --> 01:59:00.280
everything's becoming Flint everything
is like information is everywhere you

01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:00.290
is like information is everywhere you
 

01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:02.950
is like information is everywhere you
can access any kind of information and I

01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960
can access any kind of information and I
 

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:05.520
can access any kind of information and I
think it's gonna be the kind of future

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:05.530
think it's gonna be the kind of future
 

01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:08.770
think it's gonna be the kind of future
institutions just you can't be divided

01:59:08.770 --> 01:59:08.780
institutions just you can't be divided
 

01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:10.780
institutions just you can't be divided
like that anymore and there has to be

01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:10.790
like that anymore and there has to be
 

01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:14.080
like that anymore and there has to be
broken sideways so maybe we should be I

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:14.090
broken sideways so maybe we should be I
 

01:59:14.090 --> 01:59:16.360
broken sideways so maybe we should be I
mean even within the lab which should be

01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:16.370
mean even within the lab which should be
 

01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:19.270
mean even within the lab which should be
probably doing project sideways and

01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280
probably doing project sideways and
 

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:21.700
probably doing project sideways and
beyond that architecture school has to

01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:21.710
beyond that architecture school has to
 

01:59:21.710 --> 01:59:25.630
beyond that architecture school has to
be going to the music engineer and

01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:25.640
be going to the music engineer and
 

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:28.180
be going to the music engineer and
really kind of not just oh I can take a

01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:28.190
really kind of not just oh I can take a
 

01:59:28.190 --> 01:59:31.300
really kind of not just oh I can take a
few courses but really integrating as a

01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:31.310
few courses but really integrating as a
 

01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:33.610
few courses but really integrating as a
curriculum what I would think is the

01:59:33.610 --> 01:59:33.620
curriculum what I would think is the
 

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:35.620
curriculum what I would think is the
kind of future of like an institutional

01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:35.630
kind of future of like an institutional
 

01:59:35.630 --> 01:59:38.020
kind of future of like an institutional
power is that it's all there we just

01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:38.030
power is that it's all there we just
 

01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:40.180
power is that it's all there we just
have to break the wall with you cannot

01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:40.190
have to break the wall with you cannot
 

01:59:40.190 --> 01:59:41.760
have to break the wall with you cannot
gain outside of

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:41.770

you could tap into the Internet of

01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:43.630
you could tap into the Internet of
 

01:59:43.630 --> 01:59:46.320
you could tap into the Internet of
reservoir but it's not structured like

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:46.330
reservoir but it's not structured like
 

01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:48.540
reservoir but it's not structured like
you have to structure yourself so the

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:48.550
you have to structure yourself so the
 

01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:51.450
you have to structure yourself so the
beauty of the institution could be if it

01:59:51.450 --> 01:59:51.460
beauty of the institution could be if it
 

01:59:51.460 --> 02:00:24.479
beauty of the institution could be if it
breaks the sidewalls when it was

02:00:24.479 --> 02:00:24.489
breaks the sidewalls when it was
 

02:00:24.489 --> 02:00:43.500
breaks the sidewalls when it was
actually separated out and we just get

02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:43.510
actually separated out and we just get
 

02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:45.510
actually separated out and we just get
together we're gonna do it you know and

02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520
together we're gonna do it you know and
 

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:51.800
together we're gonna do it you know and
I think it's really important because

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:51.810
 
 

02:00:51.810 --> 02:00:54.900
 
any five Economist's are going to

02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:54.910
any five Economist's are going to
 

02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:56.610
any five Economist's are going to
disagree with each other completely any

02:00:56.610 --> 02:00:56.620
disagree with each other completely any
 

02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:31.629
disagree with each other completely any
five architects are and I think

02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639
 
 

02:01:31.639 --> 02:02:35.470
 
the arguing in front of Congress

02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:35.480
 
 

02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:37.820
 
the idea the way that architects

02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:37.830
the idea the way that architects
 

02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:41.780
the idea the way that architects
interpret implications of knowledge that

02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:41.790
interpret implications of knowledge that
 

02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:50.500
interpret implications of knowledge that
kind of can bridge like action and I

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:50.510
 
 

02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:55.700
 
think so much of that you know not being

02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:55.710
think so much of that you know not being
 

02:02:55.710 --> 02:03:00.380
think so much of that you know not being
able to find the right grants things is

02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:00.390
able to find the right grants things is
 

02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:02.840
able to find the right grants things is
I don't think designers generally do a

02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:02.850
I don't think designers generally do a
 

02:03:02.850 --> 02:03:05.900
I don't think designers generally do a
very good job of demonstrating our

02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:05.910
very good job of demonstrating our
 

02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:08.450
very good job of demonstrating our
expertise other than just braiding good

02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:08.460
expertise other than just braiding good
 

02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:11.150
expertise other than just braiding good
work but we never actually share it

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:11.160
work but we never actually share it
 

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:23.030
work but we never actually share it
means to be if we could do that we would

02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040
means to be if we could do that we would
 

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:48.820
means to be if we could do that we would
I mean

02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:48.830
 
 

02:03:48.830 --> 02:04:04.480
 
right the idea being that if you can so

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:04.490
right the idea being that if you can so
 

02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:39.220
right the idea being that if you can so
this is not just in making slideshows

02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:39.230
this is not just in making slideshows
 

02:04:39.230 --> 02:04:45.120
this is not just in making slideshows
look pretty but actually

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:45.130
 
 

02:04:45.130 --> 02:04:48.210
 
so if we can find a way to kind of

02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:48.220
so if we can find a way to kind of
 

02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:51.510
so if we can find a way to kind of
demonstrate our expertise and share it I

02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520
demonstrate our expertise and share it I
 

02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:54.510
demonstrate our expertise and share it I
think that this way to do that is for us

02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:54.520
think that this way to do that is for us
 

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:58.740
think that this way to do that is for us
to be able to undertake research where

02:04:58.740 --> 02:04:58.750
to be able to undertake research where
 

02:04:58.750 --> 02:05:27.850
to be able to undertake research where
we can see its

02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:27.860
 
 

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:30.040
 
I mean I just think that that these kind

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:30.050
I mean I just think that that these kind
 

02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:31.480
I mean I just think that that these kind
of research labs are really offering

02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:31.490
of research labs are really offering
 

02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:33.640
of research labs are really offering
those opportunities for collaborations

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:33.650
those opportunities for collaborations
 

02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:35.020
those opportunities for collaborations
across disciplines with other

02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:35.030
across disciplines with other
 

02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:37.090
across disciplines with other
professions and practice to produce new

02:05:37.090 --> 02:05:37.100
professions and practice to produce new
 

02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:39.400
professions and practice to produce new
bodies of knowledge through our as you

02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:39.410
bodies of knowledge through our as you
 

02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:41.380
bodies of knowledge through our as you
were suggesting mother our expertise and

02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:41.390
were suggesting mother our expertise and
 

02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:43.330
were suggesting mother our expertise and
I think given what's going to probably

02:05:43.330 --> 02:05:43.340
I think given what's going to probably
 

02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:45.010
I think given what's going to probably
happen at the other end of the shake-up

02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:45.020
happen at the other end of the shake-up
 

02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:47.290
happen at the other end of the shake-up
of the field that these are really kind

02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:47.300
of the field that these are really kind
 

02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:49.600
of the field that these are really kind
of critical models for how one works you

02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:49.610
of critical models for how one works you
 

02:05:49.610 --> 02:05:51.340
of critical models for how one works you
know even as a post graduate from this

02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:51.350
know even as a post graduate from this
 

02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:55.450
know even as a post graduate from this
institution so thank you
