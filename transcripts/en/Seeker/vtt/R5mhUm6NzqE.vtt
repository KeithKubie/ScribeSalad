00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.850
Stargate is the world's largest metal 3D printer
entirely built and designed in-house.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.730
The core of it includes three robot arms — one
of which is doing printing — and the other

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.179
two are doing post post-processing.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.980
This is a six degree of freedom industrial
robot arm so it can move anywhere within about

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.120
a 14 foot radius of its center.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.820
Right now the biggest parts we can make are
nine foot diameter and about 15 feet tall.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.539
And our printers are only getting bigger over
time.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.590
We aim to go from print to launchpad in less
than 60 days.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.240
We’re in an exciting time for spaceflight
innovation.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.730
There’s SpaceX’s reusable rockets, trips
to the farside of the moon, NASA's commercial

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.200
crew program is finally getting underway.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.860
And there’s a startup in LA’s aerospace
hub that’s on a mission to completely 3D

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.270
print a rocket.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.110
We met up with one of their co-founders for
a look inside their operations.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.590
My name is Jordan Noone.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.540
I'm co-founder and chief technology officer
at Relativity.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.670
Me and Tim actually met when we were students. We've known each other for almost 10 years now.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.790
He graduated went to Blue Origin.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.550
I graduated went to Space X.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.580
Both Tim and I saw the promise of 3D printing
and we wanted to see the advantage of that

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.530
applied to an entire rocket.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.000
But this isn't the desktop 3D printing you’re
used to seeing us cover here at Seeker.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
This is a different type of additive manufacturing,
where an entire assembly line can be built

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.140
around machines that use powerful lasers to
create industrial parts.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.620
There's two main advantages that we see by
introducing the printing process to rocketry.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.750
The first one is reducing the part count on
the rockets.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.720
Traditionally rockets can have up to 100,000
thousand parts on them and we want to reduce

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.540
that to about a thousand.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.060
The second area is in flexible manufacturing.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.744
When you have traditional manufacturing you end up with a factory full of

00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:50.390
very expensive tooling.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.510
By introducing 3D printing as a baseline to
the manufacturing process, you now have a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.020
flexible tool rather than a fixed tool.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.560
And that makes it much easier to change and
modify our designs,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.780
especially compared to any one else in the industry.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.519
While 3D printing has been explored by others
in aerospace for years now, Relativity tells

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.100
us they’re doing something different.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.680
Often other companies will take a traditionally
manufactured assembly and look at each piece

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.370
of it and try to figure out which one is best
applicable to printing and then print that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.900
traditionally designed part.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.700
For Relativity, it all starts from the ground
up. Stargate starts when a part is still on

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.749
a computer and so in a digital environment
called CAD or computer aided design.

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:38.650
Most of the rocket is basically just a system
to carry a fuel and dispense fuel.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.880
And so for that, to make sure you have like
the lightest system possible, you wanna make

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.180
sure that wherever you move your fluids inside
your rocket which are liquid oxygen or your fuel.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.379
You want to do so super efficiently.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.359
Fluid flow can be harder to predict.

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.040
So that's when we use tools like a CFD which
is computational fluid dynamics and that's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.389
basically asking the computer to kind of predict
the way that a flow of a certain fluid will

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.359
move through a manifold and distribute itself
evenly.

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.549
By doing that in a computer we’re able to
iterate really quickly so we can say hey how

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.090
does my flow behave if I have a one inch hole
and it'll tell you and then you move that

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.609
by like maybe half an inch and you try different
things.

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.720
And from that geometry you're able to basically
tell the printer what it is you wanted to make.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.000
Just being able to maybe print three different
designs using the exact same tooling the exact

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.560
same printer allows you to just kind of bake
that into the process, that kinda trial and error.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.060
And to make these future parts, Relativity
leans in on some key printing techniques.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.090
Stargate uses a direct energy deposition method
where you're actually feeding a wire into

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.150
a melting pool and moving that process around.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.239
Stargate prints the majority of the structural
components on the rocket.

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.599
And that includes not only the propellant
tanks but the structural attachments, the payload

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.560
encapsulation fairing and all of the pieces
that aren't the engines on the rocket.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.980
One of the things that makes our tanks special
is our ability to 3D print them

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.720
and we're able to 3D print them in one piece which

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.359
gives us kind of like good confidence in our
ability to be completely leak proof.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.109
When we talk about tank we actually mean like
a tank that can hold both liquid oxygen and

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.759
liquid methane and so that's usually generally
something you either put two tanks with or have some

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.280
kind of complex divider you insert to separate the two propellants. That is one of the great advantages for us

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.060
in that we're able to print both of those tanks as one part.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.180
On the smaller scale that we use for the engines
and other smaller components, we use a methodology

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.270
called DMLS or direct metal laser sintering
and that has become pretty commonplace across

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.539
the industries.

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.930
And that is done within a bed of powder.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.139
That bed powder is laid flat and then a laser
locally melts material where you want to build

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.930
up your finished part.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.400
This process repeats itself, powder and laser,
until the part is finished, which could be

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.930
as many as 10,000 layers.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.419
Here is a version of one of our printed domes.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.540
These domes represent the end caps that will
be on the ends of the propellant tanks on our rocket.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.780
There's a variety of other equipment out on
the shop floor here including Stargate in

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.780
the back,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.960
we have CNC Mills, heat treat furnaces and
a variety of equipment that supports the manufacturing

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.880
not only for the rocket but for making the
3D printers as well.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.480
And another key element of Relativity’s
production model is automation.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.700
We have a patent that covers the real time
controls during the printing process and that

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.180
patent covers novel techniques for applying
machine learning and A.I.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.099
The control station is here on my left then.

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.539
But it's mostly for monitoring now.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.699
So you can manually move the arms but traditionally
these are moved in an entire automated manner

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.510
where you're feeding the part designed essentially
to it piece by piece so it knows which parts

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.240
of it to add at once.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.580
Once you know how you want the robot to move
during the printing process you have to be

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.620
ready to do all of the dynamic controls and
feedback.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.000
We collect enough data both on what we're
putting into the printers and what's coming

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.940
out of them in order to correlate that and
come up with control loops that can maintain

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.160
the very high quality prints in a way that
we could not predict just on our own.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.750
This killer combo of automation, machine learning,
and 3D printing promises to deliver a new

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.789
path for spaceflight. Our printing
technology has surpassed even where sci-fi has

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.090
put some parts of technology which is often surprising to see.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.460
Aeon one is a fully 3D printed rocket engine
fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid methane.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.169
It is entirely printed in only three parts
and that is a testament to the part reduction

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.819
that is achievable through the printing process.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:44.940
A similar engine with a similar internal configuration
could take up to three thousand parts when

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.560
traditionally manufactured and we can make
them not only in three parts, but print those

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.960
parts in only nine days.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.120
There's still plenty of work ahead before
these engines are ready for their first official

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.360
launch, but NASA is paying close attention.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.440
They’ve recently inked a 20 year partnership
with the Stennis Space Center for future testing.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.000
We've had over 100 hot fires of that under
a variety of revisions constantly modifying

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.539
and improving the performance of it as we've
gone through that test campaign.

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.729
The rocket that we're selling is seven foot
diameter and one hundred and five feet tall.

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:24.229
It weighs about one hundred and twenty thousand
pounds at take off and by weight it's ninety

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:26.069
five percent printed.

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:31.720
This rocket is catching contracts with satellite
companies, even before it’s ever had its first test.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.700
They’re working towards a 2020 orbital test,
with 2021 as their official launch for commercial flights.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.960
We see a future where not only do we have
3D printing but we also have an automated

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.120
production line handling everything that comes out of the printers.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.310
3D printing is the special sauce of Relativity
but I think that comes into play in more ways

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.699
than people realize.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:57.319
You have the ability to basically change your
designs and explore the design space at a

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.719
much faster rate.

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:04.039
You need kind of a lot of creativity to, and
a bit of audacity to kinda look at these

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.900
problems that have been solved and try to
approach them in a different way.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.840
And so every day you get to sit down and say "oh you know have we tried this?

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.140
Have we looked at that? You really have kinda blank slate to work with,

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.960
so it's a lot of fun.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.620
