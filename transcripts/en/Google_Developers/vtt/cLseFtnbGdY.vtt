00:00:06.528 --> 00:00:08.792
Paco has successfully published

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:10.924
the first version
of his census application

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:12.528
on the Internet
with Google App Engine.

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:14.627
Users are now accessing it

00:00:14.627 --> 00:00:17.132
and are ready to fill out
their information.

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.726
It's Paco's responsibility
to find the correct operation,

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:22.858
diagnose and resolve incidents

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:23.957
that users report,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.528
as well as make adjustments
for even better performance

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:28.033
or for lower costs.

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.792
The remote administration panel

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:32.330
offers a series
of available online tools

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.363
that Paco will be able to use
with all these tasks.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:37.462
In other words, with this panel

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:40.462
Paco will be able to configure,
monitor and control

00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:42.660
different aspects
of his application

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.132
in the area of production.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.726
To access the remote
administration panel,

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:49.594
Paco enters
appengine.google.com,

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:52.198
clicks on the link
about the identifier

00:00:52.198 --> 00:00:53.627
for his application to access.

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:58.066
CONTROL BOARD OR DASHBOARD

00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:01.264
The control board
is the starting point

00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:04.462
and the most consulted section
of the remote admin. panel.

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.924
It will show Paco, in detail,

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:09.693
the amount of traffic
and overall operation

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:11.495
of his census application.

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:15.066
Immediately
underneath the charts

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.132
Paco will be able to see
the separated details

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:19.693
about daily consumption for
the most important resources,

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:21.693
available quotas and costs.

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:25.462
These quotas are renewed
every 24 hours.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.759
For those resources
that are getting close

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.363
to the end
of the available quota

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:32.429
a red warning bar will appear

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.165
next to the related resource.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.066
There's another section
that shows in more detail

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.066
the consumption of quotas
under the title "Quota Details."

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.759
If the application
gets close to,

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.462
or passes, any quota,

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:45.924
Paco must register
his credit card information

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:48.429
in the billing section,
as we will see further on.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.792
While finalizing,
Paco will find a summary

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.528
with the most
accessed addresses,

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:56.033
and some consolidated data
related to requests,

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.033
latency and execution cycles.

00:01:58.198 --> 00:02:01.264
The addresses with
the most errors are also listed.

00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:06.066
LOGS

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.693
Unlike a traditional server,

00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:11.528
where logs are accumulated
in hundreds of huge text files

00:02:11.528 --> 00:02:13.627
that are difficult to consult,

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:16.198
in the remote administration
panel, Paco will have

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:19.297
his census application logs
indexed and available

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.363
to consult quickly at any time.

00:02:22.363 --> 00:02:24.231
Paco will be able
to search by text,

00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:25.627
using regular expressions,

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:27.891
and filter by error level
and date range.

00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:30.231
To see the complete detail
for each request,

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.627
Paco will be able to expand them
and consult specific information

00:02:33.627 --> 00:02:36.198
such as what navigator
the user was on,

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.495
their IP address, URL,

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:41.198
and the date and time
they accessed.

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.957
In the Application Settings
section,

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:45.363
it is also possible
to configure time duration

00:02:45.363 --> 00:02:47.363
or the maximum size of the logs.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.990
CONFIGURATION
AND PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS

00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.330
The Application Settings section

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.297
will allow Paco to see
and change the overall aspects

00:02:57.297 --> 00:02:58.396
of his application,

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:01.264
and adjust output
and performance parameters.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.957
The type of machine
to use for the new instances

00:03:03.957 --> 00:03:05.066
is one of them.

00:03:05.264 --> 00:03:07.891
There are 4 options that vary
in RAM memory

00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:09.132
and available CPU.

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:10.957
The better the specifications,

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.825
the higher
the hourly instance cost.

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:15.693
In Google App Engine,
the "Scheduler"

00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:18.594
is responsible for routing
user requests

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.858
to active instances
with the census application,

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.495
and also to prepare
the same application

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.594
in other inactive instances,
idle instances,

00:03:26.594 --> 00:03:27.990
for later use.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.957
If high traffic occupies
all the available instances,

00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:33.462
the user will experience
some latency

00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:35.363
while new instances
are being created

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:38.627
or until occupied instances
become available again.

00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:41.462
By increasing the maximum
and minimum number

00:03:41.462 --> 00:03:43.462
of active instances,
we can control answer time,

00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:45.627
since having
more available instances

00:03:45.627 --> 00:03:47.396
won't be necessary
to create new ones

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:50.561
and thus offer an almost
immediate answer time to users.

00:03:50.726 --> 00:03:51.858
Alternatively,

00:03:51.858 --> 00:03:54.396
the pending latency,
Pending Latency,

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:57.033
determines the maximum
or minimum time that a request

00:03:57.033 --> 00:03:59.858
waits in line before
a new instance is launched

00:03:59.858 --> 00:04:01.627
to help with its process.

00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:05.198
If we assign a short time,
many instances will be created,

00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:07.792
shortening user answer time.

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:10.033
Keep in mind that
having more instances

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.693
means paying
a higher operation cost.

00:04:12.693 --> 00:04:16.099
As a result, the scheduler
automatically defines

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.528
these values according
to the amount of traffic

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:19.198
and the application profile.

00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:21.231
But Paco can manually
refine them

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:23.858
to either optimize
the application cost

00:04:23.858 --> 00:04:27.132
or the answer times,
but not both at once.

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:31.132
ROLES AND PERMISSIONS

00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:33.627
Paco needs to share
his application

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:35.759
with his team at work.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.759
Nevertheless, each one
will have different tasks,

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.264
depending on their role.

00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:42.429
Upon entering
the permissions section,

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:44.858
Paco will first see
the user list,

00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:45.957
role and state.

00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:48.264
Underneath, there is a form

00:04:48.264 --> 00:04:51.660
to add new users, indicating
their Google email address

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.198
and role to be assigned.

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:57.132
The following are
the current available roles

00:04:57.132 --> 00:04:59.462
and a summary
of the related permissions.

00:04:59.693 --> 00:05:02.561
Viewer: Can only consult
the information

00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:04.759
and data on the remote
administration panel,

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.561
but can not modify it.
Can download logs

00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:09.297
through the command line.

00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:11.957
Developer: Sees and edits
the application

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:13.627
on the remote
administration panel,

00:05:13.627 --> 00:05:16.627
but can not delete it
or change roles and permissions.

00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:19.099
They have complete access
to unfolding.

00:05:19.693 --> 00:05:22.693
Owner: Has all available

00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:24.099
application permissions.

00:05:24.132 --> 00:05:25.429
Upon adding a new user,

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.528
they will receive an email
with a link

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.264
to accept the invitation.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.693
Paco or any other
application owner

00:05:31.693 --> 00:05:34.066
can deny access
to the other accounts

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:36.759
at any time by clicking
on the Remove Button

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.693
under the Remove Access column.

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:43.957
BILLING

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:47.363
Google App Engine offers
a generous free quota

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:49.363
with which Paco
will be able to begin

00:05:49.363 --> 00:05:52.495
showing the census application
to his colleagues.

00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:54.792
Once it becomes public
and receives more

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:57.363
and more traffic
or completes more work,

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:59.627
it's likely that this quota
is passed

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.198
and he needs to begin to pay.

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:04.462
Nevertheless, the payment model
for Google App Engine

00:06:04.462 --> 00:06:06.462
functions as
a low demand scheme.

00:06:06.462 --> 00:06:09.858
This means it only applies
to the resources being used.

00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:12.066
In the Billing Status section,

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:14.561
Paco can assign
a weekly maximum budget

00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:15.924
in dollars.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.825
He can also reserve
instance hours

00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:19.396
at discount price.

00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:22.363
Paco will be able to assign
accounts as billing

00:06:22.363 --> 00:06:24.363
administrators
with access to this section.

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:26.627
Under the Transaction History
section,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.297
Paco will have the detailed list

00:06:28.297 --> 00:06:29.792
with the history
of all payments,

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:33.297
separating the consumed use
for each resource.

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:36.396
In the Billing Profile
and Billing Settings sections,

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.825
Paco will be able to define
contact information,

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.264
credit cards to be used,

00:06:40.264 --> 00:06:43.165
and other relevant
billing information.

00:06:43.594 --> 00:06:47.528
SYSTEM STATUS

00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.891
Emergency: Users report

00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:52.231
that they can not access
the census application,

00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:54.363
and that an error page
is being shown.

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:56.561
Paco wonders if it's due
to a problem

00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:57.660
with his root code.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.495
He checks it and doesn't
see anything wrong.

00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:02.462
Even though Google App Engine
is one of the platforms

00:07:02.462 --> 00:07:04.429
with the highest availability
on the market,

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:06.858
and it's not common,
it's possible

00:07:06.858 --> 00:07:08.264
that it could be offline,

00:07:08.264 --> 00:07:09.891
completely or partially.

00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:12.759
Outside the panel,
but very important to Paco

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.462
in this situation,

00:07:14.462 --> 00:07:16.957
is the system status board,
System Status,

00:07:17.297 --> 00:07:19.264
where Paco will be able
to consult, in detail,

00:07:19.264 --> 00:07:20.825
the current and past state

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:23.363
of each of
the platform components

00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:26.099
Datastore, Memcash
Main, etc...

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.330
And each of the runtimes
for Python, Java and Go.

00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:33.858
Currently, the remote
administration panel

00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:36.099
is being moved to
the unified developers' console

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:38.462
by Google Cloud Platform.

00:07:38.462 --> 00:07:41.528
On cloud.google.com/console,

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:44.693
Paco will be able to consult
part of the same information

00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:46.957
he has already seen on
the remote administration panel

00:07:46.957 --> 00:07:49.363
with a quicker
and friendlier interface.

00:07:49.462 --> 00:07:51.165
The remote administration panel

00:07:51.165 --> 00:07:52.759
has multiple sections,

00:07:52.825 --> 00:07:54.726
and with each platform update

00:07:54.726 --> 00:07:56.396
it has to grow more and more.

00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:58.990
In this lesson, we have covered
as an introduction

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.429
the most relevant sections.

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:01.825
As an exercise, it's up to you

00:08:01.825 --> 00:08:04.099
to go through the rest
of the sections on your own.

00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:05.528
That's all for now.

00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:06.891
Keep programming!
