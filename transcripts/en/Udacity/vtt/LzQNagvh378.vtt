00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.371
Since graph A is exactly the same as this function except flipped across the

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:09.918
x-axis, it represents a reflection of f of x in the x-axis. Graph B is

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:14.800
identical to f of x, except flipped across the y-axis. So, it represents a

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.378
reflection in the y-axis. Cool. We have all sorts of mirror images all over the

00:00:19.378 --> 00:00:20.279
place.
