00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:26.160
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.820
Well, if you're ready,
this will be the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.930
other big side of calculus.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.350
We still have two functions,
as before.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.300
Let me call them the height and
the slope: y of x and the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.890
slope, s of x.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.940
Function one and function two.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.070
That's what calculus is about.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.960
And earlier, we figured out how
to go from function one if

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.630
we knew that, how to
find the slope.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.280
Of course, it was easy when
function one was just a

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.000
straight line.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.550
Then the slope was just
up divided by across.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.020
But when function
one was curving,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.160
we had to do something.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.760
We had to take just a small
distance across, a small

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.200
distance up and divide,
and then let small

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.450
get smaller and smaller.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.840
The result of that was function
two, the derivative.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770
Today, we're going
the other way.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.060
We know the slope.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.625
We know s of x, and we want
to find the height, y

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:41.760
of x, of the graph.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.450
We know how the graph is sloping
at every point, and we

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.920
have to put all that information
together to find

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590
its height.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.220
OK.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.076
Let me say the easiest way to
do it, when it works, is to

00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:05.740
recognize if we are given a
formula for the slope, to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.770
recognize maybe we know a height
that goes with it.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.010
Let me take an example.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.040
So the one, and most important
case of a height

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.860
is x to some power.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.400
x to n.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.900
That's one that everybody
learns.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.720
When y is x to the nth, the
result of this process that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.460
produces function two going in
that direction is dy/dx is

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:51.130
that n comes down and we
have one lower power.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.050
So if we happen to have that
as our slope, that would be

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.990
our height.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.920
Nothing more to do.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.360
But many other slopes
are possible.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.400
Let's just stay with this
another minute.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.730
What if the slope was
x to the nth itself?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.310
What if we started with function
two as x to the nth.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.310
Suppose dy/dx is x to the nth
power, like x squared.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.010
Where does x squared
come from?

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.770
Well, look at this rule.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.140
That rule said that for these
power functions, the power

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.640
drops by one.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.390
So if I want to end up with x
to the nth, going backwards,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.730
function one had better be,
involve an x to the n plus 1.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.040
But that's not perfect, of
course, because when I take

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.460
the slope of that one, this
factor, this power, this

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.450
exponent, n plus n
will come down.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.530
Just as n came down to here, n
plus 1 will come down, and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.680
therefore I'd better divide by
n plus 1 so that when I do

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.829
take the slope, when I do go to
number two, the n plus 1's

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.860
will cancel.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.140
The power will drop by one, and
I'll have x to the nth.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.140
OK, there's an example--

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.860
quite a useful one--

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.660
of going from step two to
step one just by kind of

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.060
recognizing what
you want there.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.880
So this is one set that
everybody learns.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.070
Another is sines and cosines,
if you can fit it into that.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.540
Another is either
the x or logx.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.490
That's pretty much the list.
And then you learn, in the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.030
future, ways to change things
around to fit into one of

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.670
those forms. But then,
of course, there

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.830
are many, many cases--

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.010
many, many functions, too-- that
you don't fit, can't fit

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.160
into a form where you can
recognize from some list which

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.170
you either have learned or you
find on the web or you find in

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.240
the calculator.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.830
A lot of lists have been made
to help you go from two to

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.050
one, but today we have
to understand what

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.110
is the actual process.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.730
What is the, what is the the
reverse process to this one?

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.360
And of course, this one involved
a limit as delta x

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.550
went to 0, because always I have
to remember that things

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.960
can be curving, things can be
changing, I can't assume that

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.300
they're saying the same.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.580
And then, the reverse
direction.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.410
Maybe I just tell you first
what the symbol is.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.300
If I have this s of x and I want
to get back to y of x--

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.880
so this is from two to one--

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.740
one will be y of x.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.370
The symbol for y
of x will be--

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.575
it's, I'm just really wanting to
draw that integral symbol.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.990
The integral, I would say the
integral of s of x dx.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.830
And you'll see why--

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.520
this is, that's an s--

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.370
you'll see why that's a
reasonable way to write it.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.600
But of course, first, we need
the idea behind it.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.477
OK, so how am I going
to proceed?

00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:54.380
Step one, I'll take steps, I
won't try to get immediately

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.930
to the case of continuous
change.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.870
I'll take single, individual
steps.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.070
Let me do that.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.850
And then, I'm going to
take smaller steps.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.920
And then in the limit, I'm
taking continuous steps.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.100
OK, so first, big steps.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.490
So let me put down, for example,
suppose I have y's.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:32.990
Suppose the y's stepped up like
0, 1, 4, 9, 16, whatever.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:40.610
So those are heights, and, of a
graph that's sort of pieces

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.380
of straight lines, only
changing a few times.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.670
What would be the slopes?

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.400
Going now, this is
one going to two.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.650
The slope is s.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.530
Well, the slope, if the step
size is one and I go up by

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.870
one, the slope will be 1.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.440
Here I go up by 3.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.300
Here I go up by 5.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.520
Here I go up by 7.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.810
So if I, to go from there to
there, I'm taking differences.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.860
I'm taking delta y's.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.710
These s's are delta y's.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.380
How do I go backwards?

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:28.380
Suppose I gave you 1, 3, 5, 7,
and I started y off at 0.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.645
How could you recover
the rest of the y's?

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.679
Well, that I would, that 1 plus
3 is the 4, 1 plus 3 plus

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.630
5 is the 9, 1 plus
3 adds 7 more.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.230
You're up to 16 and onwards.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:53.440
So if going this way is a
subtraction at each step,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.080
going this way is a kind
of running addition.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.350
I add up all the slopes to
see how far I've climbed.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.730
Let me do a second example,
just to make that point.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.010
Let me start you this time,
let me start you with the

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.380
slopes, because that's
today's job.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.930
Suppose the slopes are
4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.570
So if these were speeds,
I would say,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.310
OK, I'm slowing down.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.560
I'm slowing down, but I'm
still moving forward.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.110
Positive speeds, but putting
the brakes on.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.850
What would be the distances?

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.380
If the trip meter starts, start
the trip meter at 0.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:42.770
OK.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:53.950
Then in the first second or
hour, the first delta x we

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.200
would go 4.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.050
And what goes there?

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.300
7, right?

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.670
I'm doing, I'm accumulating,
adding up the distances.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.130
Here I was at 4.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.600
I went another three
to 7, to 9, 10.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.250
Here's, I didn't move.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:27.180
No speed, zero slope, stays
flat, hit the top at 10.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:33.020
OK, I could do this with any
bunch of numbers and I can do

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.770
it with letters.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:40.110
So now I move from arithmetic
to algebra.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.920
Algebra just means I'll do it
with any letters, but I'm not

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.340
yet doing it continuously,
which is what

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.100
calculus will do.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:11:01.680
So with letters, I have here y0,
y1, y2, y3, y4, let's say.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.980
So those are the y's.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.510
Now what are the slopes between
them if the step

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.790
across is 1?

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.620
So what are the steps upward,
what are the delta y's?

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:26.860
Well, y1 minus y0, y2 minus y1,
y3 minus y2, y4 minus y3.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:32.470
And then my question is these
are the s's, these are the

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.930
delta y's, you could say.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.180
These are the y's.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.870
What happens if I add
all those delta y's?

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.880
Do you see what happens?

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.250
What happens if I add those
four changes to

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.620
get the total change?

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.540
Well, when I add those, do you
see that y1 will cancel minus

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:03.320
y1, y2 will cancel minus y2,
y3 will cancel minus y3.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.400
So the sum--

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.260
and I use just a sigma symbol,
but I'll just say sum and you

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.550
know what I mean--

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:18.500
of these delta y's is what?

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.900
What happened after all
those cancellations?

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.490
Did everything cancel?

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.300
No way.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.360
y4 is still there, minus
y0 is still there.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.670
So it was y4 minus y0.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.350
The last y minus the first y.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:45.650
I'll just write y last minus
y 0, y first. y end minus y

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.330
start is the sum of
the delta y's.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.230
Simple algebra.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.410
Reminding us again and again and
again that the opposite,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:05.100
the inverse to go the other way
from two to one, we add

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.025
pieces to get back to the y's.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:22.650
Now I'm coming closer to what I
want, but I'm moving toward

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.900
calculus now.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:34.950
So calculus, I got there by
delta y's over delta x's.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.550
So in moving toward calculus,
what am I doing?

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:43.836
I'm thinking of the changes
delta y over

00:13:43.836 --> 00:13:46.283
smaller steps delta x.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.840
So I just want to
take this step.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.930
I want to divide by delta x
and multiply by delta x.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.110
Why do I do that?

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.830
That's because it's this delta
y over delta x that is--

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:10.370
it's those ratios, whatever
the size of delta x is.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.540
And it's going to get
smaller and smaller.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:19.540
I'm going to look at the change
over very short steps.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.640
Then it's that ratio
that make sense.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.970
Delta y over delta x is
a reasonable number.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.120
It's close to the s.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.490
It's close to dy dx, but it
hasn't got there yet.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:39.430
I'm multiplying by the delta x,
the small step that's going

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.130
to 0 but hasn't got there yet.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:48.050
And I'm adding and I get the
last one minus the first one.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:56.670
Now here comes the
limiting step.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:03.940
So the limiting step will be
the limit of this left hand

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.360
side, this sum.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.920
So in the limit, I'll have more
and more and more things.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:18.430
As delta x gets smaller, if
I'm thinking of some fixed

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.970
total change in x, I'm chopping
that up into smaller

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.560
and smaller pieces, more
and more pieces.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:30.690
So more and more pieces of the
slopes at different points

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:39.640
along times the size of the
piece give this answer.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.420
So now can I jump to the
way that I would

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.090
write this in the limit?

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.570
So now let delta x go to 0.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.320
And I ask the right hand
side, y last minus y

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.250
first is not changing.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.870
y at the end--

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.960
I'll write something different,
y end minus y

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.470
start, just to make that
same point again.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.770
But it's this that's changing.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:22.070
As delta x goes to 0,
this becomes dy dx.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.250
The little delta x's
are going to 0.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.160
Here's the way I write it.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:50.590
So in that limit, I can't
legally write that sigma, so

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:55.030
this integral symbol is kind
of copied from that sigma.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.120
But it's telling you that
a limit has happened.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.589
And in that limit, this
is dy dx and this, the

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.560
notation, is dx.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:18.809
I've got what I predicted
here, with s of x there.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:30.070
So what I hope this discussion
has, by starting with numbers,

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:35.630
by going to algebra, by looking
at the sum of those

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.390
things, which was simple, and
then by going to the limit,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.550
which was not simple.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:49.410
So a whole lot of limit has been
not fully explained, and

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.180
I think the right thing to do
now is to do an example.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.570
So let me move to an example.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:02.350
So I'll take a particular
function and follow this

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.070
process, this limiting process
and see what it gives.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:13.380
And it will give us function one
and, as a bonus, it will

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.550
give us a new meaning
for function one.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.430
Let's do it.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:24.770
So now I'm going to take
a particular s of x.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.400
So here's x.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:34.670
Let me take s of x
to be 2 minus 2x.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.370
I didn't want to take one
totally simple that I already

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:47.830
had started the lecture with,
but it's not difficult either.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:51.310
We'll be able to see what's
happening here.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.410
OK, so let me graph it, because
I want to do this now

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.690
with the graph.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:05.960
So at x equal 1, s of x has
dropped to 0, where when x was

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.540
0, it started at 2.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.850
So it started somewhere here.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.240
Here was 1, halfway down.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.470
It's going to come down
in a straight line.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.750
And let me stop there.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:24.690
It could continue, but let me
call y end is going to be 0

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.650
and y start is going to be--

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.350
well, we'll see about
that, sorry.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.840
s at the end is 0.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.150
S at the end is 0.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.640
I don't yet know what
y at the end is.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.750
It's not 0.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.000
So what's my idea?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.980
Well, not mine.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:48.210
Newton and Leibniz and a lot
of people had these ideas.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.170
It's kind of interesting.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.130
So Archimedes.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:58.260
He goes way, way back, before
Newton or Leibniz or anybody

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.510
conceived of them.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.770
Archimedes figured out
how to deal with a

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:11.000
curve with a parabola.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.880
Archimedes got from a parabola,
he got from x

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:25.540
squared, the parabola, back to
a height by special ideas.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.700
He was one of the great
mathematicians of all time.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:35.700
But even Archimedes didn't see
what you now see, this

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.190
connection between function
one and function two.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.950
If he had seen that, he would
have gone further.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.410
All right, now let's see it.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.420
Let me take a delta
x equal to 1/4.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:02.000
So this is delta x here, and
this one is two delta x's, and

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.370
this one is three delta x's, and
the one is four delta x's

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:14.440
in my original delta x, which is
1/4, which is small but not

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.550
really small.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.700
So now what do I do?

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.540
Look at this first period.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.610
The slope, the s function,
function two--

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.520
see, over here is going
to be function one.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.010
This is going to be the y,
the integral of that.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.680
But I don't know what
it is yet, so it's

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.750
pretty open to question.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.190
OK, so now let's get there.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:52.150
So the point is that
over this interval,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.200
the slope is changing.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.920
It's changing a significant
amount.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.990
Not too much, but
it's changing.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.880
And I don't know, from the
algebra, I don't know how to

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.130
deal with that.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.320
I'm just going to take a value
within this sum value and stay

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.110
with it within that interval,
and I'll take

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.750
the starting value.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:25.070
So over this first delta x, I'm
going to pretend that the

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.330
slope stays at 2.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.820
So I'm pretending that this
is my slope function.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:37.050
Then over my next delta x, I'm
going to pretend that it stays

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.660
at probably 1 1/2.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.550
And then I'm going to pretend
that it stays at 1, and I'm

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.110
going to pretend that
it stays at 1/2.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:55.590
If you allow me to go back to
distance and speed, I'm

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:03.320
chopping up the full time, the
day, let's say, into four

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:11.350
pieces and in each piece, the
speed is changing, which I'm

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.990
not ready to deal with,
which algebra isn't

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.830
ready to deal with.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:22.000
So the best I could do was say
OK, so suppose the speed is

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.550
constant at what it was at the
start of that short time.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.090
So those would be delta t's
rather than delta x's.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:36.560
The s would be representing
speed, but no difference in

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.000
the picture.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.270
So now let me do these things.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.650
Now I'm going to do this
addition, which won't give me

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:55.790
exactly the right y because
those rectangles are not

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.670
exactly right.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:03.940
But I'll get them better by
taking smaller delta x's.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.540
Let me see, what
do I have here?

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.870
Over this first time, I
have my slope, which

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.130
I'm taking to b 2.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:22.290
So that's the delta y over delta
x, that's the s, and

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.630
then times the delta x.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.700
And what is that?

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.840
We might as well just face it,
that that 2 times that delta

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.330
x, we can think of that
as the area in

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.340
that tall, thin rectangle.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.256
Well, I've introduced the word
area for the first time.

00:24:43.256 --> 00:24:47.940
It never showed up on
the previous board.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.570
It's the extra insight
that's coming today.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:58.680
Now over the second short
period, I'm going to keep fix

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.000
my speed at 1 1/2.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:10.540
1 1/2 times delta x, because my
speed I'm setting at 1 1/2,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.980
and this is how long I go so
this is a distance or a change

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.450
in height, a change in y.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.820
And you see what's coming.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.740
The next one will be a 1 times
the delta x, and the last will

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.676
be 1/2 times the delta x.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:35.480
This is adding the way
I did in the algebra.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.720
And what do I get?

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.810
Well, this, again, is the
area of that piece.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.310
This one is the area of that
piece, this one is the area of

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.950
that piece.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:55.200
I get an overestimate because
the true slopes dropped a

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.670
little within each piece.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:05.440
I get some quantity which I can
figure out, but it's not

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.110
the right answer.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.380
It's not the final answer.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.910
And what is now the main
step to get there?

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:16.790
Chop delta x into half,
you could say.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.150
Why not cut it in half?

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.450
Now I'll have a different
picture.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.790
Can you see what this
picture is doing?

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:32.770
Now over the first little half
of the old step I am up here,

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.220
but then I drop to here.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.060
Can I do this with an eraser?

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:47.755
A little bit got chopped away, a
little bit got chopped away.

00:26:47.755 --> 00:26:49.005
Where has it gone?

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:58.790
I'm going to have
this zig zag.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.040
That wasn't too bad.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:15.680
I'm replacing that with a sum of
eight pieces, because delta

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.190
x is now down to 1/8.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.090
This is what we said
about that sum.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:29.690
That sum has got more and more
terms because it has a term

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:36.860
for every little delta x, and
the size of that term is about

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.660
like delta x multiplied
by an s.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:47.030
So what I getting in the limit
is a kind of running sum, a

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.980
running counter, a mileage
meter, a trip mileage, that's

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.160
adding up distance
based on speed.

00:27:58.432 --> 00:28:04.870
Do you see what I'm getting
in the graph picture?

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:09.790
What happens to the shaded part
as delta x gets smaller

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.400
and smaller?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:19.940
This shaded part is going
to be the curve.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:26.310
These little long pieces are
going to get reduced, reduced,

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:31.740
reduced, and in the end
the total height at

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.680
1 is going to be--

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.800
ta-da, this is the moment--

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.160
the area under the
slope curve.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:49.750
This y turns out to be
the area under the s

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:54.340
of x curve, or y.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.640
So at x equal 1, what is it?

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.860
What's the area out to 1?

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.260
Well, we've got a
triangle there.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.735
Its base is 1, its
height is 2.

00:29:07.735 --> 00:29:10.870
The area of a triangle is 1/2
the base times the height, so

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.530
I have 1/2 times 1 times 2.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:13.780
I've got 1.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.610
The area at the end is 1.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.942
But--

00:29:21.942 --> 00:29:23.250
well, I shouldn't say but.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:31.960
I should let you applaud first.
What if I only went

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.210
that far, halfway?

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.830
What if that was s end?

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:46.750
What if I want to know what
is y at x equal 1/2?

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.720
Then it'll be of course, just
the area up to that point.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:56.590
Can I remove this part of the
picture for a moment?

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.050
I'm always looking at area.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.440
And the area of that, do we know
what that area would be?

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.140
It's not a triangle anymore,
it's some kind of a trapezoid.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:13.270
As delta x goes to 0, I'm going
to get the correct area,

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.820
which will be what?

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:21.250
Let's see, I have 1/2 as the
base and the average height is

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.700
about 1 1/2.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.490
Can I do that little
calculation?

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:30.760
The base is 1/2 and the average
height is 1 1/2.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.800
I think I get 3/4.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.110
So halfway along, it's
got up to 3/4.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.020
Where is 3/4?

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.430
So this is 1, this is 3/4,
this is 1/2, this is 1/4.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.550
So at 1, it's at 3/4.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.180
Halfway along, its at 3/4.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:03.640
I would like to know
that graph now.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.960
I'm ready to jump
to the limit.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:13.230
Let me do it the way I said at
the very start of the lecture.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.370
Let me take this and
try to guess.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.320
So, I'm taking a shortcut.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.210
Because do we go through this
horrible process every time we

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.150
want to do an integral?

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:26.150
Of course we don't.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:32.470
The best way is, can we find a
y function, a function, one,

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.220
that has that derivative?

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.010
Let's just try it.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.130
I'm allowed to take it in
two pieces, that's a

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.000
very valuable fact.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.720
So what has the derivative 2?

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.730
If the slope is 2, what's
the function?

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.850
If the speed is 2, what's
the distance?

00:31:52.850 --> 00:32:01.420
It's constant speed, 2, times
the total distance.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.770
The slope of the 2x line
is 2, clearly.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.460
What about the 2x?

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.120
Which function has
the slope 2x?

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.360
Well, we saw it over here.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:23.330
The function that has the slope
2x is x squared, because

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.685
when I take the slope of x
squared, the 2 comes down.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.130
The 2 shows up, I have
one smaller power, x

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.230
to the first power.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:41.830
This is the correct y, and I
hope that my graph gets those

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.940
points right.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:48.020
At x equal to 1, this is
2 minus 1, this is the

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.190
correct height, 1.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:57.270
At x equal to 1/2, all right,
here is the moment of truth.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:04.860
Now set x equal to 1/2, and what
do you get for this y?

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.580
You get 2 times 1/2--
that's 1--

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:14.336
minus 1/2 squared, 1/4.

00:33:14.336 --> 00:33:16.080
Hey, miracle.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.360
3/4.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:24.100
This area I figured
to be 3/4 and this

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.370
approach also gave 3/4.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:30.470
Either way, multiplying
those is 3/4,

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.810
subtracting those is 3/4.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.080
What does my graph look like?

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.850
What does the graph
of that look like?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.740
What's the slope at the start?

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.000
The slope at the start
is s at the start.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.040
And s at the start, when
x is 0, the slope is 2.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.340
So it starts out with
a slope of 2.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:04.370
But it's slowing down, it's a
little bit like this one where

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:08.260
the car was slowing down, we're
not picking up distance

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.080
so quickly, we're not picking
up height so quickly.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.429
But we're still going
forward, we're still

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.880
picking up some height.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.260
So it starts with a slope of 2,
bends around to there, and

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.350
I guess maybe that is--

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.909
yes.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.760
That picture is almost
good, but not great.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:35.760
So the slope is 2 and there.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.040
And what is the slope
at this point?

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.760
You can't tell from my picture,
which isn't perfect.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.520
The slope, I'm told
what it is.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.650
When x is 1, the slope
is 2 minus 2.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.600
Slope 0.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.409
The slope is 0.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.909
We're not picking up any more
height, any more area.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.780
And of course, that's right.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.500
At this point, we're not
picking up more area.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.400
If I continue beyond here,
we're losing area because

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.820
below the axis, I'll count as
negative area just because if

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.500
it was speed, I'd be
going backwards.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.730
That's what will happen here.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.980
I'll start down.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.710
If that continued, this
would still be the

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.290
correct thing to graph.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.750
If I do graph it, that's
actually the top at x equal 1,

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.460
and then it starts down and
probably by, I don't know

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:39.090
where, x equal something,
maybe by x equal 2.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.230
Oh yeah, you can see.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.760
By x equal to 2, it's
got down to 0 again.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:51.750
When x is 2, this is now 0 and
you can see that when x is 2,

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.860
we'll have the bad area--

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.590
the car going backwards--

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.030
will be identical to
the forward area.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.655
The total area is 0, and I'll be
at this point when x is 2.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.235
Let me just recap a moment.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.240
Today was about going
from function two

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.940
back to function one.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.020
The quickest way to do it is
to find a function one that

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.710
gives that function two
and then you're in.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.080
But if you can't do that or if
you want to understand what

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.410
the real, behind it, limiting
process is, it's like the

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:43.060
algebra but it's this expression
here that's

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.900
concealing so much
mathematics.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.710
Delta x going to 0, these ratios
going to the actual

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:57.430
function, and the delta x I
replaced by the symbol dx,

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:01.200
indicating an infinitesimal.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:01.930
We'll see it more.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.105
Thank you.
