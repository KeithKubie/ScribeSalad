00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.910
in this video we'll see an alternative

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
in this video we'll see an alternative
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.970
in this video we'll see an alternative
for visualizing undirected graphical

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980
for visualizing undirected graphical
 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.039
for visualizing undirected graphical
models like the conditional random field

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
models like the conditional random field
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.450
models like the conditional random field
known as the factor graph we've seen in

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
known as the factor graph we've seen in
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.100
known as the factor graph we've seen in
the previous video that one way of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
the previous video that one way of
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.959
the previous video that one way of
visualizing in conditional random field

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
visualizing in conditional random field
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.590
visualizing in conditional random field
is to draw a network where each node

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
is to draw a network where each node
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.019
is to draw a network where each node
would correspond to one of the random

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
would correspond to one of the random
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.140
would correspond to one of the random
variables in the model and then we will

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
variables in the model and then we will
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.710
variables in the model and then we will
draw an edge between each node that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
draw an edge between each node that
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.560
draw an edge between each node that
share at least one factor in the product

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
share at least one factor in the product
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.870
share at least one factor in the product
of factors form of the conditional

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
of factors form of the conditional
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.670
of factors form of the conditional
random field now one problem with this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
random field now one problem with this
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.709
random field now one problem with this
visualization is that it's actually

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
visualization is that it's actually
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.250
visualization is that it's actually
ambiguous so we notice for instance that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
ambiguous so we notice for instance that
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.560
ambiguous so we notice for instance that
we actually have a clip between and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
we actually have a clip between and
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540
we actually have a clip between and
there's a mistake here this would be x2

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
there's a mistake here this would be x2
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.619
there's a mistake here this would be x2
we actually have a click between y1 y2

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
we actually have a click between y1 y2
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.310
we actually have a click between y1 y2
and x2 another click like this here that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
and x2 another click like this here that
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.670
and x2 another click like this here that
is a subset of the graph where each node

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680
is a subset of the graph where each node
 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.830
is a subset of the graph where each node
each pair of node is connected to each

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
each pair of node is connected to each
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.479
each pair of node is connected to each
other and this actually kind of suggests

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
other and this actually kind of suggests
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.270
other and this actually kind of suggests
that perhaps that was a factor that had

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
that perhaps that was a factor that had
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.530
that perhaps that was a factor that had
as it's three arguments y1 y2 and x2

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
as it's three arguments y1 y2 and x2
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.840
as it's three arguments y1 y2 and x2
because in this case that I have to draw

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
because in this case that I have to draw
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.320
because in this case that I have to draw
an edge between y1 y2 an edge between y1

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
an edge between y1 y2 an edge between y1
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.780
an edge between y1 y2 an edge between y1
and x2 and another edge between y2 and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
and x2 and another edge between y2 and
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.469
and x2 and another edge between y2 and
x2 but in fact in my actual model all I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
x2 but in fact in my actual model all I
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.760
x2 but in fact in my actual model all I
had was three factors one between y1 and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
had was three factors one between y1 and
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.270
had was three factors one between y1 and
y2 another one between y2 and x2 and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
y2 another one between y2 and x2 and
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.410
y2 another one between y2 and x2 and
another one between y1 and x2 and you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
another one between y1 and x2 and you
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.929
another one between y1 and x2 and you
know in some sense it's as if I had just

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
know in some sense it's as if I had just
 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.020
know in some sense it's as if I had just
a single factor which was the product so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
a single factor which was the product so
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270
a single factor which was the product so
a single factor between y1 y2 and x2

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
a single factor between y1 y2 and x2
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060
a single factor between y1 y2 and x2
where I which was the product of my

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
where I which was the product of my
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.660
where I which was the product of my
simpler factor y1 and y2 times the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
simpler factor y1 and y2 times the
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.080
simpler factor y1 and y2 times the
factor between y2 and x2 times the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
factor between y2 and x2 times the
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.660
factor between y2 and x2 times the
factor between y1 and x2 but what if I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
factor between y1 and x2 but what if I
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580
factor between y1 and x2 but what if I
had a model with actually had a factor

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
had a model with actually had a factor
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319
had a model with actually had a factor
between these three random variables

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
between these three random variables
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.859
between these three random variables
that was more complicated it's actually

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869
that was more complicated it's actually
 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.389
that was more complicated it's actually
they would they sort of correspond to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
they would they sort of correspond to
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.470
they would they sort of correspond to
different models one which is a bit more

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
different models one which is a bit more
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.730
different models one which is a bit more
complicated can

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
complicated can
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.310
complicated can
more sophisticated interactions between

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320
more sophisticated interactions between
 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200
more sophisticated interactions between
these three random variables and the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210
these three random variables and the
 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.240
these three random variables and the
other one which just assumes that you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
other one which just assumes that you
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.410
other one which just assumes that you
know the way I'm going to model

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
know the way I'm going to model
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.150
know the way I'm going to model
preferences between the values of these

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160
preferences between the values of these
 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.400
preferences between the values of these
three random variables is as a product

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
three random variables is as a product
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.260
three random variables is as a product
of preferences between pairs of

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270
of preferences between pairs of
 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.720
of preferences between pairs of
variables and so what we'll see is that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
variables and so what we'll see is that
 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.000
variables and so what we'll see is that
there's another type of graphical

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
there's another type of graphical
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.800
there's another type of graphical
visualization which is going to allow us

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
visualization which is going to allow us
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.590
visualization which is going to allow us
to distinguish between these two cases

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600
 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.940
so this visualization is known as a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
so this visualization is known as a
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.970
so this visualization is known as a
factor graph and the idea is that we're

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
factor graph and the idea is that we're
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.340
factor graph and the idea is that we're
actually going to add nodes in our graph

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350
actually going to add nodes in our graph
 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.270
actually going to add nodes in our graph
that corresponds to the factors so in

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280
that corresponds to the factors so in
 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.280
that corresponds to the factors so in
our conditional random field which is a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290
our conditional random field which is a
 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410
our conditional random field which is a
linear chain and as a context window of

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420
linear chain and as a context window of
 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.230
linear chain and as a context window of
radius 1 this will correspond to that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240
radius 1 this will correspond to that
 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.030
radius 1 this will correspond to that
this factor craft

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
this factor craft
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.630
this factor craft
so usually factors we illustrate them as

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
so usually factors we illustrate them as
 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.290
so usually factors we illustrate them as
a little square like this and now each

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
a little square like this and now each
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.120
a little square like this and now each
square corresponds to a factor in my

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130
square corresponds to a factor in my
 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.620
square corresponds to a factor in my
product of factors form of my

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630
product of factors form of my
 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.730
product of factors form of my
conditional random field and now each

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740
conditional random field and now each
 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.860
conditional random field and now each
factor node is going to be connected to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870
factor node is going to be connected to
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.110
factor node is going to be connected to
its argument to the random variables

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
its argument to the random variables
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.780
its argument to the random variables
that are correspond to arguments of the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790
that are correspond to arguments of the
 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.910
that are correspond to arguments of the
factor so for instance we have this

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920
factor so for instance we have this
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.190
factor so for instance we have this
factor here and it's connected to Y 3

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200
factor here and it's connected to Y 3
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.450
factor here and it's connected to Y 3
and X 3 because in the factor which is

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460
and X 3 because in the factor which is
 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.320
and X 3 because in the factor which is
this it depends on X 3 and it depends on

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330
this it depends on X 3 and it depends on
 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.900
this it depends on X 3 and it depends on
Y 3 similarly I'm gonna have this factor

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
Y 3 similarly I'm gonna have this factor
 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.880
Y 3 similarly I'm gonna have this factor
here and it's going to be connected to X

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890
here and it's going to be connected to X
 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.150
here and it's going to be connected to X
2 and Y through Y sorry X 2 and Y 3

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
2 and Y through Y sorry X 2 and Y 3
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.370
2 and Y through Y sorry X 2 and Y 3
because again it's a factor that depends

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
because again it's a factor that depends
 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.700
because again it's a factor that depends
on X 2 in 1 3 and so on say for this

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710
on X 2 in 1 3 and so on say for this
 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.670
on X 2 in 1 3 and so on say for this
factor and also I have a pairwise factor

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
factor and also I have a pairwise factor
 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.450
factor and also I have a pairwise factor
here which is here which is connected to

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460
here which is here which is connected to
 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.870
here which is here which is connected to
y3 and y4 because it expresses a

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
y3 and y4 because it expresses a
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.350
y3 and y4 because it expresses a
preference over the joint value of y3

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360
preference over the joint value of y3
 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.560
preference over the joint value of y3
and y4 now the reason why this is less

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570
and y4 now the reason why this is less
 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.030
and y4 now the reason why this is less
ambiguous is because now we explicitly

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040
ambiguous is because now we explicitly
 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.270
ambiguous is because now we explicitly
have the factors illustrated in our

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280
have the factors illustrated in our
 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.550
have the factors illustrated in our
visualization so consider this very

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560
visualization so consider this very
 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.370
visualization so consider this very
simple example where I have this Markov

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380
simple example where I have this Markov
 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.350
simple example where I have this Markov
network

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
network
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.659
network
corresponds to three variables each

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669
corresponds to three variables each
 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.429
corresponds to three variables each
connected to each other like we've

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439
connected to each other like we've
 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.379
connected to each other like we've
discussed before well in this case we

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389
discussed before well in this case we
 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.959
discussed before well in this case we
don't really know whether it's it's

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:35.969
don't really know whether it's it's
 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.140
don't really know whether it's it's
actually a model where we have three

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150
actually a model where we have three
 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.360
actually a model where we have three
factors that are over pairs or just a

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370
factors that are over pairs or just a
 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.980
factors that are over pairs or just a
single factor over three variables

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990
single factor over three variables
 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.490
single factor over three variables
however given this factor graph well if

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500
however given this factor graph well if
 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.040
however given this factor graph well if
I was to draw to infer what is the mark

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050
I was to draw to infer what is the mark
 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.929
I was to draw to infer what is the mark
of network visualization based on that

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939
of network visualization based on that
 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.170
of network visualization based on that
factor graph well I'd have to draw an

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
factor graph well I'd have to draw an
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.059
factor graph well I'd have to draw an
edge between this node and this node

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069
edge between this node and this node
 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.469
edge between this node and this node
because there's this factor that

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479
because there's this factor that
 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.749
because there's this factor that
connects them so this there's one factor

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759
connects them so this there's one factor
 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.990
connects them so this there's one factor
that involves the two of them same thing

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000
that involves the two of them same thing
 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.119
that involves the two of them same thing
because at if this factor I need to draw

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129
because at if this factor I need to draw
 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.980
because at if this factor I need to draw
an edge in the Mac mark up network

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990
an edge in the Mac mark up network
 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.930
an edge in the Mac mark up network
varies between these two variables and

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940
varies between these two variables and
 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.119
varies between these two variables and
similarly for that factor I'd get an

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129
similarly for that factor I'd get an
 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.089
similarly for that factor I'd get an
edge here and we see that also this

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099
edge here and we see that also this
 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.850
edge here and we see that also this
factor graph with a single factor will

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860
factor graph with a single factor will
 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.180
factor graph with a single factor will
actually correspond to the same mark up

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190
actually correspond to the same mark up
 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.360
actually correspond to the same mark up
network so while going from factor graph

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370
network so while going from factor graph
 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.499
network so while going from factor graph
to mark up network is well defined

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509
to mark up network is well defined
 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.119
to mark up network is well defined
inferring from a mark of network what is

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129
inferring from a mark of network what is
 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.279
inferring from a mark of network what is
the factor graph is actually ambiguous

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289
the factor graph is actually ambiguous
 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.890
the factor graph is actually ambiguous
so that's not a well-defined operation

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900
so that's not a well-defined operation
 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.409
so that's not a well-defined operation
so we've lost less information by

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419
so we've lost less information by
 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.990
so we've lost less information by
drawing so or we're providing more

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000
drawing so or we're providing more
 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.540
drawing so or we're providing more
information by drawing the factor graph

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550
information by drawing the factor graph
 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.909
information by drawing the factor graph
as opposed to drawing the mark of

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919
as opposed to drawing the mark of
 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.070
as opposed to drawing the mark of
network there's still some advantage in

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080
network there's still some advantage in
 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.409
network there's still some advantage in
the mark of network it's kind of more

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419
the mark of network it's kind of more
 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.629
the mark of network it's kind of more
intuitive and easier to infer the

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639
intuitive and easier to infer the
 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.339
intuitive and easier to infer the
conditional independencies like we've

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349
conditional independencies like we've
 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.230
conditional independencies like we've
done before though we could extend that

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240
done before though we could extend that
 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.010
done before though we could extend that
logic to factor factor graphs but in all

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020
logic to factor factor graphs but in all
 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.769
logic to factor factor graphs but in all
cases when the information about the

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:03.779
cases when the information about the
 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.570
cases when the information about the
factors is not as much important and

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580
factors is not as much important and
 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.700
factors is not as much important and
we're more concerned about showing the

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710
we're more concerned about showing the
 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.860
we're more concerned about showing the
Independence's or dependencies between

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870
Independence's or dependencies between
 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.959
Independence's or dependencies between
the variable often we'll favor

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969
the variable often we'll favor
 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.209
the variable often we'll favor
drawing a mark of network but if the

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219
drawing a mark of network but if the
 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.010
drawing a mark of network but if the
actual information about the factors is

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020
actual information about the factors is
 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.839
actual information about the factors is
important then we'll want to use a

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849
important then we'll want to use a
 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.570
important then we'll want to use a
factor graph all right so this covers

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580
factor graph all right so this covers
 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.629
factor graph all right so this covers
the the second type of visualization for

the the second type of visualization for
 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.519
