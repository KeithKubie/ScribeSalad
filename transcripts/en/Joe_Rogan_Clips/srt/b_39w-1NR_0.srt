1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,510
A skill for skill, ability
for ability. I think he,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,980
if he's not the best of all time,
it's him and fade or no. And then the,

3
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:10,380
you always have to mention Verdomme cause
even though Steve Bay knocked for doom

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:13,890
out in the first round for
Dumas submitted, the best
of the best is submitted.

5
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:18,270
Minataro he submitted fade or he
submitted Kaine. I mean what the fuck?

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,990
I mean that that guy is just for doing it.
Volumes record it.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,980
If you just look at who he's fine,
he's fine. He's the best. Yeah,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,980
I in my opinion and for how long
he's been around. But it's like,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,670
but when did he beat those guys?
Like when did he be those guys?

10
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,190
Did he beat those?

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,190
Like when you beat fade or fader was as
close to his prime as you can get when

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,210
you know, like it's hard to say
like the Brett Rogers fight,

13
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:45,470
a lot of people were saying he wasn't
as focused for the Brett Rogers. Right.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,870
But he's still knocked him out with one
punch. Remember that crazy fucking chaos.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,120
Anytime you gotta be ready for fatal.
Yeah.

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,920
But Verdomme handled him, you know, on
the ground and submitted them. You know,

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,770
I would have loved to seen what
it was like in pride if you,

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,160
he could fight him when fade war was
at his peak click back when he beat

19
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:06,420
Minataro. Yeah. But for doom,
you know, he's, he's overlooked.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,350
And that argument of WHO's the best and
in terms of like accomplishments as a

21
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,184
UFC fighter,

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,670
well it's steep a cause Steve plays the
only guy to defend the title four times

23
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,820
and it really kind of bums me out that
he's out of the conversation right now.

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,220
You don't hear about a Steve Bay fight.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,040
I mean he's like a two in which I feel
like he should get more attention for

26
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,180
this and he's just a normal guy.

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,510
Like he has a full time job
where he's a firefighter.

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
Like I feel like more people should
resonate with them because of that. Yeah.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,890
But they don't,
I don't use a fucking great,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,210
it's kind of be an asshole
to get attention these
days. I don't know. I mean,

31
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:41,100
I feel like if he had beaten DC
and you know, I mean beat Francis,

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,060
that was a big fight because Francis came
into that fight with a lot of hype and

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,390
asked the Overeem knockout.
Steve Bay fought like a fucking champion,

34
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:51,660
have really fought like a champion.
Smart. And he showed Francis and look,

35
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,650
Francis fought after that.

36
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:56,160
He was not the same thing when he fought
after then he fought Derrick Lewis.

37
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:58,470
You could see he was still throwing up.

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,580
He was still fucked up from that last
fight and he admitted it to his credit,

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,300
you know,

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,630
and he bounced back with the Curtis
blades fight and look fantastic in that

41
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:10,240
bigger firm. Cause blades is awesome.
Wrestler. Exactly. Clip blades.

42
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,760
Blades is a very athletic wrestler. He's
huge. He's big, he's fast, he's powerful.

43
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,600
And you know, and that's twice Francis
is beaten him twice. He stopped him.

44
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,290
That was his first UFC fight. So, um,

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,160
he stopped them then and they
stopped him in this one as well.

46
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:27,180
So coming into this fight
with Kane, you know, there's,

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,720
there's a lot of questions we haven't
seen Kane in two years, right.

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,170
It's been about two years. Yeah.
It may be even longer. Let's say,

49
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,570
when was the last time came to
Alaska? It's flat time. Yeah.

50
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,490
I think you might be right.
I think it might be three years.

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,680
It's been a while raise. I know, but when,

52
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,310
when he was at the top of the food chain,
when Kane was at the top,

53
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:48,120
he would put a fucking storm on these
people that was just like a hundred year

54
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,340
storm. That would never end.
It's like, how is this guy
have this kind of intimacy,

55
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,200
Purdue to do that to him now?
And the city was crazy.

56
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,150
I thought it'd be the other
way around. Yeah. It was crazy.

57
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:01,900
And just see came tired. So
here we go. 2016 yeah. July 9th.

58
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,350
So two and a half years. Yeah, almost.
Yeah. And that was Travis Brown,

59
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,520
which is just a phenomenal beating.
Um,

60
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,410
and that was a UFC 200 yeah.

61
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,340
And they did the junior dos Santos one
and the one before that was a year,

62
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,130
you know,
so he's like Fabricio been active.

63
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,510
Well he had children 2013 look
at those gaps. Yup. Yup. Dang.

64
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,130
Two year gaps. Yep. Two year
gaps. One year, two year again.

65
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,350
That's rough man. Yeah,
it is. It is rough.

66
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,590
Especially when this is your job and how
you get paid. Fuck yeah. Right. Yeah.

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,020
Lucky's a heavyweight and they get taken
care of a little more. But yeah. Yeah.

68
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:41,320
I mean it's just,
I wonder how,

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,890
how much you could fix all that
stuff that's going on in the spine.

70
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,980
You know what I mean? It's one thing
if a guy gets a knee, you know,

71
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:51,960
he's got a ACL or something like that,
you know, they can come back from that.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,590
That's 100% possible.

73
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,310
But back stuff is weird once it
seems like once things start going,

74
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,340
it's like you like a car,
you know,

75
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,060
once a ball joint blows out and the acts
will start grinding and you're like,

76
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,850
God, Jesus, it's like a bunch
of Shits gonna go wrong.

77
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,440
Something that that's like your
core. Yeah. At his best man.

78
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,440
He was fucking terrifying.
Yeah. Cause it just,

79
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,630
I'd never saw a heavyweight
with that kind of endurance.

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,270
Now I remember being so scared
of Cain Velasquez and I was like,

81
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,640
I think I talked about this last time in
your podcast when I was a kid wrestling

82
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:25,060
in college, cause I was like this
tiny ass little white boy wrestler.

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,690
And Kate would walk around with justice
singlet straps on his shorts and he had

84
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:30,850
brown pipe,
brown pride tattooed across his chest.

85
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,700
He's just huge heavyweight
wrestling d one for Asu.

86
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,610
I was just like so scared of that guys.
Like, Damn, look at that guy, man.

87
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,130
Just walking around like wandering.
Probably rip my head off,

88
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:42,610
has brown pride tattooed on his chest,
just wearing just a singlet straps.

89
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:47,260
Just huge. It's funny. Yeah, I remember
him forever, man. Well, you know,

90
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,430
him and DC,

91
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:52,840
having that kind of a relationship is
such a unique situation for the two

92
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:55,060
fighters that they have.
You know,

93
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,920
another elite guy that's their size
and they just smash each other left and

94
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:03,080
right and work with each other. That's
what I tried to create wherever I go. Um,

95
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,680
and that's what we're doing in southern
California. I know one or two let, uh,

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,850
and Picos a cubs Swanson's we're trying
to build a room of the smaller guys that

97
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,030
we can, but we're a lot, we don't
want to kill each other. Right.

98
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,550
And that's something that we,
I've always had to control myself.

99
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,650
I've always gone really hard and something
that I've had to learn to control. Um,

100
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,400
but having that room full of killers so
that when we go to wrestling practice,

101
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,230
like you don't know if you're
going to have a good practice.

102
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,740
You might be getting beat up on that day
when you go home and be all pissed off.

103
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,710
Like, shit, I had a bad practice,
I got taken down with this.

104
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,510
But that's what makes you
better for the next practice.

105
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,640
If you just go to practice and
beat up on everyone every day,

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,370
you're never going to know
what you need to change,

107
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,410
what you need to get better
at. So I think that's why, uh,

108
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,240
Canaan and DC have gotten so good so
quick at MMA that each other to build off

109
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:47,080
of, you know, and see if you can survive
it. Yeah. If you survive it. Yeah.

110
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,300
And you know,
like the knock on Aka,

111
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,120
some people said they trained too
hard cause they're always injured.

112
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,380
But look at the amount of
champions they produced.

113
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,760
Look at the amount of fucking killers
that had come out of there. Luke Rockhold,

114
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,080
DC cane, Khabib. I mean,
get the fuck out of here.

115
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:07,910
That place is a den of assassins. You can
survive it, right? Yeah. Perfect. I mean,

116
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,880
yeah, I mean that's the
only way, man. I mean, look,

117
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:15,470
it's not good to spar full clip like old
school lions den days where they used

118
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,930
to beat the shit out of each of
the or the military days. I mean,

119
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,040
nobody knew a thing back then.
They didn't know the consequences.

120
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,090
They didn't know what it's like.
