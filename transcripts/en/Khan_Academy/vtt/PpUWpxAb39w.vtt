00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.479
Let's attempt another
surface integral,

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:04.270
and I've changed the
notation a little bit.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.660
Instead of writing the
surface as a capital sigma,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.610
I've written it as a capital S.
Instead of writing d lowercase

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.770
sigma, I wrote d uppercase
S, which is still

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.797
a surface integral
of the function y.

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.130
And the surface we care about
is x plus y squared mins z

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:16.713
is equal to 0.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.390
X between 0 and 1,
y between 0 and 2.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.860
Now, this one might be a
little bit more straightforward

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.970
than the last one we
did, or at least I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.370
hope it's a little bit more
straightforward, because we

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.190
can explicitly define
z in terms of x and y.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.940
And actually we can
even explicitly define

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.520
x in terms of y and z.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.780
But I'll do it the other way.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.860
It's a little bit easier
for me to visualize.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.000
So if you add z to both sides of
this equation right over here,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.454
you get x plus y
squared is equal to z,

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:46.870
or z is equal to
x plus y squared.

00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:51.760
And this is actually
pretty straightforward.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.360
this surface is pretty
easy to visualize,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.050
or we can give our best
attempt at visualizing it.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.580
So if that is our z-axis,
and that is our x-axis,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.490
and that is the y-axis,
we care about the region

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.690
x between 0 and 1.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.690
So maybe this is x equals
1, and y between 0 and 2.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.050
So let's say this is 1,
this is 2 in the y area.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.620
So we essentially care
about the surface over this,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.112
over this region
of the xy plane.

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:28.320
And then we can think about
what the surface actually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.620
looks like.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.578
This isn't the surface.

00:01:29.578 --> 00:01:32.850
This is just kind of the range
of x's and y's that we actually

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.920
care about.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.590
And so let's think
about the surface.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.870
When x and y are 0, z is 0.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.467
So we're going to
be sitting-- let

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.300
me do this in a-- let
me do this in green. z

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.120
is going to be right over there.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.530
And now as y increases, or
if when x is equal to 0,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590
if we're just talking
about the zy plane,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.270
z is going to be
equal to y squared.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.860
So this might be
z is equal to 4.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.510
This is z is equal to 2, 1, 3.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.120
So z is going to do
something like this.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.740
It's going to be a
parabola in the zy plane.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.550
It's going to look
something like that.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.790
Now, when y is equal to
0, z is just equal to x.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.080
So as x goes to 1,
z will also go to 1.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.240
So z will go like this.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.160
The scales of the axes aren't--
they are not drawn to scale.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.720
The z is a little
bit more compressed

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.100
than the x or y the
way I've drawn them.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.230
And then from this
point right over here,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.020
you add the y squared.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.110
And so you get
something that looks--

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.540
so this is this point there.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.610
And then this point, when y is
equal to 2 and x is equal to 1,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.845
you have z is equal to 5.

00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:46.470
It's going to look
something like this.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.460
And then you're going to have
a straight line like that,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.010
at this point, is
right over there.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.170
And this surface is the surface
that we are going to take,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.450
or the surface over which we're
going to evaluate the surface

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.250
integral of the function y.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.320
And so one way you
could think about it,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.900
y could be maybe the mass
density of this surface.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.800
And so when you multiply
y times each dS,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.890
you're essentially figuring out
the mass of that little chunk,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.769
and then you're figuring out
the mass of this entire surface.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.060
And so one way you could
imagine as we go more and more

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.430
in that direction
as y is increasing,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.180
this thing is getting
more and more dense.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.450
So this part of the
surface is more dense

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.540
than as y becomes
lower and lower.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.570
And then that would
actually give us the mass.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.000
With that out of the way,
let's actually evaluate it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.590
And so, as you
know, the first step

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.444
is to figure out
a parametrization.

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:46.110
And it should be
pretty straightforward,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.520
because we can write z
explicitly in terms of x and y.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.980
And so we can actually use x
and y as the actual parameters,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.070
or if we want to just substitute
it with different parameters,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.950
we could.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.330
But let me-- so let's just
write-- let me do that.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.860
So let me just write x is equal
to-- and in the spirit of using

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.840
different notation, instead
of using s and t, I'll use u

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.950
and v. X is equal to u,
let's say y is equal to v,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.596
and then z is going to be
equal to u plus v squared.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.180
And so our surface, written
as a vector position function

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.050
or position vector
function, our surface,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.000
we can write it as
r, which is going

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.230
to be a function of
u and v. And it's

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:46.960
going to be equal to ui plus
vj plus u plus v squared k.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.440
And then u is going
to be between 0 and 1,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.410
because x is just equal
to u or u is equal to x.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.010
So u is going to
be between 0 and 1.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.862
And then v is going
to be between 0 and 2.

00:05:01.862 --> 00:05:03.070
I'm going to leave you there.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.390
In the next video,
we'll actually

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.050
set up the surface
integral now that we

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.400
have the parametrization done.
