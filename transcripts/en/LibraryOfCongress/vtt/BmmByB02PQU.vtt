00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.540
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.510
&gt;&gt; Emilio Garcia-Ruiz: Without
further adieu, Alejandro Danois.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:19.610
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.910
&gt;&gt; Alejandro Danois:
Thank you, Emilio,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120
for that awesome introduction.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.600
That gentleman's name was
Gary D Howard who was working

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.350
at the Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel at the time.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.680 position:56%
And that was a really pivotal moment
for me when I ran down the escalator

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.980
to talk to him, because he asked
me, can you do that every time?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.740
And I said, does a bear
defecate in the woods?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.340
Yes, I can.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.640
So that's awesome.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.630
I didn't know anyone else knew that
story, that he shared that story.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.610
So Emilio, thanks for bringing
back some awesome memories.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.750
The Boys of Dunbar was a
10-year passion project for me.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.120
I'll give you a little
bit of background of,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.670
you know, how this thing started.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.020
Initially, it was a magazine
story idea that I sent

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.950
to a very prominent magazine.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.190
I sent a two to three
paragraph pitch to a gentleman,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.070
and he got back to me and
said, I really like this,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.190
but we're not going to use it,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.650
because I think you have
something so much bigger here.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.550
And he put me in touch with
some people who were veterans

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.520
of the publishing industry.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.100
And they said, wow, this
is a wonderful idea,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.200
are you up to taking a two to
three paragraph magazine proposal

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.010
and turning it into an
80-page book proposal?

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.440
And so from there, was
just off and running.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.320
The seeds of this story were
planted way back in 1982 for me.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.100
And this was around the time

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.130
that this team was accomplishing
some magnificent things

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.110
on the basketball court.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.920
I grew up in Brooklyn, New York,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.550
and there was a basketball court
directly behind my building.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.490
And we were basketball
enthusiasts, junkies, morons,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.080
whatever you want to call it.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.390
We were out there every day.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.750
If it was snowing, we
were shoveling snow.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.230
We not only played but
we debated and we argued,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.960
everything that's basketball
related.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.610
And for people in here that
are familiar with folks

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.630
from New York City, we were
loud, we were arrogant,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.740
and we thought we knew everything.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.150
So we're 12 years old, and we're
talking about our favorite players

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.660
from New York, and why New
York is the king of basketball.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.800
So we're talking about Bernard
King for the New York Knicks

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.190
who was our favorite
player at the time.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.170
We're talking about Julius
Erving, the Great Doctor Jay was

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.420
from Long Island, who we loved.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.630
Tiny Archibald, the only player
to ever lead the NBA in assists

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.830
and scoring in the same year.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.960
Guys by the name of World be Free,
Vinnie the Microwave Johnson.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.290
We're even going back to Bob Cousy,
the Great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.590
If you were lucky enough,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.790
you saw him wondering the
halls, he's here today.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.580
And we're talking about
all these players,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.910
and they are older neighborhood
superheroes that we're watching

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.890
and we're seeing play in these
great playground tournaments.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.620
There was a guy in
high school by the name

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.840
of Chris Mullen, who was awesome.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.300
We loved Chris Mullen.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.970
Our personal hero was a guy by the
name of Duane the Pearl Washington,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.730
who was significant in
turning the Big East Conference

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.090
in Syracuse University basketball

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.240
into the phenomenon
that it later became.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.890
There was a guy by the
name of Walter Berry,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.790
who went on to become the National
Player of the Year at St. John's,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.520
leading them to the Final Four.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.500
These were guys we saw around
the neighborhood and playing.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.430
And there were other guys our
own age who we're hearing about.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.440
There was a guy by the
name of Kenny Anderson,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.150
and we called him Kenny the Kid,
or Kenny Ice, who was tearing

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.180 position:56%
up the youth playground tournaments.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.690 position:56%
There was a guy by the name of Malik
Sealy, the great late Malik Sealy.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.750
And all of these other players.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.970
We heard about these brothers

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.830
in Coney Island called the Marbury
Brothers, Norman and Jou-Jou,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.460
and a bunch of other ones.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.580
And little did we know that their
younger brother, Stephon Marbury,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.860
would go on to surpass them all.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.380
And so we're having
this conversation

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.360 position:56%
about how great New York is, and
there's an older gentleman who lives

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.670
in my building, and he was
probably in his young 20s.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.320
He was an excellent
playground basketball player

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.810
and we used to go watch him play.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.100
And he said, yeah, New York's
the king of basketball,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.480
but the greatest team I ever
saw was a high school team

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.680
from Baltimore called Dunbar.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.270
And so we're watching the
Philadelphia 76ers and Doctor Jay

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.380
and Larry Bird with the Celtics
and Magic Johnson with the Lakers.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.910
And we said, wait a minute,

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.040
the greatest team you ever saw is
a high school team from Baltimore?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.020
And he goes on to explain, every
player on the bench is going

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.470
to play Division I basketball.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.340
They have the number one high
school player in the country

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.100
by the name of Reggie Williams.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.840
Wait till you get a chance
to see him in college.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.350
He's six foot seven.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.130
He can play every position
on the floor.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.430
He can block shots.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.730
He can rebound.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.030
He can shoot jump shots.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.330
He can pass.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.630
He's marvelous.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.930
He's unbelievable.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.130
But the crazy thing is, he's
not even the best player

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.980
on his own team.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.010
So we're scratching our
head and saying, okay,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.570
the number one high school player

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.810 position:56%
in the country is not even the best
player on his own team, yeah, right.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.110
So who is the best player?

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.800
And he said, you're not
going to believe me.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.370
Come on, man, who is
the best player?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.610
He says, all right, the best
player is a five-foot midget,

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.760
and his name is Muggsy.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.060
He called him Muggsy.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.950
And we thought he was lying.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.250
We thought he was playing with us.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.750
A couple of years later,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.630
I'm watching this innovative
cable network with the idea

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.160
of 24-hour sports programming
called ESPN.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.590
And I'm watching a Wake Forest
University basketball game,

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.600
and I see a 5'3 athletic marvel
unlike anything I've ever seen

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.210 position:56%
before by the name of Muggsy Bogues.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.860
And I screamed to no one in
particular, that's Muggsy.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.550
And so I was in prep school
in Massachusetts at the time.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.450
And there was a player by
the name of Reggie Lewis

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.930
at Northeastern University, who
was phenomenal, unbelievable,

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.580
tearing up the college
basketball scene.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.450
And I heard that he couldn't even
start for his own high school team.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.840
So I did a little digging,
a little bit of research,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.980
and found out that he
attended Dunbar High School

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.180
with this guy named Muggsy Bogues.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.490
And so the light bulb went on and
I started to think about this team.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.490
Reggie Williams and David Wingate
were at Georgetown University

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:11.460
at the time, at the apex of the
phenomenon known as Hoya Paranoia.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.430
They delivered John Thompson's
only national championship.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.400
And Reggie Williams as a
freshman at Georgetown,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.380
was the most valuable player,
the most outstanding player

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.460 position:56%
in the Final Four when they defeated
an incredibly talented Phi Slama

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.130
Jama team from the University of
Houston that featured future Hall

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:37.640
of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde
Drexler, and a number of others.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.300
Reggie had 19 points and seven
rebounds in the final game.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.620
And to think that the year before,
this guy was in high school,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.510
just boggles the mind and tells
you how exceptional he was.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.760
And so this idea had been
marinating for a while,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.440
and then we fast-forward
to me merging my passion

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.790
for the written word with
sports, and deciding,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.860
I'm going to tell this story.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.890
And we rewind to the magazine
pitch, to stretching it

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.120
out to become a book proposal.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.650 position:56%
And the long story short version is,

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.980
spending 10 years putting
this story together.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.930
And I initially thought
I was embarking

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.190
on a basketball story, right.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.130
Story of perhaps the greatest high
school basketball team of all time.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.450
This is the story that
I'm going to tell.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.810
And so I buried myself
in the archive rooms

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.770
at the Enoch Pratt main library
in Baltimore on Cathedral Street.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.710
And I said, I have to find
out what was going on.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.330
I have to look at these games.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.080
I had to see who did what.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.940
Put that together.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.500 position:56%
But I also said, I need to read the
newspaper from front to back to find

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.320
out what was going on at the time.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.260
And so it wasn't until I actually
started reading what was going

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.180
on in the city and around
the country that I realized,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.460
this is a basketball story that's
not even about basketball at all.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.330
And so we look at what was
going on in the early 1980s

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.240
in Baltimore at the time.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.680
And we found this once proud
city really struggling.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.440
And there were some forces
that were really laying siege

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.900
to this once proud community.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.860
Through the head coach Bob
Wade, we kind of get the story

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.500
of his parents being part of
this great northern migration.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.290
They were from a very
small town called Dillwyn,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.780
Virginia, down South.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.940
And as we know, the agrarian
economy had ground to a halt.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.680
And a lot of African-American
people were in search

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.360
of the so-called promised land.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.160
And Bob Wade's parents were
emblematic of the people

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.540
who left the tobacco fields and
the cotton fields down South

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.430
in search of the promised land.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.700
And Baltimore happened to be
one of those promised lands.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:16.250
Because due to the World War II
economy, they had iron foundries

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:22.530 position:56%
and steel mills, the great Bethlehem
Steel complex, car factories.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.610
They were hiring people
for three shifts a day.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.920
You didn't have to have
a high level of education

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.750
in order to get a job there.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.410 position:56%
And the economic prospects were so
much better in cities like Baltimore

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.230
and other cities, that
people migrated to.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.080
So people were able to
get a decent union wage.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.880
And they were able
to purchase homes.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.230
And they used to scrub those marble
steps in front of those row homes

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.230
in East Baltimore with pride.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.240
And they dreamed of sending
their kids on to college

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.210
and having a better life
for them then they had.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:00.020
And so when we fast-forward now
to the early 1980s in Baltimore,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.170
where the book takes place,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:07.190
we find that there is the
loss of that union wage.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.670
The way that people were
accustomed to making a living

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.770
and dreaming was no
longer a reality.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.300
And so Bethlehem Steel, as
I found out as I was going

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.930
through the newspaper
archives of the Baltimore Sun

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.910
and the Baltimore News American,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.680
were laying people off
at an astounding rate.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.700
The General Motors plant
was laying off people.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.460
The iron foundries, the steel
mills, the jobs disappeared,

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.470
because the economy changed.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:42.760 position:56%
And within that, we also had the
onset of the plague of crack cocaine

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.460
at the same time, which
ravaged the community.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.730
Baltimore had long been a town that
was dominated by the heroin trade,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.390
and the drug business was
always big in Baltimore.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.610
But there was a very big
shift in the early '80s.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.790
There was a federal drug
task force that took out all

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.990
of the big-time kingpins
around the heroin trade.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.020
These guys were older businessmen.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.320
They were very smart.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.980
They kept it away from
schools, from the outdoors.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.760
The inventories were regulated.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.060
They ran it like a real business.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.960
When those guys got taken away,
some gentlemen filled the vacuum.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.730
And they realize that
there were loopholes

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.260
in the city's juvenile
justice system.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.690
And so what happened was, they
said, if an adult gets caught

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.090
with my stuff, I've got to pay
lawyer fees, they're going to go

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.990
to jail for 10 to 15 years.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.840
If a kid is younger than 18 and
he's caught selling my stuff,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.530
he's going to go to a
juvenile detention facility,

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.140
and the next day he's going to
be home with mom and grandma.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.760
So they started recruiting
teenagers into these drug armies.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.480 position:56%
They created this new business model
called the Open Air Drug Market,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.230
which ran 24 hours
a day for 20 years.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.550
And so when you have this army of
undisciplined young people fighting

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.460
over this business where the
profit margins are so astounding,

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.820 position:56%
you have teenagers with a stupefying
amount of semiautomatic weapons,

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.230
random gunfire, a destruction
of the community.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.500
And all of this stuff
happens around the time

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.160
with this great high school
basketball team comes together.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.700
You have the head coach Bob Wade,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.830
who was a product of
Dunbar High School.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.580
He grew up in East Baltimore.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.520
He himself was a product
of a single-parent home.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.140
And so he went on to get a college
scholarship to play football.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.490
Played in the National Football
League for the Washington Redskins,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.180
the Baltimore Colts,
the Denver Broncos,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.000
and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.080
But he was also cognizant
of the fact

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.350
that he had some wonderful mentors
and role models who helped him.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.510
And while he was in the
National Football League,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.960
he came back every summer to work
on his teaching certification.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.780
And his goal was to make an impact
on the young lives of athletes

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.730
in the same way that his
role models did for him.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.090
He was the valedictorian of
his graduating class at Dunbar.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.460 position:56%
His mother worked in a textile mill.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.170
And she always told
him, get your education,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.360
be serious about your degree,
I don't want you working

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.500
in a textile factory like me.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.580
And he took that responsibility
seriously.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:32.830
And so when he's the head coach at
Dunbar, and this team comes along,

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.560
he is adamant that they
are going to take care

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.880
of your academic responsibilities.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.320
And so he ran the program very much

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.820
like you see the elite
college programs run today.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.030
At the end of school,
practice did not start at 3:30,

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.490
study hall started at 3:30.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.090
He recruited teachers and
professionals from the community

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.490
to serve as mentors and tutors.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.830 position:56%
They would work with the kids around
their schedules, time management,

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.620
okay, you have a test coming
up on Tuesday, you have a quiz

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.440
in this class on Wednesday, you
have a paper due next Monday.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.600
And they helped them really
get an understanding of how

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.750
to handle the academic rigor that
they were going to need to abide

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.480
by when they got to college if
they were going to stay eligible.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.400
So sometimes practice didn't
start till 5:30, 6:00 at night,

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.470
until the last textbook got closed.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:31.130
And this was a time where
there weren't distinctions

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.640
on how long you could
run a practice.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.550
And so his practices were brutal.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.690
They practiced holding bricks,

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.450
because he could not
afford a fancy weight room.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.180
And we talk about the economics
of what was going on at the time

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.480
in the community, he would drive

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.560
around to these dilapidated
buildings and just pick

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.690
up these bricks and
wrap them in duct tape.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.190
And the guys would actually
practice their drills sometimes

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.700
with bricks in their hand.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.780
Sometimes a basketball
never got bounced

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.860
in a three-to-four-hour practice.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.620
They worked with sandbags, with
backpacks filled with sand,

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.110
that they ran around
with on their back.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.860
And the philosophy behind
that was, no team will be

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.630
in better condition then we are.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.260
So when you look at
Wade's story, and again,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.210
his family being emblematic of
that great northern migration,

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.240
now we look at this
collection of talent

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.080 position:56%
that we see on the basketball court.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.040
We mentioned Muggsy Bogues, the
five foot three athletic marvel

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.640
who could dominate a game
without scoring a point.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.990
I thought I knew everything there
was to know about basketball,

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:43.700
and when I saw him play, I did not
realize that that was possible.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.810
We have already seen a
reasonable facsimile of the person

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.320
that everyone thinks is the
greatest basketball player ever

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.620
in Michael Jordan.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.360
I think it's safe to say that
Kobe Bryant came pretty close

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.950
to being a reasonable
facsimile of Michael Jordan.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.750
I believe we will see 10 more
Michael Jordans before we see

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.420
another Muggsy Bogues.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.290
Because his talent was so rare.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:16.870
He was a one-man fast-break
defensive dynamo pressing machine

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.700
who could alter the
landscape of a game simply

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.580
with his leadership
in defensive pressure.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.010
We talked about Reggie Williams,
the number one high school player

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:32.090 position:56%
in the country, who won the
National Championship at Georgetown.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.440
David Wingate, whose
mother was paralyzed

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.820
and had never seen him
play a game of basketball

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.830
until his final high
school game championship

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.890
in the Baltimore Civic Center.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.060
8500 people, standing-room only.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.980
He says he wanted to
go to the University

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.230
of Maryland, that was his dream.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.290
And when John Thompson walked into
his living room, his mother said,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.950
you are going to play for this man.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.640
She knew nothing about basketball,
Patrick Ewing, Georgetown,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.380
you're going to play for this man.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:15.200
Reggie Lewis did not start for
the Dunbar Poets, and he goes on,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.920
let's think about this, to
become the best NBA player

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.500
out of all of them.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:28.820
He supplants Larry Bird, Hall of
Famer Larry Bird, as the captain

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:33.570
of this legendary Boston
Celtics franchise.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.370 position:56%
And unfortunately, passes away at
the age of 28 due to a heart defect.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.170
His mother had a heart
attack when she was 15.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.220
His brother was born with
a small hole in his heart,

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.030
had multiple open-heart surgeries.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.670
There was a medical history of
heart problems in his family.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.990
And very sad that Reggie
passes away at the age of 28.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:59.420
But he did not start for
this high school team.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.350
And so to think about what he
blossomed into and what he became,

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.610
the lazy narrative is that, man,
this guy wasn't even good enough

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.630
to start for his own
high school team.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.710
That's not true.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.010
Bob Wade said he thought
about starting him,

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.520
but there was the starting
center by the name of Tim Dawson,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.600
who went on to become the
Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Year

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.980
at George Washington University.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.980
He later transferred to
finish his college career

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.480
at the University of Miami.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.550 position:56%
Tim Dawson right now is probably the
most successful out of all of them.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:36.060
He went on to get a PhD and
was a principal at a number

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.550
of different school
systems in Florida

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.050
and Baltimore and in Maryland.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:47.090
And Tim Dawson was a very strong
physical basketball player.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:52.060
And he could block shots,
could jump out the rim.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.040
And when he slam dunked the ball,
he was trying to rip the rim down.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.010
So think about this from a
psychological perspective.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.270
You're getting your brains
beat in by 40 points.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.320
Tim Dawson is dunking all over you,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.060
grabbing every rebound,
blocking every shot.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.550
When he goes to the bench, the
other team takes a sigh of relief,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.860 position:56%
and says, whoo, now we got a chance.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:19.240
I comes Reggie Lewis,
and they get better.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.540
Unbelievable.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.460
It speaks to Bob Wade's acumen
and the psychology to be able

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:31.400 position:56%
to convince a player of that talent
to come off the bench and not start.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:38.200 position:56%
And so this team was not a team that
was recruited by some super scout.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.080
When we see these great prep
teams today like Oak Hill Academy,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.650
like Monteverdi Academy in Florida,
they're not only recruited from all

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.560
over the country, they're
recruited from all over the globe.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.170
Ben Simmons, the most recent
number one pick in the NBA draft.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.800
Phenomenal talent.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.100
Went to Monteverdi.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.210
He's from Australia.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:01.340 position:56%
The shooting guard on his Monteverdi
team was from Louisville, Kentucky.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.980
The point guard was from Florida.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.200
We'll never see a team like
this of young men that grew

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.900
up with each other, playing in
the back alleys on milk crates

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.100
when the older guys would
shoo them off the courts.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.380
They ate at the same dinner tables.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.650
They competed with and
against one another

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.940
at the neighborhood
recreation centers.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.340
They were in the Dunbar
gym as little children.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.580
They knew all the cheers.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.880
They knew all of the fight songs.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.380
And they were just little
kids excited to be part

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.470
of this great institution,
because Dunbar,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.040
like the very strong
African-American churches

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.650
in Baltimore that played such a
pivotal role in the community,

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.920
Dunbar was similar to those
other revered institutions.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.030
So Muggsy and Reggie
Williams were the best

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.040
of friends from a very early age.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.220
They were nicknamed Mutt and Jeff.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.520
Because out of a 24-hour day,
they spent 16 of them together.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.450
Reggie was tall and skinny.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.400
Muggsy was short and squat.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.080
But you always found them together.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.280
No one knew what type
of potential they had.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.510
They were riding their
rollerskates together.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.250 position:56%
They were playing baseball together.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.180 position:56%
They were playing football together.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.550 position:56%
They were at the local recreation
center, playing checkers and dancing

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.310
and listening to music, doing
arts and crafts activities.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.270
Before they even showed a
hint of athletic potential,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.400
these guys were cohesive.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.650
And when people saw the embryonic
relationship that they had

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.970
on a basketball court, Muggsy could
come, look away from the basket,

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.410
throw an underhand alley-oop.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.820
Everybody would say, what
in the world did he just do?

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.020
Reggie would come flying
out of nowhere,

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.770
grab it, slam it through the rim.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.420
People would run out of the stands.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.610
They'd never seen anything
like that before.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.970
And they could do that
and communicate

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.740
with one another without
saying a word.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.580
Because from the age of five,
six, and seven years old,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.290
they had this relationship.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:11.760
So it really is a basketball
story that's not about basketball.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.220
It's about community.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.520
It's about love.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.820
It's about mentorship.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.300
It's about family.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:24.350 position:56%
And it really is about how this team
that created this majestic sense

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.190
of artwork through this
sport of basketball

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.500
on a basketball court gave
a struggling community hope.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.160
Because people were being laid off.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.040
You had the drugs really
decimating the community.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.630
And for those two hours that
you were in that Dunbar gym,

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.460
it was the cheapest entertainment
ticket in town, you could forget

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.920
that you didn't know how you
were going to pay the rent.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.020
You could forget that
the Baltimore gas

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.550
and electric bill had
a turnoff notice.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:57.100
You could forget what drugs
were doing to the family.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.910
You could forget that you didn't
have any food in the fridge

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.280
and you didn't know how you
were going to get groceries.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.220
And for those two hours,
you were part of a show,

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.330
and they made you smile, and
they made you feel magnificent,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:17.230
and they gave you hope that
something good could happen.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.900
So I know we only have a few
minutes left, and I did want

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.100
to open the floor up
to some questions.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.570
So how does it work?

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.510
We go back to a microphone
and ask a question?

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:44.060
[ Silence ]

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.660
&gt;&gt; Excellent presentation.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.960
Really enjoyed it.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.510
&gt;&gt; Did any of the players
come back to Baltimore to try

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:57.510
and make it a better place
after their basketball career?

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.890
&gt;&gt; Well, the funny thing is
when you look at the trajectory

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.640
of these guys, even
the guys that went

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.010
on to the NBA, they became coaches.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.170
And so maybe not necessarily
coming back to Baltimore.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.900
There actually is the
young men considered one

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.670 position:56%
of the greatest coaches in the
country right now in the prep level,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:21.480
probably the best coach in
the region, is a young man

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.550
by the name of Herman Tree Harried.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.470
He was nicknamed Helicopter,
for folks that are fans

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.380
of Syracuse University teams, with
Derek Coleman and Pearl Washington

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.410
and Rony Seikaly and those guys.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.660
He came back and he's the
coach at Lake Clifton now.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.340
And has coached some
excellent teams.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.270
Muggsy went on to become
the head coach

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.800
of the Charlotte Sting in the WNBA.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.690
He coached at United Faith
Christian Academy in Charlotte.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.430
Reggie Williams was a coach
at a number of high schools

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.910
and junior colleges
and community colleges.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:58.430
He operates his own basketball
academy now I believe out of Bowie

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.420
or somewhere in that region.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.100
So it's really interesting to look
at all of the guys who went back

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.980
into coaching and wanted to make
an influence on young people

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.320
through the sport, because of
what they got from Coach Wade.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.620
Thank you for your question.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.050
&gt;&gt; How you doing?

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.350
&gt;&gt; I'm great, how you doing?

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.650
&gt;&gt; Pretty good, pretty good.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.860
Just kind of blown away by the
overview, the historical overview.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.290
I grew up in West Baltimore.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:27.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.520
&gt;&gt; And so spent a lot of
time both at Lafayette courts

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.860
and Flag as I was growing up.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.420
And I think oftentimes
what's kind of absent

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.870
from that East Baltimore story
is that there were so many guys

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.290
that were even better than Muggsy
and David Wingate and Reggie

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.520
who never even played
high school basketball

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.670
because of the failing
educational system in Baltimore.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.260
I'm just interested because I grew

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.890
up in Baltimore, you
grew up in Brooklyn.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:54.300
Wanted to hear you share some

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.850
of your impressions
of the neighborhood.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:02.440 position:56%
Because most of the sections of East
Baltimore where Dunbar is located,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.880
these neighborhoods
look the same way now

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.810 position:56%
than they did 30 plus years ago,
with a backdrop of having, you know,

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.400
Johns Hopkins Hospital in
the center of East Baltimore.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.860
One of the most prolific you know,
health institutions in the country.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.160
Yet, those neighborhoods in East
Baltimore where Muggsy and Wingate

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.560
and all them played, these
neighborhoods still look the same,

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.860
you know, 30 plus years ago.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.590
So I'm just interested in
hearing your perspective.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.410
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'll touch on the
first part of your question.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:37.370
I mean, I don't think I'm
credentialed enough to really talk

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.160
about the socioeconomic's
and the politics

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.450
of why things look
the way they do today.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.620
But you make a very valiant
point, a very valid point.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.970
I loved what you said though

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.600
about the great talents
that didn't make it.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.250
Because there are minor characters
in this story that really speak

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.640
to why these guys made
a pact with one another,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.960
to hold each other
to a high standard.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.250
And I'll give the example
of the greatest player ever

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.940
from the history of Baltimore, as
much as I love Carmelo Anthony,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.080 position:56%
I'm a long struggling Knicks fan,
Carmelo's going to the Hall of Fame.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.320
As much as Sam Cassell accomplished
winning NBA championships

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.620
in the NBA.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.860
The greatest player from
Baltimore is a young man

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.110
by the name of Skip Honey Dip Wise.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:26.410
He was six foot five.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.880
He was every bit the talent of a
Jerry Weston and Oscar Robertson.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.990
But heroine, drugs, and crime
took him off of his path.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.070
Skip got a scholarship to
go to Clemson University

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:43.120
and became the first
freshman in the history

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.440
of the Atlantic Coast Conference
to be a first team all-ACC player.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.680
That tells you how good he was.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:56.020
But his decline was
precipitated by becoming addicted

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.990
to narcotics, falling into crime.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:04.030
Instead of his name appearing on
the back page for his headlines,

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:11.390 position:56%
his name was on the police blotter,
and on the front pages of the paper,

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.370
because of his arrests and the
things that happened to him.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.880
And Muggsy and those guys saw
Skip and said, Skip was better

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.790
than everybody, and he fell down,
we can't let that happen to us.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.600
So there is a great lineage of some
miraculous players from Baltimore

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.870 position:56%
that you've never heard of, who were
phenomenal talents, that got caught

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:37.030
up this great plague of drugs.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.490
Thank you for your question.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:44.750
&gt;&gt; I don't know how far you follow
the key characters after Dunbar.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:50.880
Bob Wade went on to Maryland and
was not a successful experience.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.080
Do you cover in the book, or can
you talk about what happened there

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.450
to take him off the
path that he was on?

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.070
&gt;&gt; Well, the book really
focuses on the '81, 1982 season,

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.180
and we kind of gloss over '82, '83.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.500
There is a mention of Wade's
experience at Maryland,

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.870
but it's really not
an exhaustive look.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.960
And I think, you know, I think it's
time that he kind of told his story

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.210
from his perspective on
his experience at Maryland.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.910
And one of the things that
is really unfortunate is,

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.730
that because he was not
successful at Maryland,

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.480
for people who have a passing
interest, and they hear that name,

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.490
they think of Bob Wade, high
school coach, in over his head,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.230
failed at Marilyn, and cheated.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.620
But I think his legacy is so much
bigger than that when you look

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.270
at the lives that he impacted,
the hundreds of lives.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:47.370
There are over 100 kids that
he coached in either football,

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.050
basketball, or baseball
at Dunbar that went

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.020
on to get athletic
scholarships to college.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.920
And they felt like he was a
father figure to many of them

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.980
who didn't have a father
figure in their lives.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.540
So we touch on it a little bit
at the end where we say, hey,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.330
this is where they are now.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.920
But I think that's an
entirely different story.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.060
&gt;&gt; Did he go back to high
school coaching in Baltimore?

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.890
&gt;&gt; He actually came
back to Baltimore,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.910
never coached another
game of basketball,

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.350
but he became the director
of athletics

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:21.200
for the Baltimore City Public
School Systems and oversaw all

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.530
of the athletic programs
for all of the schools

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.970
in the public school system.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.770
He just recently retired, and
they had a big ceremony at Dunbar.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.590
A lot of the old players came back.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.140
And they named the court after him.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.970
Thank you for your question.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.610
&gt;&gt; Great presentation.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.710
I'm a Brooklyn guy also.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.510
Hats off to Brooklyn.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.640
[applause].

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.260
Have you ever gone back to Brooklyn
and worked with some of the kids

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.510
in the community where you lived?

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.810
&gt;&gt; I do go back.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:59.160
My mom is still in the area,
my family is still in the area.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.590
So I try to get back
once every few months.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.890
I live in Maryland now,

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.690
but fortunately I'm only a
three-and-a-half-hour drive

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.430
and two-and-a-half-hour
ride on the Amtrak.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.050
So I do get back quite often.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.760
And Brooklyn looks a lot
different than it did.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.140
I tell a lot of people now
that say, hey, you know,

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.440
I was in your old neighborhood.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.950
I say, yeah, that was dangerous
when I was growing up there.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.630
But I'm happy that mom can
walk around the corner and eat

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.140
at a Thai food place and
sit outside with her friends

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.760 position:56%
and not have to dodge stray bullets.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.990
&gt;&gt; What part of Brooklyn
did you grow up in?

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.800
&gt;&gt; I grew up in Bedford Stuyvesant.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.890
I lived in Starrett
City, East New York.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.770
Mom is now in Fort
Greene, Clinton Hill area.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:45.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.540
&gt;&gt; Hi. I haven't read the book
yet, but I was curious to know

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:52.110
if the players, did they play at
AAU basketball during the summer?

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.750
And if so, were they
on the same team?

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:59.540
And if you've seen that's
different the way it is now

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.950
where sometimes players
are just sort of divided

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.770
between their AAU team and
their high school team?

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.070
&gt;&gt; That's an excellent question.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.370
And we touch on that in the book,

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.860
because the climate is
so much different today.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.370
The AAU structure is dominated
by the sneaker companies,

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.180
the apparel companies, and
this large outlay of cash.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.520
So today your prestige is defined
by what team you're playing with.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.640
Oh, I'm on team mellow,
or, you know,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.310
I'm on this team, I'm on that team.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.870
You'll find that there are teams
where the star player is a kid

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.220
from Texas or California.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:42.390
Well, how is this kid playing
on a New York AAU team, right?

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.420
Back then, the most powerful person

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:50.540
in high school basketball was not
Nike, not Under Armour, not Adidas.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.100
It was a gentleman by the
name of Howard Garfinkel,

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.160
who ran the Five-Star
Basketball Camps.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.210
And so what would happen was, Coach
Wade would put these guys in a van.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.910
They would drive up to
Pennsylvania to participate

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.390 position:56%
in these Five-Star Basketball Camps.

00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:13.900
The director of the drills
and the teaching was a guy

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.200
by the name of Bobby Knight.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.730
Young coaches who were still
in high school at the time,

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:26.940 position:56%
begging for a college job, like Dick
Vitale, a number of other coaches,

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.540
Rick Pitino, John Calipari.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.160
These guys were high
school coaches who were

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.840
up there running drills
and trying to learn.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.160
So picture Bob Wade driving
a van up to Five-Star,

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.320
and all of these long limbed
individuals get out the van.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.320
Howard Garfinkel runs up to Wade,
and his nickname for him was sugar.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.730
And he'd say, sugar, I hear
you're keeping all these secrets

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.840
down in Baltimore.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.410
And so Howard Garfinkel and
Wade actually almost got

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.720
into a physical confrontation.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.990
Because when Muggsy was
at the camp, there were --

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.010
he was not a national prospect.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.370
No one knew how good he was.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.660
And so there were a number
of point guards at the camp

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.180 position:56%
that had these national reputations.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.030
So they would have a draft.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.690
And Bob Wade picked, because
of the numbers that got picked

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.430
out of a hat, he picked
the worst center.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.650
And in lieu of that, he
was granted the first pick

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.030 position:56%
of the best point guard in the camp.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.150
And he picked Muggsy.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.610
And Howard Garfinkel lost his mind.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:41.720
He said, sugar, you can't do
that, you can't take this kid,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.540
you got to pick the best guy.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.640
And he says, I did
pick the best guy.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.740
I know he plays for you in
Baltimore, but nobody's heard

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.890
of him, he's a midget,
you can't take him.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.360
Wade said, I'm not only taking
him, but he's going to be my horse.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.930
And in Five-Star terminology,
a horse was --

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.430
every player had to play
at least half the game,

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.910
you could designate
one player as a horse

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.160
that could play the whole game.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.690
And that was reserved for guys

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.890
like Patrick Ewing,
Ralph Sampson, Len Bias.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.120
No one had a five-foot-three-inch
horse.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.930
So they had to be separated.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.830 position:56%
And Garfinkel says, you're screwing
up the camp, do what you want to do.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.540
And Wade says, I bet
you I go undefeated

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.110
and win the championship
with Muggsy.

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.780
And Garfinkel says, you'll
never win a game, it's a bit,

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.610
I'll take you to dinner
if you win one game.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:39.720
Muggsy destroyed every
point guard at that camp.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.480
Tommy Amaker, the great
coach at Harvard now,

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.880
who was a phenomenal point
guard at Duke University,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.400
said he saw Muggsy tear

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.330
up the top-rated point
guard in the country.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.940
Did not sleep the night before
he had to play against him.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.940
And for the first time in his
career, he was talking to himself

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.860
when Muggsy was guarding him,
saying, keep the ball tight,

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:07.320
don't let them steal it,
don't let them embarrass you.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:13.910 position:56%
And after that camp, was when
Muggsy became a national phenomenon.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:18.000
And in Howard Garfinkel's Five-Star
report that he sent out to all

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.160
of the top college coaches, he
gave Muggsy a Five-Star rating,

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.560
which was the highest rating
you could give, and he only gave

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.150
that to elite players that
could dominate in college.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.000
And in the comments section,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.910
he called Muggsy the greatest
peanut since Planters.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.660
It was a different time.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.260
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your question.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.750
How are we doing on time?

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.230
Two minutes left.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.620
I think we got time
for one more question.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:56.930
&gt;&gt; Don't be shy.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:58.230
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:09.810
If you're not near the mic,
stand up and get it in.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.110
[inaudible question].

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.530
You know, that's a separate topic.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.650
I mean, to me.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.570
I'm sorry, he said could
I speak about the --

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:21.340
it was just a strictly basketball
question that's kind of off-topic.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.710
Can I speak about the
legacy of Len Bias.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:28.140
From a basketball perspective, Len
Bias was the greatest player I saw

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.980
in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.900
He was in the same conference at
the same time as Michael Jordan.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.560
And if Len had not passed
away, we might be talking

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.480
about Air Bias right now,
because he was that good.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:50.310
His death and the controversy
really brought the drug culture

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:53.450
that was destroying
America to the forefront

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:56.010
of a national conversation.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:01.050
It became the hottest topic
in the corridors of Congress.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:05.480
There was some knee-jerk
reactions and some laws

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.970
that were put into place.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:13.710
Which kind of resulted in low-level
drug offenders receiving longer

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.770
sentences than murderers.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.500
You know, there's a very
deep legacy to Len Bias.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.990
But one of the saddest things
for people from this area

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.550
who saw how brilliant he was.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.000
And it really made us change
our perception of drugs,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.560
because we thought that it
was just the junkies outside.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.430
And we didn't realize
how prevalent it was.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.540
And we didn't realize that,

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.780
if it could touch this
beautiful angelic young man,

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.110
who had such a beautiful future
ahead of him, who was gifted

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:52.670
by the basketball gods, in ways
that not many of the people were,

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:57.610
then that was a sign on the highway
that this problem was really,

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:03.330 position:56%
really, really bigger than we had
anticipated and was going to be kind

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.080
of really ugly when we
saw how it manifested.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.230
So I've got to wrap it up.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.430
I really want to thank
everyone for taking the time.

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.660
I know Shonda Rhimes is
speaking at the same time.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.090
And I was mad at myself
for speaking at this time,

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:22.010
because I wanted to
go check out Shonda.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:26.350
But you guys could've been anywhere
today, anywhere at this festival,

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:30.350
and I'm really, really humbled that
you chose to spend a few minutes

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.610
with me to learn about this book.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.760
It was a passion project
10 years in the making.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.100
I'm really excited to release it.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.700
It's much bigger than basketball.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.520
And I hope if you do read
it, that it touches you.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.480 position:56%
I'm not going to sell the basketball
short for basketball junkies.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.740
The basketball action is great,
but there's so much more to it.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.190
So thank you very much.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.490
I really appreciate you.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.170
Thank you.
