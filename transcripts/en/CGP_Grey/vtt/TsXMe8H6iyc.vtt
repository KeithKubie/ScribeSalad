00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.670
Scan-duh-nay-vee-ah!

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.530
Look at this Arctic wonderland -- fjords,
saunas, fjords, lutefisk, blondes, vikings,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:12.269
blond vikings?, fjords, Ikea, babies in government
issued boxes, Santa, death metal, and fjords.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.340
But like, where exactly are the borders of
Scandinavia -- because not off of this stuff

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.590
is in it.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.180
Scandinavia is just three countries exactly:
Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.599
Three kingdoms to be more precise, all of
which are on the Scandinavian peninsula -- well,

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.990
except Denmark, and errrr plus Finland.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.629
Wait, this doesn't help at all.

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.629
Forget that.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.120
The three countries on this peninsula can
be collectively called Fennoscandia -- but

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.250
if you do everyone will look at you weird
because no one except the nerdiest of geography

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.160
nerds uses that word.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160
*Fennoscandia*.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.899
So, Scandinavia is a term that's one part
geography, one part history, and one part

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.579
linguistics -- which is why people will argue
about who exactly is included.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.600
Finland is normally excluded because she used
to be considered one of the Baltic sisters

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.730
with historical ties to mother Russia.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.689
And Denmark, though on the other side of the
sea is included because of her relationship

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.350
'it's complicated' with Sweden.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.890
They've had something like 15 to 21 wars between
them depending on how you want to count it.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.330
And it's complicated-er because they mostly
fought over Norway.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.440
And who wouldn't?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.340
She beautiful -- and rich.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.500
Anyway, when outsiders say Scandinavia they
probably mean The Nordic Countries.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.040
That's these three *plus* Finland *and* Iceland.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.830
Though you can hardly blame people for confusion
when organizations like the American Scandinavia

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.330
Foundation lists everyone as members.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.050
And all the Nordic Countries sometimes advertise
abroad under the banner of Scandinavia anyway.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.520
This is the 'Holland' approach to international
relations: if there is a fun name that everyone

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.990
likes and keeps using wrongly, just go with
it.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.780
The Nordic countries get along well enough
that they've made an official union: The Nordic

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.860
Council, a Viking cool kids club, that other
Northern European places occasionally unrealistically

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.950
dream of joining.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.090
Though the Baltic sisters do get to sit with
them, but not actually vote on anything.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.040
The Nordic Council is largely a collection
of committees that tries to get its members

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.820
to cooperate on common problems like the Arctic
environment and social welfare, and business

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.820
in the region.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.610
And also finds time to make a surprisingly
long and hilariously specific list rules for

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.440
how their logo can be used.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.070
Including a 'respect distance' the sovereignty
of which must not be violated.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.920
But the biggest deal of the Nordic Council
is that citizens of these five countries get

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.260
to live and work in any of the others.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.040
(Which, if you've seen the EU video -- adds
yet another semi-overlapping bubble of complexity

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.390
to an already complex region)

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.080
The immigration rule, however, doesn't apply
to Icelandic horses which are

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.080
1.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080
Super adorables

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.080
And 2.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.250
Banished from returning to Iceland should
they ever leave.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.070
But that's a story for another time.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.260
Now, it wouldn't be a political union in Europe
without some special territorial weirdness

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.379
to mention, mainly:

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.200
- Aland: an autonomous region of Finland,
that speaks Swedish.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.870
- And The Faeroe Islands and Greenland, both
countries in the Kingdom of Denmark.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.420
Greenland is really the odd girl out in the
Nordic club, given that she's in the wrong

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.230
hemisphere and that Greenlanders aren't historically
or linguistically related to Nords.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.000
Also, her flag ruins the otherwise consistent
design motif.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.250
But she's part of Denmark because Vikings.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.260
Lastly there's Svalbard, an unincorporated
territory of Norway, that must be mentioned

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.850
because it has prepared for the apocalypse
with a seed bank of every plant to rebuild

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.220
all of agriculture should it be necessary.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.860
And it's also guarded by armored bears.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.470
So that's that -- next time you say Scandinavia,
and you're not 100% sure who that includes,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.650
just say the The Nordic Countries instead.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.840
Hello Internet, this is my first sponsored
video and that sponsor *is* Squarespace.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.700
Squarespace is the easiest way to create a
beautiful website, blog, or online store for

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.950
you and your ideas.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.520
I'm very happy to have them as a sponsor because
I personally use Squarespace to run cgpgrey.com

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.020
and also hellointernet.com, the podcast I
do with Brady.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.830
If you are looking to have your own website
for just about anything, I personally recommend

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.910
Squarespace.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.340

code "Grey," you get 10% off at check-out.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.140
So if you have ever considered starting your
own website, click on the link, go to Squarespace,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.140
give them a try.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.610
It helps Squarespace, and it helps this channel.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:31.420
Squarespace, build it beautiful.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:49.410
Oh how will I spend all my money?

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.850
Teslas for everyone!
