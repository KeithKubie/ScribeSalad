1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,930
Um, I've been talking about
what makes people a champion.

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:08,660
Like I talked to Tony Romo right
after the super bowl about, you know,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,530
you came from eastern Illinois University.
It's like got what,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,440
nine students or something and he's a
little bit of university and he turns out

5
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,700
to be quarterback if
America's team for 14 years,

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:25,260
set all kinds of records and then goes
to the booth and becomes a number one

7
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:29,160
color analyst in television. I
mean, champion, champion, champion.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,880
Why you, what is it, what
do you attribute that to?

9
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:35,490
I like asking those questions
and hearing people talk.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,240
What do you say to young people
about that? What made you a champion?

11
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:43,800
Are you going to let your
kids play football with all
this CTE and stuff? What,

12
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,680
what do you say? I like having
those kinds of conversations.

13
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,530
Did the same thing with Shaq and
Charles Barkley and different people.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,360
What did he say about what makes
you a champion, you know, for him?

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,640
Um,
he said that he has this,

16
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:03,300
um,
he says he didn't,

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,920
he wasn't the kind of swagger sort of
person that, you know, came in Cocky,

18
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,620
like he was gonna own the
field and own the game.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,670
But inside he said he had this
absolute drive that if he didn't win,

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,660
he couldn't live with it.

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,710
It's like if somebody thought
like he played the game,

22
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,900
somebody beat them,
beat him.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,330
That just the idea that that person
went home thinking that they were better

24
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:38,250
than him,
that they could beat him,

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,240
that he just couldn't eat,
sleep.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,320
Think until he got back and owned it
again and got back to it. He said he just,

27
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,720
is this, this drive to
win. And so he would,

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,530
I mean he said he would be out at one
o'clock in the morning and the dome

29
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:59,760
throwing a pass that that
route got intercepted.

30
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:04,761
He got jumped on that route and you'd be
trying to figure out why on Thursday in

31
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,030
practice,
he saw what he needed to see,

32
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,780
why didn't we see it on Sunday and
he would analyze, analyze, analyze,

33
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,150
until he could get there, until he
could do it, until he could win it.

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,740
He just had this drive to win

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,780
that super unhealthy obsession.

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,570
They all share that Michael
Jordan had that. I mean,

37
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:24,610
we've talked about that
several times on the podcast.

38
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,550
So many people that are extreme winners,

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,150
they're psychotic and their
obsession with winning. Yeah.

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,600
That's all they want to do. And
if they lose, they, they, they,

41
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,090
it's almost in softball.
They almost can't deal with it.

42
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,900
Yeah. And that, I don't know
that necessarily a bad thing,

43
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:46,901
but the difference between winners and
losers as winners do things losers do not

44
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:51,170
want to do. Yeah. They, they will
get up in the middle of the night.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,820
They will do this, they will do that.
They feel it more, they just do things.

46
00:02:55,821 --> 00:03:00,070
Losers don't want to do and pay a
price. Losers just don't to pay. Yeah.

47
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,900
And lose your, it's just not worth it
and every winner has been loser. Oh,

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,700
well that's what made him a winter.
Yeah. If all you ever do, if it's,

49
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,150
if you go through, life is in
a success only journey. God,

50
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,120
how boring would that be me?
You think it would be great,

51
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,480
but it's like eating ice cream
every meal about the fourth meal,

52
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,270
you're going to be thinking, God,
let's kill something and eat it.
