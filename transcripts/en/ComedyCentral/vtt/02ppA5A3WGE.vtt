00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.038
- MM.

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.305
THAT WAS GREAT.
WE GOT IT.

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:08.441
TERRIFIC.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.009
DO YOU WANT TO WRAP, OR DO
YOU WANT TO PUNCH ANYBODY OUT?

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.345
THAT'S PRETTY IRISH.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.181
- DID YOU SEE WHAT JUST HAPPENED
WITH MY WIFE?

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.184
- YOUR EX-WIFE IS A NUT JOB.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.954
- WHAT?

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.690
- LOOK, THE IRISH SUFFER.
IT'S IN THEIR BLOOD, OKAY?

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:28.061
IT'S TRADITION.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.996
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
- HMM?

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.964
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
ABOUT THE GUY

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.033
WHO WAITED AND WAITED
AND WAITED AND WAITED

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.802
UNTIL A LITTLE BIT OF FUNGUS
TURNED INTO PENICILLIN.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.737
- MM.
- AND THIS IRISH SEQUENCE

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.407
IS VERY CLOSE
TO BECOMING PENICILLIN...

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.444
THANKS TO YOU.
- IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.112
- WELL, THOSE WERE YOUR WORDS,
AND I THINK THEY SAY A LOT.

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:57.890
- YOU KNOW, GRANT,
WHEN I STARTED HERE,

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:00.393
I BELIEVED IN WHAT
WE WERE DOING,

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.929
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.098
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I DO KNOW.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.134
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST JAG-OFF
I'VE EVER WORKED FOR,

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.137
AND I HOPE THIS PLACE BURNS
TO THE GROUND WITH YOU IN IT,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.206
'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DESERVE,

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.576
YOU NICKEL-AND-DIME
CHICKEN[bleep] MOTHER[bleep]!

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.245
[normal voice]
YOU CALL YOURSELF A PRODUCER?

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.781
YOU COULDN'T PRODUCE
A HAM SANDWICH!

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.116
NOW I AM WALKING OUT
THAT DOOR,

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.951
AND I AM NEVER COMING BACK,

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.819
NOT IF YOU BEG ME!
I QUIT!

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:28.554
[all cheering]
- YEAH!

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:29.989
- AND ONE MORE THING!

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:35.528
all: OH!
[cheering]

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.029
- CATCH HIM.
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY!

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:38.898
FORREST!

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.866
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY.
DO YOU HAVE HIM?

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.172
- SUZANNE!

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.941
SUZANNE!

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:51.878 line:92%
SUZANNE!

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:56.449
- OKAY, WEIRDLY ENOUGH, FORREST
HAS ACTUALLY NOT BEEN SEEN

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:59.519
BY ANYONE HERE AT THE SHOW
SINCE THAT NIGHT,

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.889
SO IT SEEMS LIKE
HE REALLY DID QUIT FOR REAL,

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.455
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.
