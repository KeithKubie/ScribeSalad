00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.530
"What if?" We ask ourselves this question
all the time at Carnegie Mellon University.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.949
What if students were immersed in a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.329
collaborative learning environment where
open spaces translate into open ideas?

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.949
What if the world's most forward-looking
business school created the education of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.939
the future to prepare the next
generation of leaders to be pioneers of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.130
change in a dynamic global world? What if we unleashed innovation by giving

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.970
promising entrepreneurs from every
corner of CMU access to a center that

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.860
merges business technology and design?
What if every prospective student, parent,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.390
alum, supporter, partner and visitor could
feel welcomed and wowed as they

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.550
experienced the richness of CMU first hand? 
What if emerging business executives

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
harness the latest practices expertise
and coaching to accelerate their growth

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.090
and transform industries?
What if students can become global citizens by

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.780
connecting with cultures through a
multimedia-rich interactive learning space?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.399
What if educators revolutionized
learning by developing new technologies

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.549
and techniques with state of the art
classrooms and teaching innovation studios?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.350
What if every student, every faculty
member, every target had access, had the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.630
inspiration, had the place to create, to
build, to innovate, to accelerate the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.219
convergence of ideas to solve the
world's greatest challenges? "What if?"

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.109
Two words that represent the future of how
Carnegie Mellon is empowering tomorrow's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.659
thinkers, innovators and discoverers,
giving them the tools to stretch the

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.789
limits of our imagination. Now, as we
celebrate the opening of the Tepper Quad,

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:03.849
we are prepared to go beyond "What if?"
Today we ask, "What next?"
