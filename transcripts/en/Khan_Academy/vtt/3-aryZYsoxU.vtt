00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.775
- [Voiceover] In another video
we've already talked about

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:04.344
what an opposite of a number is,

00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:06.012
but we'll review it a little bit.

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:07.671
If we start with a positive number,

00:00:07.671 --> 00:00:10.212
say, the number four.

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:14.733
If you have a number

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.907
and then we want to think about

00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:18.244
what the opposite of that number is.

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:19.800
Opposite.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.611
This is just the symbol for number

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:22.642
or shorthand for number.

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:24.043
So if the number is four,

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:25.511
what is its opposite?

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:28.273
Well, four is one, two, three, four

00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:29.480
to the right of zero.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.610
Positive four is four
to the right of zero.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.033
So its opposite is going to be

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.610
one, two, three, four to the left.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.640
So it's going to be negative four.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.533
Or another way to think about it,

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.809
if you have a positive number,

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.810
its opposite is going to be
the negative of that number.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.474
So another way of thinking about it is,

00:00:46.474 --> 00:00:49.910
is that this negative
literally means opposite.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.341
One way to think about
it, this is the number

00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.567
that is the opposite of four.

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:55.144
So let me write this down.

00:00:55.144 --> 00:00:58.805
So if I write negative four.

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:01.074
Negative, let me write this,

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:04.405
negative four.

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:05.776
That literally means...

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:11.440
So you can take this negative symbol

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.107
as meaning opposite.

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:14.809
Opposite.

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:19.809
Opposite of four. Opposite of four.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.145
If you were to say negative,

00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:24.805
instead of saying a specific number

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.334
let's just say a letter that
could represent a number.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:29.710
So if I said negative A,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.465
that means the opposite of the number A.

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:38.333
That means the opposite...

00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:42.044
Opposite of...

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.115
Let me do that in blue color.

00:01:45.115 --> 00:01:48.612
Opposite of A. Of A.

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:50.215
And if this confuses you
a little bit just look,

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.870
A could be any number right over here.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.903
So let me draw a number line

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:55.746
just so this can be a little bit,

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:58.209
make a little bit more sense hopefully.

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.345
So this is a number line.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:02.342
Let me put some tick marks here.

00:02:02.342 --> 00:02:05.043
I don't know much each
of these tick marks jump

00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:09.703
but let's say that A is some
number that is right over here.

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:14.045
Well negative A is going
to be the opposite of A.

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.667
So if A is three tick marks to the right

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.638
negative A is going to be
three tick marks to the left.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.313
One, two, three.

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:24.100
And so the opposite of A

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.539
is going to be this value right over here.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.503
And we can write that, we can
write opposite of A over here.

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:31.610
We could literally write opposite,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.533
opposite of A

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.606
is that number right over there.

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:41.670
Or as a shorthand, we can just write--

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.942
We can just write negative.

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:49.381
We can just write this is
negative A right over here.

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:53.276
Negative A.

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:54.081
So with that in mind,

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:56.500
if we literally view this negative symbol

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.308
as meaning the opposite
of whatever this is,

00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:01.142
let's try something interesting.

00:03:01.142 --> 00:03:04.010
What would be the negative--

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.411
Let me do this in another color.

00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:10.404
What would be the negative of

00:03:10.404 --> 00:03:13.144
negative three?

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:16.143
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.

00:03:16.143 --> 00:03:19.340
Well we just said, this
negative means the opposite.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.343
So you can think about this as meaning

00:03:21.343 --> 00:03:24.138
this means the opposite...

00:03:27.738 --> 00:03:31.140
Opposite of negative--

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.338
The opposite of negative three.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.070
So what is the opposite of negative three?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.348
Well negative three is
three to the left of zero.

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:39.745
One, two, three.

00:03:39.745 --> 00:03:41.809
So it's opposite is going to
be three to the right of zero.

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.172
One, two, three.

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:46.382
So it's going to be positive three.

00:03:46.382 --> 00:03:50.779
So this is equal to positive three.

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.175
Or we could just write positive three

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:56.547
like that.

00:03:56.547 --> 00:03:58.574
So hopefully this gives
you a better appreciation

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:01.409
for what opposite means

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.644
and also how it relates to the

00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:06.442
actual negative symbol.

00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:08.329
We could keep going.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.012
We could do something like

00:04:10.012 --> 00:04:13.503
what is the negative

00:04:13.508 --> 00:04:15.206
of the negative

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:18.303
of negative--

00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:20.732
Let me do a different
number. Of negative two.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.280
Well, this part right over here

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.571
the negative, the
opposite of negative two,

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.081
which is really the opposite
of the opposite of two,

00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.270
well that's just going to be two.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.979
Every time you say opposite
you flip over the number line.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.942
So this flips you over the
number line two to the left

00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:40.772
and this flips you back two to the right

00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:42.537
so all of this is going to be two

00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:44.143
but then you're going to
take the opposite of two

00:04:44.143 --> 00:04:48.808
so that's just going to be negative two.

00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:50.538
If you threw another
negative in front of this,

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:51.738
it would be the opposite of all of this.

00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:52.908
So it would be the
opposite of negative two

00:04:52.908 --> 00:04:54.109
and then all of a sudden
it would become positive.

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:56.545
So every time you put that
negative in front there

00:04:56.545 --> 00:05:00.634
you're flipping on the other
side of the number line.
