- I'm gonna tell you about some
jobs I had.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.703
I had a great job.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:11.871
I worked at a meat-packing
plant for three years.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.639
Anybody else done that?

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.242
The Hormel meat-packing plant
in Ottumwa, Iowa.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.244
By the way, if you work on the
kill floor

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:22.148
of a meat-packing plant, you
will get very drunk every day.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.749
Okay?

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.785
There's a documentary called
"American Dream"--

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.787
It won an academy award in
1990--

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.589
about our meat-packing plant.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.558
I voted for every strike that
came up.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.760
I didn't even read the
paperwork, you know,

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:37.330
and by the way, man, it's so
fun.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.498
You get so drunk.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.966
You start a bonfire outside.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.667
You fucking firebomb anybody
that tries

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.102
to get through the gates.

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.637
A lot of times it's your
cousin, you know.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.139
You don't even care.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.840
And then people were
interviewing us outside,

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.775
and they're like, "Why are you
striking?"

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:51.110
And I go, "I have no idea, but
it's fucking fun, man.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:51.377
I know that."

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.779
And if you watch that
documentary,

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.581
you see what happens.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:57.617
The company just fired us and
just changed the name of the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.854
business, and then they hired
people from other countries

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:03.623
to work for half the pay.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.958
Yeah, anyway, it didn't work
out too well,

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:09.362
but my best job, I think, was
McDonald's.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.964
So after that, I went to the
University of Iowa,

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:13.633
and I needed money, right?

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.201
So--first I applied at Pizza
Hut.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:18.304
But they made you take a lie
detector, so...

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.206
and then they ask you
questions, you know,

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.676
real personal ones, like, "Have
you ever stolen food,"

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.813
and earlier in my life, I
worked on a farm.

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:30.950
I grew up on farms, and I was
bailing hay for a guy.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.986
We all did--for 14 hours--
and this guy was supposed

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.822
to pay us $1.40 an hour, and
he was an asshole,

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.658
and he only gave us 70 cents an
hour,

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.226
'cause he said we drank too
much water.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.495
So I sold one of his cows.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.163
Anyway, that's technically
stealing.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.898
I think it's technically--
I did, for real.

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.167
I don't consider it stealing,
but anyway,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.003
so--and I had, like, a fucking
Pinto.

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:54.840
It was a tough--anyway, but I
had those bungee cords.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.342
I mean, he was safe.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.845
Anyway, it's a long story...
That's true.

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:02.882
So, I get this job
at McDonald's in Iowa City.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:04.684
And it is the best job because,

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.219
if you unload the truck
on Thursdays,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.188
you get one meal
of whatever you want to eat.

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.492
So I would have eight Big Macs
with Quarter-Pounder meat

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:14.860
and a Diet Coke.

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:16.762
And then
I would start my workday,

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:20.499
you know, feeling totally
sick and disgusting.

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:22.034
And that's--it's shocking

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.003
I became a drug addict
because of that.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:25.938
Anyway, but I loved there.

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.874
I got to play Ronald McDonald

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:30.543
for the kids on Sundays

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.044
with terrible hangovers.

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:33.879
It was just
a wonderful place to work.

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:35.214
And all my friends loved it.

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.882
You know how
your friends love it

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:38.050
when you work at a place
like that, right?

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.885
They fucking line up there.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:41.520
And they want free food.
You know?

00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:44.557
And it's really hard
'cause they got computers,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.725
so you gotta pay attention

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:47.226
and keep track of the food.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.961
And you have to pretend
you've thrown food

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:50.930
into the hopper that
was in there too long,

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.565
and you've thrown it away,

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.433
so when you're giving away
free food.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.369
And, you know--and by the way,

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.037
all that food
that was in the hopper

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.739
that they put into
a trash thing,

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:01.407
I take home every night.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.908
And my roommates, we love it.

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.977
And sometimes
we'd get a bad Filet-O-Fish

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.612
or something
and somebody gets really sick.

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.814
But anyway--
otherwise it's a waste.

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.250
It's only been in there
12 hours, that's fine.

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:12.718
So...

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.487
[light laughter, murmuring]

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.055
And anyway...

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:19.792
So, my buddy, Moe,
who's still my buddy,

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.260
you know, he comes in there
every Friday,

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.062
and he wants
a bag of cheeseburgers.

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:24.764
So I give him
a bag of cheeseburgers.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.399
I give all my friends whatever.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.267
And then I have to figure out
on the computer--

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.769
you know, 'cause it makes you
real smart working there.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.937
And...and then I see Moe.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.674
He's talking to the owner,
Kevin [bleep].

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.108
And they're pointing at me.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:37.677
And I'm like, what's going on?

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.178
And he goes,
"This customer says

00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:40.946
you forgot some
of his cheeseburgers."

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.983
Like, my own fucking buddy
is narcing on me,

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:45.751
who I just gave free--

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:48.854
you know, that's the kind
of friends I have, so...

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:52.291
I also had a part-time job at
Paul's Discount,

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:53.693
and this really helped.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.461
And what I did to Paul's
Discount was,

00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:57.463
every day I'd go into work, and
then I'd get a gym bag

00:04:57.496 --> 00:05:00.299
off the shelf, and I'd fill it
up with stuff

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:01.934
that friends wanted me to
steal,

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:04.370
and I'd go home with a full gym
bag,

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:06.272
and the owner would take me
home.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.441
And every night, it was scary,
'cause it still had

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.643
the things on it, and, you
know, the clips.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:13.813
And I just prayed he'd shut off
the security system

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.481
as I walked by the cash
registers.

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:17.850
And so it was a very exciting
place to work.

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:21.320
And then--and then one day a
beer distributor came in

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:23.389
and said he wanted some golf
clubs and stuff,

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:25.157
and I said, "I'll make you a
deal.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.026
"You drop off 50 cases of beer
at my house,

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.495
and I'll make this trade," so
we--you know,

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:31.197
a good deal for everybody.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.532
And--and it was a Friday night,
Iowa football game,

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:36.035
so I knew we were gonna be
partying very hard,

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:38.971
and also, McDonald's,
we had this game going.

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:41.340
And every time
you bought a bag of food,

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:43.008
we put a game ticket in,

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:46.712
and you could win a Big Mac
or a Big Breakfast or $5.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:49.682
And so, I was getting ready
to leave--it was Friday night.

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:51.817
And I see a box of those,
6,000.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.553
And I'm like, fuck that.
I'm taking it home.

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:56.088
So I take home the box,

00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:57.857
and me and my friends
stayed up all night.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.325
Our fingernails were--
were just destroyed,

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.160
'cause you gotta rip
the sides off.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:04.563
And in the morning, we had
157 free Big Breakfastes.

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.532
And we'd been up all night with
the free beer.

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:08.734
And it was, like, a real classy
party,

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.202
like, you know, a brunch of
something,

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.004
so, anyway,
we go down to McDonald's.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:13.839
Since I work there,
I can't cash it in.

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:15.608
But my buddy Moe can.

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.376
So I park behind the dumpster.

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.912
And Moe goes in
and he goes up to the front.

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:22.114
And he puts them up there
and he says,

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:25.751
"I'd like
157 free Big Breakfastes."

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:27.420
And the lady goes,

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.556
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir, did
you not read the fine print?

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.258
It's only one per visit."

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.059
And my friend Moe
is pretty smart.

00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:37.062
He's like,
"Boy, the kids at the home

00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:39.031
are gonna be pretty sad."

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:41.567
And Kevin [bleep], the owner,
who's still the owner,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.868
runs over and goes,

00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:45.538
"Sir, we will honor those.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.106
For the kids."

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.908
So the next thing I see

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.644
is my buddy Moe
with a giant cardboard box

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:53.112
full of Big Breakfastes.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:54.747
I'm like, holy shit, we did it.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.415
We did it.
Brilliant.

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:59.385
And then right behind him
is Kevin [bleep],

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:01.420
the owner of McDonald's
with another big box

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:03.088
of Big Breakfastes.

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:07.493
And I realize, I'm gonna
be fired in about five seconds.

00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:08.828
And Kevin [bleep],

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.096
that guy is such a jerk,

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:12.765
he didn't even
take the food back.

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:13.999
He just looked at me in the car

00:07:14.032 --> 00:07:15.668
and just gave me that, "I'm...

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.336
"I'm so disappointed.

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:21.240
"I considered you assistant
manager material, Tom.

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:23.242
You could've ended up
at Hamburger U."

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:26.612
Anyway, so that's my last day
at McDonald's.

00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:29.248
So...later in life...

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.584
I know, it's sad.
It was a great job.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:33.285
Later in life, I got sober,

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:35.020
and when you get sober
you have to make a list

00:07:35.053 --> 00:07:36.789
of all the people
you need to make amends to.

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:38.624
And mine was
a pretty extensive list.

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:41.527
And...once I got past
the girlfriends

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.030
whose credit I'd ruined,
I got to McDonald's

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:47.867
and Paul's Discount,
and I sent them checks.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.369
And...I called Kevin [bleep].

00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:53.639
And he's such a nice guy,
he cried.

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:55.307
And he wouldn't take the money.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.810
He had to give it to
the Ronald McDonald House.

00:07:57.843 --> 00:07:59.478
How nice is that, right?

00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.047
'Cause I'd stolen, you know,
$10,000 worth of food.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.016
I mean, that's pretty--
like, that is...

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:05.985
The one thing I did do,
when I left,

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.953
they stopped putting pockets
on the uniforms.

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:12.525
'Cause I--you know.
Anyway...

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:15.227
but there's a happy ending,
because one time

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.829
I hosted "Saturday Night Live."

00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:19.164
And I got to play a McDonald's
manager,

00:08:19.197 --> 00:08:21.000
And this was when Bill Clinton
was president

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.568
and would always go to
McDonald's.

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:25.671
And the great Phil Hartman,
who I love too...

00:08:25.704 --> 00:08:27.072
Yeah, everybody...

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:28.741
[cheers and applause]

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:33.178
Most of the people that I love
are dead now apparently,

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:36.181
but Phil Hartman was wonderful,
and I had--

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:38.083
I played Kevin [bleep].

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:39.685
I had his name tag on there
as a tribute to that guy,

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:42.021
so that's a happy ending to
that story.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.890
Thank you guys very much
for being here.

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:46.592
<i> Thank you.</i>

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.160
<i> - Tom Arnold, y'all.</i>

00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:49.862
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:50.296
<i> Yeah.</i>
