00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.240
So far, all the lines we've talked
about have had a positive slope.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.490
But you can also have a negative slope.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.850
Positive slopes we think of as going
uphill, when we read from left to right.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.140
Negative slopes are more downhill.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.980
So if I give you a few lines,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.700
can you tell me which of these
lines have a negative slope?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.120
And you can just check all that apply.
