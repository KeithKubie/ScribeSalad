00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.570
Welcome to the presentation
on multiplying expressions.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.260
Let's get started.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.540
So if I were to ask you what x
plus 2 times, let me use a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:20.610
different color, times x plus 3
equals, at first you'd be like,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.450
huh, that's a little strange.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.180
But it turns out that you
actually already know

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.940
how to do this problem.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.060
And it's just the
distributive property.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.040
Because, if I just had -- let
me write a different problem

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.603
here -- if I just wrote a let
me just make it clear, this is

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:41.400
a separate problem -- if I just
wrote a times x plus 3, you

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:58.060
know that that's just a x plus,
you could say a 3, or

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.510
another way to say that
would be 3a, right?

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.020
But as you see, all we did is
distribute it, this a times 3.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.290
All we did is distribute the
a times the x and the 3.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.763
Well, we're going to do the
same thing here, but instead

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:10.630
of a we have x plus 2.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.050
So let's do that.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.830
So this would be -- let me
switch to green -- we get x

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.995
plus 2, and since I'm using
green, I'm just going

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:24.482
to stay with green.

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:28.400
x plus 2, let me
switch to orange.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.980
x plus 2 times x plus
x plus 2 times 3.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.310
Does that make sense?

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.720
If that looks a little
confusing, just pretend

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.550
like that x plus 2 is
the a in this example.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.080
And all we did is, we
distributed it across

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.110
that x plus three.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.980
And now it becomes a pretty
straightforward problem.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.140
What is -- we do distribution
again with each part

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.420
of this problem.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.740
So, let me stay in orange.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.950
What is x times x?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.820
Well that's x squared.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.850
And then x times 2
-- well, that's 2x.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.860
So we did this left-hand
side already.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.680
Now we do this right-hand side.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.730
What's 3 times x?

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.650
Well that's 3x.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.940
What's 3 times 2?

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.680
Well, that's 6.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.680
And now we're almost done.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.670
We could say, oh, we have a 2x
here and a 3x here, we can

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.700
simplify and add
those together.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.070
And we know that that
equals x squared.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.000
2x plus 3x is equal to 5x.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.930
x squared plus 5x plus 6.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.890
So all we did, there's really
nothing new to learn here.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.460
We just distributed the x plus
2 times each term of x plus 3.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.630
And we got the second step.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.480
And then we distributed this x
times x plus 2, and this 3

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.660
times x plus 2, and simplify.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.810
Let's do a couple of problems.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.970
And hopefully it'll
hit the point home.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:07.180
Let's say I had 5x plus
9 times 4x minus 2.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.590
Once again, that
equals 5x plus 9.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.120
I'm just distributing it.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.640
I want to stay in my color that
I'm using, so that's why I'm

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.670
just writing it out like this.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.660
That equals 5x plus 9 times 4x.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.350
And then plus, 5x plus
9 times minus 2.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.570
That minus 2 is here
and this 4x is here.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.830
And now we just
multiply it out.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.170
5x times 4x is 20x squared.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.720
Hope that makes sense to
you; let me write it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.756
down in this corner.

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:55.050
5x times 4x is the same thing
as 5 times 4 times x times x.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.040
That equals 20x squared.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.840
Hopefully that makes
sense to you.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.290
So, going back to the problem.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.830
5x times 4x is 20x squared
plus 9 times 4x is 36x.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.040
Plus minus 2 times 5x.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.000
So that's minus 10x.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.860
And then 9 times negative
2, well, that's minus 18.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.470
And we're almost done.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.696
So we get 20x squared.

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:27.310
And we have 36x.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.990
Minus 10x.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.040
So that's plus 26x minus 18.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.520
There.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.430
We're done.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.325
Let's do another problem.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.710
Let's do 2x plus y.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.640
Whoops, some parentheses.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.040
I'll stay in one color, since
I think you understand

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.170
what we're doing.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:03.210
Times 3x plus 2y.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.790
Well, once again, this is the
same thing as -- and we could

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.100
just do it in a little
different way, a little

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.840
different order.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.350
But we could distribute
it like this.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.960
We could say that this
is 3x times 2x plus y.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.570
Plus 2y times 2x plus y.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.050
See what I did?

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.280
I just switched the
order this time.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.410
Just to mix things up.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.060
This 3x is there.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.140
This 2y is here.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.320
And we just distributed it
along 2 -- and we just, we

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.260
distributed it 2x plus y
along each of these numbers.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.540
And now we just
multiply it out.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.630
3x times 2x is 6x squared.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.970
3x times y -- that's 3xy.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.930
3xy is just another way of
saying 3 times x times y.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.850
Plus, now, 2 times y times 2y
times 2x, well, that's 4 y x.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.320
4 y x.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.450
2 times 2 times y times x.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.020
Plus 2y times y.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.370
Well, that's just 2y squared.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.590
Now, can we simplify
anything here?

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.980
Think about it a little bit.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.960
Well, it turns out that x y and
y are actually the same thing.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.570
They're just
switching the order.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.300
So you could just rewrite
this as 6x squared plus

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.110
7 x y plus 2y squared.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.560
And we could have just as
easily have written it as

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:39.471
6x squared plus 7y
x plus 2y squared.

00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.420
I hope I'm not confusing you.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.910
Let's do one more, real fast.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:53.100
Let's do 2x plus 2 squared.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.870
Well, you might be temptd to
just square each of these

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.180
terms, but you've got to be
careful because you

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.340
have this x here.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.840
So it actually turns out
that this is equal to 2x

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.230
plus 2 times 2x plus 2.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.740
Any number squared is just
that number times itself.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.950
So any expression like 2x plus
2 squared, is just that

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.010
expression times itself.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.980
And now we can just do it as
-- this is the same thing

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.310
as 2x times 2x plus 2.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.070
Plus 2 times 2x plus 2.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.330
We just multiply
everything out.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.240
2x times 2x, that's 4x squared.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.530
2x times 2, that's 4x.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.690
Plus 2 times 2x is 4x again.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.802
And then 2 times 2,
well, that's 4.

00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:43.770
And we're almost there.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.750
We just can add up
these two terms.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.140
4x squared plus 8x plus 4.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.520
And we're done.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.900
I think you're ready now to try
some level one multiplying

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.220
expression problems.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.930
Hope you have fun.
