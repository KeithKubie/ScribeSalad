00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
How many cultures are there in the world?

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.980
We’ve talked a lot about the things that
make a culture a culture – things like norms
and symbols and languages.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.600
But we haven’t really discussed how you
lump all those little things together and say,  yes,
these are the things that belong together –

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.800
these things are culture A, and
these other things are culture B.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.580
So, what are the rules of culture?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.960
Well, culture isn’t just about nationality,
or the language you speak.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.080
You and another person can live in the same
country and speak the same language, and still
have totally different cultural backgrounds.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.170
Within a single country, even within a single
city, you see lots of different cultures,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.640
and each person’s cultural background will
be a mishmash of many different influences.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.380
So, there really isn’t – and never will be – a single,
agreed-upon number of cultures that exist in the world.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.120
But that doesn’t mean we can’t recognize
a culture, and understand cultural patterns
and cultural change,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.980
and think about how different cultures
contribute to the functioning of society.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:59.900
[Theme Music]

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.080
Are you more likely to spend your free time
at a football game, or at a modern art gallery?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.350
Do you watch NCIS or True Detective?

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.210
Do you wear JC Penney or J Crew?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.820
These distinctions – and many more like them –
are just one way of distinguishing between cultural
patterns, in terms of social class.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.180
Because, yes, Class affects culture,
and vice versa.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.380
So one way of looking at culture is by examining
distinctions between low culture and high culture.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.380
And OK, yeah, those are kinda gross sounding
terms.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.680
But I want to be clear: High culture does
not mean better culture.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.180
In fact, so-called low culture is also known as popular
culture, which is exactly what it sounds like:

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.080
Low or popular culture includes the cultural behaviors and ideas that are popular with most people in a society.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.300
High culture, meanwhile, refers to cultural
patterns that distinguish a society’s elite.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.920
You can sort of think of low culture versus
high culture as the People’s Choice Awards
versus the Oscars.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.300
The Hunger Games probably weren’t gonna
be winning Best Picture at the Oscars.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.920
But they were massive blockbusters, and the
original movie was voted the best movie of
2012 by the People’s Choice Awards.

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.999
By contrast, the winner of Best Picture at
the Oscars that same year was The Artist,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.920
a black and white silent film produced by
a French production company.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.480
Very different movies, very different types
of culture.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.260
Now, you can also look at how different types
of cultural patterns work together.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.810
The Hunger Games and The Artist may appeal
to different segments of society, but ultimately,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.860
they both fit into mainstream American media
culture.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.720
Mainstream culture includes the cultural
patterns that are broadly in line with a society’s
cultural ideals and values.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.380
And within any society, there are also
subcultures – cultural patterns that set apart a
segment of a society’s population.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.960
Take, for example, hipsters!

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.460
They make up a cultural group that formed around the idea of rejecting what was once considered “cool,” in favor of a different type of cultural expression.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.880
Yeah, your beard and your fixed-gear bike, or your
bleach blonde hair and your thick-framed glasses –

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.320
they’re all part of the material culture that signifies
membership in your own specific sub-culture.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.120
But, who decides what’s mainstream and what’s
a sub-culture?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.140
I mean, the whole hipster thing has gone pretty
mainstream at this point.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.340
Typically, cultural groups with the most power
and societal influence get labelled the norm,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.900
and people with less power get relegated to
sub-groups.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.520
The US is a great example of this.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.080
In large part because of our history as a country of immigrants, the US is often thought of as a “melting pot,” a place where many cultures come together to form a single combined culture.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.140
But how accurate is that?

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.560
After all, each subculture is unique – and they
don’t necessarily blend together into one big cohesive
culture just because we share a country.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.600
And more importantly, some cultures are valued
more than others in the US.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.080
For example, everyone gets Christmas off
from school, because Christian culture holds
a privileged role in American society.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.520
That might not seem fair, if you’re a member of a
sub-culture that isn’t folded into mainstream culture.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.470
So, it's not really a melting pot if one flavor
is overpowering all the other flavors.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.360
And this brings me to another subject: How
we judge other cultures, and subcultures.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.240
Humans are judgmental.
We just are.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.560
And we’re extra judgmental when we see
someone who acts differently than how we
think people should act.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.200
Ethnocentrism is the practice of judging one
culture by the standards of another.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.080
In recent decades, there’s been growing
recognition that Eurocentrism – or the preference
for European cultural patterns –

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.450
has influenced how history has been
recorded, and how we interpret the lives
and ways of people from other cultures.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.080
So what if, rather than trying to melt all the cultures
into one, we recognize each individual flavor?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.160
One way to do this is by focusing research on
cultures that have historically gotten less attention.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.100
For example, afrocentrism is a school of thought
that re-centers historical and sociological study on the
contributions of Africans and African-Americans.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.120
Another option is expanding and equalizing
your focus.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.000
Instead of looking at behavior through the
lens of your own culture, you can look at it through
the lens of multiculturalism –

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.120
a perspective that, rather than seeing society as a homogenous culture, recognizes cultural diversity while advocating for equal standing for all cultural traditions.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.760
In this view, America is less a “melting
pot” and more like a multicultural society.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.400
Still, the ways in which cultures and subcultures
fit together – if at all – can vary, depending on your
school of thought as a sociologist.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.120
For example, from a structural functionalist
perspective, cultures form to provide order
and cohesiveness in a society.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.800
So in that view, a melting pot of cultures
is a good thing.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.720
But a conflict theorist might see the interactions
of sub-cultures differently.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.600
Prioritizing one sub-culture over another can create
social inequalities and disenfranchise those who belong
to cultures that are at odds with the mainstream.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.660
It’s hard to encourage individual cultural
identities without promoting divisiveness.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.660
In the US at least, it’s a constant struggle.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.320
But sometimes, sub-groups can be more
than simply different from mainstream culture
– they can be in active opposition to it.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.400
This is what we call a counter-culture.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.880
Counter-cultures push back on mainstream culture
in an attempt to change how a society functions.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.540
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to take a
trip back to one of the biggest counter-cultural
periods of the 20th century: the 1960s.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.560
In the United States, the 1960s were rife
with countercultures.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.580
It was a time of beatniks, and hippies, of
protests against the Vietnam war, and of protests
for civil rights and women’s liberation.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.250
These movements were often led by young people
and were seen as a rebellion against the culture
and values of older generations.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.780
This was the era of free love, where people
embraced relationships outside of the traditionally
heterosexual and monogamous cultural norms.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.440
Drug use – especially the use of psychedelic
drugs – was heavily associated with this sub-culture
and was celebrated in its popular culture –

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.150
think Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
or the Beat authors’ books about acid trips.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.220
But this counter-culture was also a push back
politically against mainstream culture.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.660
Many cornerstones of the politics of the American left
have their origins in the counter-culture of the 1960s:

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.280
anti-war, pro-environmentalism,
pro-civil rights, feminism, LGBTQ equality.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.340
From the Stonewall riots to the Vietnam war protests,
‘60s counter-culture was where many of these issues
first reached the public consciousness.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.480
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.729
So, counter-cultures can often act as
catalysts for cultural change, especially if they
get big enough to gain mainstream support.

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.960
But cultures change all the time, with or
without the pushback from sub-cultures and
counter-cultures.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.620
And different parts of cultures change at
different speeds.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.080
Sometimes we have what’s called a cultural
lag, where some cultural elements change more
slowly than others.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.980
Take how education works, for example.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.730
In the US, we get the summer off from school.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.680
This is a holdover from when this was a
more agricultural country, and children needed
to take time off during harvest.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.800
Today, there’s no real reason for summer
vacation, other than that’s what we’ve always done.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.220
So how does cultural change happen?

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.849
Sometimes, people invent new things that change
culture.

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:53.100
Cell phones, for example, have
revolutionized not just how we make phone calls,
but how we socialize and communicate.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.139
And inventions don’t just have to be material.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.720
Ideas, like about money or voting systems,
can also be invented and change a culture.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.720
People also discover new things.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.940
When European explorers first discovered tomatoes in Central America in the 1500s and brought them back to Europe, they completely changed the culture of food.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.860
What would pizza be without tomatoes?!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:17.160
A third cause of cultural change comes
from cultural diffusion, which is how cultural
traits spread from one culture to another.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.920
Just about everything we think of as classic
“American” culture is actually borrowed and
transformed from another culture.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.480
Burgers and fries?
German and Belgian, respectively.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.380
The American cowboy?
An update on the Mexican vaquero.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.220
The ideals of liberty and justice for all
enshrined in our founding documents?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.060
Heavily influenced by French philosophers
like Rousseau and Voltaire, and British philosophers

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.820
like Hobbes and Locke, as well as by the Iroquois
Confederacy and its ideas of representative
democracy.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.039
Whether we’re talking about material culture
or symbolic culture, we’re seeing more and

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.260
more aspects of culture shared across nations
and across oceans.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.180
As symbolic interactionists see it, all of
society is about the shared reality – the
shared culture – that we create.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.360
As borders get thinner, the group of people
who share a culture gets larger.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.300
Whether it’s the hot dogs we get from Germany or the jazz and hip hop coming from African traditions,

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.100
more and more cultures overlap as technology and globalization make our world just a little bit smaller.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.640
And as our society becomes more global, the
questions raised by two of our camps of sociology,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.720
structural functionalism and conflict theory,
become even more pressing.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.539
Are the structural functionalists right?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.460
Does having a shared culture provide points
of similarity that encourage cooperation and
help societies function?

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.320
Or does conflict theory have it right?

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.720
Does culture divide us, and benefit some
members of society more than others?

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.820
In the end, they’re both kind of right.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:32.880
There will always be different ways of
thinking and doing and living within a society –
but culture is the tie that binds us together.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.830
Today, we learned about different types of
culture, like low culture and high culture.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.920
We looked at different ways of categorizing
cultures into sub-cultures.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.260
We contrasted two different ways of
looking at cultural diversity: ethno-centrism and
multi-culturalism.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.340
We discussed the role of counter cultures
and explored how cultural change happens.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.280
And lastly, we looked at a structural
functionalist and a conflict theory perspective
on what cultures mean for society.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.290
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT, and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.320
