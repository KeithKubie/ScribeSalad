00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.740
My name is David Attenborough
and I gave the Christmas

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.980
Lectures on animal
behavior in 1973.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.520
You might think that the
orangutan would be a very good

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.520
subject to try and
teach to talk.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.930
Actually, not so, and for quite
interesting reasons.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.070
But the orangutan is, in the
wild, a very solitary animal.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.080
This is a mantis.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.330
And he says beware by putting
up his forelegs.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.760
His forelegs have got
barbs on them.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.350
You see?

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.450
Would you like a
bit of a grape?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.700
Yes.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.720
I think the Royal Institution
champion ear-waggler for 1973

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.915
is

00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:00.958
- [SHOUTING]

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.810
- Good Lord!

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.070
So he, too, is ferocious.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.320
Now...

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.300
there we are.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.160
Now I regret to have
to tell you - ow!

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.060
In those days, they
were all live.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.940
I found it an extremely
difficult thing to do, partly

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.966
because I tried to remain true
to the traditions of the

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.870
lecture, which is that if you
make a statement, you

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.390
have to prove it.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.980
Now that's OK when you're
talking about producing carbon

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.860
dioxide by pouring hydrochloric

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.940
acid on marble chips.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.900
That's fine.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.950
But when you want to say
something about animal

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.880
behavior, animals aren't just
chemical substances.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.950
They have minds of their own.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.970
And also, not only that, but
they have to run to time.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.750
So you had to produce a series
of experiments in which

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.220
animals were going
to do things.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.130
And if they didn't do it in the
time allocated, well then

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.740
you just had to move on
to the next thing.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.280
On his wrists, he has...

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.020
he has...

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.450
little, little...

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:42.584
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:46.950
Well, I don't think it's
going to work.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.420
No, I don't think it is.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.296
You know, I never liked mice!

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:58.920
Oh, I suppose five weeks to
go, four weeks to go, I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.700
actually rang up the producer
and said, "Look, I will pay a

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.540
lot of money.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.700
I'm just going to break
my contract.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.770
I really can't do this." And
he gave me a strong cup of

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.730
coffee and told me
not to be silly.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.670
If I get the gain turned
up on this apparatus...

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.640
[TAPPING]

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.940
Indeed, quicker than
I thought.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.880
That noise is produced
by an egg.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.170
There he is.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.131
It is a porcupine,
as you can see.

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:34.740
Now, he's got a little
alarmed, you see.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.000
You see, he has erected
his quills.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.380
When he gets really angry, he
lifts them up as though he was

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.920
raising his hairs so he looks
even bigger and even more

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.980
formidable.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.460
Knowing my luck, these two
champion Indian hill mynahs

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.080
will now, from this moment, be
as silent as the grave. But

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.920
there we are.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.368
(SINGING) Polly put
the kettle on.

00:04:00.368 --> 00:04:02.758
(BIRD SINGING) Polly
put the kettle on.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.510
I gave the lectures
way back in 1973.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.330
It was a hair-raising
experience, but I'm sure

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.590
they're just as good today
as they ever were.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.140
And I hope you'll enjoy them.
