00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.874
Right after I call session.commit( ),
I'll go ahead and add a flash message to

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:07.000
let my user know that a item
has successfully been edited.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.100
Likewise, in my deleteMenuItem function
I'll add another flash message to let

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.160
the user know that
a item has been deleted.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.470
Solutions for this challenge
are available in the instructor notes.
