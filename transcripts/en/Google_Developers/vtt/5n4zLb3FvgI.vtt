00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:07.240
JP GIL: Today, we're going to be
talking about interactive watch

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.822
faces.

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:10.155
And it's going to be more
focused on the user experience

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.320
side and how to design
interactive watch faces,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.030
but I think it could be a good,
interesting talk for developers

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.890
as well.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.856
How to think about your watch
faces when you design them.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.010
Before we start, I think
probably most people

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.690
know what Android Wear is.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.270
Does everybody know
what Android Wear is?

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.870
Is anyone wearing Android Wear?

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.590
OK.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.810
So for those of you who
don't know Android Wear,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.340
Android Wear is Google's
wearable OS platform,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.030
and it provides
you notifications

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.540
and immersive app experiences
and thousands of cool watch

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.500
faces.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.834
So this, in combination
with the many devices that

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.750
have been launched out
there and plus the ones

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.669
that have been announced, you
can pretty much literally,

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:56.460
as it says on the
slides-- you can actually

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.440
wear what you want.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.881
You can totally personalize
your experience.

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.380
And one of the coolest things
you can do with Android Wear--

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.370
we released in the
previous release--

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.330
is to make interactive
watch faces,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.250
and that's what I'm going
to talk about today.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.820
So before we enter
watch faces, I just

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.740
want to give you a very
quick overview of what

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.520
are the user experience
entry points that users

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.080
have with Android Wear.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.830
So you have your watch faces.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.410
That's your classic
watch experience.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.930
You have notifications that
are bridged from your phone

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.670
or even kind of thrown
by apps on your watch.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.740
You have micro apps, which
are like mini versions of apps

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.587
from your phone.

00:01:38.587 --> 00:01:39.670
They're run on your watch.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.060
They provide a little more
immersive experiences.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.922
And we have voice and actions.

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:46.130
That means that you demand
something from your watch.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.970
You talk to it, you
launch an action.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.110
But let's focus on
watch faces, especially

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.880
the interactive
watch faces part.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.010
So when you look at
this continuum here,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.030
it is like an example of a
fictitious step counter watch

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.640
face.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.790
So on the left-hand
side, you have

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.370
just your classic watch face.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.460
It's just time.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.700
As you progress
towards the right,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.800
you have one data
point and time.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.450
So you see around
the tickers that

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.970
are showing your step count.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.790
And you can add
more data as you go.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.390
You can add another data
point plus a ticker,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.640
or at the far right, you
can just show just data.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.210
And just with a
little hint of time.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.730
So watch faces,
when they show data,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030
they become more relevant
for your personal experience

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.920
and they become more
interesting, right?

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.030
And I'm just going to do a
little break here and plug

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.825
a little bit our next talk.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.070
For every stage of
your watch face,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.190
we have a thing called
always on, or ambient mode.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.930
It's something that kind
of saves power and stays on

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.640
if you don't interact with it.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.730
So it's actually a very good
way for getting glanceable data

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.860
and information without
actually even interacting

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.790
with the watch face.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.860
It's a nice way to save
power and have a longer user

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.780
experience.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.370
We're going to talk about
this in the next talk.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.750
And if you want to
stick around, please do.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.770
So going back to watch faces.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.610
Here, when I show
this continuum here,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.590
you see that you have
to choose a layout.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.720
So I went through
all these variations,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.050
and I see, oh, yeah.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.730
Maybe I like the
third one on the left.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.360
But that makes it kind
of difficult for users.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.280
Why do you have to
choose just one fixed way

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.522
of showing the watch face?

00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:40.230
Perhaps you can combine
different things.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.730
Perhaps you can have number
one combined with number two

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.280
and how do you do that.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.750
So that's why we came up
with interactive watch faces.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.600
So if you look at
this watch face,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.280
it's pretty much your
classic watch face

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.710
with a little hint
of data or some entry

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.970
point-- we call
complications, something

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.660
that sits on top of a watch
face-- that can actually

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.030
open another activity
or do something else.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.760
So let's say you tap on this
and then you get another state.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.254
So you combine two
states into one.

00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:08.920
And you can have more
states because you

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.990
can add other interactive
tap targets that

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.700
can open other activities or
do other things with your watch

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.220
face.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.920
So it's kind actually a good
way to just have more density

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.550
without cluttering the UI.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.910
So now we're going to talk
about some concepts you

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.010
need to understand before you go
on designing your watch faces.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.390
So why do you want to make
a watch face interactive?

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.350
So what's the point?

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.860
So my first thing is I
want to provide more data.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.520
I want to provide
more information,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.645
but you don't want to do
that by cluttering the UI.

00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:46.936
You can do that in a timely
manner, where you just show

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:48.090
something based on context.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.805
Like, at 1 o'clock
something appears.

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:52.180
But maybe you can have something
that's more predictable.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.722
Someone can tap on and get
the information they need.

00:04:56.722 --> 00:04:58.430
You can extend the
watch face experience.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.240
You can open a
micro app, you can

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.410
trigger an external service.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.810
You can check in into a place
by just tapping a complication

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.710
or just tap on the screen.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.970
But just one single tap
for the whole watch face.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.880
Or it can cause just
an aesthetic change.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.505
Maybe you just want
to please the user.

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:18.080
maybe you want
just something fun.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.920
Maybe you just going
to change the color.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.929
Maybe it's a picture
of your child,

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:23.720
and they send you a
picture, you tap on it,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.620
and you zoom in on the picture.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.828
So there are many things
you can do with watch faces.

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:29.260
So I mean, it's up to you to
design the best experience.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.320
But I think this is
just a little primer

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.290
to see-- introduce you on the
thinking of interactive watch

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.030
faces.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.110
So here's some key
principles that you maybe

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.760
want to observe on designing
watch faces, interactive watch

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.930
faces.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.300
Make them predictable.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.820
So when you tap on a
watch face and something

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.250
random happens, it's not
very predictable, right?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.120
So you want people to just
know what's going to happen.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720
It can show a
surprise, but they just

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.330
need to know that something
will happen when you tap on it.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.210
Make it relevant.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.250
Make every tap count.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.377
Don't make users lose their time
by just tapping on something

00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:06.460
and then you say, you want
to look at the weather?

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.010
And then you show
the stock ticker.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.690
It doesn't make
any sense, right?

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.770
Try to make it more
relevant as you go.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.770
And make it immediate.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.020
When you optimize your code,
make interactive watch faces

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.797
that are fast, that
don't have any latency.

00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:22.130
Because sometimes, when you
tap on something and nothing

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.274
happens, you tap again.

00:06:23.274 --> 00:06:25.190
And then you're not
capturing the right state.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.520
So let's try to make things
very quick as possible

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.200
and make it immediate so
it makes to a better user

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.700
experience.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.840
So here are just a
very few examples

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.580
of where interactive watch
faces can work really well,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.620
in terms of use cases.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.030
Maybe you want to share
a picture with someone

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.220
or say you get a
nugget of information.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.610
You tap on it and you
expand to see more.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.960
Maybe you want to connect
with someone maybe

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.090
have a paired experience.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.591
We have a watch
face called Together

00:06:55.591 --> 00:06:57.090
that you can pair
with another watch

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.900
so you're immediately connected.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.240
So you can tap on the watch
face and send some kind

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.320
of emotional kind of signal.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.900
You can make little games.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.120
So you can make a little game
where someone taps on the watch

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.460
face, and you jump
to do something else.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.100
You can complete a task.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.700
Let's say, a task is
triggered by something that

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.870
happened throughout the day.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.330
It can just say, OK,
I'm done with this.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.840
You can delight,
you can have fun.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.660
You can do a lot of things.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.390
Those are just a kind
of basic examples

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.290
of how to think about
interactive watch

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.440
face in terms of use cases.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.510
So we have a lot of interactions
in Android Wear, and most of it

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.250
is reserved by the system.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.404
So for example, if you
look at this table here,

00:07:40.404 --> 00:07:42.820
the ones in the middle are
totally reserved by the system.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.850
So you can't swipe left or
right on the watch face.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.697
When you swipe
down you pull the--

00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:50.280
what do you call--
notification shade.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.967
So all those things
are reserved,

00:07:51.967 --> 00:07:53.550
and there's a couple
on there blocked.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.910
You can't pinch and zoom.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.820
For watch faces, what we decided
on is just to have single tap.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.540
And why just single
tap, you may ask.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.000
Why not double
tap or long press?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.050
All those interactions--
everything

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.950
that has an additional
tap will cause latency,

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.750
because you have
to measure the time

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.650
and then users are waiting
for something to happen.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.060
And we decided to
do it very simple.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.690
So people know when you
tap on a watch face,

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.790
you're only going to
interact with the watch face.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.440
That way, we make all
the other interactions

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.630
reserved for the system.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.139
So we make that
distinction clear

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:27.430
so users understand that issue.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.250
Makes it clear that everything
that's done by the user

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:37.360
is intentional, not an accident.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.860
OK.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.720
So now I'm going to go
through a couple of examples,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.761
and then I'm going to show
you a demo afterwards.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.540
Pretty much what I
want to show you here

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.472
is ways of thinking of how
you can use interactive watch

00:08:49.472 --> 00:08:50.805
faces to design your experience.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.860
It's up to you to
decide how you're

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.560
going to interact
with the watch face.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.350
You can tap on the
whole watch face, which

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.600
is kind of more forgiving.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.490
You just tap without looking
or on a specific target, which

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.770
will require the user to
look at the watch face

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.400
and decide where to tap.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.380
So this adds a little
more involvement

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.440
from the user
aspect, but those are

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.160
different routes you can take.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.254
So in the more forgiving
side, for example,

00:09:18.254 --> 00:09:19.795
you can just tap on
a watch face just

00:09:19.795 --> 00:09:22.010
to change the background color.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.520
You can just cycle, tap
on the watch face, cycle

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.020
through, and just maybe go
back to the first element

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.830
of the list.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.520
Or you can just do
some random changes.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.420
But that's more like to
just be more forgiving.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.289
We are using here just
the whole watch face.

00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:39.830
You can also use
the whole watch face

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.490
if you want to change the
whole state of the watch face.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.050
So here, for example, I'm using
kind of a weather watch face.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.780
You have the weather
icons in there.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.620
Once you tap on the
watch face you just

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.860
replace the background
with a temperature,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.350
and you tap back to go
back to the previous state.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.819
So in this way,
for example, you're

00:09:57.819 --> 00:09:58.860
changing the whole state.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.000
You're not specifically changing
a specific area of the UI.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
If you want to change a
specific area of the UI,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.470
you just have to design the
tap targets around the area

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.570
that you want to change.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.900
And here is a very basic example
of-- you have a little star.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.500
Once you tap on it, you can
cause any specific change

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.820
to that part of the UI.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.560
Following this principle, you
can tap on a specific area,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.900
and this area can expand to
reveal information inline,

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.570
and then you can
tap back to go back.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.500
For example, in this
example, we just

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.290
have a layer of complication
that shows your step counter.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.270
And when you tap on
the complication,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.290
you would expand inline, and
you would reveal my information.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.460
So that way you don't have to
get our favorite watch face,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.010
you don't have to
open a micro app,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.520
you don't have to look
at a notification.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.190
The information that
you need is there.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.023
And if you want to go
back to the watch face

00:10:47.023 --> 00:10:49.327
you do a single tap again.

00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:50.910
You can have an
approach that once you

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.980
tap on a specific icon,
you will open a micro app.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.660
So you may lose
a little context,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.080
but if your micro
app is designed

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.220
in a way that makes
sense in combination

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.680
with the watch
face-- sometimes you

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.580
can release an APK that
comes with the watch

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.550
face and the micro app.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.370
You tap on that complication or
the target on the watch face,

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.740
you open the micro app,
go about your experience,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.780
and then you swipe away to
go back to the watch face.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.780
And maybe you can even
have a combined approach.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.740
You can have an inline expansion
that shows more information.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.490
And then you see the
information you need,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.770
and you say, perhaps
I want to know more.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.372
You can also pair this with
opening your phone as well.

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:27.330
But you can just say,
OK, I looked at my steps.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.840
I want to know
what my history is.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.850
I want to see all the
kinds of activities

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.500
that I'm doing,
that I'm tracking.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.390
So you just tap
that complication.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.480
Open the micro app.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.190
When you go back you go
back to the initial state

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.830
of the watch face.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.022
Right now, I'm going
to show you a demo.

00:11:46.022 --> 00:11:47.480
Can you switch
please to the camera

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.600
so I can just do a
demo on the watch?

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.230
Can anyone see my screen?

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.680
Someone was calling me, I think.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.180
All right.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.930
So I'm going to show you
a couple of watch faces

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.810
that actually use
interactivity in a clever way.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.125
So this is a watch
face called Timer.

00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:20.000
The watch faces that
I'm going to show today,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.530
they're by us, too.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.890
They are a good partner of ours
that develops a lot of watch

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.240
faces for Android Wear.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.340
So this one is called Timer.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.280
As you see here, there's
a lot tap targets

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.940
around the watch face.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.860
And let's say I want to
have a timer for 20 minutes.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.450
I would just tap in this
and then it starts counting.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.550
It's a very minimal interaction,
but it's very effective.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.100
When you tap, you see the
thing happening right away

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.340
and it's-- the timer
starts to count down.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.840
You can change the
timer at anytime.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.691
Demo gods are not
helping me, I'm sorry.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:55.190
All right.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.680
So.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.600
OK, so I just changed
the timer to 20 minutes,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.264
and it starts counting.

00:13:01.264 --> 00:13:02.680
They have another
layout for this.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.054
I'm not going to
show this today,

00:13:04.054 --> 00:13:06.090
but you can see by
just one single tap,

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.500
you can actually make the
watch face more interesting.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.640
So you're pretty much combining
two watch faces in one, right.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.960
So you have your normal
watch face plus your timer.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.420
Here you're seeing
the always on mode.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.230
That just removes a lot of
the essential information that

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.340
needs a lot of
display pixels, and it

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.800
just focuses on essentials
and removes any interactivity.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.090
If you want to start again,
you just tap and then

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:31.970
you can do it.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.440
So I'm going to
cancel this timer.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.230
I'm going to show you
another watch face.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.440
So if you want to change
watch faces in Android Wear,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.980
you just long press and you
get into the watch face picker.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.870
So this is another
watch face by us, too.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.330
It's a very basic one.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.764
I'm sorry that the colors
are not showing so well.

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:51.180
So basically, the
only interaction

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.040
that you have in
this watch face is

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.060
when you tap, you can
just change colors.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:57.810
You go through it.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.600
You see that once you tap,
the reaction is immediate.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.190
And they use what we call
a material like ripple.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.600
It's a circle that
grows from the center,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.640
and that's how they
review the next color.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.920
And I think that they
have a limited selection

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.400
of color combinations.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.180
And I think they have 10.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.160
So you just cycle
through-- or even less.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.462
You cycle through, and it
doesn't do more than that.

00:14:20.462 --> 00:14:22.920
It just shows you the color,
but it's kind of a nice touch.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.878
It's like, I'm feeling
like having a new color.

00:14:24.878 --> 00:14:26.960
You just tap on it, and
it provides the light.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.730
Then I'm going to
show you what we-- I

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.290
call this the Uber
interactive watch face.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.420
I'm sorry if that crashed.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.808
I promise this was
working before.

00:14:49.808 --> 00:14:53.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:53.700
OK.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.513
So unfortunately, my demo broke.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.080
Can you switch to the
slides, please, again?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.010
If you look for interactive
watch faces on the Play Store,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.740
you're going to find already
hundreds of watch faces.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.980
And that one specifically
that I wanted to show you

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.280
is called Bits.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.990
And it's pretty
much a combination

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.290
of different complications
that you can configure.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.950
And once you tap
on the watch face,

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.620
you would expand inline to
reveal more information.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.270
All right.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:29.770
So.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.000
Wrong way?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.500
OK.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.640
So before we end
the presentation,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.930
I want to get into very
small technical details

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.010
about the touchbacks
that you have

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.020
to deal with when you
design a watch face.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.950
So Android has a minimal
touch target of 48 dp.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.150
And dp depends on--
it's a device pixel.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.515
It's kind of a
relative measurement.

00:15:56.515 --> 00:16:00.370
A device that has
very high resolution

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.750
would have more pixels
within that square.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.490
So the minimum suggested size
for Android is 48 pixels.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.450
So for us, we suggest using
a touch target of 90 pixels,

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.870
just to be more forgiving.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.910
You don't want people to
just look at your watch

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.240
and just trying to figure out
where they're going to tap.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.060
And the same applies for the
safety gaps between each tap

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:25.856
target.

00:16:25.856 --> 00:16:27.980
If you look at the watch
face that I showed before,

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.790
the one with the timer, it was
like they had very clear tap

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.670
targets, because they
drew a circle around them.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.960
But they were very generous
with the tap target

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.040
size, plus the space in
between, so you would not

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.480
tap in the one before
nor in the one after.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.790
So make sure when you design
your watch faces that the tap

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.790
targets are giving
sufficient space for the user

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.140
to interact without having to
fidget with the watch face.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.460
So when you design
promotable targets,

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.142
just try to find a
logical grouping.

00:17:00.142 --> 00:17:02.680
Don't make a random
combination of targets,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.210
nor try to use different
tap target sizes.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.560
If you do so, just make
sure that the target

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.310
sizes are intentional and
they make sense to the user.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.400
In the example that I
actually said before,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.250
they actually drew an outline
where the tap target is.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.210
So if you want to use
different tap targets,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.349
make sure the user
understands where they are,

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.569
because sometimes if you-- in
the beginning of this process,

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.298
we worked with certain partners.

00:17:25.298 --> 00:17:27.089
And some of the early
versions of the watch

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:31.500
faces, because we are actually
developing the guidelines,

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.309
we saw that sometimes
there were multiple targets

00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:36.600
in the same area and the
other area didn't have any tap

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.880
targets, and people
didn't know where to tap.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.310
And once they tap,
things are not

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.685
occurring because
you're actually

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:43.710
tracking the information
for another target.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.610
It's just kind of more
logical rules of layout

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.590
that you can apply
for watch faces.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.209
And in general,
for Android Wear,

00:17:52.209 --> 00:17:53.500
we try to do things glanceable.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.650
So when you look at
stuff, you should try

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.150
to get immediately what it is.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.046
So you shouldn't just
waste users' time

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:02.670
just trying to figure out-- when
they look at their watch face,

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.350
oh, where should I tap again.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.030
What is the size of the target?

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.900
What should I do
when it disappears?

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.950
So just try to make
it clear as you go.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:12.450
OK.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.290
So, if you want to learn more
about interactive watch faces,

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.640
we're going to have a little
workshop at the code lab room.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.200
And then we have office
hours from 2:00 to 4:00 PM.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.960
You can also check our
interactive watch face sample.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.610
It's on GitHub.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.230
And if you want
to know more, just

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.550
join our community of
Android Wear developers.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:38.690
And we're going to talk about
in the next talk about always

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.100
on watch face apps.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.900
And if you have any
questions, I'm here to answer.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.250
