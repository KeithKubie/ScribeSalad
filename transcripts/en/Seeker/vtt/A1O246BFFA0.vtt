00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.510
You thought sneezing and itchy eyes were bad?

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.590
Yeah, try having your skin feel like its on
fire every time you take a shower.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.910
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.270
I have terrible allergies, so about this time
of year I kind of start feeling sorry for

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.270
myself.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.270
But you know what?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.270
That ends today my friends.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.100
I have seen allergy hell, and it ain't pretty.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.570
Here are 5 real allergies people actually
have to put up with:

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.570
Number 1?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.570
WATER.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.150
I mean, you'd think that since our bodies
are MOSTLY WATER that might be a little problem.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.050
But, as it turns out, people with a water
allergy are alive and functioning - it's estimated

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.410
that 1 in every 23 MILLION people has it.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.340
The allergy is called Aquagenic Urticaria,
and it causes itchy hives when the person

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.820
comes into contact with water.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.870
The hives can last for hours.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.390
A woman from Britain has to drink diet coke
to survive and another from Australia can

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.420
hardly stand to shower for 1 minute before
it starts burning!

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.420
Poor thing!

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.020
I'll never take a shower for granted again.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.250
Well, I probably will like a week from now.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.250
Number 2: EXERCISE.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.089
It's the allergy we've all been hoping for.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.290
Nah, I'm just kidding.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.209
It actually sounds awful.

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.100
Exercise Induced Anaphylaxis can be lethal.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.909
It starts with hives and skin irritation,
then trouble breathing.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.060
If it is severe enough, anaphylaxis will cause
your blood pressure to drop and your lungs

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.000
tighten until you can't breathe.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.320
Scientists think that this rare condition
may be brought on by eating something they're

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.189
allergic to and then working out right after.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.689
Number 3: THE COLD!

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.179
I mean, I think I'm psychologically allergic
to the cold but there are some people who

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.090
form rashes and have trouble breathing when
they step out into the cold, find themselves

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.780
in cold water, or even drinking cold beverages.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.920
"Cold Urticaria" is an inflammatory disorder
that can cause a flood of histamine to be

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.619
released in the body, leading to a drop in
blood pressure, fainting, and even death.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.619
So much death.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.210
I guess I'll stop complaining about the cold
now.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.210
Number 4 is SEMEN.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.389
Semen allergies are definitely a thing, it's
thought to affect anywhere between 20-40,000

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.389
Americans.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.979
People with this allergy can experience vaginal
burning, swelling, itching, hives, and shortness

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.259
of breath after coming into contact with their
partner's semen.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.190
Strangely, there have also been a few cases
of men being allergic to THEIR OWN semen!

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.070
Doctors say the best way to treat this allergy
is to avoid contact all together -- but I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.290
dunno, that seems like it would be kind of
hard if it's coming out of your own body.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.280
Last up is the sun!

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.450
This is the most depressing thing I've heard
all day.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.410
It's apparently not even that uncommon for
someone to develop a rash, bumps, crusting,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.560
or blisters when they're exposed to sunlight.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.880
It takes the idea of a sunburn to a whole
new terrifying level.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.740
