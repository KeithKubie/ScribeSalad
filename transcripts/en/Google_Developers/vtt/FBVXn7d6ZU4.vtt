DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don Dodge.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.710
And this is Google Root Access.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.490
Today, my guest is Ryan Damico,
founder and CEO of Crocodoc.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.250
Welcome, Ryan.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.560
RYAN DAMICO: Thanks, Don.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.830
DON DODGE: So I met you about
six years ago in Boston.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.650
And at the time, you were
doing this web annotation thing

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.110
that you called Crocodoc.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.470
So tell me about how you
started, first of all?

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.220
RYAN DAMICO: Sure.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.350
So I started the company
out of my dorm room at MIT.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.460
And back then we called
ourselves WebNotes

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.260
because we were building note
taking software for students.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.412
And it was a classic
case of the startup that

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:43.620
solves a problem because
they think it's really cool,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.745
and obviously, the world's
going to come and buy it

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:46.670
once it's out.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.830
So we spent a good two
to two and a half years

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.790
building this
really good product

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.516
for creating highlights
and sticky notes

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.640
and other types of annotations
in your web browser,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.520
and we were so convinced that
everyone was going to love it.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.970
But we made the classic mistake
of solving a non-problem.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.610
We had a really well
executed product

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.170
that nobody cared about.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.519
So that was the very first
innovation of the company.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.940
DON DODGE: Was is that
they didn't care about it

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.490
or that they
wouldn't pay for it?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.310
RYAN DAMICO: That's
a good question.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.851
Well, A, we were
selling to students,

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:12.880
and that's a hard
thing to do regardless.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
But the more important issue
is that we weren't solving

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.515
a really burning,
hair on fire problem.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:19.640
We were building a set of
features that were really

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.767
perceived as nice to haves.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.850
DON DODGE: So it was a
vitamin, not a pain killer.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.552
RYAN DAMICO: Exactly, and we
learned that the hard way.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:26.510
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.570
And how did you pivot from that,
or did you do several pivots

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390
from there to where
you are today?

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.320
RYAN DAMICO: Well, there
was a main pivot when

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.774
we had spent a couple years
building this product,

00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:38.440
and we saw that it
was getting some use,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.830
but the growth was really flat.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.820
And we had added a
couple features, tested

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.800
some hypotheses, and
nothing was really

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.390
moving the needle too much.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.119
So right around that time,
we were running out of money

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:48.660
as a startup.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.060
We almost imploded as a company.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.637
We made a whole bunch of
mistakes as a startup.

00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:54.970
And then just as we pulled
up before hitting the ground,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.050
we moved from Boston
out to Mountain View

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.670
and went through Y Combinator.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.870
And that's when we started
trying bigger experiments

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.050
with the product.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.380
And the one that led to Crocodoc
was taking this one feature

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.449
from our product called WebNotes
where you could upload a PDF

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.380
file to your web browser, view
it in a Flash Player we built,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.760
and then actually highlight
it and add annotations to it.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.843
That was the thing people
seemed to like the most.

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:17.990
So we ripped that out of
WebNotes in a weekend.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.020
We re-branded it as Crocodoc.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.990
And we repositioned it
not as an academic tool

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.740
but as a way to
collaborate with coworkers

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.880
and actually annotate
presentations and documents

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.900
to get work done.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.440
And that's where
we started to see

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.140
some real traction and some
interest in the product.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.700
DON DODGE: So tell me
about Y Combinator.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.090
Or let me ask this question.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.870
Do you think you would have
gotten to the same point

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.070
and done the same pivot on
your own back in Boston,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.440
or did it take being in
the Y Combinator community

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.852
and in that cauldron of
ideas to get you there?

00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:48.560
RYAN DAMICO: I think
it certainly helped.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.890
Y Combinator was a
catalyst, for sure.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.320
And being surrounded by a
whole bunch of other startups

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.050
that were facing similar
issues, that really

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.411
helped to zoom out and get
some perspective in what we

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:58.910
were doing.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.130
And just moving the
company, across the company,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.440
we needed a big change
like that, metaphorically.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.600
So we did that.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.820
It caused us to reassess
what we were doing.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.830
If we hadn't, maybe we would
have come up with this change.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.090
But it would have taken
a longer time at least.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.980
DON DODGE: So I did a show a
few weeks ago about accelerators

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.870
and incubators and why you might
consider joining an incubator

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.910
and what you give up in equity.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.110
What was your experience at Y
Combinator, and in retrospect,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.996
do you think it was a
great decision to do?

00:03:28.996 --> 00:03:30.370
RYAN DAMICO: Yeah,
in retrospect,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.830
it was definitely
a great decision.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.413
I don't think we would've made
it as a company had we not gone

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:36.840
through Y Combinator, just
because when we started off

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.610
we were very naive
entrepreneurs.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.107
We were just heads
down, building

00:03:41.107 --> 00:03:42.940
things we thought were
cool, which is really

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.644
not the best way
to build a product.

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:46.060
So the best thing,
again, was just

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.110
being surrounded by those
other companies who,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.530
some had faced similar problems.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.090
Some were more advanced and
farther along than we were.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.910
But just getting to
see that perspective

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.990
and see that we weren't alone
in going through those struggles

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.100
and learning from
others in terms

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.850
of how they had dealt
with those problems,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.650
that was by far the most
beneficial aspect of it.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.270
DON DODGE: So it was beneficial,
and the equity that you gave up

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.854
didn't matter in the
scheme of things.

00:04:06.854 --> 00:04:07.811
RYAN DAMICO: It didn't.

00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:09.860
At first, we were really
hesitant-- oh, man, we

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.760
don't want to give up
these points of equity.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.140
But looking back, it should've
been such a no-brainer for us

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.230
because we were debating
whether to give up

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.720
a few points of equity for a
company that was just headed

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.303
straight in a nosedive
for the ground.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:22.695
So it was really
worth it for us,

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.530
and it was a fun
experience, too.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.960
DON DODGE: Awesome.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.850
So you did some
pivots from being

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.430
a consumer-facing freemium
app to an enterprise app.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.724
So that's where you are today.

00:04:35.724 --> 00:04:36.640
How did you get there?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.040
RYAN DAMICO: Sure.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.550
Well, there's one more key
pivot that nobody expected,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.090
which is that once we had this
Crocodoc product where we were

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.610
letting people collaborate
on PDFs and other documents

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.080
online, we made the decision
that, in order for us to be

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.580
successful, we had
to build the best

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.946
online viewer for
documents in the world.

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:54.320
Because unlike
images and videos,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.319
documents don't really
work natively on the web.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.984
So we saw that as
an opportunity.

00:04:57.984 --> 00:04:59.400
And we spent another
several years

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.000
actually ditching
everything we built in Flash

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.149
and recreating
everything in HTML5.

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:06.065
We wanted a faster,
lighter weight experience.

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:07.700
We wanted to get
onto mobile devices.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.550
So we made a big
technology decision

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.492
and made a big bet on that.

00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:12.450
And it really paid off.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.540
And the surprising thing
is that, once we actually

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.385
figured out we could actually
display Office and PowerPoint

00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:19.730
and PDF documents in
pure HTML in your web

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.147
browser and your
mobile device, we

00:05:21.147 --> 00:05:22.896
were going to use that
in our own product.

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:24.990
But before we could
recycle the technology back

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.070
into the company, we
started getting approached

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.890
by other companies
who saw what we built.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.530
And they said, hey, I like what
you're doing-- don't really

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.560
care for this businessy
product, but can we

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.920
embed the technology
in our own products?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.040
And that was the major pivot
that led us to the success

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.170
that we saw and eventually
became very profitable

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.030
doing as a company.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.360
So we actually licensed this
out, hosted a web-based SAS

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.420
API, and partnered
with companies

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.880
like Yammer, LinkedIn,
Facebook, Dropbox, SAP,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.237
all these companies who use
this in their own services,

00:05:53.237 --> 00:05:55.570
so that their users could see
documents in their own web

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.850
apps.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.330
And that's what took off.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.038
DON DODGE: So you
generated revenue early

00:05:58.038 --> 00:06:00.270
from that relationship.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.200
RYAN DAMICO: We did.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.304
Totally unexpected,
but it turns out,

00:06:03.304 --> 00:06:05.220
especially when you're
selling to enterprises,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.649
you've got to have the best
product, 10 times better

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:08.440
than anything else.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.290
And as a startup, what we
learned, again the hard way,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.090
is that you've got
to find a problem, A,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.610
you can solve better
than anyone else but, B,

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.776
that's narrow enough in
scope that you can solve it.

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.590
We were just a
seven-person company,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.680
and we were able to carve
out this niche for us

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.888
where we build the best
online document viewer, which

00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:24.800
is a very specific
kind of technology.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.216
But sure enough,
we did it so well

00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:28.200
that other companies
couldn't not take notice,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.420
and it really helped
us with our sales.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.640
DON DODGE: So how do you
convince a big company

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.210
to buy a product
from a tiny startup?

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.360
RYAN DAMICO: It's not easy.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.943
It's not easy.

00:06:36.943 --> 00:06:38.840
You've got to win on
product, for starters.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.820
So if you don't have
the best product,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.830
I don't think
you've got a chance.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.340
If you've got the best product,
then you have a chance.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.500
And for us, it helped
by really identifying

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.510
who was going to evangelize
us at the target company.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.750
So we worked with
folks, for instance,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.960
at Yammer who really believed
in what we were doing,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.870
saw the value for the
users, and worked with us.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.950
And as a startup, what
we did is just really

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.490
partnering with that person
and asked a lot of questions

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.220
about how we're
perceived, functionally

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.439
what do we have to do--
pricing is always difficult

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.480
when you're starting off.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.930
How is pricing perceived?--
and really built

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.820
up a great rapport.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.300
So we were just
asking questions,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.060
getting direct feedback,
and adapting the technology

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.920
in the business that
we were offering

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.480
to suit the needs
of the customer.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.710
DON DODGE: And how did
you target your customers?

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.690
How did you find them?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.190
RYAN DAMICO: That's
a good question.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.550
We were really lucky in
that most of our customers

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.870
all came to us.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.480
It's a really small
world out there.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.610
When we did our first
integration with Yammer

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.770
and that went live,
it went really well.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.345
It allowed users of Yammer to
upload all sorts of documents

00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:35.470
and actually view them and
then collaboratively add

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.710
highlights and comments
in Yammer's product.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.050
And for Yammer, this brought
users out of their inbox

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.210
and actually created a
whole new workflow on Yammer

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.420
which was really successful.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.390
A lot of other companies
took notice of this.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.931
And then soon enough,
we were working

00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:50.784
on resumes for LinkedIn,
internal presentations for SAP,

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:52.950
and all sorts of interesting
applications like that.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.446
So we just were approached
by lot of companies.

00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.070
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.400
Great story.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.070
Well, that's all we
have time for today.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.920
