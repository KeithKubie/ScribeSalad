00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.884
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that we want the distance between 2x, wherever that lies on the

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:09.865
number line, and 4 to be less than 6. So we can start at 4 and count over 6 in

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:15.154
one direction. Let's mark that. And then over 6 in the other direction. So we

00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:20.454
know where we'll need to put symbols now. We want 2x to be closer to 4, then 6

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:25.325
units away. So these are the upper limits of the range it can fall in, and we

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:30.516
need to shade in the area in between them. Neither end point is included because

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:35.309
we just have a less than sign, not a less than or equal to sign. So these two

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.739
values are negative 2 and 10. Written as an interval, we have this.
