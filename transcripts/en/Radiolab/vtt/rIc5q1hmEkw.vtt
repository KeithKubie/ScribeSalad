00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.050
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.890
and today it's patient zero. Let's try subject. Yeah. And this next story, oh,

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.540
it's so huge. It's the ultimate patient zero story.

4
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:15.620
Really many of us have lived through this. It was, it's as recent an event.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.520
It's, it's such a recent event that it still hurts and it still bleeds. Yeah.

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.750
And in it somewhere is a, literally the,

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.350
the patient that is called zero. So this was, yeah,

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.180
a lot of people are going to help us tell this story,

9
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:33.830
but starting us off is science writer, Radiolab, regular Carl Zimmer.

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.320
<v 1>So in 1981</v>

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.600
doctors for the first time described mysterious,

12
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:44.530
newly discovered disease syndrome, which affects mostly homosexual men.

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.470
The young men in Los Angeles are dying.

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.650
The number of cases has been growing faster and faster.

15
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.670
So far more than 80 Americans have died. 258 people have died.

16
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:57.220
625 people have died. Of course,

17
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:00.870
this is the part we all know how from those first few cases in La,

18
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.660
aids became one of the deadliest pandemics the world has ever seen.

19
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.870
More dangerous than the plague of the Middle Age.

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.450
In the back of the beginning there was a story that I have not been able to

21
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:14.080
shake for the last 30 years and it's a story I don't want to reimagine right

22
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:14.914
now.

23
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.910
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

24
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.350
<v 1>right after news of this syndrome started to break that science writer,</v>

25
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:23.990
David [inaudible], who along with Carl will be one of our guides.

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Epidemiologists were trying to figure out where did it come from and they were

27
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.390
thinking like, well, maybe it's a sexually transmitted disease.

28
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:37.100
So the CDC launches a study of a group of about 30 patients,

29
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.170
gay men in New York, Los Angeles,

30
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:43.220
and San Francisco to see who had had sexual contact with whom.

31
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.780
How do you get to us that just a series of interviews with people. Yeah,

32
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.830
please name all the people that you, that you've slept with.

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.230
<v 0>The CDC eventually releases the results of this survey in the form of a diagram</v>

34
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.500
like a network drawing with circles representing patients in lines representing

35
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.390
sexual contact and each patient,

36
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.100
each little circle was numbered New York seven Los Angeles 12 so you didn't know

37
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.670
who was who, but you could tell immediately when you look at

38
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.490
<v 1>this thing that of all the 30 or so circles,</v>

39
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.710
there was one circle that was special.

40
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.740
It had lines coming out in every direction,

41
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:20.390
seven or eight emanating from him like the hub of a wheel except all the spokes

42
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.750
on this wheel connected to other wheels which then shot out and connected to

43
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:27.710
other wheels fanning outward at the center of it all was that one little circle.

44
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.570
<v 0>Cool numbered zero number zero as far as we know,</v>

45
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:36.770
that was the first time that you ever get the term patient zero.

46
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.180
<v 1>Patient zero was on. I am the central victim and victimizer.</v>

47
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.640
<v 0>This is from a 60 minutes special. In 1988 that year,</v>

48
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.420
a reporter named Randy Schultz had written a book called and the band played on

49
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.690
that for the first time revealed the identity of patient zero.

50
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.520
<v 1>He was a French Canadian and very handsome airline steward, name gates,</v>

51
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.070
[inaudible] gates, and [inaudible] zero. A few minutes later in

52
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 0>the report, Schultes comes on to describe I've guy</v>

53
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.790
<v 3>who has got [inaudible]</v>

54
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.410
<v 0>limited sexual stamina.</v>

55
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.660
This sexual athlete who would fly from one hot spot to the next because of his

56
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.690
job having sex with literally thousands of men on his,

57
00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:17.660
he knew he was dying, at least according to Randy Schultz,

58
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.300
he became somewhat sinister and malicious.

59
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.410
He would sleep with a male partner at a bathhouse in San Francisco or somewhere

60
00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:28.370
else, and then when the light came up, according to Randy Shilts, he would say,

61
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.440
I've got gay cancer

62
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.640
<v 3>now. You're going to get it to your doctor. I talked to him. Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.260
<v 0>This is Dr Selma dreads. She was part of that CDC. Yes.</v>

64
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.590
<v 3>I told him that he was getting other people sick with it and he said,</v>

65
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.490
my rights to do whatever I want by civil rights.

66
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.930
I do as I please. I've got it. Why shouldn't they have it? They said,

67
00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:52.630
you can kill yourself. You wanted,

68
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.050
you got no right to take somebody else along with you. And you said screw you.

69
00:03:57.051 --> 00:03:57.884
And walked out.

70
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.410
<v 0>Really a chilling moment.</v>

71
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.520
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

72
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.510
<v 1>and pretty much from that moment on Gayton UGA, he just took on this,</v>

73
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:12.130
this aura as a single handedly causing a, a,

74
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.100
an epidemic in the United States. Now, I don't know about you,

75
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:18.140
but I first bumped into this story in the movie version of,

76
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.110
in the band played on my friend would talking about thousands of men whose faces

77
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:26.250
I cannot even remember. And you want name that's an actor playing gait,

78
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.193
new gun movie. Now,

79
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.850
when I first saw that aids had already infected two and a half million people,

80
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:35.851
and to think that it could all go back to this one guy just seemed unreal.

81
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.600
<v 4>It was a, it was a very, uh, potent story. There's no doubt</v>

82
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.750
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.900
<v 1>and, and he gave HIV to a lot of people. There's no question about that.</v>

84
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.440
But what we do know is that he was not patient zero.

85
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.850
<v 0>He was not patients there. No, he was not the beginning point.</v>

86
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.090
He was not even close. Huh.

87
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.110
So here's the question that got me started in the story. Yeah. Okay.

88
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:03.330
So the gay steward, that was the movie stuck in my head.

89
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:04.800
But what's the real movie?

90
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.400
What movie can we make about the beginning of the AIDS epidemic?

91
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.390
Because when you've got something so vast that according to some mass mints will

92
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:15.150
have killed 60 million people by the end of the decade.

93
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.380
What you need a beginning.

94
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.650
You need some way of explaining how this disaster happened and how it might

95
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.004
happen again.

96
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.840
<v 4>And how exactly do we know that Gayton Duco wasn't patient's euro? Well, um,</v>

97
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.470
there are a couple of reasons we know it. So, um,

98
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.900
so one thing that people started to do, scientists was to, um,

99
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.540
they went, started going back and looking at people who had died,

100
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.440
who died mysteriously aids, like things in the past might,

101
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:50.100
some of them have been early cases and they started finding a lot.

102
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.970
Robert Rayford had aids 12 years before it was recognized in this country.

103
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:57.830
In 1959 a sailor in Britain died of pneumonia.

104
00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.380
<v 0>And so for awhile you had all these new patients. Zero</v>

105
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.410
<v 4>in 1961 a nurse in Chicago died of Kappa Sarcoma,</v>

106
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.760
but the real definitive blow to this.

107
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.280
So patient zero nonsense came by actually looking at the virus itself

108
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.570
<v 0>in 1984, same year that gate unto God died.</v>

109
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.540
Scientists isolate the virus HIV,

110
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.590
which is really just a little string of genetic code that gets into your body

111
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:25.130
and into your cells and uses your cells to make copies of itself.

112
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.130
But here's the thing,

113
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.340
<v 6>when it replicates within a single patient, it copies itself. Um,</v>

114
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.693
in precisely,

115
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.220
<v 1>it mutates quickly.</v>

116
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.920
It changes a lot as the virus duplicates itself inside a person,

117
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.850
the dukes often have little copying errors and then little mutations,

118
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.990
it turns out those errors, they happen at a predictable rate.

119
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.040
You can kind of almost predict how many you're going to see in a year or five

120
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:56.430
years. And so the amount of changes that you see out there,

121
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.640
the diversity really of the viruses in the aids population.

122
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.310
Well that becomes really good information.

123
00:07:02.311 --> 00:07:06.540
And so a group of scientists began to look at the amount of diversity among HIV

124
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:08.670
patients in the u s and other parts of the world.

125
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.510
And the more diversity the longer the virus has been around. Right, right.

126
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.310
And they could use that kind of like a clock.

127
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.160
<v 0>If you have a virus here and a virus there,</v>

128
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.950
you could measure how different they are and you would know that it would take a

129
00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:21.990
certain amount of time for them to get that different.

130
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.430
And to make a long story short,

131
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.460
the picture they get is that aids entered the United States around 1966

132
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.840
<v 6>at a time when Gayton to God was still a virgin adolescent.</v>

133
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.510
<v 0>From there,</v>

134
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.310
scientists were able to trace the virus back to Haiti and from Haiti back to

135
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:41.144
Africa.

136
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.900
<v 4>It's been there the longest. It's had the longest time to become diverse,</v>

137
00:07:45.901 --> 00:07:49.950
to mutate, to evolve. So if you want to really, if you want to get to the,

138
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.690
to the real patients, your as it were,

139
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.600
the most interesting staff come actually comes from Africa.

140
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.670
So one way to try to figure out its origins there is to go looking for the

141
00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:00.504
virus.

142
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:00.640
<v 6>Yup.</v>

143
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.640
And that takes us back to Zr 59 and DRC 60 can we talk about them?

144
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:06.910
Sure.

145
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.910
What these are the two earliest known HIV positive human specimens,

146
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.650
<v 0>and this is where, for me at least,</v>

147
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.520
the story gets way bigger than I imagined from no.

148
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.510
The first sample zr 59 came to light in the late nineties somehow scientists

149
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.550
unearthed a very old tube of blood from a hospital in Kinshasa in the Democratic

150
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:28.560
Republic of Congo and when they tested it,

151
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.950
<v 6>it had HIV.</v>

152
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.100
This had been taken from a band to man in 1959 1959 right?

153
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.170
Yeah. Nobody knows his name.

154
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.070
Nobody even knows I think what he died of and that was the only one for a number

155
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.590
of years. That was our one glimpse

156
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.210
<v 0>into the kind of deep history of HIV.</v>

157
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.610
But then along comes that Guy Michael Warby.

158
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:52.690
He's an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and a few years ago

159
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.920
Michael went back to Kinshasa and found a second sample.

160
00:08:55.921 --> 00:09:00.300
He actually found the virus lurking in a tiny bit of human tissue that was

161
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:04.980
preserved in paraffin wax. It's kind of like a Hans Solo in,

162
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.460
uh,

163
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.480
in the star wars movie when he's kind of frozen in that carbonite or whatever

164
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.960
that stuff is. And this new sample, it was from the same town.

165
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.250
Kinshasa is the first and also more importantly from the same time,

166
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.230
1960 and with the two of them then you can kind of go back in time.

167
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.730
And so yes, like we described before,

168
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:26.070
you can measure the differences between the samples,

169
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:30.330
calculate how long it would take for those samples to get that different.

170
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.640
And in the end you can use these two samples to wind the clock all the way back

171
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:36.660
to the virus.

172
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.900
It started at all and it turned out the most recent common ancestor of those two

173
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:46.650
specimens goes back to two, about 1908,

174
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.760
1908. That is when it started in human beings.

175
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.880
What 1908 77 well roughly give or take a margin of error early 19 hundreds.

176
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.360
Wow. So around 1908 give or take,

177
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.980
something happened. That's right.

178
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:07.010
That moment is the spillover spill over spillovers the term the scientists use

179
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:12.651
to describe the moment when a virus in one species passes into another species.

180
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.630
New Diseases in humans tend to pop up from animals.

181
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.470
<v 4>So people said, okay, flu comes from birds. Where does HIV come from to get it?</v>

182
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.690
Then answer, you have to look beyond human beings.

183
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.960
You have to look at other viruses that are like HIV.

184
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.930
<v 0>So the search was on the inability to find a similar disease and research animal</v>

185
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.960
turns out right about the time that the HIV virus was discovered.

186
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.600
Scientists at the New England primate research center,

187
00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:42.260
some researchers found a virus like it in the CAC monkey monkey. In fact,

188
00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:43.910
it was so similar that they called it

189
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.190
<v 4>Sib Simian immunodeficiency virus. Yes.</v>

190
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.040
<v 7>And that's where the origin quest started. This is Beatrice Han.</v>

191
00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:56.360
I'm a professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.

192
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.030
And so after they found it, macaques, what happened? Um,

193
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.230
it took a couple of years,

194
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.090
but eventually she says they found Siv instill another primate species to sooty.

195
00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:09.410
Mangabey and then in a few more African green monkeys mandrill pretty soon it

196
00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:10.250
was all over the place.

197
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.660
Now I think 40 different species of African monkeys known to have their own

198
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:16.670
version of Siv. So then the question was,

199
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:21.080
which one of these monkeys or primates pass it to us? Then unexpectedly,

200
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:26.110
a researcher named Martine Martine Peters at the center in Gabon decided to test

201
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:29.810
her chimps who? Orphan chimpanzees and Bingo.

202
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.040
<v 0>She found a very, very close match,</v>

203
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.810
<v 7>a virus that was the closest relative of HIV one. So everybody said, well,</v>

204
00:11:37.811 --> 00:11:38.300
you know,

205
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.660
<v 0>it was a gym. It was a gym. Okay, yeah, it came from chimp. Yes.</v>

206
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.040
But then the question was, well, which chimps or rather where,

207
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:46.940
where exactly.

208
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.060
So Beatrice Hahn and her colleagues started looking at chimps that came

209
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.093
different parts

210
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.230
<v 7>of western Central Africa.</v>

211
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.920
Now getting blood samples from chimps in the wild is pretty much,

212
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.750
it just isn't feasible, you know,

213
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:05.030
because in the wild they hide the moment they see us. So you,

214
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.900
you get stuck with fecal samples, poop? Oh yes.

215
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.410
There's lots of DNA in there and viruses.

216
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.610
So they would just go to where the chimpanzees would sleep at night and they

217
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:18.280
would just, you know, collect some poop, bring it back to the lab,

218
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:23.281
and Beatrice would analyze all the viruses over 90 different wild communities

219
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:27.340
from every part of central Africa, over 7,000 different fecal samples,

220
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.270
and slowly they were able to piece together which communities were infected in

221
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:34.690
which ones had the closest HIV one. That's when it hit us

222
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.783
<v 0>first time.</v>

223
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.900
What exactly hit you that geographic origin of these chimps in 2006 her and her

224
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:46.530
colleagues published at the human aids virus comes from a group of chimps,

225
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:51.330
a very specific group that live in a very specific place.

226
00:12:51.331 --> 00:12:56.331
This little corner of southeastern camera between the Bloomberg River and Goco

227
00:12:57.841 --> 00:12:59.250
river and the Sanga River.

228
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.090
These chimps were essentially penned in between these three rivers

229
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.530
<v 6>scenario. Probably only have a hundred square miles. Not much more than that.</v>

230
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:08.230
Wow.

231
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.340
<v 0>When we're looking at what humans have and we're looking at what all of those</v>

232
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.020
chimps in Africa have,

233
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.910
the most perfect match is this little territory up there in Cameron.

234
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.960
Yeah. There is no other virus that is any closer. So that's that.

235
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.020
So can you reconstruct the spillover and the WHO that it spilled over into as

236
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.060
best, you know, as best as [inaudible]

237
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.160
<v 6>you can understand, it can hypothesize.</v>

238
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.780
And the best hypothesis is the cut hunter hypothesis.

239
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.040
The cut hunter, the cut hunter. That's right. A hunter who gets cut.

240
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.180
And what can we say about this guy? I mean as you, what do we know about it?

241
00:13:45.181 --> 00:13:46.360
If we had to guess,

242
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.480
if we had to guess that human was probably a band to man living very near the

243
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:56.470
forest or in the forest and southeastern Cameroon,

244
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.880
<v 9>he was hunting.</v>

245
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.140
<v 6>Maybe he had a bow and Arrow, maybe he had a spear</v>

246
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.180
<v 9>and uh,</v>

247
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.473
<v 10>kills the champions.</v>

248
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.560
<v 6>Bingo. Here's a big pile of me and he starts to put your head,</v>

249
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.060
he's cutting open the chest cavity. He's pulling out organs and

250
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.980
he cuts himself and he gets blood to blood contact chimpanzee blood against his

251
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:24.304
blood.

252
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:31.050
What happens is that the virus in the chimpanzee blood found itself in an

253
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:34.990
environment that was unexpected, that was alien to it,

254
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:40.290
but was not too much different from the biochemical environment.

255
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.190
It had been in chimpanzee blood.

256
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.030
It could function and that's the moment.

257
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.100
That's the moment it begins that human is patient zero.

258
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.190
The why then

259
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.950
<v 0>why 1908 I mean presumably people have been hunting ships for a really long</v>

260
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:01.520
time. Why wouldn't this guy be patient 7 million?

261
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.030
<v 6>That's another of the big questions.</v>

262
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.210
People certainly in in central Africa have been eating monkeys

263
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:11.080
<v 0>for thousands of years. I mean, David says there's really no way to know,</v>

264
00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:13.440
but this could have just been the right virus. Maybe

265
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.670
<v 6>a particular virus evolved in a way that made it more transmissible in humans</v>

266
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.960
<v 0>or maybe it just got lucky to come along at precisely the right time.</v>

267
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.160
What you're looking at this is Carl again,

268
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:31.250
is a time when this part of Africa was being heavily colonized.

269
00:15:32.221 --> 00:15:34.650
The French and the Belgians were building trained systems.

270
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.090
The populations were on the move can Shaza which was then Leopoldville.

271
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.310
It was exploding. It was huge.

272
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.330
The cities were attracting people from the boonies in those days.

273
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.650
So by 1908,

274
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.060
all the virus has to do is get from that tiny village where the cut hunter lived

275
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.310
to one of the new cities. That happens almost certainly by river

276
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.820
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

277
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.820
<v 6>I was stirred by the work of Beatrice on and Mike Warby to see what this</v>

278
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.570
scenario looked like on the ground

279
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:06.860
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

280
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.390
<v 6>so I went to southeastern camera and,</v>

281
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:12.380
and I chartered a little boat about a 30 foot wooden boat with an outboard

282
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:14.930
motor, any trace, the path of the virus.

283
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.380
We went down the and Goco river and we stopped at a few villages.

284
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.450
There are a couple of little villages there,

285
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:23.270
one of which has a market where you can buy um,

286
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.970
monkey meat and crocodile meat.

287
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.870
And he says it wasn't hard to imagine how it all might've went down.

288
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.510
Perhaps the cut hunter gave the virus to a woman who then passed it on to a

289
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:37.640
fisherman fellow that I called the voyager

290
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.270
<v 0>who then gotten a boat is David did</v>

291
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.910
<v 6>and carried it down the river. Sanga River, which is the Goco,</v>

292
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.880
is a tributary of the Sanga. Sanga becomes a bigger river 200 meters wide,

293
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.470
which then flows to the Congo river, the big river, and into the city.

294
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.600
And I imagine him sliding into Brazzaville

295
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.730
around 1920 the first HIV positive man to arrive an urban center where there's

296
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.690
much greater density of humans, where there are prostitutes,

297
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.290
a greater fluidity of social and sexual interactions.

298
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.740
And that seems to have been the place from which the disease went global.

299
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.990
<v 0>So that's how it happened.</v>

300
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:41.890
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

301
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.110
<v 0>we can take it back even farther actually. What do you mean</v>

302
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.540
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

303
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.230
<v 0>all right guys, if you want to make a movie about this start of it. Well,</v>

304
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:49.100
this is not the start

305
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.070
<v 11>because we got it from chimps. Right? Right.</v>

306
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.500
So you could ask her who was chimp's zero, what do we know about chimps? Zero,

307
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.360
right? Yeah. I mean everything comes from somewhere. And again,

308
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:08.361
by molecular work scientists have been able to determine that the chimp fires is

309
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:11.460
actually, it actually comes from two monkey viruses,

310
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.940
two different monkeys from two completely different species.

311
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.580
What would they have encountered each other somewhere or had a fight?

312
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.010
Uh, they probably encountered each other in the stomach of a chimp.

313
00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:25.680
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

314
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.330
<v 11>meaning what? Well, from the perspective of a chimpanzee monkeys,</v>

315
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.140
they look tasty. This is Nathan Wolfe,

316
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.590
professor and human biology at Stanford University. And he says,

317
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:40.680
to fully understand this part of the patient,

318
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.110
you're a rather chimp zero narrative.

319
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.260
You have to grasp how it is that chimps hunt.

320
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.610
And this is something he witnessed in the Kabale national forest in,

321
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.320
in southwestern Uganda.

322
00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:00.300
<v 13>Describe to US watching three male chimps converge on a tree.</v>

323
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.940
Fourth call this monkeys, which are those really small black and white.

324
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.170
And one individual managed to grab two juvenile.

325
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.350
And then the three individuals all met up and

326
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.330
began to,

327
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.920
<v 11>the monkey was still alive. The chimpanzee was going after, uh, an Oregon,</v>

328
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.910
you know, that that obviously was a tasty morsel that, that he was going after.

329
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:26.840
And, and the monkey was, uh, was screaming bloody murder.

330
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.700
It is quite disturbing to watch, he says, but the,

331
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.970
one of the things that struck me at that moment

332
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.980
was the depth of contact between the blood.

333
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:40.930
And Body fluids of this monkey and the chimpanzee.

334
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.640
The chimps are literally covered in blood and blood on their face,

335
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.740
in their eyes and from the virus perspective.

336
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.980
This is spillover heaven. Okay,

337
00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:58.400
so the following is the closest that we can get to a zero point in this entire

338
00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:02.510
narrative. We don't know where it happened and we don't know exactly the time.

339
00:20:02.511 --> 00:20:05.540
Say some hundreds of thousands of years ago from the molecular clock.

340
00:20:05.541 --> 00:20:07.910
We know it was less than a million years. That's all we know.

341
00:20:07.911 --> 00:20:09.410
But whenever it was chimps,

342
00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.190
zero was hunting and he comes upon a monkey called a red cap.

343
00:20:13.191 --> 00:20:15.560
Mangabey the red Cap Mangabey. This is a,

344
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.220
a larger primate and these are tree dwelling. A little little guy tree dwelling,

345
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.890
a little bit of red for on their heads. Yes. Chips, zero spots.

346
00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:23.480
One of these monkeys eats it

347
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.960
and then the process key catches a red cap mangabey version of the AIDS virus.

348
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.030
Next, sometime after that first kill weeks,

349
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.730
months, we don't know, maybe it was the same day.

350
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:45.030
Chimp zero comes across another monkey and this monkey was called a spot.

351
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.640
Knows Quentin. Yes, it's got a spot, its nose, I assume. There you go.

352
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.240
Very small.

353
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.080
One of the tiniest monkeys of all of the old world monkeys and chips,

354
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:58.081
zero eats that monkey and gets a spot nosed Guinen version of the AIDS virus for

355
00:20:58.531 --> 00:21:00.030
the HIV virus inside.

356
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.690
So you've got the Red Cap Mangabey and you've got the spot.

357
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.970
Knows Gwen who've got a [inaudible] and a Mangabey,

358
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.650
two completely different kinds of Siv viruses inside the same chimp. Now,

359
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.200
under normal circumstances, according to Nathan,

360
00:21:13.201 --> 00:21:17.690
both of these Siv viruses would go nowhere because one,

361
00:21:17.691 --> 00:21:19.320
one of these viruses makes the jump.

362
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.070
They go from a place they've adapted to and that they know to a completely

363
00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:27.000
foreign landscape like a human being dropped off on Mars,

364
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.170
maybe without a space suit.

365
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.500
I mean they basically are entering a completely alien habitat.

366
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.330
The cells don't look the same.

367
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.930
The environment is different and the chimps immune system would normally kill

368
00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:40.530
them, but then once in a blue moon, something crazy happens.

369
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.350
These two viruses will end up inside the same cell, in the same chip.

370
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.730
At the same time,

371
00:21:47.731 --> 00:21:52.290
literally there is a single cell simultaneously infected with both viruses to

372
00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:54.840
suppose on one side of the cell you've got the Mangabey virus

373
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.823
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

374
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.030
<v 11>and on the other side of the same cell you've got the spot nose Gwen and virus.</v>

375
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.160
And what happens is, uh, literally inside the cell you have an enzyme,

376
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.760
it's called the polymerase enzyme that's copying genetic information to the

377
00:22:15.921 --> 00:22:20.160
virus. This is what viruses do.

378
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.250
They hijack these enzymes to make copies of themselves.

379
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.673
<v 8>No,</v>

380
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.350
<v 11>here's the problem. These, these enzymes,</v>

381
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.040
they're not necessarily that sticky and while they're in the process of copying

382
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:36.060
one virus, every once in awhile they'll accidentally fall off,

383
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.680
make copy and go black and latched on to the second virus and just keep on

384
00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:46.650
copying. And so what it ends up spitting out is a hybrid

385
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.763
<v 8>that</v>

386
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.140
<v 11>no, this new mosaic probably won't go anywhere because</v>

387
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.450
99.999999999% of the time when these hybrids happens, dead end,

388
00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.040
the chimps immune system is pretty sophisticated.

389
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.210
It has evolved defenses against these viruses and it will destroy them.

390
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.370
But again, once in a blue moon. So this is a blue moon after a blue moon,

391
00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:15.020
after a blue moon to really get this.

392
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.710
Finally you get one particular mosaic virus

393
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.833
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

394
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.540
<v 11>we in the main could be in the quad and that through sheer random luck,</v>

395
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.620
it landed on the exact right combination of genes that allowed it to evade the

396
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.090
chimp's immune system. I mean,

397
00:23:36.091 --> 00:23:39.840
one of the amazing things to think about is how many,

398
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.730
how many hopeful monsters you had to have in order to get that one that actually

399
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.510
probably trillions, boom.

400
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:55.100
<v 14>Suddenly in a flash from these two viruses that can barely survive in the chimp,</v>

401
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.833
you get a new virus,

402
00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.380
<v 11>it's a little bit Mangabey, little bit in cannot only survive in the chimp,</v>

403
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.980
but can thrive. In fact, for this baby virus,

404
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:08.690
the chimp is the perfect host and that was the virus that ended up spreading,

405
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.240
jumping over into humans.

406
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.870
And it's been this massive and incredibly traumatic sort of tear in the fabric

407
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:18.704
of humanity.

408
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.163
<v 7>Uh,</v>

409
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.870
<v 6>let me add another parentheses.</v>

410
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.560
There are essentially 12 major groups of the HIV virus.

411
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.250
<v 11>What David means is it 12 different kinds of HIV?</v>

412
00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:43.610
Viruses have spilled over 12 different times.

413
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.500
<v 6>Eight of them came from monkeys,</v>

414
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.880
three of them came from chimps and one came from gorillas. Wow.

415
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.920
And of those 12 only one of them is responsible for the global pandemic.

416
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.890
There are 12 kinds, 12 times that we know about.

417
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.970
That's probably happened dozens and dozens more times that we don't know about.

418
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.140
So the spillover is not a highly improbable event.

419
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.320
<v 11>These sorts of viruses, they're constantly paying at us.</v>

420
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:12.710
They're pinging at us and pinging it at us. We see it happening all the time.

421
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.390
You see it happening all the time.

422
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.530
Nathan has set up a series of monitoring stations in places like central Africa

423
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.760
and he and his colleagues have been tracking what he calls the viral chatter in

424
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:24.590
the people who hunt these primates.

425
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.950
We collected specimens from the animals that they were hunting.

426
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.250
They compare that to blood samples from the hunters themselves. And guess what?

427
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:35.090
We found a whole range of new retroviruses that we're moving over into these

428
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:36.320
hunters. For example,

429
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:39.110
he's been tracking something called the Simian foamy virus,

430
00:25:39.111 --> 00:25:41.360
which is first in the same family as HIV.

431
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.620
And he has seen it hot from an individual gorilla to an individual human who

432
00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:46.850
killed that gorilla. Yeah.

433
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:50.450
These are almost certainly what we call primary transmission events. Oh,

434
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.260
says you really are looking at the potential beginning of something. Yes,

435
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.100
you want a patient zero and really clear patient zero. Uh,

436
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.100
it's some of these individuals that have been affected with these viruses.

437
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.030
And the real question is, how do we stop patients heroes?

438
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.880
How do, how do we avoid patient, the patient one and patient two. Exactly.

439
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.290
So Nathan is developing a series of tools like digital surveillance. I mean,

440
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:17.270
some of these places, uh,

441
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.140
I work in some places in Democratic Republic of Congo.

442
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.970
You basically have to fly in to get there. No roads, often, no electricity

443
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.030
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

444
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.370
<v 11>but many of these places, they still have cell phone towers.</v>

445
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.330
So Nathan has begun to track cell phone call patterns in these communities.

446
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.250
So if he sees a blip of many calls to a medical center within a short period of

447
