00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.150
In this session we saw some
of the great safety features

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.890
Apple has included in the Swift
programming language.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.950
Of course, even with these
features errors will occur.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.120
But by adhering to the safe code
practices taught here, you'll

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.530
be well on your way to writing clean
code and minimizing debugging time.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.590
See you in the next session.
