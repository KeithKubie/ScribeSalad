JEREMY WALKER: Hi, my
name's Jeremy Walker.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.910
I'm here for YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.120
And today is all about GDEs.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.410
What's a GDE, you might ask?

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.510
It's a Google Developer Expert.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.400
These are people that help
us with supporting the APIs

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.540
and spreading knowledge
about the APIs.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.240
So they help us answer
questions on stack overflow,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.330
they talk at events, they
help us with hackathons.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.496
There's lots of great stuff.

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:30.540
And we had a GDE
summit where a bunch

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.226
of them from around the
world came out to see us.

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:35.790
So we wanted to make sure
we pulled them in and did

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.810
a couple of interviews
with each of them

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.530
so we could see what
they were up to.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.210
Our first one is from
Utah, Jarom McDonald.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.540
And enjoy the show.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.250
Next, we have our newest
addition to the team, Jarom.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.540
He's from Utah.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.257
So say hello.

00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:51.840
JAROM MCDONALD: Hi,
how are you doing?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.090
JEREMY WALKER: So we were
talking, before this event,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.490
a little bit about the
live streaming API, which

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.890
for anybody that
doesn't know, it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.510
allows you to tape live
events and put them up

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.662
on YouTube in real-time.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:06.120
Can you tell us a little bit
about what you were telling me

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.410
about the opportunities you saw?

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.270
JAROM MCDONALD:
Being in education,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.650
I think that the
live streaming API

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.300
is perfect for really
helping extend education

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.230
into distance fields, whether
we're talking about classrooms,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.670
whether it's lectures, trying
to get more people involved

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.430
in educational opportunities.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.380
The live stream in API
and its ease-of-use

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.090
is really poised
to do that well.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.330
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.890
Is there anything
that surprised you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.840
from when you started
from integration

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.050
with the live streaming API?

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.174
JAROM MCDONALD: I think
one of the biggest benefits

00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:38.970
is the fact that you only have
to send one stream to YouTube

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.000
through the API.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160
And then YouTube takes
care of all the transcoding

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.026
for multiple devices
in multiple formats.

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:45.650
Most of the time when
you see platforms

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.200
like this they ask
you to send multiple

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.970
streams, but YouTube
just requires the one.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.845
JEREMY WALKER: Right.

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:51.510
Yeah, that's true.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.520
Anything that you'd request,
maybe to improve it?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.100
JAROM MCDONALD: Probably just
requiring fewer subscribers

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.020
before allowing
someone to use the API.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.410
Right now the limit on
the number of subscribers

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.430
is too high, according
to most developers who

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.931
want to get their
hands on this API.

00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:06.805
JEREMY WALKER: Right.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:07.395
It was 1,000.

00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:09.270
And we've dropped it to 100.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.220
And keep your eyes on that.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.194
Well, thanks for joining
us here in Mountain View.

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:15.610
If you're in Utah,
I'm sure you'll

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.790
get to see Jarom quite a bit,
talking about the YouTube APIs.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.880
But feel free to join us for
our next couple of interviews.
