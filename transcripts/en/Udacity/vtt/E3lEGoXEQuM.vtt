00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.620
And that's exactly what we're going to look at next,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.630
relationships in the class diagram, how they're represented and

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.010
what they mean. First of all relationships as the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.550
name says, describe interactions between classes or between objects in

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.510
my system. And we will describe three main types

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.060
of relationships. The first one is called a Dependency

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.450
relationship. And we can express that as X uses

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.840
Y and we represent it with a dashed directed line.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.170
So when we have such a line between two classes

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.020
that means that the first class uses the second one. And

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.520
we're going to provide an example of a dependency in a

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.960
minute. The second type of relationship is an association that can

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.880
also be an aggregation. We'll see what the distinction is.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.470
But basically, what this means is that we can express that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.640
as a X has a y. So x contains a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.950
y. And if it is in association, we indicate it with

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.570
a solid undirected line. If it's an aggregation,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.740
we indicate it in the same way, but with

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.510
a diamond at one of the ends. Finally, the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.740
third type of relationship is what is called Generalization.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.300
And this can be expressed as x is a

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.620
y. So this is the relationship that expresses inheritance.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.600
Specialization between two classes. It's represented with a solid

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.190
directed line with a large open arrow head at

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.030
the end. Going from the more specialized class to

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.770
the less specialized class. So going from the subclass to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.740
the super class. So now let's look at each relationship

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.360
in more detail using our example, our course management system.
