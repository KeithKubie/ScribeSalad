which case they might as well just sit
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190
which case they might as well just sit
there and do nothing which would

there and do nothing which would
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.750

doing now so how do they extract
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.870
doing now so how do they extract
themselves from that dilemma they do it

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
themselves from that dilemma they do it
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.030
themselves from that dilemma they do it
eeeh logically but they don't care

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
eeeh logically but they don't care

which post-modernism emerged and so they
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539
which post-modernism emerged and so they
say well yeah you can't get any

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
say well yeah you can't get any
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.819

direction from post-modernism but we

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
direction from post-modernism but we
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.319
direction from post-modernism but we
don't we're not going to worry about

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
don't we're not going to worry about
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.609
don't we're not going to worry about
that because we don't worry about such

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
that because we don't worry about such
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.850
that because we don't worry about such
things what we'll do is just use sleight

things what we'll do is just use sleight

of hand to push forward the
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.870
of hand to push forward the
communitarian doctrines out of which our

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
communitarian doctrines out of which our
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.900
communitarian doctrines out of which our
original hypothesis emerged and everyone

says well we'll turn a blind eye to the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
says well we'll turn a blind eye to the
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.070
says well we'll turn a blind eye to the
paradox because we actually need

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
paradox because we actually need
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.820
paradox because we actually need
something to do

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
something to do
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680
something to do
and plus to the degree that we're

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690
and plus to the degree that we're
 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.740
and plus to the degree that we're
communitarian we can take out our

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750
communitarian we can take out our
 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.720
communitarian we can take out our
nihilistic resentment and arrogance and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
nihilistic resentment and arrogance and
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.390
nihilistic resentment and arrogance and
ingratitude on every single person we
