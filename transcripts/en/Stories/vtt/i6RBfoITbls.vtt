00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.780
I don't think in 20 years of doing this, that
I've done one thing that takes sick people

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.420
and makes them well people nearly as incredibly
is this does.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.640
You can dispute the ickiness of this, but
I don't think anybody can dispute anymore

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.640
the efficacy of this.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.179
The science is clear.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:33.320
It's like a miracle.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.860
Ryan Schneider was a healthy 25-year-old when
he developed a mysterious, debilitating condition.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.680
I was being treated for what I now know is
chronic pelvic pain.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.090
I was seeing urologists for it that were trying
to diagnose it, and they thought it was other

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.190
conditions such as an STD or a UTI.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.370
And so they were just prescribing me antibiotic
after antibiotic.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.770
And I didn't know at the time how devastating
those are on your body.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.250
And so what the antibiotics did is kill all
of the healthy bacteria, if you will.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.300
Every morning I was waking up vomiting before
work, and I would still go to work and just

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.530
feel terrible all day.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.590
It basically made my immune system similar
to that of somebody who's infected with HIV

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.939
or AIDS or cancer.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.520
It was from a stool sample that I finally
found that I had C. diff.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.130
Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, is a bacterium
that lives in the colon and can cause a number

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.020
of severe symptoms such as diarrhea, fever,
weight loss, nausea, and pain.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.229
It affects about a half million patients a
year.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.179
And it kills an estimated 15,000 to 30,000
people annually.

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.159
Normally I'm 175 pounds.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.689
I weigh about 155 right now.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.600
So I've lost a ton of weight in the last year.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.189
Most people with C. diff, which is what Ryan
has, the dominant symptom is diarrhea.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.359
It's really horrible, horrible diarrhea.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.259
They're tired, they lose weight.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.740
They're fatigued, they have a belly ache.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.100
It can be life-threatening.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.229
People can die of this.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.060
None of the medications help with my symptoms.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.950
Are you taking anything else?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.009
I am on Prozac now.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.700
I'm seeing a therapist because it's just been
really draining, having this disease for so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.740
long.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.170
My appetite's not good.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.320
I'm feeling nauseous all the time.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.660
I'm having trouble sleeping.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.840
I'm anxious.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.069
Many people with Ryan's condition have turned
to a unique procedure known as a fecal transplant,

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.500
which involves taking poop from a healthy
donor and inserting it into a patient's colon

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.790
to recolonize good bacteria into their system.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.870
The population that we're treating this way,
this is their last resort.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.099
They've been sick for a minimum of six months.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.099
And this cures them.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.069
The classic case that I take care of has an
over 90% success rate.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.030
A nonprofit in Massachusetts called Open Biome
works with doctors across the country to provide

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.810
them with screened fecal matter.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.409
They're essentially a poop bank.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.090
So we process stool from healthy donors and
send it out to hospitals all over the country

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.170
for use in the medical procedure fecal microbiota
transplantation.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.880
Can you tell us a bit about the process?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.239
We have a three-step process for becoming
a donor.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.159
Overall the pass rate is about 4%.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.689
So it's about twice as hard to become a donor
as it is to get into Harvard.

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.110
So you go through 109-point clinical assessment.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.860
If you clear that, and most people don't,
then you go on and bring in a stool sample.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.680
And if you pass that, then you go in and get
a blood draw.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.990
Because we invest quite a bit of money and
time and finding donors, we pay the donors

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.090
40 bucks a sample.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.000
For every poop we've got to process it within
an hour of passage.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.640
Once material's collected, processed, then
it sits in our freezer and quarantined for

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640
60 days.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.250
So it's sort of under medical supervision
during the collection process.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.959
And then if they pass at the end, then we
release the material for use and we'll send

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.340
it out to clinics.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.250
I think the average is about 150 to 200 grams.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.239
The biggest sample we've ever seen is 581
grams, which is just ginormous.

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.609
Like that almost completely filled these containers.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.209
So I just weighed this sample here.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.510
I grab one of these filter bags.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.400
So this is just pumping the liquid through
a filter here.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.620
Do some of the donors have a smell that you
recognize?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.209
Some donors, I would say, are generally stinkier
than others, but I wouldn't say they have

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.370
a trademark smell per se.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.950
So it's no longer in that log form.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.950
We broke it all up.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.210
I'm just using this pipette, and we're just
transferring the liquid into the bottles.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.039
We're ready to freeze these, and that's it.

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:33.130
The minimum size is enough to create one treatment,
but of course, bigger is always better.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.250
We encourage fiber.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.259
We're dealing with life and death issues for
patients, and we take that really, really

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.259
seriously.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.560
But we also like to recognize that there's
a pretty funny element to what we do as well,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.800
and particularly with our donors, get them
motivated and engaged.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.919
What we've done is we've given kind of an
avatar to each donor.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.870
And so there's a bunch of poop-related puns,
like Albus Dumpledor or--

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.590
Ninja Turdle.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.590
Ninja Turdle.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.780
Scooby Doo Doo's a good one.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.889
It's nice to have a bit of fun.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.830
How did you find out about donating your feces
for science?

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.020
They had a flier up that they were passing
around.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.390
We were kind of standing around laughing about
it, and it was saying, $40 for every poop,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.990
and I was thinking, like, man, this sounds
great.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.479
How do you collect a poop donation?

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.080
There is a little, looks like a cooler container.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.780
It sits in the toilet bowl with a little kind
of rack.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.470
So you pretty much just go like you normally
would, as long as your aim is all right.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.069
It gets in the bowl and then you just pop
a lid on it and that's that.

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.880
It was really weird at first, especially the
first couple samples I turned in.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.889
But everyone so nice, without a filter, in
terms of talking about poop around here, that

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.800
I quickly adjusted to it.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.979
So now it's second nature.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.540
Especially at the end of every week they tell
you, here's how many people you saved this

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.540
week.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.540
I mean, it was something I was doing every
day anyway.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.520
Why not help people?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.259
After learning about the success rate of fecal
transplants, Ryan is preparing to undergo

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.259
the procedure.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.919
Do you feel weird about having somebody else's
fecal material put into your body?

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.800
It was weird at first, but I don't even think
about that at all any more, because the way

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.180
I feel now is weird.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.230
I want to feel back to normal.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.199
I don't really care what it takes to get that.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:36.300
I just want to feel normal again.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.349
This is done pretty simply with a colonoscopy.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.349
So we flush them out.

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:42.349
They get an IV.

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.330
They get sedated.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.120
I take a colonoscope, I drive it to the top
of their colon, and then we have syringes

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.530
that are full of replacement poop.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.849
And we literally inject 250 ccs or so of poop.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:56.889
That's about a soda can.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.860
It's somewhere-- the volume's about 10 ounces
of poop.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.650
We go all the way to the top, we inject it
inside.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.870
We take the camera out.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.780
What's success for you?

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.350
Like, let's say 100%?

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.350
80%?

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:20.070
Yeah, I mean, if I was just not having diarrhea
any more after the surgery, and not having

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.250
pain any more, that would be success.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.790
To see a negative test for C. diff.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:36.759
So it took us eight months to treat the first
thousand patients.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.319
And then it took us four months to treat the
next thousand patients.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:45.310
So we wouldn't be surprised if in the next
year we're treating more like 5,000 or 10,000

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.690
patients a year.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.060
Our mission is to change the epidemiology
of C. diff, and really start to make a dent

00:07:51.060 --> 00:08:03.139
in the overall national mortality of the disease.

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:05.780
