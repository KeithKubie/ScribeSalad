00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.760
 
so I've got something to say about these

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770
so I've got something to say about these
 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.329
so I've got something to say about these
balls today and also something called

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
balls today and also something called
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.709
balls today and also something called
and to poedel points or antipodal points

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719
and to poedel points or antipodal points
 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.600
and to poedel points or antipodal points
i don't know which way people like to

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
i don't know which way people like to
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.520
i don't know which way people like to
say it but I'm just going to call them

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
say it but I'm just going to call them
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.350
say it but I'm just going to call them
antipodal points the best way you can

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
antipodal points the best way you can
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.939
antipodal points the best way you can
think about it is on the planet Earth

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
think about it is on the planet Earth
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.830
think about it is on the planet Earth
you have to believe the earth is round

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
you have to believe the earth is round
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.070
you have to believe the earth is round
then it has a north and a South Pole now

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
then it has a north and a South Pole now
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.790
then it has a north and a South Pole now
those points are antipodal or antipodal

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
those points are antipodal or antipodal
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.820
those points are antipodal or antipodal
which means if you draw a line between

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
which means if you draw a line between
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.230
which means if you draw a line between
the North and South Pole

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
the North and South Pole
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.389
the North and South Pole
it'll pass straight through the center

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
it'll pass straight through the center
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.549
it'll pass straight through the center
of the earth so they're exact opposites

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
of the earth so they're exact opposites
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.410
of the earth so they're exact opposites
on a sphere but I want to just show you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
on a sphere but I want to just show you
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110
on a sphere but I want to just show you
first a map of the world so here what

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
first a map of the world so here what
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510
first a map of the world so here what
I've got is a flattened out map of the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
I've got is a flattened out map of the
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970
I've got is a flattened out map of the
world so this isn't the world this is a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
world so this isn't the world this is a
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.680
world so this isn't the world this is a
flat version of it don't get confused

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
flat version of it don't get confused
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720
flat version of it don't get confused
between the two okay this is a flat

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
between the two okay this is a flat
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.869
between the two okay this is a flat
representation of a spherical world so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
representation of a spherical world so
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.209
representation of a spherical world so
North and South is up here the North and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
North and South is up here the North and
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.740
North and South is up here the North and
South Pole but there's little many many

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
South Pole but there's little many many
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360
South Pole but there's little many many
more points we can have there's the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
more points we can have there's the
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.939
more points we can have there's the
equator right and so if we picked a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
equator right and so if we picked a
 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.119
equator right and so if we picked a
point on the equator say boom right here

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
point on the equator say boom right here
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.549
point on the equator say boom right here
in the Indian Ocean we could find out

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
in the Indian Ocean we could find out
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.890
in the Indian Ocean we could find out
what the antipodal point is and that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
what the antipodal point is and that
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.570
what the antipodal point is and that
would be 180 degrees around so for us

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
would be 180 degrees around so for us
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.270
would be 180 degrees around so for us
that would be we find that we end up

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
that would be we find that we end up
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390
that would be we find that we end up
here but also if we got a point here

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
here but also if we got a point here
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.310
here but also if we got a point here
there's an integral point here or here

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
there's an integral point here or here
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350
there's an integral point here or here
or here basically there's an infinite

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
or here basically there's an infinite
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.320
or here basically there's an infinite
number right but it doesn't have to just

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
number right but it doesn't have to just
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.399
number right but it doesn't have to just
be on the equator

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
be on the equator
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800
be on the equator
there's also antipodal points in

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
there's also antipodal points in
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230
there's also antipodal points in
different places most interestingly you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
different places most interestingly you
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149
different places most interestingly you
can actually pick different towns or

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
can actually pick different towns or
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.270
can actually pick different towns or
different locations so we could pick say

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
different locations so we could pick say
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.249
different locations so we could pick say
here in Auckland there's a famous spot

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
here in Auckland there's a famous spot
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.060
here in Auckland there's a famous spot
for rugby fans Eden Park which is right

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
for rugby fans Eden Park which is right
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.600
for rugby fans Eden Park which is right
here and the antipodal point for that is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
here and the antipodal point for that is
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.499
here and the antipodal point for that is
again we go back 180 degrees which we

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
again we go back 180 degrees which we
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.810
again we go back 180 degrees which we
end up somewhere over here but then we

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
end up somewhere over here but then we
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960
end up somewhere over here but then we
have to flip and we go up and then we

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970
have to flip and we go up and then we
 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.010
have to flip and we go up and then we
end up down here in southern Spain so

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
end up down here in southern Spain so
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.459
end up down here in southern Spain so
these two points are as far away apart

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
these two points are as far away apart
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.289
these two points are as far away apart
as you can be from one another if I look

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
as you can be from one another if I look
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569
as you can be from one another if I look
at my tennis ball there's something

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
at my tennis ball there's something
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.510
at my tennis ball there's something
interesting we've got a scene right now

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
interesting we've got a scene right now
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.130
interesting we've got a scene right now
the seam actually cuts the surface

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
the seam actually cuts the surface
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.490
the seam actually cuts the surface
into two equal areas that little patch

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
into two equal areas that little patch
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.010
into two equal areas that little patch
there equals that patch there so this

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
there equals that patch there so this
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.670
there equals that patch there so this
seam is nice and smooth it's a loop cuts

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
seam is nice and smooth it's a loop cuts
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.550
seam is nice and smooth it's a loop cuts
the surface into two equal areas but if

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
the surface into two equal areas but if
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860
the surface into two equal areas but if
I just do a little bit of a research

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
I just do a little bit of a research
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.630
I just do a little bit of a research
here look what I find and typical points

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640
here look what I find and typical points
 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.699
here look what I find and typical points
so on the baseball again we've got the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
so on the baseball again we've got the
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.680
so on the baseball again we've got the
same situation two pieces of leather

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
same situation two pieces of leather
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.870
same situation two pieces of leather
that are exactly the same shape exactly

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880
that are exactly the same shape exactly
 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.300
that are exactly the same shape exactly
the same area and they have this seam

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
the same area and they have this seam
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.850
the same area and they have this seam
it's nice and smooth so it cuts the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860
it's nice and smooth so it cuts the
 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430
it's nice and smooth so it cuts the
surface into two equal areas and yes

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
surface into two equal areas and yes
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.400
surface into two equal areas and yes
I've got my finger on this on the seam

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
I've got my finger on this on the seam
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.160
I've got my finger on this on the seam
and my thumb and look I could rotate it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
and my thumb and look I could rotate it
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.400
and my thumb and look I could rotate it
like it's North and South Pole and then

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
like it's North and South Pole and then
 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.650
like it's North and South Pole and then
of course a cricket ball which is sort

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
of course a cricket ball which is sort
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.690
of course a cricket ball which is sort
of the simplest because it's just got an

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
of the simplest because it's just got an
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.630
of the simplest because it's just got an
equator running straight through Shh you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640
equator running straight through Shh you
 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.979
equator running straight through Shh you
could pick you can really run your

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
could pick you can really run your
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.160
could pick you can really run your
fingers all around the cricket ball and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
fingers all around the cricket ball and
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.780
fingers all around the cricket ball and
you can find heaps and heaps but yep

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
you can find heaps and heaps but yep
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.460
you can find heaps and heaps but yep
there it goes this is special if we've

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
there it goes this is special if we've
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.490
there it goes this is special if we've
got a situation where we have a surface

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500
got a situation where we have a surface
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.280
got a situation where we have a surface
of a sphere if we have the surface cut

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290
of a sphere if we have the surface cut
 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.120
of a sphere if we have the surface cut
into two equal areas with a simple loop

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130
into two equal areas with a simple loop
 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.729
into two equal areas with a simple loop
then that loop will contain and typical

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739
then that loop will contain and typical
 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.789
then that loop will contain and typical
points and now that to a mathematician

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799
points and now that to a mathematician
 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.410
points and now that to a mathematician
is a very exciting proposition there has

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420
is a very exciting proposition there has
 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.479
is a very exciting proposition there has
to be a reason why that happens because

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489
to be a reason why that happens because
 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.289
to be a reason why that happens because
I can tell you any loop which cuts the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299
I can tell you any loop which cuts the
 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.509
I can tell you any loop which cuts the
surface of a sphere into two equal areas

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519
surface of a sphere into two equal areas
 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.270
surface of a sphere into two equal areas
will always contain antipodal points

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280
will always contain antipodal points
 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.069
will always contain antipodal points
this has actually got a really special

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079
this has actually got a really special
 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.530
this has actually got a really special
history for me because when I was

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540
history for me because when I was
 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.830
history for me because when I was
studying maths at Melbourne Uni a friend

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840
studying maths at Melbourne Uni a friend
 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.720
studying maths at Melbourne Uni a friend
of mine who was just another student his

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730
of mine who was just another student his
 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.300
of mine who was just another student his
name is John he was brilliant at

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
name is John he was brilliant at
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.699
name is John he was brilliant at
mathematics and he actually came up with

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709
mathematics and he actually came up with
 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.979
mathematics and he actually came up with
this so he was just looking at a tennis

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989
this so he was just looking at a tennis
 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.960
this so he was just looking at a tennis
ball and sort of looked at the same and

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970
ball and sort of looked at the same and
 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.069
ball and sort of looked at the same and
found and typical points and he said

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079
found and typical points and he said
 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.930
found and typical points and he said
exactly that and he proved it and he

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940
exactly that and he proved it and he
 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.520
exactly that and he proved it and he
explained to me the proof and for me

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530
explained to me the proof and for me
 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.960
explained to me the proof and for me
this was like one of the most beautiful

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
this was like one of the most beautiful
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.670
this was like one of the most beautiful
experiences just someone coming up with

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680
experiences just someone coming up with
 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.930
experiences just someone coming up with
math so I don't even know if this is a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
math so I don't even know if this is a
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.029
math so I don't even know if this is a
theorem if it's out there I don't really

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039
theorem if it's out there I don't really
 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.740
theorem if it's out there I don't really
care because it happened to me it's a

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750
care because it happened to me it's a
 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.870
care because it happened to me it's a
personal experience so I want to prove

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
personal experience so I want to prove
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.210
personal experience so I want to prove
this to you right now brady

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220
this to you right now brady
 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.040
this to you right now brady
okay right we need to have an

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050
okay right we need to have an
 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.990
okay right we need to have an
understanding about and typical points

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000
understanding about and typical points
 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.610
understanding about and typical points
to be able to make this work and I think

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620
to be able to make this work and I think
 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.080
to be able to make this work and I think
the best way to do it is looking at

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090
the best way to do it is looking at
 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.250
the best way to do it is looking at
something we're familiar with which is

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260
something we're familiar with which is
 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.890
something we're familiar with which is
the world we live on already showing you

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
the world we live on already showing you
 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.010
the world we live on already showing you
that the equator has antipodal points by

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020
that the equator has antipodal points by
 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.860
that the equator has antipodal points by
going 180 degrees in the opposite

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870
going 180 degrees in the opposite
 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.320
going 180 degrees in the opposite
direction and then also we've got these

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330
direction and then also we've got these
 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.950
direction and then also we've got these
two towns so in actual fact or the way

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960
two towns so in actual fact or the way
 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.360
two towns so in actual fact or the way
you find an interpretive point from

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370
you find an interpretive point from
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.980
you find an interpretive point from
wherever you are so where you are right

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990
wherever you are so where you are right
 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.550
wherever you are so where you are right
now is that you've rotate by 180 degrees

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
now is that you've rotate by 180 degrees
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.700
now is that you've rotate by 180 degrees
and then you flip your location from if

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710
and then you flip your location from if
 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.020
and then you flip your location from if
you're in the northern hemisphere to the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030
you're in the northern hemisphere to the
 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.240
you're in the northern hemisphere to the
southern hemisphere or vice versa so

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250
southern hemisphere or vice versa so
 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.240
southern hemisphere or vice versa so
it's the same latitude so you basically

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250
it's the same latitude so you basically
 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.220
it's the same latitude so you basically
go 180 degrees and then you use the

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230
go 180 degrees and then you use the
 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.820
go 180 degrees and then you use the
equator as a mirror so this here is

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830
equator as a mirror so this here is
 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.710
equator as a mirror so this here is
rotating by 180 degrees and then if we

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720
rotating by 180 degrees and then if we
 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.110
rotating by 180 degrees and then if we
take the same distance here to here

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120
take the same distance here to here
 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.490
take the same distance here to here
which is taking the mirror image and

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500
which is taking the mirror image and
 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.470
which is taking the mirror image and
then we'll end up in the south of Spain

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480
then we'll end up in the south of Spain
 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.370
then we'll end up in the south of Spain
so that's how we get an antipodal point

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380
so that's how we get an antipodal point
 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.430
so that's how we get an antipodal point
but what if we took the entire map of

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440
but what if we took the entire map of
 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.210
but what if we took the entire map of
the world and mapped it to its end

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220
the world and mapped it to its end
 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.990
the world and mapped it to its end
typical points

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000
typical points
 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.350
typical points
I've got another map of the world like

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360
I've got another map of the world like
 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.830
I've got another map of the world like
so and so first of all I need to move it

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840
so and so first of all I need to move it
 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.320
so and so first of all I need to move it
over 180 degrees and I can do that

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330
over 180 degrees and I can do that
 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.140
over 180 degrees and I can do that
really simply by cutting straight

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150
really simply by cutting straight
 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.080
really simply by cutting straight
through the Greenwich Meridian which is

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090
through the Greenwich Meridian which is
 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.040
through the Greenwich Meridian which is
0 I'm gonna cut straight through here ok

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050
0 I'm gonna cut straight through here ok
 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.960
0 I'm gonna cut straight through here ok
so this is now going to go 180 degrees

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970
so this is now going to go 180 degrees
 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.380
so this is now going to go 180 degrees
which means I move this over here and I

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390
which means I move this over here and I
 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.770
which means I move this over here and I
move this behind but then we need to do

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780
move this behind but then we need to do
 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.620
move this behind but then we need to do
a mirror image which is really simple if

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630
a mirror image which is really simple if
 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.650
a mirror image which is really simple if
you've got transparencies you just turn

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660
you've got transparencies you just turn
 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.380
you've got transparencies you just turn
it upside down so there we go so now we

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390
it upside down so there we go so now we
 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.310
it upside down so there we go so now we
have the two maps flipped and we can see

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320
have the two maps flipped and we can see
 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.510
have the two maps flipped and we can see
here there we had Auckland so Eden Park

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520
here there we had Auckland so Eden Park
 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.550
here there we had Auckland so Eden Park
and Eden Park is now over there and it's

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560
and Eden Park is now over there and it's
 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.159
and Eden Park is now over there and it's
ok I've got a pretty spot on so it's

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169
ok I've got a pretty spot on so it's
 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.560
ok I've got a pretty spot on so it's
pretty close what's interesting as well

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570
pretty close what's interesting as well
 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.390
pretty close what's interesting as well
as you can see a lot of the land

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400
as you can see a lot of the land
 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.250
as you can see a lot of the land
of the world actually kind of mapped to

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260
of the world actually kind of mapped to
 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.520
of the world actually kind of mapped to
oceans so you've got maybe Argentina

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530
oceans so you've got maybe Argentina
 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.250
oceans so you've got maybe Argentina
here and Chile goes to parts of China

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260
here and Chile goes to parts of China
 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.450
here and Chile goes to parts of China
you have Borneo going to parts of the

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460
you have Borneo going to parts of the
 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.140
you have Borneo going to parts of the
northern parts of South America but yeah

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150
northern parts of South America but yeah
 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.780
northern parts of South America but yeah
what if it seems to Australia look it's

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790
what if it seems to Australia look it's
 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.400
what if it seems to Australia look it's
in the middle of the Atlantic and you've

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410
in the middle of the Atlantic and you've
 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.560
in the middle of the Atlantic and you've
got Africa sort of taken up this area

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570
got Africa sort of taken up this area
 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.080
got Africa sort of taken up this area
here in the Pacific so in most parts of

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090
here in the Pacific so in most parts of
 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.460
here in the Pacific so in most parts of
the world if you go straight through the

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470
the world if you go straight through the
 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.530
the world if you go straight through the
center so wherever you are and go

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540
center so wherever you are and go
 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.379
center so wherever you are and go
through the center you'll end up wet

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389
through the center you'll end up wet
 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.090
through the center you'll end up wet
yeah we you'll burn to death first but

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100
yeah we you'll burn to death first but
 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.920
yeah we you'll burn to death first but
anyway you'll end up wet on the other

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930
anyway you'll end up wet on the other
 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.840
anyway you'll end up wet on the other
side that's a good thing cuz you're

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850
side that's a good thing cuz you're
 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.180
side that's a good thing cuz you're
probably burnings of it if you look at

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190
probably burnings of it if you look at
 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.960
probably burnings of it if you look at
say our beautiful home country Brady so

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970
say our beautiful home country Brady so
 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.779
say our beautiful home country Brady so
the continent of Australia if we flip it

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:13.789
the continent of Australia if we flip it
 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:15.430
the continent of Australia if we flip it
you can see what Australia looks like in

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440
you can see what Australia looks like in
 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.100
you can see what Australia looks like in
the anti put antipodal and typical map

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110
the anti put antipodal and typical map
 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.350
the anti put antipodal and typical map
but what do you notice about the area of

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360
but what do you notice about the area of
 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.659
but what do you notice about the area of
Australia with the real Australia and

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669
Australia with the real Australia and
 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:23.920
Australia with the real Australia and
then the end typical Australia what do

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930
then the end typical Australia what do
 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.279
then the end typical Australia what do
you notice about those two areas the

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289
you notice about those two areas the
 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:31.510
you notice about those two areas the
same yes yes so what that means is an

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520
same yes yes so what that means is an
 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.770
same yes yes so what that means is an
antiphonal map preserves area so if you

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:35.780
antiphonal map preserves area so if you
 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.379
antiphonal map preserves area so if you
have a region and it has an area inside

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:38.389
have a region and it has an area inside
 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:41.260
have a region and it has an area inside
it if you map it to another region that

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270
it if you map it to another region that
 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.719
it if you map it to another region that
area is the same and that's really

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:43.729
area is the same and that's really
 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.760
area is the same and that's really
important but what we're doing here I'm

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770
important but what we're doing here I'm
 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.580
important but what we're doing here I'm
going to take this tennis ball and I'm

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.590
going to take this tennis ball and I'm
 

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.520
going to take this tennis ball and I'm
going to transpose it to the map the map

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:51.530
going to transpose it to the map the map
 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.200
going to transpose it to the map the map
that I was using so there's lots of

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.210
that I was using so there's lots of
 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.089
that I was using so there's lots of
different ways that you can map a a

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:55.099
different ways that you can map a a
 

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:59.140
different ways that you can map a a
sphere to to a map but the way we were

00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.150
sphere to to a map but the way we were
 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.120
sphere to to a map but the way we were
using it well there's a separate video

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.130
using it well there's a separate video
 

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.060
using it well there's a separate video
really you kind of come down once so I'm

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.070
really you kind of come down once so I'm
 

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.850
really you kind of come down once so I'm
not used to being this imprecise that's

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:06.860
not used to being this imprecise that's
 

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.350
not used to being this imprecise that's
right I'm just going to think it's a

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360
right I'm just going to think it's a
 

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.540
right I'm just going to think it's a
poorly manufactured tennis ball here's

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:10.550
poorly manufactured tennis ball here's
 

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.700
poorly manufactured tennis ball here's
one we prepared earlier and it's perfect

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:12.710
one we prepared earlier and it's perfect
 

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.120
one we prepared earlier and it's perfect
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.130
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
 

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.659
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
create a transparency so I can do a

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:18.669
create a transparency so I can do a
 

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:22.000
create a transparency so I can do a
antipodal map or an antipodal map which

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.010
antipodal map or an antipodal map which
 

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.640
antipodal map or an antipodal map which
doesn't involve calculating moving

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.650
doesn't involve calculating moving
 

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.180
doesn't involve calculating moving
around now I should have mentioned if

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.190
around now I should have mentioned if
 

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.210
around now I should have mentioned if
this was nice and perfect which it is in

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:31.220
this was nice and perfect which it is in
 

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:38.140
this was nice and perfect which it is in
this whole area in here

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.150
 
 

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.820
 
is exactly half the total area and so is

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:42.830
is exactly half the total area and so is
 

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.330
is exactly half the total area and so is
this and this is half total so this is

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:46.340
this and this is half total so this is
 

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.970
this and this is half total so this is
half total and this is half total and so

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:48.980
half total and this is half total and so
 

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.340
half total and this is half total and so
now if I take this little dually like

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.350
now if I take this little dually like
 

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.970
now if I take this little dually like
you here I could probably just make this

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:54.980
you here I could probably just make this
 

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.090
you here I could probably just make this
make my life easy there like that and go

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:58.100
make my life easy there like that and go
 

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.520
make my life easy there like that and go
like that and I'll give it a cut down

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:00.530
like that and I'll give it a cut down
 

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.130
like that and I'll give it a cut down
the middle so I'm going to craft my own

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140
the middle so I'm going to craft my own
 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.040
the middle so I'm going to craft my own
typical map so let's do that now so now

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.050
typical map so let's do that now so now
 

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:11.700
typical map so let's do that now so now
we've got this 180 degrees voila and

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:11.710
we've got this 180 degrees voila and
 

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:21.400
we've got this 180 degrees voila and
then flip and so that's rough

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.410
then flip and so that's rough
 

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.440
then flip and so that's rough
that's rough I've missed that altogether

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:23.450
that's rough I've missed that altogether
 

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.570
that's rough I've missed that altogether
here's one we prepared earlier you

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:25.580
here's one we prepared earlier you
 

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.190
here's one we prepared earlier you
should have six pairs and their typical

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200
should have six pairs and their typical
 

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.750
should have six pairs and their typical
points so you'll have twelve

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760
points so you'll have twelve
 

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.000
points so you'll have twelve
intersections which correspond to six

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.010
intersections which correspond to six
 

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.400
intersections which correspond to six
and typical pairs yeah six north/south

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.410
and typical pairs yeah six north/south
 

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.870
and typical pairs yeah six north/south
how did you get hand drawn Wow it's

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880
how did you get hand drawn Wow it's
 

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:46.510
how did you get hand drawn Wow it's
terrible so hand drawn I got one got hmm

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:46.520
terrible so hand drawn I got one got hmm
 

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.980
terrible so hand drawn I got one got hmm
I don't even know what's going on here

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:47.990
I don't even know what's going on here
 

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.590
I don't even know what's going on here
okay we have everything we need to now

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600
okay we have everything we need to now
 

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.410
okay we have everything we need to now
prove that if you have a simple closed

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:53.420
prove that if you have a simple closed
 

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.960
prove that if you have a simple closed
loop that cuts the surface of the sphere

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:55.970
loop that cuts the surface of the sphere
 

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.570
loop that cuts the surface of the sphere
into two equal areas and that loop must

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:58.580
into two equal areas and that loop must
 

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.090
into two equal areas and that loop must
always contain antipodal points or

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.100
always contain antipodal points or
 

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.280
always contain antipodal points or
antipodal points now the way we're going

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:03.290
antipodal points now the way we're going
 

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.590
antipodal points now the way we're going
to do that is that we're going to create

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600
to do that is that we're going to create
 

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.440
to do that is that we're going to create
a loop that doesn't have antipodal

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.450
a loop that doesn't have antipodal
 

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.900
a loop that doesn't have antipodal
points but we're going to just assume

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:13.910
points but we're going to just assume
 

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.110
points but we're going to just assume
that it actually cuts the surface area

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120
that it actually cuts the surface area
 

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.020
that it actually cuts the surface area
of the sphere into two equal areas all

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.030
of the sphere into two equal areas all
 

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.940
of the sphere into two equal areas all
right and we can do that because this is

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:21.950
right and we can do that because this is
 

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.480
right and we can do that because this is
the way mathematicians think what if so

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.490
the way mathematicians think what if so
 

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.210
the way mathematicians think what if so
I'm gonna create a curve here and I'm

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:28.220
I'm gonna create a curve here and I'm
 

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.350
I'm gonna create a curve here and I'm
gonna come and bring it down yeah yeah

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360
gonna come and bring it down yeah yeah
 

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.950
gonna come and bring it down yeah yeah
and maybe where should I pop out well

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:35.960
and maybe where should I pop out well
 

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.890
and maybe where should I pop out well
I've got to pop out somewhere there so

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:38.900
I've got to pop out somewhere there so
 

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.620
I've got to pop out somewhere there so
make it actually work my ruler gonna go

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:43.630
make it actually work my ruler gonna go
 

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.920
make it actually work my ruler gonna go
now this loop doesn't have an typical

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:47.930
now this loop doesn't have an typical
 

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.090
now this loop doesn't have an typical
points but let's just say

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.100
points but let's just say
 

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.130
points but let's just say
and please that check because it's not

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140
and please that check because it's not
 

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.519
and please that check because it's not
true it doesn't matter this is half area

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:58.529
true it doesn't matter this is half area
 

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:02.180
true it doesn't matter this is half area
total we can do that now let's create

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:02.190
total we can do that now let's create
 

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.080
total we can do that now let's create
and antipodal mouth so I'm going on

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.090
and antipodal mouth so I'm going on
 

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:12.050
and antipodal mouth so I'm going on
handed this now and not only that I'm

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060
handed this now and not only that I'm
 

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:21.890
handed this now and not only that I'm
gonna copy these little lines here so

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:21.900
gonna copy these little lines here so
 

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.660
gonna copy these little lines here so
first of all 180 degrees doesn't look

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:26.670
first of all 180 degrees doesn't look
 

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:37.310
first of all 180 degrees doesn't look
good but then we click and it works so

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320
good but then we click and it works so
 

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.450
good but then we click and it works so
as you can see the the loop here doesn't

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:41.460
as you can see the the loop here doesn't
 

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.220
as you can see the the loop here doesn't
have and typical points because I did

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:43.230
have and typical points because I did
 

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.329
have and typical points because I did
the any typical map and it didn't

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:44.339
the any typical map and it didn't
 

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:46.940
the any typical map and it didn't
intersect it did when we did the tennis

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:46.950
intersect it did when we did the tennis
 

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.160
intersect it did when we did the tennis
ball it did it would when you have the

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.170
ball it did it would when you have the
 

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.290
ball it did it would when you have the
baseball or the cricket ball they would

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300
baseball or the cricket ball they would
 

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.110
baseball or the cricket ball they would
intersect these don't intersect but I'm

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120
intersect these don't intersect but I'm
 

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.290
intersect these don't intersect but I'm
claiming that this is half the area but

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300
claiming that this is half the area but
 

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.700
claiming that this is half the area but
that means this is half the area so 1/2

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:01.710
that means this is half the area so 1/2
 

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.660
that means this is half the area so 1/2
plus 1/2 is already the hole and what's

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:05.670
plus 1/2 is already the hole and what's
 

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.240
plus 1/2 is already the hole and what's
all this bit in the middle that should

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:08.250
all this bit in the middle that should
 

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.110
all this bit in the middle that should
be equal to 0 but it's not and so as we

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120
be equal to 0 but it's not and so as we
 

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.400
be equal to 0 but it's not and so as we
doing maths it's a contradiction and so

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:16.410
doing maths it's a contradiction and so
 

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.750
doing maths it's a contradiction and so
that's the reason why on a tennis ball

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760
that's the reason why on a tennis ball
 

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.900
that's the reason why on a tennis ball
on a baseball on a cricket ball you have

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:23.910
on a baseball on a cricket ball you have
 

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.180
on a baseball on a cricket ball you have
these areas which are equal

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.190
these areas which are equal
 

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.160
these areas which are equal
cutting the surface into two equal areas

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.170
cutting the surface into two equal areas
 

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.280
cutting the surface into two equal areas
the seam is nice and smooth it's a loop

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.290
the seam is nice and smooth it's a loop
 

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.550
the seam is nice and smooth it's a loop
they have to contain and typical points

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560
they have to contain and typical points
 

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.270
they have to contain and typical points
it comes down to the beautiful

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:37.280
it comes down to the beautiful
 

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.910
it comes down to the beautiful
continuous symmetry of the sphere you

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920
continuous symmetry of the sphere you
 

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.960
continuous symmetry of the sphere you
know if you're the sort of person who

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:41.970
know if you're the sort of person who
 

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.850
know if you're the sort of person who
holds a baseball and finds yourself

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860
