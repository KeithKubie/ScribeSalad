00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:42.920
In today’s era of streaming and YouTube
where we as consumers have the power to pick

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.710
and choose the songs we listen to and curate
our own playlists, the idea of a homemade

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.140
mixtape is either quaint or completely alien
depending on how old you are.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.809
Go back just a few decades in the UK though
and you’d find heavy-handed warnings in

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.030
almost every cassette tape sleeve telling
you, quite matter of factly, that “Home

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.069
Taping Is Killing Music” with the qualifier,
“And it’s illegal”.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:10.360
This oddly aggressive morality campaign, which
seems to repeat itself any time a new medium

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.260
is developed in the entertainment industry
despite these campaigns universally failing

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.140
to accomplish anything, was launched in this
case as a direct result of the introduction

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.940
of blank cassette tapes.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.159
Specifically, the campaign was launched by
what was then known as the British Phonographic

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.759
Industry (henceforth shortened to BPI) on
October 28th, 1981 on behalf of basically

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.770
the entire British music industry.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
(The BPI is a trade association that represents
nearly every record label and thus nearly

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.649
every musician, in the UK.)

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.610
While the technology to record or copy music
onto a blank tape had existed for some time

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.920
at this point, a cheap, consumer-friendly
version of the technology wasn’t readily

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.729
available in the UK- or, at least, it wasn’t
until a man called Alan Sugar came along in

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:56.729
1981.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.509
Sugar, a business magnate strongly linked
to the British technology sector, saw, according

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.049
to his autobiography, “a Sharp-brand twin
cassette deck” while travelling through

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.049
Tokyo.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.690
The cassette deck, which was being sold in
a store selling professional grade musical

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.829
equipment, could copy inserted cassette tapes
onto blank ones, and even record directly

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.120
from the radio.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.010
Sugar saw this and realised that a cheaper,
consumer version of such a piece of technology

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.590
had the potential to be a huge hit in the
UK if consumers realised that it could be

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.739
used to copy their favourite songs from the
radio for the cost of a blank tape, or even

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.130
copy their favourite hits directly from another
tape and share them with friends.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.220
The problem was that directly promoting that
the new technology could be used for unauthorized

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.010
copying of copyrighted material would be illegal,
which is when he hatched an ingenious idea.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.610
After his company Amstrad had developed a
cheap, consumer-grade version of the technology

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.090
he’d seen in Japan, Sugar personally made
sure that the advertising campaign around

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.690
its launch in September of 1981 specifically
mentioned that using it to copy copyrighted

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.040
material was against the law.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
In his own words:

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.600
I told Malcolm Miller to take the precaution
of putting an asterisk beside the picture

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.440
of the new TS55 twin cassette tower system
with its “tape to tape” logo and at the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.620
bottom of the advert, in large, bold printing,
we stated, “*It is illegal to copy copyrighted

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.620
material.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.070
This machine should only be used to copy material
you have generated yourself”…

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.320
This was a cheeky tactic.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.040
People would read it and think to themselves,
“Hey, that’s a good idea!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.720
I can use this machine to copy my mate’s
Abba cassette.”

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.450
That was the effect the warning had, yet there
was I, keeping within the law, whiter than

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.840
white, telling people that the product should
not be used for that purpose…

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.609
Thanks to Amstrad’s device and the countless
copycat pieces of technology it inspired,

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.180
the British public could now make copies of
the music they owned and, if they wanted to,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.549
copies of music they didn’t own but liked.

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.340
This thought infuriated the BPI who quickly
countered its launch with the aforementioned

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.310
“Home Taping is Killing Music” morality
campaign.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.390
Why a morality campaign instead of focusing
more on the illegality of it?

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.350
Well, because home-taping (and the more modern,
digital age version of it) was, and still

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.410
is to some extent, a grey area legally speaking.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.620
You see, the law, which varies a bit from
country to country, doesn’t seem quite able

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.300
to make up its mind on whether or not it’s
legal to make copies of music you own for

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.480
personal use.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.530
In the UK, for example, a high court decision
was made in 2011 and made law in 2014 that

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.450
made it legal to “transfer files from your
own CDs or DVDs onto your MP3 player, your

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.850
computer or other devices” a practise that
had apparently been illegal prior to this,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.200
but was seldom enforced due to the music industry
as a whole (mostly) turning a blind eye, outside

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200
of occasionally trying to make it harder to
do so with various encryption algorithms.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.889
This law itself was overturned just a year
later in 2015 due to pressure from the music

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.909
industry, once again making the practice illegal
despite the fact that industry analysts and

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.610
experts openly acknowledged that there was
no consensus on how such a law could even

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.130
be enforced.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.870
Likewise in the United States, while it’s
unlikely that you’d ever be sued for making

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.999
copies of music you own for personal use,
it’s the opinion of the RIAA that consumers

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:13.560
have no legal “right” to do so.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.050
Home_taping_is_killing_musicBack to the 1980s-
one of the reasons the BPI framed the “Home

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.500
Taping is Killing Music” campaign as a moral
issue more than they did a legal one (though

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.180
they did note in the small print on the posters
they released that home taping is illegal)

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.879
is because they had no real way of stopping
consumers making copies of tapes.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:36.240
Even though the BPI had the law, to an extent,
on its side, enforcing it was impossible,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.139
so they had to instead try to appeal to the
morality of consumers…

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.039
This didn’t exactly work the way the BPI
planned (shocker) and the campaign resulted

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.389
in a huge push-back from both consumers and
musicians, most notably the Dead Kennedys

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.909
who released a special version of their EP,
In God We Trust Inc on a tape with one side

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.310
intentionally left blank for the explicit
purpose of allowing fans to use it to copy

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.099
songs they liked onto it.

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.099
The blank side even included a helpful message
for fans that read:

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.710
Home taping is killing record industry profits!

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.009
We left this side blank so you can help.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.509
Similar, though not as explicit, sentiments
were echoed by other musicians and entities

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.310
within the music industry throughout the UK
at the time, much to the chagrin of the BPI.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.499
Chris Wright, the then chairman of the BPI
and the man who first introduced the slogan

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:31.979
for the campaign to the public, especially
disliked how the music industry as a whole

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:37.379
refused to unite on the issue of home taping,
pointing a finger specifically at Island Records

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.789
in his autobiography due to the fact they
were, at the time, selling: “a chromium

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:47.139
dioxide cassette which combined a pre-recorded
album by an Island act on one side with the

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.650
other side left blank for the consumer to
use and tape whatever else they fancied.”

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.129
Because the world is a beautiful place sometimes,
it’s noted that one of the earliest pieces

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.629
of media widely introducing the concept of
these tapes to the world was found in the

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:07.059
Nov. 7, 1981 issue of Billboard magazine directly
opposite an article about the launch of the

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.139
Home Taping is Killing Music campaign.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.569
While it’s easy to laugh at this, because
it is kind of funny, behind the scenes the

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.770
BPI were making headway towards severely limiting
the rights of consumers to create personal

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.680
copies of music for private use- most notably
campaigning to introduce legislation that

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.659
would levy a tax on all blank media which
would be funneled directly back to the music

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:30.759
industry.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.750
The BPI’s argument was that every blank
tape sold represented a potential lost sale

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.999
for musicians.

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:40.169
Since the BPI couldn’t stop people from
doing this, they used the age old corporate

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.830
practice of lobbying the government to solve
the problem for them.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.439
However, the British government did not agree
and despite repeated attempts on behalf of

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:53.470
the BPI to introduce a tax or levy on blank
media citing the precedent of similar laws

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.529
existing throughout Europe, the government
remained stalwart in its conviction that such

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:00.659
a tax was unnecessary.

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:03.990
As of 2011, the official stance of the UK
government is that:

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.129
The Government considers that levies or other
compensation are neither required nor desirable

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:12.229
in the context of a narrow provision that
causes minimal harm.

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:15.710
Levies are an unnecessary and inefficient
tax on consumers.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.839
They are unfair to consumers in that they
are payable regardless of the use to which

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:24.960
a levied device (for example a hard disk)
is put and regardless of whether a user has

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.099
already paid for the copies they store on
a device.

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:32.930
Furthermore, particularly in the current economic
climate, it is not right to extract more money

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.909
from the pockets of hard pressed consumers.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:41.220
In any event, in 1988, CBS music attempted
to similarly limit the ability of consumers

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.020
to potentially make copies of copyrighted
material by suing the aforementioned Alan

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.310
Sugar and his company Amstrad, arguing that
their twin cassette tape players facilitated

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.600
illegal behaviour.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.610
In a landmark decision that set the precedent
for ownership of devices that could be used

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.779
to circumvent copyright, the House of Lords
came to the ultimate decision that while the

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:06.560
device could be used to illegally copy music,
as it has other, legitimate uses, it was perfectly

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.009
legal to own.

00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:13.149
The Home Taping is Killing Music campaign
itself largely fizzled out by the late 1980s

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:18.470
and despite literally hundreds of thousands
of pounds being spent by the BPI on it, the

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.029
main effect it had was fracturing the music
industry over their opinion on the legality

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.500
of making copies of music you owned for personal
and private use.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.790
It also, of course, helped spread the word
that such copying of music was possible with

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.899
the new cassette tape technology…

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:36.160
Although the campaign went away and was wholly
ineffective, the sentiment behind it, along

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.970
with similar expensive campaigns, has continued
to predictably pop up with the advent of new

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:46.060
technology that places more power in the hands
of consumers to curate and create their own

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.029
music and video libraries.

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:51.779
Beyond the more well known of these campaigns
launched by the music and film industries,

00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:55.600
a somewhat lesser known one that is definitely
worth a watch if you’re not familiar is

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.650
the infamous Don’t Copy That Floppy ad blitz
by the Software Publishers Association.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.910
Predictably, this was completely ineffective,
though did give the world a hilarious time

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.250
capsule of an ad we can all continue to enjoy
today.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:15.540
Amusingly, the oft-mocked logo of the Home
Taping is Killing Music campaign, a skull

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.779
and crossbones with the skull being a stylised
representation of a cassette tape, now lives

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:46.899
on as part of the logo for the file-sharing
website the Pirate Bay.
