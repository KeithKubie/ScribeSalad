RACHEL BEEN: Hi, I'm Rachel.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.105
VIKTOR PERSSON: I'm Viktor.

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:08.370
HANNAH CHO: Hi, I'm Hannah.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.995
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
And I'm Christian.

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:12.740
And we're designers that have
been working on this material

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.990
design project, helping our
various products at Google

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.830
to bring the material
designed to it.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.380
So yesterday in our keynote,
we introduced this concept

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.970
of material design.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.700
And it's a system that
uses the classical tools

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.770
of print-like
graphic design, along

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.640
with some new
dynamic surfaces that

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.690
appeal to our innate
understanding of physics

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.849
and material.

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:48.390
Today we're going to talk about
how some of the visual design

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.980
concepts help to
define that system.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.440
So, it's not often
recognized about design

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.970
that a good portion of it
happens behind the scenes.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.460
People don't actually
recognize-- or notice

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
actively-- a lot of the choices
that we make as designers.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.100
Sometimes even people
thinking about visual design

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.860
think of it as a
skinny, or covering,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.390
that's kind of happened
at the very last moment.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.230
And today we want to show
that beauty isn't skin deep.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.550
We're going to challenge
the idea of visual design

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.610
as a skin.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.510
We want to talk about
the visible and invisible

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.920
structures that make
the material UI work.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.780
So, we'll show how
invisible grids

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.330
can hold the structure together.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.610
We'll talk about the rules
behind the scenes that

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.570
can help us have better imagery,
and we'll pull the camera back

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.500
to show the lighting
and the shadow systems.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.610
So, I'll start with one of the
more invisible, yet visible

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.730
everywhere, design
practices-- typography.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.280
Typography's a lot more than
just the choice of typeface,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.630
but the letter forms are
a good place to start.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.910
So, I'll start
talking about Roboto.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.780
Roboto's a custom
typeface that's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.620
designed with UI
specifically in mind.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.920
It's a digital native.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.550
And we're using a
new cut of Roboto

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.310
as a default typeface
for the material UI.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.910
We've extensively
reworked the outlines

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.680
to make sure that the
types work, not just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.970
on mobile and tablet, where
we've started using it,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.350
but across the
various form factors

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.010
that we're now covering.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.420
So, here's some of the changes.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.940
This way you'll be able to
pick out the new version

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.540
from the old version and impress
your type-obsessed friends.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.600
So, we've calmed down some of
the more unruly characters.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.904
We also rounded out the
squarer sides on the caps,

00:02:39.904 --> 00:02:41.570
as well as the dots
and the punctuation.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.450
We also completely
redrew the numbers.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.640
And, getting into the details,
we reworked all of the italics

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.720
so that we have better
optical correction

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.780
to the diagonal strokes.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.180
So, if you look at the right
leg of the A versus the left leg

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.795
of the A, you might notice
a very slight difference.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.689
So, really we treat
almost every single glyph

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:08.480
to polish and tune.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.813
There's a lot of changes in
the spacing and the metrics.

00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:14.590
I'll spare you the
rest of the details.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.290
But the typeface itself really
is only a part of typography.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.882
In fact, if you call a type
designer a typographer,

00:03:21.882 --> 00:03:23.840
he'll point out the
difference between the two.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.480
Typography is the use of type.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.980
One of our design principles
was to enable content that's

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.170
bold and graphic
and intentional.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.640
And this graphic character
starts with the typography.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.610
In fact, when you actually
look at UI's, it's

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.830
clear that on
almost every screen,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.320
type is the primary element.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.610
So, if I block out just
the type on the right,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.040
you can see how
the screen really

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.180
is structured by the typography.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.520
In fact, this is
a good exercise--

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.180
as you're designing things,
just block it out and just

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.500
look at the type itself, and
see if it contains a structure.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.370
UI design really is typography.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.549
If we're drawing screens,
whether we know it or not,

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.340
we're typographers.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.980
So, this design system
uses really big type

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.190
to be expressive,
but also to create

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.870
clear hierarchies
of information.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.769
It's tempting when we're
doing UI design to--

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.209
just because we're
always dealing

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.300
with dynamic content--
it's tempting to just

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.620
use the smallest size
possible, because we don't know

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.740
in a music player if the band
name is going to be super long,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.050
or we don't know
if in a calculator

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.990
that we're going to have a
calculation that's super long.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.030
Instead, we can use large
type and then adjust the size

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.260
to accommodate the
copy as needed.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.930
So, it's these
large display sizes

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.680
that are also another
opportunity for branding, where

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.530
you might consider
using a custom type,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.070
commissioning a new type,
or even licensing a type.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.050
It's easier than it might seem.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.290
So, to help us
manage the sizes, we

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.130
use a tool called the
typographic scale.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.450
This isn't a new idea.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.110
This has been around in
print for a long time.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.390
In fact, the classic
typographic scale

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.560
uses the same math as the
musical pentatonic scale.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.930
It makes sure that there's
enough contrast at each step.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.450
And what it really
does is it reduces

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.240
the amount of distinct
sizes on any one screen,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.580
so that information
is clear, and you

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.960
can tell those differences.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.400
A good rule of thumb is if
you're using more than two

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.345
or three sizes on
one screen, you

00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:36.470
should make sure that
there's a good reason for it.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.050
And if you are
using a size that's

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.317
not in the typographic
scale, there

00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:42.900
should be a really
good reason for it.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.200
Ultimately, though,
the purpose of type

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.220
is to serve the content.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.820
It's to help people quickly
parse and communicate

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.710
the information.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.850
And while typography uses up
a good portion of our screen

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.680
real estate in many ways,
it's hard to beat imagery--

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.830
photographs and
illustrations-- for impact.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.450
RACHEL BEEN: So, this
epitomizing phrase

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.370
that we've been hearing
a lot of content

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.120
being bold, graphic,
and intentional

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.450
is especially apparent with
the use of imagery in product.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.020
So, we aren't here to encourage
specific aesthetic identities.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.960
Product brands range from
being subdued and muted

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.650
to really bright and colorful.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.400
And our intention isn't
to prescribe brand.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.720
What we want to encourage
is intentionality and

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.990
thoughtfulness concerning
imagery, backed

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.200
by supported principles and best
practices, to make your imagery

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.720
and your products come to life
and feel really differentiated.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.920
So, we define the
main principles

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.950
of imagery in a
three-part statement--

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.090
be personal, be informative,
and be delightful.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.350
So personalize
the imagery, where

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.120
applicable, to make your
product feel relevant.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.400
A degree of intelligence
is automatically

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.910
communicated if imagery
accurately reflects the user.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.730
Inform the user with a visual
translation of information.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.440
This facilitates
comprehension, and allows

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.380
for expedited understanding
of information.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.850
And delight.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.340
Delight doesn't mean adding
superfluous, fluffy imagery

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.990
just to fill space.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.630
Delight really implies
aesthetic thoughtfulness,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.440
combined with appropriate
contextual use.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.830
Delight can make your product
feel not only special,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.170
but really considerate
of the user.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.460
So, some additional
principles to talk through.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.380
Imagery doesn't have
to be consistently

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.380
conspicuous to feel appropriate.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.680
So, this concept of
being immersive, right?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.480
The image above
is a great example

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.930
of using imagery to create
context and interest

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.960
without overpowering
the primary information.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.400
The artist portrait is
a textual background

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.570
for the interactive
music content,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.600
which is the primary focus.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.480
Use appropriate imagery
hinting at contextualization

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.000
to create this type of depth
and texture in your product.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.480
So, be thoughtfully ubiquitous.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.980
So ubiquitous imagery,
similar to delight,

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.670
doesn't imply superfluous
use without a rationale.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.500
Ubiquity here implies
searching for very intentional

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.910
visual opportunities,
where previously there

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.550
might have been disparities.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.920
So, look for these moments
to introduce imagery

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.020
that supports information
personalization and delight.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.400
So, context.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.670
User should feel that, in every
instance, imagery is visible.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.570
It feels relevant
and appropriate,

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.142
and not disorienting or
misleading or out of place.

00:08:34.142 --> 00:08:35.850
So, this doesn't always
mean that imagery

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.980
has to be a literal translation
of surrounding information,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.590
right?

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.860
So, the example
above is perfect.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.060
We don't see the literal facade
of the location of your event,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.630
rather, a feature image from the
location that provides context.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.700
But context in the
type of context,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.380
such as cuisine, and the
general aesthetic and vibe,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.880
and potentially even
the time of day.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.620
So, this contextual accuracy,
combined with really beautiful

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.370
imagery, will create the
best possible experience

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.060
for your users.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.050
So, best practices.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.250
I want to touch really lightly
on some overarching practices

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.970
when creating or
commissioning imagery.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.670
From an aesthetic
perspective, the main goal

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.330
is to create beautiful
images, right?

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.920
Your users will feel
inspired and excited to use

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.140
your product.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.050
But beautiful imagery is a
somewhat broad and amorphous

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.900
term, so here's some
overarching tips basically

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.810
to point you in the
right direction.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.450
Ensure that a clear concept
is conveyed in a memorable way

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.430
with having a point of focus.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.150
This doesn't
necessarily literally

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.120
translate as a single point
of focus in your image.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.000
Focus more so
conveys that there's

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.170
clear representation that
won't be lost on the user.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.250
The user should be able to
parse almost immediately what

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.370
the visual represents.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.840
Building narratives take
this concept of focus

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.200
and adds some flavor, right?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.920
Is the mood of the image
aspirational, somber,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.330
celebratory?

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.930
So, this example of Miami is
not only visually informative--

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.250
in terms of the location
that the user's travelling

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.540
to-- but it's meant to also be
an aspirational and immersive

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.850
image, creating really
positive connotations with

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.400
your location.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.720
So, all imagery is an
editorialized decision, right?

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.040
So make intentional
decisions about the narrative

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.050
of your product through imagery.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.390
I want to end up this section
about imagery speaking

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.900
about some UI
integration, and how

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.440
imagery lives within the
material design structure.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.950
So, scale.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.220
Not all assets hold
the same visual weight.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.500
An avatar in an account
switcher is purposely

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.830
smaller than a main hero
image, because of information

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:40.980
hierarchy, right?

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.540
So, be mindful of these
scale differentiations

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.550
between imagery types such,
as avatars, feature images,

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.980
et cetera, as well a
similar asset types,

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.940
such as thumbnails within
a gallery experience.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.960
Scale in a hierarchy
imply importance,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.810
and not all of your
assets are equal.

00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:02.127
OK, So this seems
obvious, but make sure

00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:04.460
your images are appropriately
sized for their containers

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.300
and across platforms.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.390
Material designed
really emphasizes

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.960
large containers, large
real estate, and ideally

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.762
these assets should
not appear pixelated

00:11:12.762 --> 00:11:14.220
in your container's
cross-platform.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.250
So also, as you can see
in many of the vignettes,

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.370
a lot of the UI color choices
reflect content, right?

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.050
So, this was spoken
about the keynote.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.460
So, color and imagery
and material design

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.460
are really symbiotic.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.720
These bold color
bars, action bars,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.300
should look to a really
intentional color sampling

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.400
story.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.050
This not only creates a
perceived intelligence

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.126
concerning the content, but will
make your product feel unique.

00:11:43.126 --> 00:11:45.750
We're building a support library
called Palette, which was also

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.560
mentioned in the keynote, which
is part of the Android support

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.500
library and will be part
of the L Preview release.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.230
You will be able to use
it pretty much right away.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.980
So, what the library
does is automatically

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.990
extract a color palette
based on a particular image.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.190
We're still iterating
on the algorithms

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.380
and the API's, so
expect improvements

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.526
on this in the future.

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:06.900
And Viktor is
going to speak more

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.530
about color in a little bit.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.920
So, before I end, I want to
talk about different image types

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.140
within the container, so you can
start naming these asset types

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.330
and thinking about
how to use these.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.450
So, avatars and thumbnails.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.350
Avatars are representations of
entities-- brands and people--

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.150
and most commonly
displayed in circular form.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.510
Thumbnails allow
the user to peek

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.430
into additional visual
content, usually surrounded

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.370
by heterogeneous information,
such as copy, titles, et

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.100
cetera.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.760
They're always actionable
into a more immersive view.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.110
And I think this is the primary
point of what a thumbnail is.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.080
They're always thinking at more.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.870
So, thumbnails are great assets
to introduce and really tighten

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.075
constrained spaces.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.990
In material design, we're
introducing two types

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.940
of hero images-- featured
heroes and integrated heroes.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.550
A feature hero is really
a bold, primary point

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.520
of focus, surrounded by
a heterogeneous layout

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.450
with additional information.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.820
But the user's eye
should really look first

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.920
to this visual while
still interacting

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.210
with the surrounding content.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.210
Integrated heroes
create a setting

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.850
for heterogeneous pieces
of content within a layout.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.110
They're not the primary
points of focus,

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.800
but more add texture
and depth to the scene.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.500
Gallery images.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.510
Well, gallery images are the
most bold visual hero images

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.910
within your layouts.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.100
Usually they're
homogeneous layouts,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.880
and these are visual
heroes without

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.100
any other visual distractions.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.410
These are the strongest and most
unobstructed views of imagery

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.470
within your product.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.470
So overall, imagery is a
vital part of material design.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.900
Thoughtfully incorporating
informative, personal,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.990
delightful imagery
in your product,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.690
while considering some
of these best practices,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.840
is really going to bring
your product to life,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.530
creating really memorable
and beautifully crafted

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.510
experiences for your user.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.880
So as I mentioned
before, imagery is really

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.849
united with color,
so Viktor's going

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.390
to come up and speak
more about that.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.770
VIKTOR PERSSON: Let's
talk about color

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.926
and how to use color to enhance
your branding and your user

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:21.425
experience.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.000
The material design system
enables bold and intentional

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.740
use of color, and I
figured the best way

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.970
to show you this is to
design an example app.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.720
When choosing your
color theme, you

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.210
should really use
your brand colors.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.040
If you happen not to
have brand colors,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.620
we've actually created an
extensive color palette

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.730
with beautiful colors
that we use ourselves

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.190
to define our own color themes.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:00.030
This example app's primary
color will be indigo blue.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.890
This is the main
color of the app.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.640
So, if your brand color
is red, for example,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.850
this color should really be red.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.800
Bold and immersive use of
color is strongly encouraged.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.990
With that said, not all
screens are the same.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.230
Density of color depends
on the density of content.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.500
So, in a screen with
very little content,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.187
it enables bolder use of
color than, let's say,

00:15:30.187 --> 00:15:31.270
a content-heavy list view.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.320
Here are a few good
examples of how

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.910
bold color is applied
in more generous ways.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.560
It brings to life otherwise
utilitarian experiences,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.060
such as the
calculator, or how it

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.140
can complement
immersive imagery.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.420
OK, let's move on and choose
the accent color for this app.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.720
This color is to
provide contrast

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:09.020
for important buttons, UI
elements, and components.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.880
Don't choose an
accent color that

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.530
doesn't provide enough contrast.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.490
This color is really
supposed to pop.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:23.140
Here are a few good examples of
how an accent color can provide

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.965
the right focus and attention
to certain areas or components.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.660
If you've chosen an
accent color that

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.310
doesn't work in certain
circumstances, don't worry.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.330
You can always fall back
to a lighter or darker tint

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.350
of that same color.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.230
Pull those colors
together, and you'll

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.240
get your basic color theme.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.670
We are very happy that we've
baked this into the Android

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.770
platform and made it
a lot easier for you

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.200
guys to define your
own color theme.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.910
And remember, the
strongest tool we

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:08.369
have to unite a user experience
across multiple platforms

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:09.530
and devices is color.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.450
So, we talked about
the design principles.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.670
We talked about typography.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.130
We talked about
imagery and color.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.119
Let's bring them all
together and design

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.839
a beautiful and consistent UI.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.280
As Zach mentioned earlier
in the direction talk,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.210
over the course
of design history,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.320
there have emerged
rules and guidelines

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.450
that we as designers are really,
really excited about that we

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:50.030
baked this in and included in
the material design system.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.740
So here a few examples of
these rules and guidelines.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.770
So, structural elements
in the material

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.930
designed system
aligns to an 8dp grid.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.449
This will provide consistency,
harmony, and rhythm

00:18:05.449 --> 00:18:06.115
to your designs.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.400
Content should follow
a set of key lines.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.900
16dp and 72dp on
mobile, 24dp and 80dp

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:21.090
on tablets, desktops,
and larger screen sizes.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.250
As you can see here, it
really orders the content

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.840
and structures the
content so that it becomes

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.330
more predictable, and your
user can read this content

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.780
a lot easier and faster.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.970
Increments is an
excellent tool, or help,

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.130
to determine the size of
larger structural elements,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.020
such as the app bar
or the nav drawer.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:52.340
The increments are based on the
standard app bar height, which

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.910
is 56dp on mobile and
64dp on tablets, desktops,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.085
and larger screen sizes.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.640
When setting your type,
make sure to align it

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.420
to a 4dp baseline grid.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.170
This will make your
typography and content easier

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.380
to read and make it
aesthetically more pleasing.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.940
I'm sure everyone
here at some point

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.690
has seen a design or
an app and just felt

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.040
like, oh, there's something off.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.510
Not aligning your type to
a consistent baseline grid

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.670
might very well have been
what was the problem there.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.110
Let's go back to our example
app again and apply these rules

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.330
and guides that we've
incorporated in the material

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.300
design system.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.900
This is going to be a fairly
straightforward list view app,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.090
but I wanted to enable
bolder use of color,

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.250
as I talked about before.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.115
So, I made the app bar
3x of the increment.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.800
When designing your layouts,
start thinking in blocks.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.460
This is extremely helpful, and
will make your design process

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.260
easier, faster, and,
I would say, better.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.250
For this app, I'm going to
use an avatar to the left,

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.830
with two lines of
text next to it.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.450
So for that I'll
use a block of 72dp.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.280
When placing in your content,
as I said, follow the key lines.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.640
In this example, the
16dp and 24dp key line

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.790
is reserved for
icons and avatars.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.440
That means that your
typography and text

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.680
should follow the 72dp
and 82dp key line.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.970
As you can clearly see,
it provides a structure

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.690
and a predictability
to the eye that

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.080
is just very user-friendly
and easy to scan.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.480
Last but not least,
remember the baseline grid.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.154
Align your typography
to the baseline

00:21:02.154 --> 00:21:03.570
grid to achieve
better typography.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.130
And there we have it.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.690
By using these-- I would
say almost magical tools

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.150
and guidelines, as well
as fundamental tools

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.900
and guidelines, we've created a
bold, beautiful, user-friendly

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.040
UI over multiple platforms
and form factors.

00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:25.960
Over to Hannah, who
is going to talk

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.543
about surface and dimension.

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:30.467
HANNAH CHO: Thank you.

00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:32.872
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:32.872 --> 00:21:35.770
HANNAH CHO: Yay.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.260
OK, so Viktor just went
over on the details

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.730
of how to create a layout.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.970
In material design, you
have to also consider

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.980
how these elements live and
move in 3D space, not just 2D.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.380
We can model how people perceive
material in our UI to group

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.200
and structure our content.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.570
The use of surface and material
can solve spatial issues,

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.920
and they're not meant to
be used just as decoration.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.209
So, in material design,
we use this technique

00:22:00.209 --> 00:22:01.250
to give our UI dimension.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.080
So, we interact with
physical objects every day.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.740
The tangible
qualities and shadows

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.440
help us to quickly
understand affordances.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.200
So, we were inspired by the
tactile qualities of paper

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.350
and studied how light
interacts with the material

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.900
to creator our shadows.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.120
We didn't just apply
this approach to our UI.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.020
We actually did
a lot of studies.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.354
We recreated our icons by
folding actual pieces of paper

00:22:24.354 --> 00:22:26.270
and placing them in
different lighting set-ups

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.600
to understand exactly how those
shadows should be constructed.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.010
These are actual photos that
we studied-- the studies

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.260
that we did-- and you can
see all the cool things that

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.970
are happening in these photos.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.424
There's soft ambient
shadows caused by the light,

00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:40.590
and you can see how the
light is being reflected off

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.100
the paper, causing subtle
highlights on the edges.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.170
This process allowed
us understand

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.280
how we can
realistically recreate

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.690
the subtle highlights and
consistent shadows in a layout.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.910
So, how do we
create the shadows?

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:05.730
There's supposed
to be animation OK.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:06.820
Imagine this animating.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.670
So, how do we create
these shadows?

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.810
In order to make our
shadows feel real,

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.520
we needed to create a
technically audacious system

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.910
that did more than just
pre-render a static drop

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.660
shadow.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.640
So, with our amazing
engineering team,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.860
they built a system that
uses real-time soft shadows.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.030
The shadows are projected from
a virtual light source that

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.250
are also being rendered
through a camera.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.550
So, this allowed us to have
consistent set of transforms

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.757
that keeps this illusion
alive as the users move

00:23:32.757 --> 00:23:34.465
from a screen to
screen, or between apps.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.470
This is the virtual
light source animation

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.400
that didn't play earlier, and
there's the virtual camera.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.740
So, these two types
of shadows make up

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.180
the shadow layers we
use in material design.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.740
The key shadow creates
the illusion of depth,

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.220
while the ambient shadow defines
the form of the material.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.890
Together, the shadows create
a halo around the material

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.905
without needing to use a hard
stroke to create an outline.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.740
Aha, animation.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.240
OK.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.570
Shadows also create the
separation between surfaces.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.570
What this means is that the
depth of our shadow changes

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.920
scale and focus.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.710
So, elements closer
to the camera

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.300
have more diffuse shadows,
and elements further away

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.510
from the camera, the shadow
becomes more focused.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.320
So, the strength of
the shadow really

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.634
determines the perceived
depth of our material.

00:24:39.634 --> 00:24:41.050
You can really see
the differences

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.700
between the perceived depth
in these two examples.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.560
The scale of the
shadow helps to show

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.080
where these elements
live spatially.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.680
In the example on the left,
the surface of the dialogue

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.490
is closer to the
camera, resulting

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.300
in a softer shadow, where as
in an example on the right,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.940
cars are further
away from the camera,

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.700
resulting in a more
defined shadow.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.655
And, because our
shadows are dynamic,

00:25:03.655 --> 00:25:05.520
they also move in
space, depending

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.890
on the location of the material
as the camera is fixed.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.040
Like this example, when you
start to see the shadows

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.840
move from the left
and right and how

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.480
it's moving below
the surface, you

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.920
can clearly see how the surface
is being brought to life.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.570
All of these details
might be subtle,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.260
but it really makes up
the whole experience.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.560
The shadows provide
a familiar visual cue

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.910
that we just
naturally understand.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.640
So, all of the
theory behind shadows

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.930
may sound super complex,
but don't worry.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.050
They're all built
into the system.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.000
Designers can download
an illustrator file

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.162
that has the shadows.

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:41.120
And you guys can use them
to design your mocks,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.270
but don't use them
to make assets.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.360
Engineers can simply
set the z-height value

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.450
and get system shadows for
Polymer and Android for free.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.280
Now that we've covered
how the shadows are built,

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.970
let's look at some examples
of how they are used.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.980
A good way to think
about these surfaces

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.310
is that they're tools
to help focus attention

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.940
and create emphasis.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.010
So FAB-- a floating
action button--

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.360
is a great example of
how we use surfaces

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.300
to help focus attention.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.150
Just by virtue of being its
own separate piece of material,

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.390
FABS have the most
prominence in our UI,

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.270
and this really helps
to promote the action.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.580
A dialogue with
another great example.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.190
Bringing a dialogue to a
surface creates an isolation

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.250
of the content, and
allows the users

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.970
to focus on things that require
either a decision or action.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.570
Here's a bad example of how
you could overuse shadows

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.440
and dimensions in your layout.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.010
Having a surface
on surface in this

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.310
is layout distracts from
being able to focus attention.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.290
So, if you see that your design
requires too many layers,

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.220
then maybe your
content is too complex.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.160
Shadows should really be used
to determine the surface where

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.940
you want your primary
content to be.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.380
Surfaces are powerful grouping
tools for our content.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.060
Like in this cars example,
we can use surfaces

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.620
to group complex content
into a digestible view.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.520
This creates a
visual system that

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.180
keeps our layout
clean and beautiful

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.390
by organizing our
type and imagery,

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.660
especially with complex data.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.520
But, we want to
avoid using surfaces

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.180
when it's not necessary.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.490
In this list example,
separating each list into cards

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.090
adds unnecessary visual
noise, and it also

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:26.310
makes it very difficult to
scan the content quickly.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.740
Surfaces also indicate
interaction cues,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.700
like how things are going to
move and interact in a space.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.070
For example, the peeking
surface in the calculator

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.600
is a hint to the user that
they can be pulled out

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.300
to reveal something
new or different

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.020
from the content they're
currently viewing.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.512
So, we have this
super helpful tool

00:27:43.512 --> 00:27:45.220
called the white frames
that you guys can

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.990
download from our spec.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.090
They're basic structures
without any content,

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.840
so you guys can use
them when you guys are

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.090
designing your app.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.900
These layout structures
used a consistent approach

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.100
that I mentioned today about
surface layers and shadows.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.320
And we developed these tools
for us designers and developers

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.930
to support how we
can better layout

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.380
our content in a meaningful way.

00:28:09.847 --> 00:28:15.329
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:17.370
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: So,
we've been talking today

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.260
about how bold graphic
design can do more than just

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.200
look great.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.490
You've looked at
examples of typography,

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.580
and how it helps people to
focus and parse the content.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.950
We've seen how the right
image at the right time

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.610
can make all the difference.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:34.690
We've seen how color
can bring both brand

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:41.770
and also help to divide space,
help people to understand.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.340
We've seen how grids and key
lines can bring structure,

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.915
and they're just the coolest.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.710
I'm excited.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.994
They're like this hidden
super power that you apply it,

00:28:56.994 --> 00:28:58.410
and then all of
sudden, everything

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:02.070
just kind of comes into focus,
and things just look amazing.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:07.480
And finally we've seen how
implied surface can give people

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.810
cues about how
they can interact,

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.570
but also to help
to divide content.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.540
It's another tool we can
use to structure our apps.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.510
Ultimately, though, the goal
behind this material design

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.020
system is to create
a common back story.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:29.706
This back story can help bring
visual designers, animators,

00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:33.630
interaction designers,
engineers together,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:38.030
and help to create a story
that is consistent for users.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.090
And in some ways, this
is a collaboration

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.140
between all of us.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:47.040
We're creating apps that people
can use based on their shared

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.576
understanding of how
the system can work.

00:29:50.576 --> 00:29:52.950
They can know how to do things
without thinking about it.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.030
So, to learn more, check
out the information

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:04.100
in the preview release of
the design specifications.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.300
It's not short, so it'll take
a few hours to read through,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.721
but there's a lot of
really good content.

00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:13.220
Also, if you're interested in
following our work or reaching

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.890
out, you can check
out google.com/design.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:24.360
And if you've not been able to
catch some of the other design

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.930
focus sessions in I/O
you can see them later.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.340
And there's one more session
this afternoon at 4:00

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.819
PM to talk about motion design.

00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:34.360
The other thing I
wanted to point out

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.310
is there's still a
few more hours left.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.330
We have designers
who have been working

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.305
on this project
over the past-- I

00:30:41.305 --> 00:30:43.340
think it's been over
a year and a half

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.240
down in the design sandbox.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.040
Please take advantage of this.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.990
Don't be shy.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.450
We're happy to answer any
questions you might have.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.456
Thank you.

00:30:57.456 --> 00:31:00.907
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:05.362 --> 00:31:07.820
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: So, it
looks like we're right on time.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.280
We've saved some
time for questions.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.390
If you have
questions, please line

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.400
up at either of the microphones
in the center of the aisle.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:30.350
Any support for SVG
in icons or any kind

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:36.450
of scalable code solution
for all the resolutions

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.680
that we currently support?

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.670
VIKTOR PERSSON: We
actually have Josh here

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.453
who can answer that
question very, very well.

00:31:46.453 --> 00:31:46.952
JOSH: Hi.

00:31:46.952 --> 00:31:48.970
So, I'm an engineer who works
with all these designers,

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.930
and I've been working
on how we manage assets

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.140
and how we generate assets.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.050
We're trying to use
SVG more and more.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.310
It's still a bit of a struggle
to use it as the native format

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.100
that you're using
within your apps.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.971
Android L is adding
some support for that.

00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:05.720
It's getting better
and better on the web,

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.570
but there's still
more we need to do.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:11.290
We are going to be releasing
the system icons that we've

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.055
designed as part of the
material on the spec.

00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:16.180
So, you'll get those there.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.804
And when we release
them, we'll release

00:32:17.804 --> 00:32:22.120
both Ping of various sizes and
densities and also the vector

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.170
versions.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.080
So hopefully that will help.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.929
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
Thanks, Josh.

00:32:29.929 --> 00:32:30.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:34.140
When you said that the grid has
been incorporated conceptually

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.550
into the material
design approach,

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:40.244
does that mean you're strongly
recommending that designers

00:32:40.244 --> 00:32:41.660
use grids for
layout, or does this

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.701
mean that there's new
facilities in the framework

00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:45.980
to actually implement
grids at a high level,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.090
and then the elements would
just line themselves upright?

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.840
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
So, this is something

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.840
that I think starts
with designers.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:00.120
The tools to align things inside
the platforms to some degree

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:07.370
have existed, and I think it
does start with designers.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.012
VIKTOR PERSSON: Yeah.

00:33:09.012 --> 00:33:11.910
And also, all the
numbers are divided

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.590
by 8-- so, 8dps increments.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.060
You can see that in everything.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.260
By the size of the buttons
that are provided to you,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.460
or nav drawers, or
app bar heights,

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.464
they're all based
on 8dp increments.

00:33:28.464 --> 00:33:30.630
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: And
all of the basic components

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.092
are already using the grids.

00:33:34.092 --> 00:33:35.550
AUDIENCE: After
seeing the thinking

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.990
behind the lighting
and the camera

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.170
and the way shadows move
with the elements on screen,

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.150
is there anything in place
to handle orientation

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.010
changes so that is more
animated experience,

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.345
rather than a broken experience?

00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:52.620
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: Do we have
some more engineering support

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.540
to talk about the
way rotation works?

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.080
Yeah.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.990
So there are system
built-in animations

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.760
for rotation support.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.590
There's also some facilities to
do custom animations if there's

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.940
a particular effect that
you want in your app.

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:18.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.719
I'm a UX designer, but
I have a background

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.371
in graphic design as well.

00:34:22.371 --> 00:34:23.870
So first, I want
to congratulate you

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.980
guys on the design
side of things.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:30.260
It's really good to see some
traditional graphic design

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.302
thinking and rules being applied
to the digital environment.

00:34:36.302 --> 00:34:42.350
On my UX site, I've noticed
that in terms of affordances,

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:46.860
there's a few instances
where the outlines of buttons

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:51.130
and stuff like that is
slightly trying to fade away.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.340
I want to ask you
guys how do you

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:59.480
feel that apps that have
very defined affordances

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.300
will fit with the new material
kind of paradigm design

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.051
language that you have designed?

00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:08.360
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, so I think

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.750
that there's two
parts to the question.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:17.810
One is, what are the right
affordances, and two,

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:22.940
how do we know the right places
to use those affordances?

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.420
For example, in
the design system,

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.627
there are actual
material buttons

00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:29.710
that come off the surface.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.190
And they're a really
great tool for situations

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.770
where you have a lot
of complex content.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:39.870
So, for example, a more complex
form where you need a button.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.800
That's very clear.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.060
We don't necessarily
need it in all places,

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:52.000
like, for example, in the action
bars on top of the screen.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.290
We don't need to have a separate
button around every icon.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.810
So, I think what
I'm trying to say

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.510
is, the role of
the designer here

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:04.507
is to look at those
situations and make sure

00:36:04.507 --> 00:36:05.840
that there is enough affordance.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.760
And then the system
has a number of steps

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.478
you can use when you do need
to have more clarity there.

00:36:13.478 --> 00:36:14.311
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:17.154 --> 00:36:19.070
AUDIENCE: I really liked
the part about color.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.360
And I was wondering-- I
know it's a common thing

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.460
to desaturate backgrounds
to reduce eye strain,

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.640
and I was wondering about
the really saturated indigo

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.780
purple and the magenta.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:39.650
And when does it become
too much, and how much

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:43.160
do you take of the
really bright colors?

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.150
VIKTOR PERSSON: So, thank you.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.090
So, I think what you
really should consider

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:53.170
as a designer is the density
of color and content,

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.680
and how those two interact.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.570
Too much color is
not a good thing.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.390
You as a designer have to figure
out where the sweet spot is.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:07.480
But we believe that we
could incorporate more color

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.800
and express your brand
stronger with color

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.250
without tiring your user's eyes.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.270
RACHEL BEEN: And we're also
doing accessibility studies

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.990
for legibility with
color combinations

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.449
as well, with type overlays.

00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:26.740
AUDIENCE: So, first, thank you.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.770
It's absolutely
beautiful-- I love

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.090
everything you guys are doing.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.195
I had a few questions
about the action bar,

00:37:32.195 --> 00:37:34.900
because it's gone over
some real changes.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.330
And I notice that up in
some of the examples,

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.210
there's like a darker
yellow, but then we

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.290
see a darker icon,
instead of a light icon,

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.220
but then with mixed
text where it's white.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.500
Also, I see there's no
icons in the action bar,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.090
and also the hamburger
button's really crazy now.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.219
It's longer integrated.

00:37:52.219 --> 00:37:54.760
Just wondering if you could just
give some insights on what's

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.426
going on with the
action bar, because it

00:37:56.426 --> 00:37:58.530
is a very integral
part of applications,

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.210
and unique to Android, really.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.460
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: So,
the action bar, I think,

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.320
is a whole topic
in and of itself.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.660
There's a few things
that we've started

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.120
looking at with the action bar.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.270
As we were looking across
the whole app ecosystem,

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.110
there wasn't enough
flexibility for different apps

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.230
that had different
needs to really

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:29.862
have the shape of
their app really match

00:38:29.862 --> 00:38:30.820
the purpose of the app.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.570
And so this is where
we've done a lot of work

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.250
to think about the
relationship between the action

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:41.806
bar and, for example,
a title on the page.

00:38:41.806 --> 00:38:44.060
I think there's a
number of screens

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.570
that showed a contact, where
it makes a lot more sense

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.900
to have the name of
the person really

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.690
live inside that same
conceptual block.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:59.350
So I think that was the
first consideration.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.060
And as it relates to
the branding question of

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.820
whether or not we need to have
an app icon up there or a logo,

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.920
there's no reason
why we couldn't

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.190
have a logo type or a logo
mark up in the action bar.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.440
I think that it probably
makes sense for a lot of apps

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.037
to do that, especially
on the top level,

00:39:17.037 --> 00:39:18.870
and then you can decide
how much you need it

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.580
as you dig in deeper.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.580
AUDIENCE: So it's more
like a content-first type

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.429
of thing for the visual.

00:39:26.429 --> 00:39:27.470
And the hamburger button?

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.900
Anything?

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.120
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: I mean,
not every screen or every needs

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.280
to have a hamburger button.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.100
The ones that do it's in an
appropriate place for it,

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.550
and it lines up
with the key lines.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.730
So you really get this-- and
it's true of the titles too--

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:47.647
you get this resonance
with the page.

00:39:47.647 --> 00:39:48.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.460
I just want to say how
all of this design system

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.830
has been very inspiring.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:00.240
And I had a question
about hero images.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.840
Something that I've
seen in the past

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.320
is when we've had designs that
are dominated by a bold hero

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:05.860
image.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.500
The problem is, if it's
submitted by the user,

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.400
sometimes users don't
pick very good images.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.700
And I wondered if you had any
advice on how you can protect

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.369
against bad
user-submitted images?

00:40:17.369 --> 00:40:19.410
RACHEL BEEN: Yeah, it's
a really tricky question.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.850
I think one of the things that
we were really considering

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.830
is respecting the user's
choices that they're

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.800
making to really personalize
their own imagery.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.180
So not manipulating a
user's image, I think,

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.900
is a really important
thing to consider.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.800
Because potentially it is
going to appear pixelated,

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.320
or it's not necessarily
aesthetically pleasing,

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.300
but they're making
that conscious decision

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.870
to include it.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.890
It's really tough.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.990
We're doing some affordances to
play with some color overlays

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.630
and scrims, but really
it's a fine line

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.760
between over-manipulation and
respecting the content, right?

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.990
It kind of depends also
on the brand identity

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.920
of how you're generally treating
imagery within your product,

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.970
as well.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:01.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:02.640
RACHEL BEEN: Sure.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.220
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.640
I'm an Android developer, and
I really loved your session.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.970
Thanks.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:17.970
One question I could ask you
is, could you upload an XML file

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:24.080
with all those typographics
scale metrics [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.560
which you want us to use?

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:33.490
So, then you would imply also
naming of all those [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.880
and [INAUDIBLE] sizes?

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.560
So it would be consistent across
all teams who develop apps,

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.950
so when you move from
one team to another,

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.400
it would be consistent.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.560
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
You take that?

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.914
VIKTOR PERSSON: Well, no.

00:41:50.914 --> 00:41:52.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:52.675 --> 00:41:55.050
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: I think
there's an intersection here

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:59.100
between the design system
and the tools systems.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.280
I'm not sure if we have
anybody from the tools team

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.050
that can talk about it.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.700
AUDIENCE: What I
would like is it

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.150
you download an XML file, you
drop it into your project,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:17.942
and you could get all those
the metrics you displayed here

00:42:17.942 --> 00:42:18.650
in your projects.

00:42:20.217 --> 00:42:22.550
RACHEL BEEN: I don't know if
we've been working on that.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.575
AUDIENCE: Could expect this?

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:25.950
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
I don't know

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.410
if I can comment on the
future path of the tools team,

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.160
but I think that does
sound like something

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.660
that would be useful to make
it easier to use the metrics.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.760
I will say that
the elements that

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:40.670
are built into the framework
do respect these grids,

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.049
and you get a certain level
of alignment just there.

00:42:44.049 --> 00:42:44.590
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.090
Thank you.

00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:50.440
AUDIENCE: I think I've
got a similar question.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.814
I was just wondering if you
were going to build something

00:42:52.814 --> 00:42:56.370
into the system overlay--
sorry, the debugger entering

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:59.930
in Android or something, so
that it could show the grid

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.000
and so that you could perhaps
make sure elements match up

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.174
that way?

00:43:04.174 --> 00:43:05.840
It could go in Android's
studio as well.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.120
I don't know if
it's just something

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.230
that's been considered?

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:09.270
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, I think

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.478
that sounds like a good idea.

00:43:10.478 --> 00:43:14.090
Again, I can't speak to the
future plans of the tool team.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.650
AUDIENCE: For supporting
older platforms, are you sort

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:27.720
of expecting to go more of
incorporating the new material

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.010
elements even on
the order platforms,

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.940
much in the way we've backed
ported in action bars,

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.100
or to do a more Holo theme
on the older platforms

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.260
and only incorporate the
new material elements

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.616
on L and above?

00:43:43.616 --> 00:43:45.830
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
Yeah, so I think that when

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.010
it comes to the
compatibility story--

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:51.275
and again, I think that
this is a whole topic

00:43:51.275 --> 00:43:55.570
in and of itself-- you
can kind of break it down

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.820
into some different parts.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.600
The first part is for
the layouts themselves

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.090
and for those measurements.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:08.080
For the content itself, the
idea of using this 8 pixel grid

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.580
is something that we've actually
been doing since-- the Holo

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.150
grids actually use those
measurements as well.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.860
If you lay out your content
with these new things

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.070
and use that for
previous versions,

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.530
it should work very well.

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:27.220
The things that you
can also-- I don't

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.380
know how deep I should
get into talking about all

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.463
of the technical features
of the support library--

00:44:31.463 --> 00:44:36.370
but the card view element
that's available in the support

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.380
library is something
you should look into,

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.820
because it will help
you to have shadows

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.787
that work across
versions as well.

00:44:45.787 --> 00:44:46.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.110
AUDIENCE: It's great to
see such a great design

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.680
spec for the first
time in Android.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.910
Considering what the
competition's done,

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:00.220
we all were worried.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.672
But I think I can say it's
been very good to be here

00:45:03.672 --> 00:45:05.380
and to see what you
guys have been doing.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.306
It's pretty great.

00:45:06.306 --> 00:45:08.430
I have no questions, but
I'll say, keep doing this.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.440
Keep coming up with
design specs we can use.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.010
Not everybody's a designer,
but for developers out there,

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.740
it's a very good
guideline to use.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.640
So, keep doing
what you're doing.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.290
Great work.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:16.850
Thank you very much.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.308
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
Great, thanks.

00:45:18.308 --> 00:45:19.390
That was a good wrap-up.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:20.890
RACHEL BEEN: Yeah, thank you.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.240
[APPLAUSE]
