00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.990
Hi, I'm Rich Hyndman.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.804
The L Developer Preview
is well underway.

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:05.470
And I'm here in the
first of this series

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.930
of Dev Bytes with a super quick
rundown of the top features.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.724
The most important
thing for developers

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:13.015
is that there are system
images available for the Nexus

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:14.490
5 and Nexus 7.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.140
So now you can test your apps
and provide feedback to us

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.890
in the bug tracker
and Google+ community.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.952
Head here, and set your project
to API level L to get started.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:25.410
And one thing you're
sure to notice

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.590
is the new Material
design language.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.310
Material provides
updates to the visual

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.250
of the interaction and the
motion design guidelines.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.920
It replaces Holo, and introduces
a new theme.material along

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.450
with APIs for activity
transitions, shadows, reveals,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.480
and more.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.340
Notifications have
received an update

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.890
and now appear on
the lock screen

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.070
letting you surface content,
updates, and actions

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.660
to users at a glance.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.360
There's three
visibility levels that

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.560
lets you manage the information
shown on secure lock screens.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.180
We have VISIBILITY_PUBLIC
where the entire notification

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.140
is shown, VISIBILITY_PRIVATE
where it's just the application

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.340
name and, "Unlock your device
to see this notification,"

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090
and VISIBILITY_SECRET that
doesn't show on the lock screen

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.090
at all.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.840
If you choose Private
you can additionally

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.770
specify a separate, custom,
redacted notification

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.750
which would show on secure
lock screens instead.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.680
Lock screens in the
L Developer Preview

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.200
no longer show controls if
you're a remote control client.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.960
So instead you should provide
media playback control

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.390
through a notification.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.400
Also if you don't
want the notification

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.360
to be sent to the user's
Android Wear device

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.489
you can use new Notification
Compat method setLocalOnly.

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:33.280
There is a non-Compat
version of the method

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.470
as well in Notifications,
but it applies

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.830
to API level 20 and above.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.720
Whilst mentioning
API level 20, this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.540
introduces Android
4.4 W. It's 4.4

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.630
with the wearable extensions.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.400
The L Developer Preview
doesn't have its own API level,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.462
and apps built against it
cannot be uploaded to Play.

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:51.920
We'll be incrementing
the API level

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.620
later on in the year
for the L release.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.700
So if you check your
SDK Manager you'll

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.150
see those two new SDK
versions available,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.280
4.4 W and the L
Developer Preview.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.270
If you're building production
apps, build them against 4.4 W.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.690
WebView has been updated
to Chrome M36, which

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.000
included support for Web Audio,
Undulating Monkeys, and Web

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.240
RTC, making it our most
advanced WebView yet.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.500
And another big behind the
scenes update is the runtime.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.940
The Art runtime
replaces Dalvik in L.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.760
So please make sure you've
tested your apps soon.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.570
Along with ahead-of-time
compilation,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.140
improved garbage collection,
and improved debugging support,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.000
also comes 64-bit support.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.900
The majority of titles in the
Play Store are 64-bit ready,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.495
and benefit with Art as they're
running purely Dex Bytecode.

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:40.620
Art's not only beneficial
for the memory footprint,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.950
but also for battery life, which
brings us onto Project Volta.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.780
As J focused on
[? junk?] removal,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.640
and K made Android more svelte,
there's a big effort in L aimed

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.570
towards improving power tracking
and doing something about power

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.760
use.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.440
So there's new
tools and APIs you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.170
can use to help save
your user's battery.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.480
For example, APIs so that you
can specify that a task should

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.650
be done if the phone
is charging whilst

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.560
on an unmetered
network like Wi-Fi,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.490
and you want to guarantee that
it would start within an hour.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.757
This is all done through
the Job Scheduler APIs.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:14.090
There are also a couple of
new UI widgets in the support

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.800
library.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.520
We have RecyclerView, an
advanced version of ListView

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.550
allowing you to
display and animate

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.190
rich, dynamic
collections, and CardView

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.180
that lets you display important
information inside a card which

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.590
uses the new elevation API in L.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.430
Next we have the new
camera API, Camera2.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.110
It provides access to full
resolution frames at full frame

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.530
rate with per frame
control of capture settings

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.010
and calibration metadata.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.600
Staying with
multimedia, we've open

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.280
sourced the new video
player called ExoPlayer.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.830
Built on top of Android's
low level media APIs,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.600
it includes support for DASH
and smooth streaming adaptive

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.740
playback, providing
a new, flexible way

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.950
to enable video in
your applications.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.580
Continuing in the same vein
we have audio updates as well.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.320
With low latency audio,
multichannel high dynamic

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.360
range floating point mixing,
and USB audio support.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.260
We've updated to Connectivity
with dynamic network selection

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.970
with seamless handoff,
and Bluetooth LE

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.180
gets an update including
peripheral mode.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.004
And then we have, in order of
size, Android Wear, Android TV,

00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:18.485
and Android Auto.

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:20.360
Don't forget to also
look out for all the I/O

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.910
material on these topics.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.670
You can dive into
Wear and TV right now

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.915
as there are emulators
available for both.

00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:27.710
Phew.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.804
That is one hell of a preview.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:32.720
We'll be going into more
details on the topics

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.594
in this video over the
next couple of months.

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:37.350
So stay tuned and happy coding.
