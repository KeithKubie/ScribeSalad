it's important to remember that Holmes
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.360
it's important to remember that Holmes
wasn't born Holmes Holmes was born like

to think like Sherlock Holmes at the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
to think like Sherlock Holmes at the
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.240
to think like Sherlock Holmes at the
beginning he probably thought more like

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
beginning he probably thought more like
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.650
beginning he probably thought more like
Watson because that's more of our

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
Watson because that's more of our

natural state he's able to attain what

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
natural state he's able to attain what
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.349
natural state he's able to attain what
he does because he's become an expert of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
he does because he's become an expert of
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.769

at person perception what I mean by this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
at person perception what I mean by this

at person perception what I mean by this
as he has thousands and thousands of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
as he has thousands and thousands of
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.729
as he has thousands and thousands of
hours of practice and that practice has

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
hours of practice and that practice has
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.970
hours of practice and that practice has
been interwoven with feedback so I look

been interwoven with feedback so I look
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040
been interwoven with feedback so I look
at you and I tell you something about

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
at you and I tell you something about
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139
at you and I tell you something about
yourself and you say no that's actually

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
yourself and you say no that's actually
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.110

all or you say wow how did you know that

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329
all or you say wow how did you know that
 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.119
all or you say wow how did you know that
so I'm learning which details matter

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
so I'm learning which details matter
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.310
so I'm learning which details matter
which details don't matter which

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
which details don't matter which
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.279
which details don't matter which
observations are logical which ones are

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
observations are logical which ones are
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.209
observations are logical which ones are
false and over time I build up that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
false and over time I build up that
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310
false and over time I build up that
expertise that will allow me to look at

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
expertise that will allow me to look at
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560
expertise that will allow me to look at
you and in one second say hey Watson I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
you and in one second say hey Watson I
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810
you and in one second say hey Watson I
think you've been in Afghanistan and it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
think you've been in Afghanistan and it
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.450
think you've been in Afghanistan and it
seems like it's completely just out of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
seems like it's completely just out of
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.310
seems like it's completely just out of
the blue oh my god how did he know that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
the blue oh my god how did he know that
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.679
the blue oh my god how did he know that
but then if you go back you'll see that

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
but then if you go back you'll see that
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.770
but then if you go back you'll see that
this is not intuition in the sense of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
this is not intuition in the sense of
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.620
this is not intuition in the sense of
just I knew it it's intuition than the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
just I knew it it's intuition than the
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810
just I knew it it's intuition than the
sense of expertise in the sense of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
sense of expertise in the sense of
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.850
sense of expertise in the sense of
judgment that has been honed over years

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
judgment that has been honed over years
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.820
judgment that has been honed over years
and years of practice so for Holmes the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
and years of practice so for Holmes the
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160
and years of practice so for Holmes the
entire thought process is akin to a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
entire thought process is akin to a
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.109
entire thought process is akin to a
scientist who is doing a research

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
scientist who is doing a research
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.530
scientist who is doing a research
experiment so someone who is who is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
experiment so someone who is who is
 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210
experiment so someone who is who is
doing kind of who's following the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
doing kind of who's following the
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.969
doing kind of who's following the
scientific method so for him the mind is

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
scientific method so for him the mind is
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.240
scientific method so for him the mind is
like an attic and what that means is you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
like an attic and what that means is you
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550
like an attic and what that means is you
can store only so much in it the space

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
can store only so much in it the space
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100
can store only so much in it the space
is finite and what you store and how you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
is finite and what you store and how you
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.580
is finite and what you store and how you
store it is incredibly important as you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
store it is incredibly important as you
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.859
store it is incredibly important as you
try to figure out how do i optimize my

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
try to figure out how do i optimize my
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.530
try to figure out how do i optimize my
mental resources how do I then take the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
mental resources how do I then take the
 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810
mental resources how do I then take the
things I've stored and access them how

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
things I've stored and access them how
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.520
things I've stored and access them how
do I organize them so that there are

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
do I organize them so that there are
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170
do I organize them so that there are
connections between them so that I can

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
connections between them so that I can
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.840
connections between them so that I can
use them and make them as part of kind

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
use them and make them as part of kind
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880
use them and make them as part of kind
of a broader whole so I can see the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
of a broader whole so I can see the
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.770
of a broader whole so I can see the
bigger picture and not just these random

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
bigger picture and not just these random
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.529
bigger picture and not just these random
components that I put there so what a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
components that I put there so what a
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.750
components that I put there so what a
researcher would do at the beginning of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
researcher would do at the beginning of
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.920
researcher would do at the beginning of
an experiment is to say

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
an experiment is to say
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.050
an experiment is to say
you know what is my question and that's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
you know what is my question and that's
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.300
you know what is my question and that's
exactly what Holmes does he says what is

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
exactly what Holmes does he says what is
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.220
exactly what Holmes does he says what is
my goal what do I want to accomplish

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
my goal what do I want to accomplish
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.220
my goal what do I want to accomplish
before he ever opens the case before he

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
before he ever opens the case before he
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.559
before he ever opens the case before he
ever meets a client he already wants to

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569
ever meets a client he already wants to
 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.380
ever meets a client he already wants to
know what is it that I want to get from

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
know what is it that I want to get from
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.390
know what is it that I want to get from
this meeting and so he comes into the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
this meeting and so he comes into the
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.220
this meeting and so he comes into the
meeting with a prepared mind set his

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
meeting with a prepared mind set his
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.619
meeting with a prepared mind set his
attic has already been primed so to

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629
attic has already been primed so to
 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.750
attic has already been primed so to
speak to take in certain inputs and to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
speak to take in certain inputs and to
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.330
speak to take in certain inputs and to
not allow other inputs in this is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
not allow other inputs in this is
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.979
not allow other inputs in this is
important because attention is

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
important because attention is
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.429
important because attention is
incredibly finite and so we don't have

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439
incredibly finite and so we don't have
 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.530
incredibly finite and so we don't have
just endless resources so we can't pay

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
just endless resources so we can't pay
 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.300
just endless resources so we can't pay
attention to everything we do need to be

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
attention to everything we do need to be
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.149
attention to everything we do need to be
selective in what we pay attention to

now the scientist after kind of setting
 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.440
now the scientist after kind of setting
this hypothesis would say okay how would

this hypothesis would say okay how would
I go about testing it that's once again

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
I go about testing it that's once again

I go about testing it that's once again
exactly what Sherlock Holmes does after

ok how do I answer this question and

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169
ok how do I answer this question and
 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.500
ok how do I answer this question and
what is it about this conversation about

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510
what is it about this conversation about
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.300

gather the data that I will then be able
to use to see whether my hypothesis

to use to see whether my hypothesis
 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.020
to use to see whether my hypothesis
holds up and then he does this thing

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030
holds up and then he does this thing
 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.420
holds up and then he does this thing
that every great scientist does and I

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.449
mind still open do I still know what's
going on does this data somehow make me

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459
going on does this data somehow make me
 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.089
going on does this data somehow make me
think of new ideas think of new

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099
think of new ideas think of new
 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.770
think of new ideas think of new
approaches think of things that I hadn't

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
approaches think of things that I hadn't
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.689
approaches think of things that I hadn't
thought of in the past and so he has

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699
thought of in the past and so he has
 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.509
thought of in the past and so he has
this incredible space for imagination

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519
this incredible space for imagination
 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.580
this incredible space for imagination
and I think that that is an essential

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590
and I think that that is an essential
 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.080
and I think that that is an essential
part of the scientific method as well

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
part of the scientific method as well
 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.719
part of the scientific method as well
you know scientists from Feynman to

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729
you know scientists from Feynman to
 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.629
you know scientists from Feynman to
Einstein have really valued the

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639
Einstein have really valued the
 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.429
Einstein have really valued the
importance of imagination and have

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439
importance of imagination and have
 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.949
importance of imagination and have
spoken a lot about it so the reason I'm

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959
spoken a lot about it so the reason I'm
 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.509
spoken a lot about it so the reason I'm
stressing this is because people tend to

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519
stressing this is because people tend to
 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.890
stressing this is because people tend to
forget it when they think about the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900
forget it when they think about the
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.229
forget it when they think about the
scientific method now finally what you

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
scientific method now finally what you
 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.780
scientific method now finally what you
do after that is you go back to the data

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
do after that is you go back to the data
 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.210
do after that is you go back to the data
and you look at the kind of what you've

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220
and you look at the kind of what you've
 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.620
and you look at the kind of what you've
done with it and you see what makes

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630
done with it and you see what makes
 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.140
done with it and you see what makes
sense based on my observations have I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150
sense based on my observations have I
 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.029
sense based on my observations have I
framed the question properly have I

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039
framed the question properly have I
 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.190
framed the question properly have I
accomplished my goal or do I need to

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200
accomplished my goal or do I need to
 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.000
accomplished my goal or do I need to
start over

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010
start over
 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.040
start over
because it's an iterative process you

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050
because it's an iterative process you
 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.840
because it's an iterative process you
may need to go through this method over

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850
may need to go through this method over
 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.910
may need to go through this method over
and over and over until you finally come

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920
and over and over until you finally come
 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.640
and over and over until you finally come
to a conclusion and that's kind of the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650
to a conclusion and that's kind of the
 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.740
to a conclusion and that's kind of the
final step of Holmes's approach he

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750
final step of Holmes's approach he
 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.660
final step of Holmes's approach he
always keeps his education going he

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670
always keeps his education going he
 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.920
always keeps his education going he
realizes that the scientific method

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930
realizes that the scientific method
 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.470
realizes that the scientific method
doesn't have an end you're always going

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480
doesn't have an end you're always going
 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.240
doesn't have an end you're always going
to have to go back to the beginning it's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250
to have to go back to the beginning it's
 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.870
to have to go back to the beginning it's
going to be a constant feedback loop
