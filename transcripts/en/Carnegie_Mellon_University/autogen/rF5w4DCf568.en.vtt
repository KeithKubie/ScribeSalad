anyway so at that time as was just
mentioned you know there was no computer

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580
mentioned you know there was no computer
 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.770
mentioned you know there was no computer
science major which is kind of amazing

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780
science major which is kind of amazing
 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.340
science major which is kind of amazing
it seeing all of you if you wanted to

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350
it seeing all of you if you wanted to
 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.780
it seeing all of you if you wanted to
study computer science which I didn't

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790
study computer science which I didn't
 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.370
study computer science which I didn't
because I didn't know anything about it

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380
because I didn't know anything about it
 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.810
because I didn't know anything about it
you know as a math major and I did this

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820
you know as a math major and I did this
 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.199
you know as a math major and I did this
math studies sequence but if you and

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209
math studies sequence but if you and
 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.150
math studies sequence but if you and
then I heard about that there was this

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160
then I heard about that there was this
 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.530
then I heard about that there was this
very good computer science department

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540
very good computer science department
 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.890
very good computer science department
and there was a computer science track

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900
and there was a computer science track
 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.200
and there was a computer science track
so that's what I did they sort of went

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210
so that's what I did they sort of went
 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.959
so that's what I did they sort of went
from the math study sequence to study

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969
from the math study sequence to study
 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.989
from the math study sequence to study

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139
776 to 79 there were very strong women
 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.110
776 to 79 there were very strong women
mentors around here there was Anita

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120
mentors around here there was Anita
 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.089
mentors around here there was Anita
Jones there was Mary Shaw there were

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:24.099
Jones there was Mary Shaw there were
 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:25.890
Jones there was Mary Shaw there were
very powerful presence in the department

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900
very powerful presence in the department
 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.629
very powerful presence in the department
you know I there were people that I

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639
you know I there were people that I
 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.670
you know I there were people that I
looked up to and I know this is still a

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680
looked up to and I know this is still a
 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.529
looked up to and I know this is still a
part of public part of the you know

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539
part of public part of the you know
 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:33.600
part of public part of the you know
conversation but I didn't actually

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610
conversation but I didn't actually
 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.950
conversation but I didn't actually
realize it at the time because these

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960
realize it at the time because these
 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.749
realize it at the time because these
women were so kind of up front there and

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759
women were so kind of up front there and
 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.300
women were so kind of up front there and
present so this was all about personal

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310
present so this was all about personal
 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.830
present so this was all about personal
you know about me about how honored I am

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840
you know about me about how honored I am
 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.709
you know about me about how honored I am
so just saying a few more general things

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:45.719
so just saying a few more general things
 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:50.550
so just saying a few more general things
as you know this is a yeah is no longer

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560
as you know this is a yeah is no longer
 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.499
as you know this is a yeah is no longer
exactly a young field it's not such an

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:52.509
exactly a young field it's not such an
 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:54.480
exactly a young field it's not such an
old field when I start in cryptography

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.490
old field when I start in cryptography
 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.469
old field when I start in cryptography
there was this paper by different

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479
there was this paper by different
 

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:56.790
there was this paper by different
Hillman that said we are on the brink of

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800
Hillman that said we are on the brink of
 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.559
Hillman that said we are on the brink of
a revolution I think it's completely

00:07:58.559 --> 00:07:58.569
a revolution I think it's completely
 

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:00.689
a revolution I think it's completely
true again now that we are on the brink

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:00.699
true again now that we are on the brink
 

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:02.370
true again now that we are on the brink
of a revolution that somehow it's been

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:02.380
of a revolution that somehow it's been
 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.309
of a revolution that somehow it's been
recognized that these automated

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319
recognized that these automated
 

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:07.439
recognized that these automated
data-driven algorithms can change the

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:07.449
data-driven algorithms can change the
 

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:09.330
data-driven algorithms can change the
world in so many disciplines and of

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:09.340
world in so many disciplines and of
 

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.499
world in so many disciplines and of
course there's a lot of warnings because

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:10.509
course there's a lot of warnings because
 

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:12.089
course there's a lot of warnings because
when you change the world you might sure

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:12.099
when you change the world you might sure
 

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:14.459
when you change the world you might sure
you do it too quickly without realizing

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:14.469
you do it too quickly without realizing
 

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:16.019
you do it too quickly without realizing
what you're doing but it's an incredible

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:16.029
what you're doing but it's an incredible
 

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.379
what you're doing but it's an incredible
period it's like wow if I had to choose

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:18.389
period it's like wow if I had to choose
 

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.300
period it's like wow if I had to choose
what I was going to major in today I

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:21.310
what I was going to major in today I
 

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.939
what I was going to major in today I
would do the same except this time it

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:23.949
would do the same except this time it
 

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:25.769
would do the same except this time it
actually makes sense and then he was

00:08:25.769 --> 00:08:25.779
actually makes sense and then he was
 

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:27.320
actually makes sense and then he was
sort of by chance

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.330
sort of by chance
 

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.189
sort of by chance
another thing you know because I'm a

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199
another thing you know because I'm a
 

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:32.250
another thing you know because I'm a
theorist I would say that don't forget

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.260
theorist I would say that don't forget
 

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.529
theorist I would say that don't forget
the importance of basic research and the

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:34.539
the importance of basic research and the
 

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.089
the importance of basic research and the
importance of recognizing a good idea

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:36.099
importance of recognizing a good idea
 

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.920
importance of recognizing a good idea
when it comes out even though it's not

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:37.930
when it comes out even though it's not
 

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.300
when it comes out even though it's not
clear that it was made to solve a

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.310
clear that it was made to solve a
 

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.089
clear that it was made to solve a
particular application tomorrow but I

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:42.099
particular application tomorrow but I
 

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.670
particular application tomorrow but I
can honestly tell you that I find look

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680
can honestly tell you that I find look
 

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.319
can honestly tell you that I find look
at all the big revolutions we have in

00:08:46.319 --> 00:08:46.329
at all the big revolutions we have in
 

00:08:46.329 --> 00:08:48.689
at all the big revolutions we have in
the computer science it all started with

00:08:48.689 --> 00:08:48.699
the computer science it all started with
 

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:51.630
the computer science it all started with
some ideas in some paper which is about

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.640
some ideas in some paper which is about
 

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.210
some ideas in some paper which is about
the fundamentals and it may take a 10

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:54.220
the fundamentals and it may take a 10
 

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.920
the fundamentals and it may take a 10
years it may take 20 years sometimes may

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:55.930
years it may take 20 years sometimes may
 

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.389
years it may take 20 years sometimes may
take 30 years and then you see it come

00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399
take 30 years and then you see it come
 

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:57.650
take 30 years and then you see it come
to

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660
to
 

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.590
to
and maybe change the world from impact

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600
and maybe change the world from impact
 

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.780
and maybe change the world from impact
on industry impact on money impact on

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:02.790
on industry impact on money impact on
 

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.870
on industry impact on money impact on
governments even well I was just telling

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880
governments even well I was just telling
 

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.300
governments even well I was just telling
me that maybe world peace you know there

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.310
me that maybe world peace you know there
 

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.800
me that maybe world peace you know there
is a lot that can be done there's a lot

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:12.810
is a lot that can be done there's a lot
 

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.300
is a lot that can be done there's a lot
of wisdom from the past and you have got

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:14.310
of wisdom from the past and you have got
 

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.980
of wisdom from the past and you have got
the wisdom to generate ideas for the

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:15.990
the wisdom to generate ideas for the
 

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.040
