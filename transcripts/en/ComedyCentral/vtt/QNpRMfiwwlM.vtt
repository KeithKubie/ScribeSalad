00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.636
- So, I came up with three
ways how I was gonna be cool.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.272
I'm like an alien studying
human behavior, you know?

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.141
Alright, this is
what they prefer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.542 line:0%
(audience laughs)

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.228 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Welcome to This Is Not
Happening Presents Fisticuffs.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.629
If you've never been
to the show before,

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.131
this is a bunch of comics

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.299
telling fun stories about
real shit that happened.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.135
Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend and yours,

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.570 line:0%
Mr. Kumail Nanjiani, everybody.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.874
(audience applauds)

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:41.708
- Hey.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.077
Okay, so I'm gonna
tell this story,

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.078
but there's a couple caveats.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.013
One, it's not actually,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.984 align:start size:88% position:13%
there's no actual
fisticuffs that happen.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.853
So, don't look for a
physical confrontation,

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.655 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's not gonna come.
(audience laughs)

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.158
'Cause I'm physically very weak,

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.593 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I'm super good
at apologizing.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.496
(audience laughs)

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.466
So, I'll bring it
right to the point

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.801 align:start size:84% position:16%
where it's gonna
happen, then I'm like,

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.903
I'm so sorry, you're right.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.505 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm a fucking asshole.
(audience laughs)

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.075
Two, there a point in this story

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.310 align:start size:81% position:19%
where you're gonna
get really sad

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.913
and you're gonna feel
really bad for me.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.747
Don't.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.915
(audience laughs)

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.417 align:start size:88% position:13%
We're gonna get through
it together, okay?

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.785
Are we okay with that?

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.187 align:start size:81% position:19%
Alright.
(audience cheers)

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.121
Okay.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.557
So, I grew up in Pakistan.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.592
That's not the sad
part of the story.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.527
(audience laughs)

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:35.361
Ha ha ha.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.664
(audience laughs)

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.998
So, when I was a kid in Pakistan

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.967 align:start size:84% position:16%
all I wanted to do
was be cool, you know?

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.103 align:start size:97% position:3%
I wanted to be one of the
cool kids, and I just wasn't.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
I didn't have it, at
school I didn't have it.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.273 align:start size:94% position:6%
I went to British
schooling and how it works

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.275 align:start size:84% position:16%
is you do 11 grades
in one school,

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.344
then last two years you can
go to a different school,

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.079
depending on your grades,
go to a different school.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.647
And I got really good grades

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.216
so I got to go to
the best school.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.152 align:start position:0%
Like the rich kids' school,
the cool kids school, you know.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.820
And I remember being
like, oh, I could be,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.755
they don't know I'm not cool.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.724 align:start size:97% position:3%
I could pretend to be cool.
(audience laughs)

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.326
And they're gonna think I'm
cool, this is gonna great,

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.528 align:start size:97% position:3%
this is the best fucking thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.029
(audience laughs)

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.700
So I came up with three ways
how I was gonna be cool, okay.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.736 align:start size:84% position:16%
Way one, I was gonna
walk way slower.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.572
(audience laughs)

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.209
'Cause in my head, cool
people walked really slow

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.745 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I remember once
seeing LL Cool J walking.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.213
(audience laughs)

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.782 align:start size:94% position:6%
And being like, he has
the word cool in his name.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:32.018 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he doesn't, he's probably
never run in his life.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.953
So that'll work.
(audience laughs)

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.523
I'm like an alien studying
human behavior, you know.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.324
Alright, this is
what hey prefer.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.327
(audience laughs)

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.228
That's one.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.798
Two, I was gonna change my laugh

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.301
to be like way smaller.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.869
It was just gonna be
like barely a laugh.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.305 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, say something to me sir,
say anything and I'm gonna.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.273
Say anything.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.340
- [Man] You're from Pakistan.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.208
- Ha.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:58.044
(audience laughs)

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.981 align:start size:81% position:19%
Heh.
(audience laughs)

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.750
Right, super cool, right?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.984
(audience laughs)

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.819
Super weird response
to what you just said.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.088
(audience laughs)

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:09.923
Ha.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.962
Three, I was gonna be
like the insult guy.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.363
I was gonna like insult people

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.531
and I was gonna be
really good at it,

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.667
and they'll think I'm cool.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.636 align:start size:94% position:6%
That could go either way.
(audience laughs)

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.673
so, I get to the school and
the cool kids at the school

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.876 align:start size:88% position:13%
are like way cooler
than any kids I've seen.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.411
They're like the
fucking coolest!

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.313 align:start size:94% position:6%
They have like great hair.
(audience laughs)

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:36.549 align:start size:94% position:6%
The dudes wear these
chains that look awesome.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.551
And they all sit
under this tree.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:39.819
They all sit under this one tree

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.921
and it's the greenest
tree you've ever seen.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.356
(audience laughs)

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.658
I bet if you did like
math, it would be right

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.161 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the center of the
school, you know.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.230 align:start size:97% position:3%
And they would sing all day.
(chuckles)

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.432
They would sit there
and they would sing.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.534
And the song they
would sing was,

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.270
do you remember
Informer by Snow?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.072
(audience laughs)

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.006
You guys remember that song?

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.674
♪ Informer

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:02.976 align:start size:81% position:19%
That song.
(audience laughs)

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.078
By the way, that
song was a hit here

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.914
but it hit us super
hard in Pakistan.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:11.551
It was the best fucking
song we had ever heard.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.286
It changed our lives.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.922
'Cause this was years
after the song came out

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.558
and it was still the
best fucking song.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:20.927 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was like the heavens
opened, the angels sang to us.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.161
♪ Informer

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:24.964
We were like, that's the
best song of all time.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.066
So they would sit there,
if you guys don't know,

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.235
he's this white guy from Canada

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.938 align:start size:84% position:16%
who sings like a black
guy from Jamaica.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.239
(audience laughs)

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.707
And then on top of that,

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.343
also put little Pakistani
kids singing that, so.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:40.013 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, so many
appropriations happening.

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.614
(audience laughs)

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.650
So it was, and then
I found out also,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.421 align:start position:0%
the school, the coolness
hierarchy was based on insults.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.390 align:start size:97% position:3%
The better you are insults,
the cooler you were.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.624 align:start size:81% position:19%
I was like, that's
fucking great,

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.926
that's exactly what
my whole plan was.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.361 align:start size:81% position:19%
That's great.
(audience laughs)

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.130
Are you guys also into
walking really slow,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.831
'cause I'm gonna be king.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.733
(audience laughs)

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.335 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the highest
insult you could do,

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:03.803
if you could twist someone's,

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start size:97% position:3%
take someone's words, twist
them and call them gay.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.041
(audience laughs)

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.677
That was the king of insults.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.880
And listen, I know it's
horrible, I'm homophobic,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.416
I didn't start it.
(audience laughs)

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.686
But when I first heard about
it, I did nothing to stop it.

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.220
(audience laughs)

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.589
I'm not trying to change the
world, I just wanna be cool.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.024
(audience laughs)

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.459 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, I remember one time,
one of the cool kids

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.261 align:start size:84% position:16%
was making fun of
me and he went by J.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.063
His last name started
with J, he went by J.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.098 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like,
heh, more like gay.

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.333
(audience laughs)

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.835
And he looked at me and
was like, you're cool.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.671
(audience laughs)

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.209 align:start size:97% position:3%
The other thing at the
school was, all the new kids,

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.111 align:start size:88% position:13%
they called us newcomers
and newcomers were,

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.380
but I remember him walking up
to his friend, his cool friend

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.249 align:start position:0%
being like, "Hey, some of these
newcomers are pretty cool."

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.385
That's me, I'm one
of the cool kids!

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.821 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm almost there, alright.
(audience laughs)

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.756 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I'm sort of
enjoying, and then,

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:59.025
somehow they figured
out I wasn't cool.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.326
Like, it just happened.

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.061
(audience laughs)

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.296
Like, one day I got to school

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.597
and everybody looked
at me differently.

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:05.898
Like some bulletin went out,

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:07.333
like Kumail is not cool.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.469 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I think at this school,
I think more schools,

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.637 align:start size:84% position:16%
cool is like a very
specific thing.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.773 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like you're either cool
or you're not cool.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.441
It's very specific groups.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.511 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I was not cool, suddenly.
(audience laughs)

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.980 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it fucking sucked 'cause
I tasted cool, you know.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.549
I'd gotten invited
to one cool party.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.118 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got like my
cousin's cool shirt.

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:27.520
I called someone gay,
I was doing great.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.589
(audience laughs)

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start size:94% position:6%
I never got sing Informer
with them, you know.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.061
I went back to being not cool.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.197 align:start size:94% position:6%
I became friends with this
guy, his name's Walid,

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:41.801 align:start position:0%
so you know, I'm not lying about
this happening in Pakistan.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.035
(audience laughs)

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.204
That's a fucking O-G name.

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:49.008
His name's Walid and
he's one of those kids,

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:51.611 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know how you have
some kids who would like,

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:55.348 align:start size:97% position:3%
come back from summer and
suddenly they were like hot?

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.983
Like this guy came
back from a summer

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.051 align:start size:81% position:19%
and he became like
super handsome.

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:00.319
(audience laughs)

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.021
Like he stepped into the
Captain America machine.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.489
(audience laughs)

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.825 align:start size:94% position:6%
And came out and was like,
I am ready to be cool.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.027
But he wasn't cool so now, but
the girls had crushes on him.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:10.863
The cool girls had crushes
on him, he could be cool.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:14.066
So I was like, alright, I'll
maybe use him to get cool.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.067
(audience laughs)

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.369
He used to like help me,

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.904
I used to help him
with his homework,

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:20.740
he used to come over to
my house, all this stuff.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.410
One day, I'm at home
alone, bell rings.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.679 align:start size:84% position:16%
I look out the
window, it's Walid.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.881
He's like, hey, come down.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.283
I go down there and he's like,

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.552 align:start size:84% position:16%
hey, come to the
end of the driveway.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:35.288
I'm like that's kinda weird, I
go to the end of the driveway

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.522
(audience laughs)

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:39.525
this car pulls up and
all the coolest kids

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:40.893
in the school jump out.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.395
And I'm like, oh my god,

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.764 align:start size:84% position:16%
they came to get me.
(audience laughs)

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.666
I'm one of them, we're
gonna go to a party.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:50.203 align:start size:97% position:3%
And while I'm thinking that
is when the first egg hits me.

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.671
(audience groans)

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:53.739 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I don't, it smells so
bad, I don't even register it.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.041
The second one hits
me and I'm like,

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.677
I realize what the fuck
is going on, you know.

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:59.045
And then I look over at Walid,

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause I think he's
gonna look like guilty

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.716 align:start size:84% position:16%
or feel regret but
he's fucking laughing!

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.618
(audience laughs)
He's laughing!

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.287
Even Walid, even his name
sounds evil, doesn't it?

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:11.457
Walid, like it sounds
like Warrio, you know.

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:12.959
(audience laughs)

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:15.495
Like there's a good version
of him somewhere called Malid

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.729
but this isn't him.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.297
(audience laughs)

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.465
This is Walid.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.369
So I turn around
and I start running

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.804 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the eggs are
hitting me in the back

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start size:84% position:16%
and as I'm running,
I turn around,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.408
one last-ditch effort, I go,

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.879
"Hey, eggs backward is
gay, are you guys gay?"

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.715
(audience laughs)

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:40.586 align:start size:97% position:3%
As if there gonna be like,
wait, did he just call us gay?

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.888
(audience laughs)

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:43.990
Stop it, you're cool, let's go!

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.192
You know the lyrics to Informer?

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.227
(audience laughs)

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:50.162
That doesn't happen.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:52.164
I run back in, they leave,

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:55.368
I have to come up and then
I have to clean the eggs

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.636
before my parents get home.

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.838
Yeah, 'cause what am I
gonna tell my parents?

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start size:84% position:16%
I go, I was working
one of my uh...

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.876 align:start size:88% position:13%
Patented driveway cakes
(audience laughs)

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.579
and shit got out of
control, you know.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:07.980
Oh, why am I crying?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.783 align:start size:94% position:6%
'Cause the cake fucked up.
(audience laughs)

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:15.054 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was really excited
about the driveway cake.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:17.056 align:start size:81% position:19%
Fucked up.
(audience laughs)

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.425
I went back to school and
there were two things.

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:22.295 align:start size:84% position:16%
One, Walid is sitting
under the tree

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.231
and he's fucking singing
Informer with these guys.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.165
He got cool.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.533
I was gonna use him to get cool,

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:29.936
he used me to get even cooler.

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:33.839
But I would look at him and
he knew I knew his secret.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.675 align:start size:84% position:16%
The other thing, they
knew immediately.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.243
Everyone knew that
I'd gotten egged.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.146 align:start size:97% position:3%
Somehow the word had gotten
out, I'd gotten egged.

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I dealt with it
very sophisticated way,

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.849
they would ask me,
they would be like,

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:44.717
hey, you got egged?

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:45.985
I'd be like, no.

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.253
I just denied it.
(audience laughs)

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.588
That's what I did.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.956 align:start size:84% position:16%
Then after a little
while, they were like,

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.390 align:start size:97% position:3%
oh, he's just mentally ill,
(audience laughs)

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.260
let's not fuck with him anymore.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.995
So then I wasn't cool

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.632 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I started having
friends and they were good,

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.768 align:start size:81% position:19%
they weren't cool,
I was not cool.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:05.171
So this all happens years ago.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:08.007
I thought of this, I hadn't
thought about this in years.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.309
But I was on Facebook last week

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.511
and I get a friend request.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:15.448 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it's fucking Walid.
(audience laughs)

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.050
And all the details came
flooding back, you know.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.586 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like Captain America,
Donatello, eggs.

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.687
Fucking eggs!

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.890
(audience laughs)

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.192
So I click on his
picture, I'm like,

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:27.793
oh he's gonna be fat and bald.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:30.796 align:start size:88% position:13%
He's not, very handsome.
(audience laughs)

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:33.766
He looks great.
(audience laughs)

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.034
And then I realized, I was like,

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.370
this guy taught me a
very important lesson.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.171 align:start size:97% position:3%
He taught me that it doesn't
matter if other people

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:40.640
think you're cool, you know.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
What matters is, if
you think you're cool.

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.378
Be yourself, don't
walk differently.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.846
Walk like you.

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:49.148 align:start size:94% position:6%
Don't be Snow and pretend
to be someone else,

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.017 align:start size:81% position:19%
be yourself.
(audience laughs)

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start size:94% position:6%
That was a very important
lesson he taught me.

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:56.322 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I looked at his
request and I hit decline,

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.857
'cause fuck that guy.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:59.759
(audience laughs)
(audience applauds)

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.360
Thank you, that's the story.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.196
(deep bass music)

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.668
- Kumail Nanjiani, everybody.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.503 align:start size:84% position:16%
One of the best
comics in Los Angeles.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.239 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's done this show a couple
times, once in Montreal,

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:16.308 align:start size:88% position:13%
obliterated off alcohol
and he was awesome.

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.477
Another time, pretty
sober in Los Angeles.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:19.945
Ask you to leave
me the best stories

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:23.883
as comments on YouTube
section and you guys did.

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:25.718
Best pranks and here are
some really good ones.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.886
There's a lot we
had to leave off

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.988 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause of (chuckles)
legal reasons.

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.756
Next week, based
on Kumail's story,

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:33.125
why don't you tell me about
stuff you can do to be cool.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.694
Like walking slow

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.095
or laughing short.

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.363
Whatever it is.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.931
Leave me your tips
on how to be cool.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.501
I'll post the best ones on my
second story from this series

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.936
that's coming out next week.

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:45.604
It'll be the last
story of the run.

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:47.306
Thank you guys for
tuning in so far.

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:49.475 align:start size:88% position:13%
And that's it everybody,
until next week,

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:52.211
the final week, I will
see you next Tuesday.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.114
