00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:04.256
&gt;&gt;I would prefer you to not take the
calculator outta the room, thinking,

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:06.406
"I need to use my calculator,"
and then leave it on the stairs

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.486
and then I cry, when I'm like,
"Where's the calculator?"

00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:11.426
&gt;&gt;Ben is my math teacher.

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:14.356
He immediately made the
impression on me that he was funny

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:18.856
and that he was eager to teach kids
and that he really liked his job.

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:23.616
He wants you to really reach
and get better at math.

00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:25.236
&gt;&gt;My name is Benjamin Mook.

00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:27.426
I'm a math teacher at
School of the Future.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.156
I teach the seventh and
eighth grade math cycle.

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:32.656
If you think about to de-- What I'd
say is an authentic assessment would

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:36.656
be something that a teacher
could design to hit the skills

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:38.666
and the needs of their population.

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:41.846
Some of these things that I'm
assessing are not necessarily

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:46.136
that kids can get to a right answer,
but that kids, once they have

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:49.686
that right answer, can understand,
"I got to this right answer

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:51.476
because I followed steps."

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:57.016
I'll just pose questions and try to
figure out what common mistakes are.

00:00:57.336 --> 00:01:01.866
And when I can get a whole mess
of like ten or fifteen mistakes,

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.216
that it doesn't even
matter who made them.

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:06.806
Like I could have a kid that's an
A student that has like an error

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:11.446
in logic on how to do a certain type
of problem, and then I can use that

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.476
and pose that as a
question to students later.

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:17.126
So I'll take a mistake that they'll
make and then, one or two days later,

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:21.196
I'll throw it back into the class.

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:23.706
&gt;&gt;So what I want you to do is
this: based on the information

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:26.046
on this sheet-- there you go.

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:28.266
&gt;&gt;One of my more favorite
types of assessment is

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.026
to actually give them incorrect
work or incorrect answers

00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:34.866
and have them break down the
error in thought process, of,

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:38.586
"How could a student who's not
as well educated as you-- ?"

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.856
or start out like that.

00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:42.906
Like, "You would never make
this mistake, but somebody did,

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:47.476
and how would this mistake happen
and how could you, as a classmate

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.976
or a tutor, remediate this mistake?"

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:57.026
&gt;&gt;Today they were applying the slope
formula to a set of stairs and seeing

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.546
if they were in compliance with
New York City building codes.

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.766
Okay, this is the math.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:08.456
This is how the math connects to
the real life, and that was my goal.

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:12.116
&gt;&gt;I really like that we get
to use our hands in class

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:15.306
and that we really get to experience
this in a real life situation,

00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:17.526
and that it's not just,
"Here's the formula."

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:21.786
It's like, "Here's why the formula
works and, you know, here's something

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:24.946
to prove it, or here's how
you could think about it."

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.726
&gt;&gt;Things that I'm doing
now I've designed

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:34.636
so that during a class period, the
student is working and I am able

00:02:34.636 --> 00:02:38.236
to walk around and kind of coach
them through what they are doing.

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:41.846
And so I can look and anticipate
the problems they're having,

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:45.646
so in the classroom, I'm
spending a lot less energy.

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:48.306
Like I end the school
day now not tired.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:50.726
&gt;&gt;When we talk about
authentic assessment,

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:52.566
obviously things can
only be as authentic

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:53.986
within the four walls of a school.

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:59.526
So we want the tasks that they do to
challenge them to synthesize things

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:03.606
and to approach problems in
the way that a scientist does

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:06.446
or historian does or a
reader does or a writer does,

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:10.406
and to make those tasks and those
challenges as authentic as possible.

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:13.696
&gt;&gt;And five minutes from now,
we get back to each other.

00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:17.696
&gt;&gt;I think not only Ben but the
rest of the teachers at SOF

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:22.486
and at the school, they really
do want you to think about it

00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:25.876
and their main goal is not to
get you to the right answer,

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:30.486
but to show how you got there, and
show that you really put effort

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.136
into what you were thinking.

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.476
&gt;&gt;The thing that I
find most important is

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:37.776
that I'm not assessing my kids
to be able to give them an A, B,

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:40.996
C or D. Like that's
not gonna help my kids.

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:45.046
I would say that the best use
of assessment is to figure

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:51.486
out where they're at and how I can
get them to where I want them to be.
