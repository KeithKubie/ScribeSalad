00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.400
Some of the promised benefits of

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.120
Network Virtualization are more rapid innovation since

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.560
innovation can proceed at the rate at

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.980
which software evolves. Rather on hardware development

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.240
cycles, allowing for new forms of network

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.880
control, and potentially simplifying programming. It is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.400
important to make a distinction between Network

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.390
Virtualization and Software-Defined Networking. Network Virtualization is

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.160
arguably one of the first killer applications for

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.820
SDN. And in some sense, SDN is a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.920
tool for implementing Network virtualization. But the two

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.790
are not one in the same. Remember the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.930
defining tenant of SDN is the separation of

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.940
the data and control plant, whereas the defining

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.660
tenant of Network virtualization. Is to separate the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.520
underlying physical network from the logical networks that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.580
lie on top of it. So SDN can be used to simplify many aspects of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.180
Network virtualization. But it does not inherently

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.020
obstruct the details of the underlying physical network.
