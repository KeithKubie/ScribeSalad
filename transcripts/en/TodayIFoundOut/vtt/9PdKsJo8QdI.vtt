00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.340
Over two decades before Buzz and Neil put
their feet on the Moon, humans were already

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.150
preparing for that day by sending other living
organisms to space.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.660
In 1947, the United States blasted fruit flies
into space in a captured Nazi V-2 rocket.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.550
Alongside packets of rye and cotton seeds,
the original intention of the flies’ mission

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.279
was to determine the effects of cosmic rays
on living organisms.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.880
When the flies’ canister parachuted back
to Earth, scientists were relieved to find

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.720
the fruit flies still alive.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.650
In 1948, America took the next step and sent
a monkey to space.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.600
This didn’t go as well.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.260
Albert I, a rhesus monkey, was anesthetized
before even being put on the V-2 Blossom.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.070
While the rocket launched successfully, scientists
later speculated that Albert probably wasn’t

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.430
alive for the flight due to having likely
suffocated in the very cramped capsule before

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.430
takeoff.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.100
Even if he was alive for the trip, with the
rocket only reaching 39 miles (62 km) in altitude,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.000
the parachute mechanism failed and the rocket
had a violent crash landing, which would have

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
likely killed him.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.260
At least the name “Albert” lived on because,
from that point on, the proceeding tests involving

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.869
monkeys in the United States were known as
the “Albert project.”

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.420
Albert II’s fate was no better, though he
was given more breathing room and survived

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.420
the flight.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.900
But after reaching a maximum altitude of 83
miles, officially crossing the Kármán line

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.510
becoming the first primate in space, he died
upon impact when the parachutes failed.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.179
Alberts III through V all were sent into space
and none survived, either due to impact, mid-air

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.299
explosion or a complication during the flight.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.229
Until 1959, no primate had ever returned to
Earth from space alive.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.530
Meanwhile in the Soviet Union, the Russians
were sending a different type of animal into

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.530
the great unknown.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.149
Around the same time the Americans were performing
their monkey experiments, the Russians were

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.530
sending rabbits, mice and rats.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.840
Then, they decided dogs were the next logical
step due to, as Vladimir Yazdovsky, the head

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.850
of the biological program for space research
at the Institute for Aviation Medicine in

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.280
Moscow, said: “We selected dogs as biological
objects because their psychology is very well-studied,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.450
they adapt well to training, are very communicative,
and social with people.”

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.660
It also helped that dogs were readily available,
with Moscow awash with stray canines at the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.660
time.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.370
In August of 1951, Dezik and Tsygan (meaning
“Gypsy”) was launched into the sky.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.640
After going to an altitude of 62 miles (100
km), the capsule with the two canines crashed

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.220
rather hard on Earth, leaving Russian scientists
fearing the worst.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.750
When they opened the capsule, however, barking
greeted them.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.250
Dezik and Tsygen were the first beings (besides
fruit flies and perhaps microbes) to go into

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.790
space and return to Earth safely – save
for a little motion sickness.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.090
Over the next eight years, the Soviets sent
many dogs to space, of which a good portion

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.920
came back to Earth alive and relatively well.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.650
Famously, in 1957, a pup named Laika became
the first to circle the Earth.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.370
Whether Laika was actually still alive during
that first orbit is a source of much debate,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.770
with her early death likely due to overheating
and panic, though it should be noted that,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.130
sadly, there were no plans to recover Laika
after the orbit.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.250
One of the scientists involved in Laika’s
mission, Oleg Gazenko, later stated of this,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.290
“Work with animals is a source of suffering
to all of us…

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.090
The more time passes, the more I’m sorry
about it.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.280
We shouldn’t have done it…

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.470
We did not learn enough from this mission
to justify the death of the dog.”

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.930
While the Russians certainly did have success
with canines, dogs are a far cry from humans.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.540
Primates, on the other hand, are in the same
family.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.590
Determined to finally get their own efforts
right, NASA choose two monkeys for its next

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.280
mission in 1959.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.010
The first was another female rhesus monkey
named Able.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.910
Picked from a lot of 24 that came from a zoo
in Independence, Kansas, Able was chosen for

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.070
the mission with direct orders from President
Eisenhower.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.190
This was due to the original primate space
cadet being Indian-born and, since some in

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.400
India consider the rhesus monkey sacred, President
Eisenhower thought it would be best for political

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.870
reasons to send an American-born rhesus monkey
to space instead.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.540
The second monkey chosen for the mission was
also selected from a large group, this time

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.600
of 25, purchased from a pet shop in Miami.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.220
The two year old, one pound South American-born
Miss Baker was determined to be the best of

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.490
the bunch, due to her propensity to not seem
to mind being confined for long periods, her

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.290
docile nature, intelligence, seeming to enjoy
being handled, and general friendliness towards

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.729
humans, with her nickname becoming “TLC”
(Tender Loving Care).

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.480
With the selections made, the two monkeys
were sent into training for their date with

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480
history.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.280
AbleEach monkey was fitted with specially
made suits with sensors to track pulse, body

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.469
temperature and movement.

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.719
Able’s was tightly fitted, allowing for
minimal movement, but giving her enough room

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:43.190
to perform a simple task on the flight- she
was trained to press a button whenever a red

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.830
light flashed, so that the humans below could
test her coordination and focus while in space.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.949
Miss Baker’s suit was lined with foam rubber
and leather and she was fitted into a very

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.169
small life support capsule, nearly the size
of a thermos, which gave her no room to move.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.539
Both monkeys had fiberglass helmets.

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:09.099
At 2:35 a.m. on May 28, 1959, the giant Jupiter
AM-18 blasted into the sky, reaching speeds

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.980
in excess of 10,000 mph, with the two primates
seated not-so-comfortably in the nose cone.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.210
Their flight lasted about 17 minutes before
they plunged into the ocean about 250 miles

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.749
southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.289
The recovery team immediately went in search
of them.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.289
Initially, there was fear that the capsule
had sunk, much like a predecessor of theirs.

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.479
But then the crew spotted it bobbing in the
water.

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.820
Shortly thereafter, a message came through
to the Cape Canaveral control room, “Able

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.050
Baker perfect.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.330
No injuries or other difficulties.”

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.939
The two monkeys had become the first primates
to travel in space and return home safely.

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.639
Miss_BakerAble and Miss Baker arrived back
to the United States to a hero’s welcome,

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.169
first going to their own private officer quarters
with recently installed air conditioning.

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.879
Then, they were flown to Washington DC for
a “welcome back” press conference.

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:59.060
There, correspondents “pushed each other
and clambered over chairs to get closer,”

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.289
to the monkeys reported The New York Times.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.220
As for the heroes themselves, “the monkeys
were far less excited than the humans.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.590
They munched peanuts and crackers.”

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.139
Able and Miss Baker were awarded medals and
merits.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.669
A month later, they were on the cover of LIFE
Magazine.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.680
For Able, unfortunately, fame was short lived.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.870
It was supposed to be a minor operation, one
simply to remove leftover electrodes from

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.490
the trip four days earlier.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.020
Doctors were very careful with her, but after
administering anesthesia, the monkey inexplicably

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.699
went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.590
After spending nearly two hours attempting
to save Able’s life, the doctors working

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.580
on her accepted the inevitable- she was gone.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.289
Able died on June 1, 1959, only days after
returning home.

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.550
Today, she’s preserved and on display at
the National Air and Space Museum in Washington

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.550
DC.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.550
miss-baker-birthdayAs for Miss Baker, she
went on to live a life worthy of an American

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.550
hero.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.150
After her media blitz, she retired to the
Naval Air Training Station in Pensacola in

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.660
a custom built home.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.999
Three years later, she was “married” to
a Peruvian squirrel monkey called “Big George”

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:56.969
in a nice naval ceremony.

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:01.689
In 1971, the happy couple moved to U.S. Space
and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.639
In 1979, Big George died but, after a brief
mourning period, Miss Baker remarried.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.910
In a ceremony in Huntsville, she took her
second vows with a monkey named Norman.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:21.430
Fitted with 
a wedding dress, Miss Baker tore it off, apparently

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.789
not much for formal wear.

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:28.120
Five years later, on November 29, 1984, Miss
Baker died, living to the ripe old age of

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.120
27.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.159
In addition to being a space explorer, Miss
Baker was also the oldest living squirrel

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.599
monkey on record.

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.599
For reference, the average lifespan of a squirrel
monkey in the wild is just 15 years and in

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.310
captivity around 20.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.240
Three hundred people, and Norman, attended
the funeral in Huntsville, Alabama, on the

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.759
grounds of the United States Space &amp; Rocket
Center.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.199
She’s buried at the Space Center with an
often-visited marker.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:53.419
Miss_Baker's_GravestoneWhile Miss Baker and
Able may not get the same recognition as Buzz

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:58.210
Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, they are, perhaps,
among the most famous monkeys in history,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:34.050
getting the chance to do something most humans
only ever dream about.
