you've learn to implement deep learning
 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.039
you've learn to implement deep learning
algorithms more or less from scratch

using Tyson and numpy and I'm glad you

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319
using Tyson and numpy and I'm glad you
 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.810
using Tyson and numpy and I'm glad you
did that because I wanted you to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820
did that because I wanted you to
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.310
did that because I wanted you to
understand what these deep learning

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
understand what these deep learning
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560

algorithms are really doing but you find

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
algorithms are really doing but you find
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.360

it lets you implement more complex

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370
it lets you implement more complex
 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.700
it lets you implement more complex
models such as composition areas or

models such as composition areas or
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.830

recurrent neural networks well if you

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
recurrent neural networks well if you
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320
recurrent neural networks well if you
start to implant very large models that

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
start to implant very large models that
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.960

good deep learning software frameworks

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
good deep learning software frameworks
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.040

that can help you implement these models

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
that can help you implement these models
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.920
that can help you implement these models
to make an analogy I think that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
to make an analogy I think that
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.930
to make an analogy I think that
hopefully you understand how to do a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
hopefully you understand how to do a
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090
hopefully you understand how to do a
matrix multiplication and you should be

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
matrix multiplication and you should be
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979
matrix multiplication and you should be
able to implement you know how to code

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
able to implement you know how to code
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.590
able to implement you know how to code
to multiply two matrices yourself but as

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
to multiply two matrices yourself but as
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840
to multiply two matrices yourself but as
you build very large applications you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
you build very large applications you
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.670
you build very large applications you
probably not want to implement your own

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
probably not want to implement your own
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889
probably not want to implement your own
matrix multiplication function but

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
matrix multiplication function but
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.080
matrix multiplication function but
instead you want to call a numerical

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
instead you want to call a numerical
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.880
instead you want to call a numerical
linear algebra library they could do it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
linear algebra library they could do it
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069
linear algebra library they could do it
more efficiently for you but it still

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
more efficiently for you but it still
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.439
more efficiently for you but it still
helps you understand how multiplying two

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
helps you understand how multiplying two
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510
helps you understand how multiplying two
matrices were so I think deep learning

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
matrices were so I think deep learning
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969
matrices were so I think deep learning
has now matured to that point where it's

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
has now matured to that point where it's
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.440
has now matured to that point where it's
actually more practical and you be more

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
actually more practical and you be more
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.780
actually more practical and you be more
efficient doing some things with some of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
efficient doing some things with some of
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910
efficient doing some things with some of
the deep learning frameworks so let's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
the deep learning frameworks so let's
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.940
the deep learning frameworks so let's
take a look at the frameworks out there

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950
take a look at the frameworks out there
 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.380
take a look at the frameworks out there
today there are many deep learning

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
today there are many deep learning
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.929
today there are many deep learning
frameworks that makes it easy for you to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
frameworks that makes it easy for you to
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.660
frameworks that makes it easy for you to
implement new networks and here are some

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
implement new networks and here are some
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.700
implement new networks and here are some
of the leading ones each of these

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
of the leading ones each of these
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.910
of the leading ones each of these
frameworks has a dedicated user and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
frameworks has a dedicated user and
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.399
frameworks has a dedicated user and
developer community and I think each of

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
developer community and I think each of
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410
developer community and I think each of
these frameworks is a credible choice

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
these frameworks is a credible choice
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.130
these frameworks is a credible choice
for some subset of applications there

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
for some subset of applications there
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.480
for some subset of applications there
are a lot of people writing articles

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
are a lot of people writing articles
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.429
are a lot of people writing articles
comparing these deep learning frameworks

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
comparing these deep learning frameworks
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800
comparing these deep learning frameworks
and how well these people in frameworks

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
and how well these people in frameworks
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.950
and how well these people in frameworks
changes and because these frameworks are

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960

and cons of some of these frameworks but

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
and cons of some of these frameworks but
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.300
and cons of some of these frameworks but
I think many of these frameworks are

framework to be truly open it means not
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.509
framework to be truly open it means not
only to be open source but I think it

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519
only to be open source but I think it
 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.030
only to be open source but I think it
means good governance as well

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040

I think multiple of these frameworks
 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.069
I think multiple of these frameworks
could be a good choice so that's it on

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079
could be a good choice so that's it on
 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.559
could be a good choice so that's it on
programming frameworks by providing a

programming frameworks by providing a
 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.569
programming frameworks by providing a
higher level of abstraction than just a

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579
higher level of abstraction than just a
 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.849
higher level of abstraction than just a
numerical linear algebra library any of

numerical linear algebra library any of
 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.379
numerical linear algebra library any of
these programming worlds can make you

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389
these programming worlds can make you
 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.629
these programming worlds can make you
more efficient as you develop machine

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639
more efficient as you develop machine
 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.510
more efficient as you develop machine
