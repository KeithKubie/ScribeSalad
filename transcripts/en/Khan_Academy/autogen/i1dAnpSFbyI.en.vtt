00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.720
 Let us delve deeper into the realm of the mitochondria 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.250
 It is best for me 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.090
 Let's take a look back at what the mitochondria are 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.450
 Then we will go deeper 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.390
 In their installation 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.990
 Think about the cell 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.490
 Specifically the eukaryotic cell 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.120
 This is the cellular membrane 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.650
 When people talk about eukaryotic cells 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.290
 The first thing that comes to mind is nucleic acid 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.020
 Located in the cell nucleus 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.690
 Let us draw the cellular membrane of the nucleus 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.220
 If this is the membrane of the nucleus 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.090
 Here DNA will be DNA 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.990
 Let's draw DNA 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.190
 When we talk about the eukaryotic cell 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.980
 We do not just talk about the nucleus inside the cell membrane 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.720
 But also other organelles in the inner membrane 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.180
 It comes second in the composition of the membrane 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.720
 It is very important for the cell 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.550
 The mitochondria 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.890
 Let us paint the mitochondria here 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 I will talk more 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.020
 I will talk more about the winding lines 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.120
 In the mitochondria 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.290
 They are actually a bit bigger 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.920
 Of the cartoons in the book, as we will learn 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.450
 Since we have more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.050
 From the developed cartoons of what is happening in 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.690
 Inside the cell, but in reality 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.250
 Do not answer all our questions 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.150
 But you certainly learned from them, 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.090
 I will explain the picture here, this mitochondria 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.020
 It is a collection 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.050
 And if we talk about one of them 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.220
 We call it the mitochondria 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.120
 It is the singular name of mitochondria 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.720
 You may have already known him, 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.190
 In the past or through another file in the Academy 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.960
 They are called cell power plants. 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.750
 I'll write it that way 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.990
 ATP power plants 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 If you watch videos about ATP power plants 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.050
 Or cellular respiration or other videos, 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.720
 I will often talk about how ATP is the base currency 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.090
 Of energy in the cell when the ATP is in a position 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.150
 Adenosine triphosphate 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 If fired one of the phosphate molecules 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.920
 They will produce energy 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.320
 This is what your body does to do some work 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.420
 Such as movement and thinking to the rest of things 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.450
 This is beneficial to our bodies, 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.850
 Let us imagine the importance of mitochondria 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.450
 Where it produces energy when the cell needs to do different things 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.760
 So we'll find more mitochondria 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.210
 In the muscle cells and cells that are used 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.950
 More energy. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.990
 And now before I talk about the composition of the mitochondria 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.590
 I will talk a bit about her amazing past 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550
 Because we consider the cell the most important unit in life 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.850
 This is true as stated in cell theory, 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.450
 But in most theories it has become widespread 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.620
 In how the mitochondria reach our cells 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.390
 It is through our ancestors 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.220
 Any of our ancestors to our own mitochondria 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.790
 They are free and independent microorganisms 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.320
 They are microorganisms such as bacteria 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.550
 Where these bacteria lived alone 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.650
 They are good at producing and processing energy 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.290
 They were good at other things too, 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.190
 But at the stage of their development in the past 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.050
 It was devoured by cells of the ancestors 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.510
 Instead of being torn apart and turned into pieces 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.450
 Or digest and eat 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.250
 "They are stuck and part of the cell 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.120
 "She continued to survive 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.850
 "Because they are able to help produce glucose 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.550
 Or help generate more energy than things. " 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.920
 These cells were able to live 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.320
 Through the formation of a symbiotic relationship which gave them a place to live 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.190
 Both mitochondria and ancient mitochondria 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.490
 Thus the mitochondria lived the ancestor 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.990
 And then through the process of natural selection, 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.350
 So we are associated with it 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.290
 We are now linked to eukaryotic cells 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 With the presence of mitochondria, 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.820
 So the whole idea is an organism 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.090
 Coexistence with another organism at the cell level 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.350
 It is mind boggling, however 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.590
 I will stop talking about this thing and start talking now 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.850
 About current time and talk about 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.220
 Composition of mitochondria 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.120
 At first I will draw a simplified drawing 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.050
 I will draw a cross section of the mitochondria 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.120
 Here is the cross-section. 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.590
 As if we made half. 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.990
 Well, let's see what we've painted here 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.720
 This is the outer membrane 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.190
 This is the outer membrane. 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.520
 Let us write its title. 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.390
 External membrane. 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.588
 All these membranes I will draw, 

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:34.250
 Will be a double layer of phosphate fat 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.550
 So if you would like to zoom in from here, 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.420
 I will enlarge this part, 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.390
 We will see a double layer of phosphate fat. 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.350
 So we have 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.490
 Water-loving heads are directed outward 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.390
 Water-loving heads are directed outward 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.050
 The tails are water-loving and directed to the inside 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.200
 So 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.250
 You see it this way, 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.880
 All double layers of phosphate fat 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.890
 But it contains not only phosphorus 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.220
 All of these membranes contain a group of proteins 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.250
 Which means that cells are complex in structure 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.890
 Yet the mitochondria are amazing organelles, 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.690
 They are its sub-structure 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.120
 They have a plethora of proteins, 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.150
 Enzymes are also an essential part of membranes 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.450
 They are able to organize what is going on 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.490
 In and out of these organelles. 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.760
 One of these proteins is located in the outer membrane 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.612
 Of the Mitochondria and are called Burrens 

00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:40.390
 The protein is not only present in the mitochondria, 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.590
 It is a type of conjunctive protein 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.450
 Its composition allows it to form channels 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.550
 In the outer membrane 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.350
 So I do my best to paint them in the best way possible 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.080
 Here is Burns 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.320
 It's a special thing for Pourines she does not allow 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.120
 For the large particles through which, 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.050
 While small molecules such as sugar and ions can cross from 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.090
 Through Bournez. 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.120
 So the concentration of your ions 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.450
 And also, 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.085
 Small particles tend to focus 

00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:12.555
 To be identical on both sides of the membrane, 

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:15.085
 And also on the side of the outer membrane. 

00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:17.125
 This is not the only employee cover 

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.845
 In the mitochondria. 

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.685
 Also we have inner casing 

00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:22.605
 I will paint it in yellow. 

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:24.155
 We also have internal membrane 

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:27.285
 I will draw it as described in the book first 

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:28.545
 Then I'll talk a little about him, 

00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:32.885
 I think it's not exactly the right shape, 

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:36.685
 But here we have the inner membrane, 

00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:41.625
 Internal membrane, 

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:45.525
 These folds are found inside the inner membrane 

00:06:45.525 --> 00:06:46.985
 To increase surface area 

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.555
 It is very important 

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:50.485
 For the inner membrane 

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:53.355
 Where the electron chain transfer process takes place 

00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:55.955
 It mainly occurs via these membranes. 

00:06:55.955 --> 00:06:57.385
 So we need this extra space on the surface 

00:06:57.385 --> 00:07:00.685
 So you can transfer more electron 

00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:02.585
 These folds have names. 

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:04.225
 So if we talk about one of them, 

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:05.725
 If we talk about one of these pleats, 

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:10.005
 You talk about custom, 

00:07:10.005 --> 00:07:14.485
 If you talk about more than one of them, 

00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:18.555
 Then you will give it by customs, 

00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:20.085
 Sometimes you utter 

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:24.525
 The custom is to collect a custom punch. 

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:27.925
 They are just folds of the inner cover 

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:30.125
 We repeat here that the inner membrane 

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:33.655
 Contains two phosphorous layers. 

00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:36.085
 Inside the membrane, 

00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:40.085
 There is a vacuum between the internal membrane and the outer membrane 

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.985
 You can guess what it is called 

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.485
 The vacuum is called the space between the membranes 

00:07:46.485 --> 00:07:51.885
 It is a normal name, space or space between the two membranes 

00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:53.885
 And because of the porenz 

00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:56.545
 Small particles concentrated 

00:07:56.545 --> 00:07:58.985
 On the inner and outer membrane 

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:02.685
 In the mitochondria, 

00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:03.855
 In cytozole, 

00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:05.825
 This concentration is uneven 

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.585
 Because the internal membrane does not contain porens 

00:08:08.585 --> 00:08:11.425
 So the concentration of molecules varies 

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:12.655
 This is necessary on both sides 

00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:14.625
 For electron transmission series. 

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:16.555
 The electron transport chain really culminates 

00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:19.055
 With hydrogen and hydrogen ion gradient 

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:20.785
 Where they are built on both sides 

00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:24.085
 Then flow down this gradient through the protein 

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:28.125
 The enzyme called ATP is called ATP 

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.925
 We'll talk about it later in this video 

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:31.255
 Or in another video 

00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:33.255
 Let us end our conversation about the different parts 

00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:36.555
 In the mitochondria 

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:40.125
 In our cell membrane 

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.855
 This area here is called filling. 

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.685
 I will use another color 

00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:47.875
 this is 

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:49.385
 Filling 

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:50.955
 The filling is called because it contains 

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:53.225
 Greater concentration of protein 

00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:58.085
 In fact it is more viscous than cytosol 

00:08:58.085 --> 00:09:02.185
 Located in the outside 

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.380
 The mitochondria. 

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.520
 Let's write the filling here. 

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.820
 When we talk cellular respiration, 

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.920
 Cellular respiration has several stages. 

00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:13.340
 We'll talk first about glycolysis 

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.955
 Glycolase appears on the cytozole 

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.320
 If glycolysis occurs in cytozole. 

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.860
 Glycolysis 

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.020
 The other important stage in the process of cellular respiration. 

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.060
 A cycle of citric acid 

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.860
 Also known as the Karps course 

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.585
 Which gets in the filling. 

00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:35.820
 If the course of Karpas 

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.220
 You get in the Matrix 

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.520
 And then the electronic transport chain 

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.160
 It is responsible for producing 

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.185
 Most of the ATP, which occurs through proteins 

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.255
 Located in the internal membrane 

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:55.125
 Or who is in the customs here. 

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:56.855
 We're done now. 

00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:59.085
 It is an amazing part of the mitochondria, 

00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:01.985
 We said we thought it was a breed 

00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:04.725
 From the ancestors of free living objects 

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:06.825
 And even be the ancestors of free living objects 

00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:09.055
 They need to get some information 

00:10:09.055 --> 00:10:13.655
 In order to transmit genetic information 

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.185
 It has already been shown that the mitochondria have 

00:10:16.185 --> 00:10:18.085
 Its own genetic information. 

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.785
 They have mitochondrial DNA 

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.785
 They do not have only one copy of it, but often, 

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:23.415
 There are several copies of it 

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:28.225
 They are in the form of rings and are very similar to bacterial DNA 

00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:29.585
 In fact they have many things in common 

00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:30.855
 With bacterial DNA so we believe 

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:34.385
 That the ancestors of the mitochondria live independently 

00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:38.655
 It may have been a form of bacteria or has been associated with it 

00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:39.985
 Somehow. 

00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:41.485
 If these 

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:43.885
 Mitochondrial DNA rings 

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:46.555
 If most of the DNA is inside you 

00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:50.385
 Comes from the DNA found in the nucleus, and also you have 

00:10:50.385 --> 00:10:52.625
 Little DNA in the mitochondria 

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:55.615
 Interestingly, DNA is present in the mitochondria 

00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:59.455
 You have inherited it 

00:10:59.455 --> 00:11:03.275
 By your mother, because when you fertilize the egg 

00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:08.825
 The human egg contains tons of mitochondria 

00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:11.785
 As you can see here, I do not draw all the things that exist 

00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:12.825
 In a human egg. 

00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:14.285
 It has a nucleus as in the drawing. 

00:11:14.285 --> 00:11:16.355
 The nuclear animal has mitochondria. 

00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:20.467
 You can imagine in need of some energy to be able 

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:22.325
 To win the competition and reach the egg 

00:11:22.325 --> 00:11:24.125
 And fertilize the egg 

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:26.355
 But the current theory says that all or most of these mitochondria 

00:11:26.355 --> 00:11:30.085
 Digested or dissolved as soon as they enter 

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:31.525
 Of the egg 

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:34.485
 The egg itself contains many mitochondria 

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:38.755
 So the DNA in your mitochondria 

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:42.085
 It is from your mother or in particular coming from your mother's side 

00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:43.655
 It actually uses mitochondrial DNA 

00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:45.585
 When people talk about the Yves dynasty 

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:47.425
 They track ratios to get 

00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:48.625
 On a common mum, 

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:52.885
 They look at mitochondrial DNA 

00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:56.785
 It is very exciting for you. 

00:11:56.785 --> 00:11:58.725
 As I said before 

00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:00.855
 The mitochondria have their own DNA 

00:12:00.855 --> 00:12:02.345
 And because it has DNA 

00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:04.455
 It has its own RNA synthesis capability 

00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:07.555
 Its own mitochondrial reybose 

00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:10.455
 But it does not synthesize the whole protein 

00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:11.725
 Located in the mitochondria 

00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:14.380
 Many of them are compounded 

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.460
 Or encoded through DNA in the nucleus 

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.955
 In fact it is synthesized outside the mitochondria 

00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:22.885
 And then turn to the mitochondria, 

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.855
 The mitochondria are wonderful things 

00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:29.455
 Where they are creatures living together 

00:12:29.455 --> 00:12:32.355
 In the cells and are able to copy themselves 

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.685
 I find all these things perplexing. 

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:35.385
 But anyway 

00:12:35.385 --> 00:12:37.785
 I said beforehand that this is a book model 

00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:39.725
 Because it turned out that when I look 

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:43.685
 For microscopic mitochondria 

00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:45.485
 He seems to stand by the book in the form 

00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:49.125
 Pleats, these customs are part of folds, 

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:51.755
 But when we managed to get to 

00:12:51.755 --> 00:12:53.645
 Imagine a developer lost it turned out to us 

00:12:53.645 --> 00:12:55.985
 They are not just simple folds 

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:59.055
 Where the inner membrane is essentially a perforator 

00:12:59.055 --> 00:13:02.255
 Inside the filling it turned out that 

00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:05.085
 It has a small vial reaching the vacuum 

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:10.525
 In the inside of the custom to the inner membrane 

00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:12.825
 So I want to think about it until I understand, 

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.825
 I looked at the book and said 

00:13:14.825 --> 00:13:17.325
 "Yes it is obvious that this is the mitochondria" 

00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:18.875
 "And here are the plants ATP energy" 

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:21.685
 But there is still a collection of picture research 

00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:24.455
 To understand exactly how it works 

00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:25.855
 And also how to install them 

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:28.655
 This is Pavel's model where you see the best 

00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:31.225
 Enter and exit from several aspects. 

00:13:31.225 --> 00:13:33.885
 In fact, it has not been accepted 

00:13:33.885 --> 00:13:36.745
 As a conceptual model for the composition of the mitochondria. 

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:39.485
 Something like this where 

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.315
 Here we have a cross-sectional model 

00:13:42.315 --> 00:13:46.615
 For example, if you draw a cross-section here 

00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:50.025
 Where here 

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:52.255
 The outer membrane and inner membrane are painted 

00:13:52.255 --> 00:13:54.655
 I will draw these small channels here 

00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:59.535
 To the vacuum within the norms. 

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:03.455
 In fact this is the most acceptable scenario now, 

00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:04.725
 So I want you to be grateful 

00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:06.885
 Where in the neighborhoods when you read something from the book 

00:14:06.885 --> 00:14:08.225
 You will say, "People have discovered 

00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:10.285
 "All these things" but people are still thinking about them 

00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:11.625
 "How does this structure work? 

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:12.785
 "How is the structure really?" 

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.825
 "And how in fact let this earth, 

00:14:14.825 --> 00:14:16.755
 "This wonderful past does all this 

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:18.805
 "This is what needs to be done"
