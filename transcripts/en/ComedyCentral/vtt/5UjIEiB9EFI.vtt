00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:05.805
Ship to address. Order now.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.942
Usually ships
in four to six weeks?!

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.345
I can make my own towels
in four to six weeks!

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.515
Mayor. You have a visitor.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.450
Not now, I'm having problems.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:19.986
But Mayor, it's Jeff Bezos.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.524
Founder and CEO of Amazon,
Jeff Bezos?

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.227
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Let him in.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:29.829
Right on through here,
Mr. Bezos.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.138
Mr. Bezos, how great
to see you again.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.208
How have you been?

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.045
I wish I was doing better.
Please, Mayor, have a seat.

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:47.781
Oh, thank you.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.852
I guess you're here
because of the strike.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.420
We had a deal, Mayor.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.355
You told me this town
would be the perfect place

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.024
for one
of our fulfillment centers.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.561
And it has been!
It gave so many people jobs,

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.931
and I'm not really sure
why everyone is so ...

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:10.303
Disgruntled? Dissatisfied?
Unamused?

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.973
Would you like to know
why Amazon is so successful?

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:18.111
Because the customer
is all that matters.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:22.082
Now orders are going unfulfilled
all over the state of Colorado.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:26.152
That makes us look very bad.
It makes you look very bad.

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:30.290
Perhaps you should no longer
be a Prime member.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.360
Please! I'm trying to get
everyone back to work.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.663
I'm gonna do everything
that I can.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.099
Then we have an understanding.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:43.369
Good bye, Mayor.
If everyone stays unfulfilled,

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:45.638
it will be you
who pays the price.
