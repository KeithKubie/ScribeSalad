00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.330
There's one last topic I wanted to
talk about with regard to portfolio

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.600
optimizers and modern portfolio theory.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.040
Consider these assets, and
also recognize that for

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.920
any particular return level,
there is an optimal portfolio.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.960
So let's suppose we picked
this return level, and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.970
that this is the optimal portfolio.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.750
In other words, this portfolio reflects
weightings of all these assets

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.100
that provides the lowest risk for
this particular return.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.420
Now, we can compute this for
all the potential returns

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.840
from the minimum return stock
here up to the maximum.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.580
And if we did that for all of them, in
fact there's an infinite number of them,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.520
so we couldn't really do it for
all of them.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.040
You get a line.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.190
So our maximum return
portfolio is up here and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.390
it would consist entirely
of that one asset.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.060
But as we bring the return down we
find a number of other portfolios

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.060
all the way down to here.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.970
A couple of different things to
observe that are interesting.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.830
One is as you reduce the return
sometimes this curve comes back

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.020
in this direction,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.590
indicating that actually the risk is
increasing as we reduce the return.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.440
So for the most part, people don't
want those sorts of portfolios.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.800
In other words, who wants a lower
returning portfolio with more risk.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.100
So we typically look only at
portfolios above this line.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.390
As you might have guessed, the name of
this line is the efficient frontier.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.730
So what does that mean,
the efficient frontier?

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.400
It means that there are essentially
no portfolios out here.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.540
And that any portfolio that's
on this side of the frontier,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.610
it's suboptimal in some way.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.850
So for instance,
if you had a portfolio here,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.810
you are assuming this much risk, for

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.340
a lower return than you could have, than
if you were up here on the frontier.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.380
Or if you were targeting
this much return,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.920
you could be over here
with regard to risk.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.840
So any portfolio inside here is not
efficient because it's either higher

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.630
risk or lower return than it could be
if we were on the efficient frontier.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.210
One last thing to mention about
the efficient frontier is if you draw

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.000
a tangent line from the origin
to the frontier where it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.010
hits is the max sharp ratio
portfolio for all of these assets.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.460
In practice the efficient
frontier isn't used for

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.930
that much other than as a theoretical
device, but people do often like to plot

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.700
the efficient frontier so they can see
where there portfolio is In relation to

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.330
the assets that they're using and where
they could be in terms of efficiency.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.570
Okay, that is all.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.720
I will see you online soon.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.560
Thank you very much.
