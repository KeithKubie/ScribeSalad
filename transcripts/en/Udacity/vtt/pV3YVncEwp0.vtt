00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.430
Let me give you an example to motivate

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.920
why this vision of active networks is both intriguing

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.460
and interesting. You may all know that Diwali

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.560
is a big festival in India, just like Christmas

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.610
is in the Western world. And let's say

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.950
that I am sending Diwali greetings electronically to my

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.050
siblings, who are in India. What I can

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
do, is I can send individually a greeting message

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.020
to each of my siblings. And so, there'll be

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.750
N messages going out on the Internet from source

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.110
to destination. So I send out N messages, and,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.480
you know, to reach any of my siblings. That's

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.330
one way of doing it. A nicer approach would

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.160
be, given that all my siblings are clustered in

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.280
one corner of the globe, it would be nice

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.800
if I could send just one message, traverses the Internet,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.250
gets to close to the destination of where

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.410
my siblings are, and the router that is

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.410
at this end, demultiplexes my message and sends

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.510
it to all my siblings. Obviously, the second method

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.080
is more frugal in terms of using network

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.960
resources. I don't have to send N messages. I

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830
can send one message, and finally at or

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.800
close to the destination, an active node takes this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.140
one message, recognizes, oh, this is intended for multiple

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.890
recipients, and demultiplexes them, and sends it to all

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.870
the eventual recipients of this message. Of course, we

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.470
can generalize this idea and say that this idea of

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.760
active router is going to be spread out throughout

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.410
the Internet, so that even if my siblings, let's

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.300
say, are distributed all over the world, then I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.440
could still send a single message from my source, and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.220
it gets demultiplexed along the way, depending on

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.630
where all the eventual recipients are for this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.740
particular message that starts from me. So in

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.030
other words, we can sprinkle this intelligence that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.310
is in this one particular router to all the routers in the Internet and that way

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.830
we are making the entire Internet an active

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.680
network. That's the vision behind active networks where the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.990
nodes in the internet will become, not

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.150
just passive entities, but actually active, in looking

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.760
at the message, and figuring out what to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.650
do with it, in terms of routing decisions.
