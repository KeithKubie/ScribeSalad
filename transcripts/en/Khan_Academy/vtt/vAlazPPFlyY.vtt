00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.160
We're asked to name an
angle adjacent to angle BGD.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.850
So angle BGD, let's see
if we can pick it out.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.380
So here is B, here is G, and
here is D, right over here.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.950
So angle BGD is this entire
angle right over here.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.845
So when we talk about
adjacent angles,

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:24.220
we're talking
about an angle that

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.680
has one of its rays in common.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.890
So for example, angle AGB has
one of the rays in common,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.750
it has GB in common
with angle BGD.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.540
So we could say angle AGB,
which could obviously also

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.950
be called angle
BGA, BGA and AGB are

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.800
both this angle right over here.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.550
You could also go
with angle FGB,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.590
because that also
has GB in common.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.450
So you go angle FGB, which could
also be written as angle BGF.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.760
Or you could go over here, angle
EGD shares ray GD in common.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.251
So you could do this angle
right over here, angle EGD.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.546
Or you could go all the
way out here, angle FGD.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.940
These last two sharing
ray GD in common.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.070
So any one of these responses
would satisfy the question

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.840
of just naming an
angle, just naming one.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.190
Let's do this next one.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.823
Name an angle
vertical to angle EGA.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.790
So this is this angle
right over here.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.850
And the way you think
about vertical angles

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.390
is, imagine two lines crossing.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.000
So imagine two lines
crossing, just like this.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.360
And they could
literally be lines,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.670
and they're
intersecting at a point.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.940
This is forming
four angles, or you

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.130
could imagine it's forming
two sets of vertical angles.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.700
So if this is the angle
that you care about,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.100
it's a vertical
angle, it's the one

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.870
on the opposite side
of the intersection.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.990
It's one of these angles
that it is not adjacent to.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.850
So it would be this
angle right over here.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.371
So going back to the question,
a vertical angle to angle EGA,

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.870
well if you imagine
the intersection

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.350
of line EB and line DA,
then the non-adjacent angle

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.150
formed to angle
EGA is angle DGB.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.400
Actually, what we already
highlighted in magenta right

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.250
over here.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.490
So this is angle DGB.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.090
Which could also be
called angle BGD.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.090
These are obviously both
referring to this angle

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.610
up here.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.875
Name an angle that forms a
linear pair with the angle DFG.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:53.250
So we'll put this
in a new color.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.143
Angle DFG.

00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:01.500
Sorry, DGF, all of these
should have G in the middle.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.440
DGF.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.070
So linear pair with
angle DGF, so that's

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.660
this angle right over here.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.640
So an angle that forms a linear
pair will be an angle that

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.170
is adjacent, where the two outer
rays combined will form a line.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.630
So for example, if you
combine angle DGF, which

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.110
is this angle, and angle DGC,
then their two outer rays

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.540
form this entire
line right over here.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.646
So we could say angle DGC.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.990
Or, if you look at angle DFG,
you could form a line this way.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.720
If you take angle AGF,
so if you take this one,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.990
then the outer rays
will form this line.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.240
So angle AGF would also work.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.600
Angle AGF.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.350
Let's do one more.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.680
Name a vertical
angle to angle FGB.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.230
So this is FGB right over here.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.260
You could imagine this angle is
one of the four angles formed

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.570
when CF-- let me highlight
this, that's hard to see.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.940
This is the last one, so I
can make a mess out of this.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.936
That angle is formed when CF and
EB intersect with each other.

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:22.060
And four angles are formed.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.770
The one question, FGB, these two
angles that are adjacent to it,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.010
it shares a common ray.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.520
And then the vertical
angle, the one

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.020
that sits on the opposite side.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.410
So this angle, this angle right
over here, which is angle EGC.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.980
Or you could also
call it angle CGE.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.670
So angle CGE.
