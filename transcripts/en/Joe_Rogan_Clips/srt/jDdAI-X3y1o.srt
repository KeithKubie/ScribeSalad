1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,910
Wow. How many people do you think
worldwide are working in your field?

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,320
Uh, so in terms of leading
labs, there's about 20,

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,120
30 broadly.

4
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:14,350
There's a probably a few hundred labs
and other all in essentially the same

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,250
field of study.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,020
They're all working with the same
molecules in the same parameters. Uh, no.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,330
Um,
that not everyone works with molecules.

8
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:25,210
But what I can tell you is we get
together in conferences and we talk about

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,710
discovering new gene that extends lifespan
and a new molecule that's working in

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,970
mice or sometimes in humans, but
it's a big field now. It's grown.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,040
And when I started it was the backwater
of biology, antioxidants, et cetera.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,740
I was very lucky to start when it was
really small and stick it out of those

13
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:47,500
fair amount of criticism in those
days. What, how so like that,

14
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,390
it was like a lot of my friends,

15
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:52,630
my supervisor said I was insane for
working on aging. That's not a thing.

16
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:57,520
That's not biology really. Yeah.
Wow. Wait, how long ago was this? Uh,

17
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:01,480
so I came to the u s from
Sydney in 1995 went to MIT.

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,130
And the scientists in the lab that
I joined, Lenny guarantee's lab,

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,170
they two students had just started
working to figure out why yeast get old.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,190
And I joined as the third senior person
to join and all the other people in,

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,040
in the lab, there are about 18, 19
people. They said, you are nuts,

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,950
Len. He's lost his mind. He's
working on aging. That's not a thing.

23
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,150
You should be working on what we do,

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,500
which is understanding how
genes are regulated. So I
called up my mom and I said,

25
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,000
I think I've made a big mistake here.

26
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,900
I thought this was the thing and the
guy and everyone here says he's nuts.

27
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,990
Meanwhile, you were right. Well,
you gotta take some risks in life.

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,780
That's one lesson. Yeah, but
that's an interesting one, right?

29
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:48,710
Because you were a young fellow.
He didn't really totally know.

30
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,860
It was pretty lucky because
I'm in Australia, right?

31
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,880
I don't know what people are saying
about this lab shorter there. Uh,

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,870
but always been fascinated with aging
since I was four. Well now though,

33
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:03,630
with all the promising new discoveries,
I mean they,

34
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:06,830
they have to be eating crow as it were.

35
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,810
Talk to those people. I go,
hey, fuck face. I was right. No,

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,220
you don't call them up in the
middle of the night drunk. No,

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,420
I definitely forgive people too much.
Had some pretty big enemies along the way,

38
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,620
but I try to be nice.

39
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,710
Is it because a research and this sort
of scientific work is so competitive?

40
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,670
Yeah, it is. It is. And there's
this belief that someone's
success is your failure.

41
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:36,200
It's not really that that is the case,
but exist in show business too.

42
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,430
It's a weird sort of a mindset.
It's a very limiting mindset.

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,510
Right. And also, and this may be
true in Hollywood, in science,

44
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,100
if you come up with a new idea,
when you're young,

45
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:49,430
you're young Turk and you're
upsetting the status quo.

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,990
I know that Thomas Kuhn's book
on structure of scientific
revolutions was just

47
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:57,560
had it had it, right. He wrote it in
the 60s about chemistry and physics,

48
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:00,820
but it applies to biology that if can't,
with a new theory that's at disruptive,

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,520
the current leaders will attack you and
it's a period of chaos and you just have

50
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,330
to get through it.

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,690
And fortunately I'd read Kuhn's book
and I knew that this was normal,

52
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,370
but a lot of people around
me were saying, oh no, what?

53
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:15,520
People are saying we're
wrong and it's controversial.

54
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:19,450
We don't want to be controversial.
I'm like, controversies, great, let's,

55
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,210
let's do more of that. And if it's not
controversial, I don't want to do it.

56
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,800
That is interesting.

57
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,950
Do you think that's because the
people who are the old guard or upset,

58
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:31,780
they didn't fight it themselves or they
upset that your new findings will make

59
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:36,640
their work look irrelevant? Yes.
It's probably a bit of both,

60
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,890
but mostly it's, it's that they're
worried that their lives will be, have,

61
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,650
have been in vain if what they're working
on is not true. Right. Yeah. There's a,

62
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,810
there's an amazing documentary on the
Sphinx where these geologists are talking

63
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,280
about some of the, uh, water or
erosion outside the area of the Sphinx.

64
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,340
And they're saying this points to the
fact that construction was thousands of

65
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,330
years older than they thought. And you
see this one egyptologist freaking out.

66
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,130
He's freaking out.
Like what evidence,

67
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,110
what evidence of this culture
you're talking about? Like,

68
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,410
cause apparently it would have
predated the known dates of 2,500 BC,

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,790
but if it made it like
7,000 years old in that,

70
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,300
because it would have to be back when
there was rainfall in the Nile Valley and

71
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,780
you could see this guy's ego kicking
him because he had, he was a professor,

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,680
he had been teaching Egyptology and he
was freaking out instead of examining

73
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,360
this evidence,
like Whoa,

74
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:33,361
like talking to this geologist who
studies rocks and erosion is who is really

75
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:38,440
steadfast, is a Boston
university geologist, a doctor
Robert Shock. And you know,

76
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,560
he's saying this is evidence of water
erosion. And he's like showing it.

77
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,280
And he even showed it to a bunch of
other geologists and they all agreed,

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,510
and this guy, this egyptologist and this
documentary was freaking out. I was like,

79
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:54,490
wow, that's what happens when you think
your whole life's work is horseshit. Yeah.

80
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,980
It can be a blow to the ego. Um,
I haven't lived through that yet.

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,950
It's probably coming.
But uh,

82
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,440
what I've noticed is that the really
successful scientists and people in life

83
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,650
just embrace change. And you know,
that kind of have to, I mean,

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,200
it doesn't mean that that guy is a loser.

85
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,410
It just means he was acting on incorrect
information based on what they knew

86
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,210
before. I mean, it should
embrace it and say, look,

87
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,090
we know certain things
were built at 2,500 BC,

88
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,670
like the great pyramid that's
been pretty clearly established,

89
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,080
but it looks like there was some ancient
structures that were there even before

90
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,420
then.
Let's now we have new things to study.

91
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,460
They don't look at it that way though.
Yeah.

92
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,830
Say the problem with with how biology
and actually most facts are taught, uh,

93
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,350
theories that taught is that,
uh,

94
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,700
there's a textbook and that's
the Bible equivalent. Uh,

95
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,680
what I try to teach my students is can
you please just forget everything you've

96
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,514
just learned.

97
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,940
And what's important to know is that
most things we think we know are not

98
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:53,350
correct. They're going to
change over time. All theories
change. Newton was wrong,

99
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:57,850
but he helped us get here,
uh, expect that we only know,

100
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,580
you know, 0.01% of, of
what we need to figure out.

101
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,680
And a lot of what we think
we know is wrong anyway.

102
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,130
So even if you have the greatest theory,
expect that it will be overturned,

103
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:11,420
but you can at least cherish the fact
that you've helped us get to that point.

104
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,880
Because without Newton, we wouldn't
have quantum physics. Well,

105
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,490
for someone like me, hearing you say
that, it's very promising and it's, it's,

106
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,730
it's very encouraging.

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,180
But I always thought that scientists
were always going on just data.

108
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,810
Like the, all they cared about was data.
All they cared about is what is correct.

109
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,020
And that was what was crucial.
That's what's important.

110
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,970
This is what they talk about.
This is what this study,

111
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,400
when I found out that scientists would,

112
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,240
would ignore information or use their own
personal biases against information or

113
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:51,620
attack research because it somehow
negates what they've done is very

114
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:55,790
disheartening for someone who's
not a scientist. And you go, oh no,

115
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,910
the egos in science too.
Right. It's disheartening. As
a scientist, I can tell it.

116
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,590
There were,

117
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,160
there was a time of great change in the
aging field where we discovered genes

118
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:08,180
control aging and molecules like
whereas virtual could extend health and

119
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,520
lifespan. It was, it was brutal. You,

120
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,570
I'd get up and give a speech and someone
to say, you're wrong. This is crap.

121
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:18,350
And where are they now? Do you call
them up in the middle of the night? Uh,

122
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,700
they still owe him up. You've
done all little fuckers, right?

123
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,930
I have a couple of glass of wine.
Yeah.

124
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,760
Well I think the secret to success in
life is actually just existing for long

125
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,880
enough and all your enemies
to fall away while they die.

126
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,960
They're not into anti-aging. Yeah. That
looks like shit and I can't walk anymore.

127
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,200
Just have to outlive your
enemies. Yeah. That's an easy way.

128
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,490
That must have been a tough time though,
for you as a young man. And you know,

129
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:43,761
you're,

130
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:47,640
you're hearing this from these established
scientists and part of you must've

131
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,800
been like thinking like,
Jeez, are they right? Sure.

132
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,770
You have to entertain the possibility
that you're wrong, that that's what we do.

133
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,500
Uh, but you go back to the
lab and you'd retest it.

134
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,240
So I went through a really brutal
period in my career where we had data,

135
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,520
we interpreted it,
we published it in the top journals,

136
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:08,030
and it was about how rich
virtual works on that,

137
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,080
sir to an enzyme that I
mentioned. And Pfizer, um,

138
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,510
came out with a paper
that said it's all wrong.

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,950
And I had people call me up saying,
you know, it was nice knowing you.

140
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm really sad for you, but it's over.
Yeah. Bad. That set book. I look,

141
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,290
uh, and so I went back to the lab. We
had some data already from years before,

142
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:32,291
which I knew were interesting and it
took another four years to get to the

143
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:35,660
bottom of it.
But it turns out in the end I was right,

144
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,040
but there were days when
I said, screw humanity. I,

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,390
I can't even be bothered getting out
of bed if this is how I'm going to be

146
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:44,600
traded for trying to devote my life
to the betterment of people's lives.

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,220
It's tough.
Um,

148
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,470
now I think anybody who's in a position
in their career like that has to have

149
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:53,300
gone through really hard times.

150
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,620
It's just discouraging from a non
scientist who relies on people like you.

151
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,930
For someone like me who relies on the
folks like you out there doing the hard

152
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:07,410
work that you would face,
that sort of, I mean,

153
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,910
I guess the best way to describe
it would be ignorance. Well, it,

154
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,830
it's okay for scientists
to challenge a theory.

155
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,880
That's what I didn't know what
everybody is trained to do. Uh,

156
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,540
but to do it in such a public end and
Vish, controversial, it was vicious.

157
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,320
It was definitely vicious. Even the
words they used were vicious. Uh,

158
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,810
which is really hurtful,
but, but they're wrong.

159
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,800
Well they might've been right or wrong.
Call him up.

160
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:36,270
Melonite you dumb motherfucker. Yeah.
The person who published that paper,

161
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:39,370
I do think about meeting
that person again. Uh,

162
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,410
but they do and destroyed careers.
It's not just, it's tough.

163
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,690
You can run out of money is students
go away. That was happening to my lab.

164
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:51,660
We went down to four people. I mean, and
what was the high, uh, I mean these days.

165
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,670
Um, but what we were before then, it was
about 18, 20. And you went down to four.

166
00:09:56,671 --> 00:10:01,650
Four. So it was looking bad. Oh yeah.
People had written me off. Holy Shit.

167
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,280
But you were right when he
got to push forward, it's uh,

168
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,210
you got to get lane cause you're not going
to get government funding for a while.

169
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:13,800
Cause people think that you're, you're
a failure. God Damn, that's crazy.

170
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,920
Well, sciences is not for the faint of
heart, I would imagine. Yeah. Boy Skin,

171
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,060
thick skin. A stubbornness
only. Only those survive.

172
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,840
Right. What was the turnaround like?

173
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,930
Was there a moment where it turned
around and moved into your favor? Yeah,

174
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,520
there was, there was one day when it, when
it all changed. So the, the earlier data,

175
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:43,130
so we're data driven, nearly data
was that the enzyme, um, we can,

176
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,120
we can mutate or change the enzyme so
that it wasn't going to be activated by

177
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:48,780
reserve trial.

178
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,780
And we found that mutation now that just
technically on non tickling technically

179
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:58,230
means that we could, uh, change the
enzyme in a way it wouldn't work.

180
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,970
So we then put that nonworking enzyme
into a cell and now we have a mouse that

181
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,740
doesn't work and give it
resveratrol. And if it, if it works,

182
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,730
it means I'm wrong.

183
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,730
If it doesn't work and it's blocked
by that change in the enzyme,

184
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,630
we're probably right. And that's
what we did. But the real,

185
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,160
the real change was that there was a
company that I started that was making

186
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:24,570
drugs, the one that, uh, cured or
at least seem to cure psoriasis.

187
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,090
Uh, and they had made these very synthetic
molecules that were not related to the

188
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,710
plant molecules is virtual.

189
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,030
And so I said to myself and to
the student who was working on it,

190
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,610
the very brave student,
if,

191
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,460
if the change in that
enzyme also blocks the drug,

192
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,800
they were onto something because that
means two separate groups working on

193
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:50,400
separate types of molecules,
different people,

194
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:54,790
different systems, all get blocked by
this one little change in the enzyme,

195
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,200
then we're right. And, and so he walked
over to the company, he got the molecule,

196
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,080
throw it on the enzyme and
it didn't work on the mutant.

197
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,290
And that was me,
uh,

198
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,180
rejoicing because I could say there was
a universal activation mechanism on this

199
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:13,210
one enzyme. There's virtual works, ah,

200
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,400
the molecules at the company work.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,330
And now there's an interesting thing
that just came out from Spain that

202
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,164
Metformin,

203
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,180
the diabetes drug may actually work the
same way as these other molecules by

204
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:29,260
activating our favorite
enzyme, the Sirtuin. Wow.

205
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,040
And how,
how much time were you in the dark lands?

206
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,530
It was a couple of years
of hell. Yeah, right.

207
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
If it gets so bad because you've got this
tight knit group of scientists and you

208
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,530
have lab meetings and you present
your results and usually you're very

209
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,760
supportive trying to help.
I had one guy saying to my student,

210
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,430
David doesn't know what he's talking
about. You shouldn't work on this.

211
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,360
It's been proven wrong.

212
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:56,290
He was dead against me in my own lab and
paying his salary and it's okay to be

213
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:00,580
constructive but vicious within my
own group. Well, suffice to say,

214
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,160
he wasn't in my grief for that long.
Wow.

215
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,430
Now this other guy that used all
these other vicious words about you,

216
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,990
where's he at now? Not sure
I would know. I would know.

217
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,640
Now I turn a time out to look back. I'm
looking forward. You're nicer than me.

218
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,390
Yeah.
You know what?

219
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,410
I'm in science because it's very
collaborative and you're often,

220
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:28,210
your enemies are reviewing your own work.
Uh, if you build up too many enemies,

221
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:31,720
you weren't survives. It's definitely
healthier approach. I'm sharing.

222
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,310
I probably would do exactly what you did,

223
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,080
but it still has gotta be beautiful to
come out on the other end and be proven.

224
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:42,790
Correct. And actually be at the forefront
of these emerging technologies. Uh,

225
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,630
well it, it, it is a minute, not
rest on any laurels, but the,

226
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,610
what I do is I pause and I remember
how hard it was to get here and how

227
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,320
fortunate I am to have made it this far.

228
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,460
And I'm working with hundreds
of collaborators around
the world to make this

229
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,080
come true. This idea that we can really
treat aging and prevent deterioration.

230
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,120
So I'm blessed. I have an APP on my phone
that I've helped engineer. What's that?

231
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,730
Uh, it's called Louis Lea. And
where's that? Uh, well, it's, uh,

232
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,040
it's a little company that
we bought in New York and uh,

233
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,510
nurses and dentists use it to
pass medical information around,

234
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,370
but we use it to share information
between scientists around the world and

235
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:31,850
coordinate activities between
companies that are started. Yeah.

236
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,100
So, you know, I think I mentioned to
you that I've started a few companies.

237
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,000
What I'm trying to build our companies
that are the 21st century version of a

238
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:45,001
Pharma company that is actually has
a decent reputation in the world.

239
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,380
I think it's pharmaceutical companies,

240
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:49,270
whether it's deserved or
not have a pretty bad rap.

241
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,340
I'm trying not to fall into that trap,

242
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:55,180
but I'm also trying to use 21st
secretary technology to not become too

243
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:59,500
bureaucratic as well within
the organization. That's
what the Luma App offers us.
