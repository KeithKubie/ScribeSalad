is<00:08:26.530><c> the</c><00:08:26.680><c> fragility</c><00:08:27.430><c> of</c><00:08:27.460><c> truth</c><00:08:27.849><c> and</c><00:08:28.330><c> what</c><00:08:28.870><c> I</c>

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:28.900 align:start position:0%
is the fragility of truth and what I
 

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
is the fragility of truth and what I
want<00:08:29.199><c> to</c><00:08:29.289><c> argue</c><00:08:29.320><c> is</c><00:08:29.860><c> that</c><00:08:30.539><c> actually</c><00:08:31.539><c> our</c>

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:31.570 align:start position:0%
want to argue is that actually our

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
of truth are actually very fragile what
 

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
of truth are actually very fragile what
