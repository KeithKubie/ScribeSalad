MOLLY STEVENS: So
welcome, everyone.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.080
Thanks everyone
for coming today.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.150
I'm actually going to let the
designers introduce themselves,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.010
because I think they'll put
it much better than I would.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.080
So why don't we go
ahead down the line

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.850
and make introductions?

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.300
JENNA BILOTTA: I'm Jenna.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.590
I am currently the co-founder
of Avocado software.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.740
We make apps for
couples, so public

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.900
and private communication
and collaboration.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.556
Formerly of Google
long time ago,

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:38.056
worked with some
of these folks that

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:40.100
are on the stage and many
of you in the audience.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.160
And currently I'm just focused
on making venture capitalists

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.481
hug their iPhones during demos.

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.230
RYAN FREITAS: Hi, my
name is Ryan Freitas.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.217
I am the co-founder of about.me,
and I run product there.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.050
Trained as an interaction
designer, formally

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.890
of adaptive path.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.800
The about.me story is one
that some of you may know.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.140
It's an identity platform
that was acquired

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.150
very quickly after
launch by AOL.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.260
We spent two years
inside, we bought it back,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.280
and I now run the
product independently

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.959
alongside my
co-founder Tony Conrad.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.500
CHAD THORNTON: Hi,
I'm Chad Thornton,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.600
I'm a design manager at Uber.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.420
Back in the day I
was also at Google,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.530
and then after that co-founded
a couple startups, and then

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.076
joined Airbnb as a
first UX designer.

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:25.700
BRADEN KOWITZ: My
name's Braden Kowitz,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.434
I'm a design partner
at Google Ventures.

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.100
I worked at Google
for about four years,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.641
and then for the
last five years I've

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:33.970
been helping all the startups
that Google Ventures invests

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.820
in, helping them be
better at design.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.590
So we just go from product to
product and startup to startup

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.770
and help them with everything
from user research,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.830
to product design, to
branding, just everything.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.730
MOLLY STEVENS: Great.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.780
So there've been a lot
of great presentations,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.460
we've seen a lot of design
over the last day and a half.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.570
And there may be
designers here who

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.090
have come up with
startup ideas, or have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.850
things they'd like to build.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.070
So what's maybe
one thing that they

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.130
can learn from your
startup experience?

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.560
Anyone want to take this?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.130
BRADEN KOWITZ: I
think it's hard.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.930
Every startup
experience is so unique

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.914
that the advice you'll
get on a panel like this

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:16.080
is going to be very general.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.500
We'll try to do our best,
but individual questions

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.000
are better.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.840
So save some for the
end, and find mentors.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.560
For me, the biggest
thing that I've

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.270
learned working with startups
is how fast you have to iterate.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.040
But you can work on something
and believe it's amazing,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.540
and then end up
showing it to people

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.123
and find out very quickly that's
not the thing that they want.

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:38.430
So the faster you can
get into testing out

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.790
your ideas the better.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.350
RYAN FREITAS: Absolutely.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.725
And I think one
of the things you

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:44.980
can do beyond understand the
speed at which things move is

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.270
to educate yourself around the
business of what you're doing.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.910
Design founders are
often at a disadvantage,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.040
not have ever been exposed
potentially to some of the ins

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.080
and outs of financing,
the legal perspective.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.160
Make certain that you
walk into the situation

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.340
completely prepared, or
as prepared as you can be.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.849
It is extraordinarily
advantageous

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.390
compared to somebody
who doesn't know

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.560
exactly what they're
getting into.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.980
MOLLY STEVENS: I think that's
an interesting point that really

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.230
would love to hear more about.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.250
Talk to me a little bit
about the transition

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.520
from being a designer
at a large company

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.600
or an independent
designer in school

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.146
to being part of the business,
making the business decisions

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:28.270
and doing things like that.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.230
So maybe Jenny you can
talk about that a bit.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.770
JENNA BILOTTA: Yeah, so I left
Google and YouTube after almost

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.990
six years and created a
startup with just myself

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.640
and my co-founder, and right
now we're at six total people.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.800
And I think the biggest
thing is that you don't just

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.010
get to do design.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.000
You're responsible for your
company's bank account,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.990
and your employees' salaries,
and your health insurance,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.147
and making sure that
their families can thrive,

00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:01.230
and that they are acting
like normal human beings.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.688
And then on top of
all of that, you

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:05.680
have to do all of the brand
thinking, all of the design,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.700
all the interaction
specs, all the icons.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.347
5,000 million launcher
icons for Android,

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:12.680
making sure that looks all good.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.880
And you basically
have to shed your idea

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.990
that you can be responsible
for perfect, super high-quality

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.270
design, because you have so
much other stuff going on.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.110
And then there's the
lawyers and the trademark,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.500
and the competitors and
wondering what they're up to,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.639
and you don't just get to do
design as a designer founder.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.180
BRADEN KOWITZ: Yeah,
I feel very much

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.404
the same way in
that designers like

00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:39.820
to say it's not
just how it looks,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.700
it's how it works as well.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.390
And when you get into
the startup world,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.500
it's how it looks,
it's how it works,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.554
but it's also what it
is, and the value you're

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:47.720
trying to create for people.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.790
And then even deeper than
that, how you put together

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.060
a team that figures out how
to deliver that value over

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.110
and over again.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.600
And so a startup designer, yeah,
you can do that top-level stuff

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.600
and you're very good
at it, but you're

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.834
going to need to work at
those lower levels as well.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.250
CHAD THORNTON: I
think when you're

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.970
in this world where you don't
actually know if the business

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.761
model's going to work
out, you have to just

00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.400
be a lot more diligent about
always ask that question

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.660
and testing that out.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.660
And be comfortable not
shipping the best product

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.660
if you can learn from
it faster, if you're

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.570
more willing to iterate,
if you're setting up things

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.660
in a way that you're able
to learn faster, really.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.920
JENNA BILOTTA: I think one
other thing is that when

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.470
you have so few resources.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.140
Like going from a
company like Google,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.545
where if you happen
to fall asleep at 4:00

00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:32.170
in the morning like
normal human beings

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.890
do and some emergency
happens, there's

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.360
always somebody else to
address the emergency.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.740
When you're a founder and
the buck stops at you,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.590
and so you're responsible
for everything.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.470
And there is no other resource,
there's no release valve.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.760
If somebody on your
team doesn't do it,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.730
you have to do it,
whatever that thing is,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.529
and a lot of times
that's not design.

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:55.570
RYAN FREITAS: Absolutely.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.656
The design piece that you may
get comfortable with early

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:01.530
on in your career, once
you become a founder,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.747
is one of your many jobs.

00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:06.330
And we talked a
little bit about this,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.260
about the pressure
of, OK, I'm supposed

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.260
to be the lead designer.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.740
I'm supposed to touch
everything first.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.865
I'm responsible for this
going all the way through.

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:15.110
How do I balance that
with everything else

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.160
I'm supposed to be doing?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.580
And you hit upon it early
in your first answer

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.030
with, you are responsible
for these people

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.640
and your entire team's ability
to provide for their families.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.320
And the weight of that
responsibility is tremendous.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.140
And sometimes your choices are
between make the business work

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.510
and make certain this
is pixel perfect.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.100
Pixel perfect loses
almost every time.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.360
JENNA BILOTTA: And you also have
to focus, at a really small pre

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.120
product market fit
company, you have

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.690
to focus on growth
over anything else.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.190
So if you have a
bug, it doesn't get

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.019
fixed, because it's not going
to help with user growth,

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:48.560
or acquisition or
anything like that.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.510
And so your priorities
really change.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.760
And as a designer who
at a larger company

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.600
was focused on
quality, and precision,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.980
and making things really
tight within the design role

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.665
that you were given, you have
to give almost all of that

00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:05.390
up and just be like, what
can I do to get this done?

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.400
How fast can I to grow?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.105
My bank account is
draining out, like--

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:10.514
RYAN FREITAS: It's a
series of terrible choices.

00:07:10.514 --> 00:07:12.430
BRADEN KOWITZ: I think
that's hard for people,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.790
too, because you want
to be a good designer

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.590
and what is good
design is things

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.064
like this beautiful
animation behind us,

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.730
and this beautiful
space that we've got.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.050
This is great design.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.512
And so as a small startup, you
want to look big in some ways,

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:27.970
and you want to spend a lot of
time doing that polish work,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.890
but oftentimes that's not the
right stuff to be focused on.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:31.650
It's a tactic.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.740
You could say, we have
to deliver delight

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.426
because we're doing a game, or
we're doing a financial product

00:07:37.426 --> 00:07:39.342
so it has to be polished
enough so that people

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:40.680
believe that it's trustworthy.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.930
But that design is just
a tactic that you can use

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.490
and you can employ,
or you can focus

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.350
on other more important things.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.660
JENNA BILOTTA: You said delight,
you have to take a shot.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.750
MOLLY STEVENS: So there's
a lot of pressures,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.000
a lot of things going on.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.190
So let's talk about how you
make some decisions about how

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.050
to focus on-- make
good design decisions,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.190
instead of only focusing
on what's urgent.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.010
I think that's a decision that
we all make as user experience

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.520
folks in anything we do, right?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.300
People come to us,
something's very urgent,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.330
but you have to decide how
you're going to move forward.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.055
So how does that
happen at a startup?

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:23.537
RYAN FREITAS: I think
pushing the decision making,

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:25.370
the hardest thing as a
founder is the belief

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.244
that all the decisions
need to come from you,

00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:30.003
and that's something you need to
abandon as quickly as possible.

00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:32.169
You have to democratize
that as quickly as possible,

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.940
and get everyone to
understand that the team is

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.620
responsible for the
delivery of quality

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.209
and excellent experience.

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:40.500
And that may mean different
things to different people,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.820
but we've been at it
for a number of years.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.765
The consistency of our
delivery reinforces

00:08:44.765 --> 00:08:46.640
that every person who's
brought into the team

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.450
knows that we have standards.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.580
We have a belief in
providing specific tools,

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.990
a particular experience.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.847
If those decisions continually
have to go through one person,

00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:58.180
there's going to be a point
at which it'll all collapse.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.010
MOLLY STEVENS: So
another thing that

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.240
comes up when we think
about startup design

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.690
is investor-directed design.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.140
So someone comes in
and says, oh, you

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.700
should make it a different
color, or something.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.830
Talk to me a little
bit about investors,

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.800
and key figures that might
be involved in startup design

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.650
you didn't expect.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.815
JENNA BILOTTA: I think this
is where you and I disagree.

00:09:18.815 --> 00:09:19.510
RYAN FREITAS: Totally.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.885
JENNA BILOTTA:
This is my tactic.

00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:21.570
Sure, sure, yes.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.360
Yes, of course, that's
incredibly brilliant,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.650
thank you for your
time and attention.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.080
RYAN FREITAS: I think
that's where I started out.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.810
The first company
that I was with,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.830
I was an early design
employee, and there

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.710
were investors that were very
interested in making comments

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.460
about the design, the
direction, and I was like this.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.030
I had no absolutely
no use for it.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.200
Over time, I think I've matured
my perspective a little bit,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.800
if only to think that these
people are actively invested

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.900
in you, and your team, and
the success of the product.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.990
Some of them see far across
their own portfolios.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.770
They get pitches from people who
aren't even in the portfolios.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.230
They're seeing tons
of tremendous ideas

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.516
that you-- you're focused.

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:03.890
You're building
your own company,

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.829
you're not seeing the
things that they are.

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:07.120
So it's a balancing act, right?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.120
I think I went
from, no, F off, I

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.960
don't want to listen
to any of this,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.540
because it's going to pollute
my perspective on my--

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.260
JENNA BILOTTA: The bottom
lines are totally different.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.801
I'm responsible for building a
market and building a product,

00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:20.520
and they're responsible for
making their investment grow,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.020
right?

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.561
They're focused on money, and
I'm focused on product quality.

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:27.810
And those two things are
oftentimes mutually exclusive.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.800
And the time that they devote
to thinking about your product

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.640
deeply is so surface that
you can't really get great--

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.640
I mean, unless you have an
amazing investor like Braden--

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.620
BRADEN KOWITZ: So the
way I think about it,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.280
so you're absolutely
right that when

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.585
someone who's giving
you a million dollars

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:44.355
says make the button
blue, you're like,

00:10:44.355 --> 00:10:46.177
should I make the button blue?

00:10:46.177 --> 00:10:47.760
RYAN FREITAS: But
good investors don't

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.490
make those kinds of directives.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.536
They show you
other things that--

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:53.910
BRADEN KOWITZ: I think of it
much like customer feedback.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.070
So you talk to customer,
and they're like,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.611
I want a faster
horse, you don't just

00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:57.870
go try to make a faster horse.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.576
You go like, why
do you want that?

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.950
And you dig a
couple levels deep,

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.515
and then often you get
to things like, well, I'm

00:11:02.515 --> 00:11:03.930
worried about
distribution, how you're

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.140
going to get this to customer.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.010
Or I'm worried about whether
you can really scale and make

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.176
this thing in a certain way.

00:11:08.176 --> 00:11:10.152
And when you get to those
core issues or fears

00:11:10.152 --> 00:11:11.610
they have about
your business, then

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.069
you can start to figure out
what to change in your product.

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:15.693
CHAD THORNTON: The
thing I've seen work

00:11:15.693 --> 00:11:16.950
well is, it's hard to do it.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.450
If you can get a number
of investors in a room

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.658
and make it almost more like
sort of an earlier-stage

00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:23.390
brainstorming we session, it
puts them more on their A game.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.989
Because they're
investors with investors,

00:11:26.989 --> 00:11:28.030
RYAN FREITAS: Absolutely.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.960
You've changed the
context entirely.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.470
I think there's a natural
instinct for designers

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.730
to-- they have an
allergy to dilettantism.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.980
Somebody who doesn't have
the background that they do,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.790
coming in and making commentary.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.250
And the easiest way to
transform those conversations

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.490
into something
helpful is to ask, OK,

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.400
this is your art
direction feedback,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.904
in the service of what goal?

00:11:48.904 --> 00:11:50.320
Let's get back to
core principles.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.582
Why do you think this
change is necessary?

00:11:52.582 --> 00:11:54.790
And then we can actually
explore solutions in the way

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.014
that a good design team does.

00:11:57.014 --> 00:11:59.180
JENNA BILOTTA: I think any
individual investor might

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.712
have some reasonably thought
out design advice for you,

00:12:01.712 --> 00:12:04.170
and I don't know how you got
all your investors in the room

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.169
at the same time, because
that seems impossible.

00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:09.972
But collectively, if you
have more than three or four,

00:12:09.972 --> 00:12:11.930
they are like the worst
client you've ever had.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.590
They all have
different feedback,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.560
it's mutually exclusive, it's
to serve their own purpose,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.580
and you can't reconcile
it within the design

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.150
in a reasonably holistic way.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.560
And so you don't
know what to do.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.190
Like, you have five or
six people telling you

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.240
that wrote you
really big checks,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.990
that they feel really strongly
that the option be free or not

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.640
free or whatever, and
you have to listen,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.822
but then your other
investor will be like,

00:12:34.822 --> 00:12:36.780
oh no, it has to be free,
and one will be like,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.140
oh, it has to be
paid, like you have

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.640
to have a business
model right away.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.197
And what do you do with that?

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:42.780
RYAN FREITAS: The
most important piece

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.580
in any of that, though,
is a designer needs

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.230
to maintain their point of view.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.064
They have to come
back to, this is

00:12:48.064 --> 00:12:49.730
what I wanted to put
out into the world.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.920
If they're opening that up
to speculation or suggestion

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.980
from everybody and anybody,
then they've lost the plot.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.007
They don't know what
road they're on.

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:00.840
JENNA BILOTTA: A lot
of times like investors

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.030
aren't designers or
even product people,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.870
and they're finance people,
they're like business people.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.250
And so they will give you
the most randomizing design

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:09.750
feedback.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.520
Like, oh, if you could
make it like Snapchat.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.572
Your things go disappear,
like if you could just

00:13:15.572 --> 00:13:17.030
be Snapchat, that'd
be really cool.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.650
Like, if your app
was just-- like maybe

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.191
you just change the
name from Avocado

00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:24.365
to Snapchat, and like
maybe release that.

00:13:24.365 --> 00:13:26.180
They don't know how
to give feedback.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.400
They're not trying to not, so.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.950
MOLLY STEVENS: So that
might not be great advice.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.490
JENNA BILOTTA: Full
of horrible advice.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.650
MOLLY STEVENS: So lots of
people will come to you,

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.130
they'll give advice, you'll
ask users for advice.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.210
There's all kinds
of ways people want

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.330
to have input on your thing.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.055
What's the best
startup design advice

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:51.195
that you've gotten from
an unexpected source?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.130
JENNA BILOTTA:
Remember to be human.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.779
It's easy to forget when you're
trying to ship a product,

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:04.070
trying to find out if it works.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:10.740
And the line between
yourself and your company

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.197
is so blurry that when an
investor comes up to you

00:14:15.197 --> 00:14:17.030
and says, oh, well, the
company's not really

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.935
working out the way
that it should be.

00:14:18.935 --> 00:14:20.810
It's like really
underperforming or whatever.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.710
You feel like that's
talking basically

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.960
directly into your soul,
and it's really easy

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.560
to forget you're a
human being and you

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.150
have to separate from
the design and you

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.960
have to let some
of the design go,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.950
and you just use have
to let some things go.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.370
You literally can't
do everything,

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.852
and you have to remember
to be a human being.

00:14:39.852 --> 00:14:41.560
I don't know where
that advice came from,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:41.960
but it was good advice.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.550
CHAD THORNTON: I
think the advice

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.840
you gave earlier, what was it?

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.130
Get a therapist, and a--

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:45.800
RYAN FREITAS: And
a personal trainer.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.383
CHAD THORNTON: And
a personal trainer.

00:14:47.383 --> 00:14:49.244
I mean, yeah, that
sounds silly, but like--

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:50.910
RYAN FREITAS: It's
trite, but it's true.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.618
JENNA BILOTTA: I'll
+1 the therapy thing.

00:14:52.618 --> 00:14:55.300
RYAN FREITAS: If you're not
taking care of yourself,

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.940
god, you wind up in a
situation where you're

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.110
under tremendous pressure
that you are sharing day

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.776
to day with only one
person, because you

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.834
want to keep that
away from your team.

00:15:03.834 --> 00:15:06.250
We've been talking quite a bit
about the [BLEEP] umbrella.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.447
You're trying to
stay above them,

00:15:08.447 --> 00:15:10.780
making certain that they don't
get covered by everything

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.940
that's raining down
on them constantly.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.970
That takes a toll, both a
mental and a physical toll.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.750
You have to make certain
that some part of your day

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.085
or some part of your week
is devoted to making certain

00:15:21.085 --> 00:15:23.050
that you're all right.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.676
JENNA BILOTTA: It's
also really lonely.

00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:26.216
When you're working
on a big company,

00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:27.861
you're working on
a team, but you're

00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:29.860
working with other designers
and user experience

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.230
researchers and stuff.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.387
And these are people that
understand you and speak

00:15:33.387 --> 00:15:33.970
your language.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.222
But when you're in a really
small team, if you're

00:15:36.222 --> 00:15:38.430
less than 10, you're not
going to have two designers.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.430
Like, you're it.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.810
And well, I hope-- maybe
you will, I don't know.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.330
I would hire 10 engineers
before I hired a designer.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.230
But it's really lonely,
and you don't have anybody

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.120
to bounce ideas
off of that is kind

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.780
of in the design profession.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.000
Basically, I picked a buddy of
mine that I used to work with

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.036
and sent him mockups on
the sly and was like, hey,

00:15:58.036 --> 00:15:59.910
can you just tell me if
this is crazy or not?

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.534
Because you start to
really feel crazy.

00:16:01.534 --> 00:16:03.500
Like, am I building
the right thing?

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.040
Is this boring?

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.930
What am I doing?

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.780
RYAN FREITAS: Yeah, the lack
of peer input is daunting,

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.224
it's really difficult.

00:16:11.224 --> 00:16:13.390
BRADEN KOWITZ: To that
point, almost all the startup

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.431
designers I talked to who
were at small companies

00:16:15.431 --> 00:16:16.410
feel very lonely.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.990
Like there's no in their company
that can give them feedback,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.823
there's no one to give
them a reality check.

00:16:20.823 --> 00:16:24.380
So for them, we try to be that
support on our design team,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.970
but also it's great
if they can create

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.910
a mentorship, a set of people
that they can get coaching

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:31.790
from.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.220
JENNA BILOTTA: Where were
you when I needed you?

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.370
I was so lonely.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.970
MOLLY STEVENS: That
sounds like one idea might

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.480
be having kind of a Las
Vegas for designers where

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.810
they can go and share stories
and it all stays there, right?

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.940
It doesn't go anywhere, so.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.440
BRADEN KOWITZ: The other big
thing that I've learned is that

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.000
often when teams are fighting,
and they're-- we should do

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.480
something, we should
do A, we should do B,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.729
and they fight back and forth.

00:16:57.729 --> 00:17:00.940
For me, I've learned to see that
as the canary in the coal mine

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.430
that we don't have enough data.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.650
Often you don't realize
what you don't know,

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.786
it's this invisible
thing, this unknown.

00:17:07.786 --> 00:17:09.869
But when you start fighting
really hard about what

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:11.704
you should do, it's
usually good indicator

00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:13.329
that you probably
don't know something.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:15.900
So that's a great time to take
a step back and think about,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.200
what is it that we
don't know, and could we

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.589
design an experiment, or a
test, or do customer interviews,

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.264
or do something to
bring data into that?

00:17:21.264 --> 00:17:23.430
So that instead of spending
all of our time arguing,

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.304
we can very quickly get
into execution again.

00:17:25.304 --> 00:17:27.599
RYAN FREITAS: Do you think
entrenched opinion is a sign

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:30.690
that the good questions
aren't getting asked?

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.984
BRADEN KOWITZ: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:33.984 --> 00:17:35.400
Or that you don't
have enough data

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.989
to sway the other people along.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.780
RYAN FREITAS: In more
mature organizations,

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.320
what is that like?

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.300
What have you seen?

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.830
I mean, you've seen at
mid and large scale.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.420
CHAD THORNTON:
Yeah, I mean, I feel

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.753
like the larger the organization
gets, the more diligent

00:17:46.753 --> 00:17:50.270
they get about using data
in a variety of useful ways.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.740
Early on, it's hard to stay
disciplined and actually

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.900
say, like, what is the
hypothesis we're testing,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.250
and how can we
actually validate this?

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.890
You hear all of the
internet with lean startup

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.640
this and that.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.080
But to actually
see that through?

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.139
Unbelievably hard.

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:06.680
RYAN FREITAS: There
are organizations

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.357
that do KPIs and goal setting
really well, and then, I mean,

00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:11.690
you've see across the portfolio.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.952
I don't know how many small
stage startups are really

00:18:13.952 --> 00:18:16.160
good about saying-- you
talked about making decisions

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.440
based on growth.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.020
Other startups have
different goals,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.330
but if every decision is not
coming back to something,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.070
some kind of goal, then
you can very quickly

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.540
wind up losing exactly
what you're trying to do.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.081
JENNA BILOTTA: Well,
and then there's

00:18:29.081 --> 00:18:32.059
all the accidental successes
where something just went crazy

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:34.350
and they didn't really take
the time to understand why,

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.650
and they're like,
yes, more of that.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.750
Just keep doing the
thing that we were doing,

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.810
and then you realize a
year in or two years in,

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.230
you're trying to build a
business and the founder,

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.020
God bless them, but--
and I said them, not him,

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.255
but they just stumbled
into this luck

00:18:52.255 --> 00:18:54.380
and they don't actually
know how to run a business.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.800
That's when you need
to bring in an adult

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.650
to handle the situation.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.870
But I don't know.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.894
It's a whole lot of luck, and a
much smaller amount of talent.

00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:07.810
RYAN FREITAS: No one
knows what they're doing.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.920
JENNA BILOTTA: No one
knows what they're doing.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.225
I mean, that's the
secret of tiny startups,

00:19:11.225 --> 00:19:14.880
is nobody, none of us,
knows what they're doing.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.190
Nobody has a plan.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.140
And if they have a plan,
they're just fooling themselves.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.970
None of us know
what we're doing.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.020
MOLLY STEVENS: And yet
we're all up here on stage.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.520
JENNA BILOTTA: Any one of these
people could be up here too.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.700
MOLLY STEVENS: So let's a
little bit about timing.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.730
So about how you think
about starting something,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.700
when you make decisions,
how you decide the launch

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.316
design changes, or
things like that.

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:44.690
The timing, I
think, is something

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.520
that is really relevant
to startup design.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.781
And it comes up like, is it
too fast, is it too slow?

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:52.030
Do we know what our goals are?

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.410
Let anyone speak to
that a little bit?

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.360
BRADEN KOWITZ: I mean,
there's a tremendous amount

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.660
of randomness in the market.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.230
Sometimes you can just start
your startup in a very bad time

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.830
macroeconomic time,
and sometimes you

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:02.920
can do the opposite.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.460
And it's almost impossible for
everyone to tell where that is.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.320
And so I think a
lot of it's getting

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.190
comfortable with that there's
a lot of luck in this industry,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.645
and you have to
sail with the winds.

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:16.020
RYAN FREITAS: Well, that's
what it comes back to in terms

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.050
any person's story about
their startup success

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.870
is generally entirely
experiential.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.260
You can't recreate a path,
there is no cookbook.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.740
Timing is the devil
in the details.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.060
You don't know what the
macroeconomic situation is

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.440
going to be in six months,
so do you raise now?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.926
Do you raise later?

00:20:35.926 --> 00:20:38.050
Do you focus on growth, do
you focus on engagement?

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.970
Do you focus entirely
on that partnership,

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:44.190
or bring in a strategic
partner as an investor that

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.700
could change the game for
you in terms of distribution.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.270
Those decisions are
entirely weighted

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.160
by how aware you are of what's
going on in the larger picture.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.070
I know plenty of founders
who are completely

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.069
heads down trying to make
their businesses work,

00:20:56.069 --> 00:20:58.140
paying not any
piece of attention

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.750
to anything besides the quality
of the product and their bank

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.090
account.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.589
And they'll figure
out when to raise

00:21:02.589 --> 00:21:04.737
based on how low the amount
in the bank account is.

00:21:04.737 --> 00:21:06.820
JENNA BILOTTA: And raising
is its own distraction.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.530
Like you basically
stop all product--

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.174
if you're a designer that wants
to become a startup founder,

00:21:13.174 --> 00:21:15.590
you have to get used to the
idea that the product is going

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.130
to move forward without you
for like three to six months

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.250
while you're fundraising.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.920
Fundraising is a full-time job.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.970
It's all-inclusive, and
it's so distracting.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.470
It's distracting
for your employees,

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.230
and it's distracting for you.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.440
I basically don't get
to do what I wanted

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.980
to do when I created a startup,
which is design a product

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.160
and ship it to the world.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.220
You just have to go to
meetings with white dudes

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.722
in khaki pants, and it's
like, I like steak, too.

00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:41.930
CHAD THORNTON: You have to
shipped an amazing product

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.830
of the world that
has many, many users.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.395
So the output of what
you've done is that.

00:21:46.395 --> 00:21:47.770
JENNA BILOTTA:
Well, it basically

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.080
gets frozen during fundraising.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.610
So we have these periods
where we shift once a month

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.720
or every three weeks or
something, and by the way,

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.180
I do have an opinion on speed.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.960
When you're a tiny startup
and with limited resources,

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.860
it's always too slow.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.611
Everything you do is
always too slow based

00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:03.235
on the number of
dollars that you have.

00:22:03.235 --> 00:22:05.930
RYAN FREITAS: I don't think that
changes across the spectrum.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.720
We're all under
ridiculous time pressure,

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.680
because there's
always an assumption

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.638
that something is going
to be on fire tomorrow.

00:22:10.638 --> 00:22:13.627
And at the end, if it's not
public opinion, it's your base.

00:22:13.627 --> 00:22:15.960
JENNA BILOTTA: Well, I think
in a place like Uber that's

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.910
in growth stage
right now, I think

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.830
that the leaders need to realize
when the inflection point is,

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.200
and deliberately slow
things down to be like, OK,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.970
how are we going to
grow thoughtfully?

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.490
And how are we going to change
our product thinking more

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.500
deliberately?

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.902
But pre we're pretty
OK here, you just

00:22:34.902 --> 00:22:36.110
got to go as fast as you can.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.360
Just throw all the
spaghetti against the wall

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.492
and see what falls off.

00:22:39.492 --> 00:22:40.950
CHAD THORNTON: I
think there's also

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.400
that-- so you guys have
talked about timing related

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.600
to raising money and all this.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.310
You two both had
successful startups.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.110
I had two startups
which are successful,

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.776
and I think that's a
tougher thing, too.

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:52.850
It's like, what's your
timing around saying

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.730
this isn't working?

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.090
I need to go make money, I
need to do something else

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.000
because just emotionally this
is like, it's going to kill me.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.639
And that's a hard call to make.

00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:03.430
RYAN FREITAS: So how
did you make the call?

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.013
CHAD THORNTON: That's
a good question.

00:23:05.013 --> 00:23:09.020
I mean, the first one was easy,
we weren't getting funded.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.270
RYAN FREITAS: Somebody else
made the decision for you.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.119
CHAD THORNTON: The
second one was tougher.

00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:15.410
The co-founder and I just
really weren't getting along.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.680
And I think that was a
really hard learning lesson.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.746
I should've done more
due diligence up front,

00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:21.620
and figured out what
roles we were each going

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.740
to play, and just
accept that up.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.120
And you just have
to realize, OK--

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.920
sunk cost is the worst cognitive
bias, because you're like,

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.360
I've sunk so much
time into this.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.220
I just need to see
that something's

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.370
going to happen, right?

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.432
And then just to realize,
no, time for something else.

00:23:36.432 --> 00:23:38.515
JENNA BILOTTA: The reality
check, the cold shower,

00:23:38.515 --> 00:23:40.590
is something you
start asking yourself

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:45.775
when you get to 50% of your
initial seed investment

00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:46.650
in your bank account.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.150
You're like, is this working?

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.710
And then you just keep saying,
yeah, we're crushing it, yeah.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.364
And then from that
day on, the first time

00:23:55.364 --> 00:23:57.530
you ask yourself that
question, every single day you

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.655
ask yourself that question.

00:23:58.655 --> 00:23:59.440
Is this working?

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.010
Is it time to
throw in the towel?

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.900
What are we doing?

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.930
And thinking about closing a
startup that you devoted all

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.440
your extra energy to is like
thinking about cutting off

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.780
your leg, well at
least for me anyway.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.770
It's like having someone
suggest to me that I amputate

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.040
a part of my body that I worked
on that cell division really

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.870
hard to grow that leg.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.080
And then you just
have to cut it off.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.600
MOLLY STEVENS: So we've heard
about a lot of the positives

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.370
and negatives.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.560
I want to hit on one more
positive before I have a couple

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.260
more serious questions.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.200
What's the most
exciting moment for you

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.100
when you've launched a startup,
launched a design, co-founded.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.630
There are a lot of
pain points, but what's

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.040
the most exciting moment?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.076
BRADEN KOWITZ: For me going
from a big company to working

00:24:57.076 --> 00:24:58.450
with startups,
the biggest change

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.340
was how hungry they
are for design work.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.995
So if you're in a big company,
you've got your design

00:25:01.995 --> 00:25:03.785
and you talk to the
engineers, and like, well,

00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:04.830
I can't build half of that.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.510
You talk to the product
managers and they all

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.720
want something different.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.810
And your design gets eroded
into something very, very small.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.290
And if you're an
agency, you ship

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.790
a lot of things over the
wall, and you're hoping,

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.960
I hope they build one of these.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.940
And you're shipping, and
shipping, and shipping, right?

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.270
But at a startup, when I
started to work with them,

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.359
I was blown away with
how hungry they were.

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:22.900
So they would come
in with a problem,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.320
and I would say, how
about something like this?

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.140
And they go, great.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.530
And they build it the
next day and ship it.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.160
That's so exciting,
and so different

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.040
than the way I was
used to working.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.300
JENNA BILOTTA: I have a
really specific moment.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:39.130
We screwed up our iOS mission
for our very first launch,

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.799
and it went out 24
hours in advance

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:42.840
of when we were actually
organizing all our press

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.170
releases and stuff.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:48.540
And we got a phone call from
our lead iOS dev that says,

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.720
guys, we're live in the
store, and somebody just

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.665
bought the app.

00:25:52.665 --> 00:25:55.040
And at the time, our app was
like five bucks or something

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.430
ridiculous so that we
could keep the crowd small.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.180
We didn't know how we
were going to scale.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.990
And that was the most
exciting moment for me.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.996
I built something from
scratch that somebody

00:26:03.996 --> 00:26:06.120
that I don't know, that
wasn't my friend or family,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.240
paid money to use.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.300
And that was the best
moment in Avocado history.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.780
And it was a complete accident.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.010
We were all out to dinner
celebrating the launch,

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.010
and we went live when no
one was paying attention.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.250
But it was awesome.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.320
RYAN FREITAS: When people
use what you built,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.399
it's-- the whole rule in the
design business is don't design

00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:26.940
for yourself.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.180
The original version of
about.me was specifically

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.887
to solve a problem that we
thought five people had,

00:26:31.887 --> 00:26:33.470
and then it just
turned into something

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.620
that millions of people
are using on a daily basis.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.840
But it was a huge
cognitive shift for me

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.260
to be like, OK, these are
the things I would want,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.010
this is the way I would
want to set it up.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.335
This is different
from everything else,

00:26:44.335 --> 00:26:46.460
and we're going to put it
out there into the world.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.050
And for that to catch
on, or even for the brand

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.700
to be recognizable, or
when I introduce myself

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.060
and somebody says, oh yeah,
I have an about.me page.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.900
That's just like something
going on in the back of my head,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.620
because I didn't
expect any of this.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.920
So it's a powerful thing.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.204
It's dangerous, because
the ego latches onto that,

00:27:05.204 --> 00:27:06.870
and you're like, OK
what does this mean?

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.036
JENNA BILOTTA: Don't worry,
it's a really short trip

00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:12.980
from that high into the trough
of despair, so it's like a week

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.290
and then you're in the
trough of despair again.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.290
So it's all good.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:16.860
RYAN FREITAS: It's a good thing.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.568
JENNA BILOTTA: It
might be that same day.

00:27:18.568 --> 00:27:20.710
RYAN FREITAS: It
keeps you honest.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.001
CHAD THORNTON: I would say
the same thing, it's growth.

00:27:23.001 --> 00:27:25.670
I think more the point,
it's not intentional growth,

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.420
but it's growth because
you did something,

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.420
and then that thing
actually kind of panned out.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.060
Not the accidental, threw
something at the wall and it

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.950
stuck.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.950
JENNA BILOTTA: It's like, when
something happens intentionally

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.130
instead of by accident,
you're like, yay, I'm smart.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.920
MOLLY STEVENS: So my
last question is serious.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.430
And as I look at the room
and I think about the world,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.110
and I recently moved
here from China.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:55.620
So in the news, we hear
that startups and some

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.640
of the designers
are fairly elitist,

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.660
and don't really represent
the rest of the world, right?

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.500
Or the world we live in
or the problem we have.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.120
So what will you
do as a designer,

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:13.692
or what do you do, to make
that not an issue next year?

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:14.525
JENNA BILOTTA: Chad.

00:28:16.874 --> 00:28:18.040
CHAD THORNTON: The hard one.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.540
I mean--

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.029
JENNA BILOTTA: Sorry.

00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:21.820
CHAD THORNTON: So I
guess, just to clarify,

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.950
is this a question about
how to be more inclusive

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.380
on design teams, or--

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.130
MOLLY STEVENS: How
would you interpret it?

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.590
Because I think we could talk
about the inclusivity of teams,

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.747
but also the kinds of
products that we work on.

00:28:33.747 --> 00:28:34.580
CHAD THORNTON: Yeah.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.915
I mean honestly, I guess I'm
a big design education nerd,

00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:40.340
so I think it actually
starts a lot earlier.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.110
How do you get a wider
variety of people

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.660
to think about design
as a discipline that's

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.230
really exciting to them?

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.140
I was a biologist
as an undergrad,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.330
and as a systems thinker, that's
shaped how I feel about things.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:58.320
But I feel like we need more
of that breadth in the thinking

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.480
space of designers.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.900
I guess to me that's like
inclusiveness, I guess.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.400
JENNA BILOTTA: I think it's
hard to get away from this idea,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.497
like I said, when you're
creating a new market,

00:29:10.497 --> 00:29:12.830
you have to create a product
that you would want to use,

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.871
and you would understand.

00:29:13.871 --> 00:29:16.360
And as a founder, you have
to be super, super passionate

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.847
about that idea, and be
a one minute active user

00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:19.680
of your own product.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.410
And so I think that
obviously we're here,

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.070
we have a certain
amount of privilege,

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:32.100
and those things don't
come naturally to say, oh,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:38.020
how can I solve internet access
in third world countries that

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.490
don't have power?

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.300
But I do think that
designers are well

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.300
positioned through both
their empathy, and just

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.570
their holistic-- yeah, I know.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.875
Hit the buzzer, I said empathy.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.650
The people in this room are
going to solve those problems.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.550
And we all need to be
better about pitching in

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.060
towards problems
that we can solve

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.620
that help the world
instead of problems

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.180
we're solving for ourselves.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.650
But I think there's this
weird balance of what

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.150
are you going to give up your
whole life for when you create

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.460
a business and a product?

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.050
And I think it's really
hard to, at least initially,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.330
be like, well, I'm going to do
that and just give it all away.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.560
And I don't know,
it's a fine line.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.997
RYAN FREITAS: Absolutely.

00:30:25.997 --> 00:30:27.580
I come at it from
the perspective of I

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.300
can build a team that
represents a better mix.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.800
You're talking
about inclusivity,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.690
I'm just trying to find the best
possible talent that also makes

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.750
certain that they believe in
what we're trying to build.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.600
But I also am keeping
an eye on-- we're

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.980
40% female on a 25-person team.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.920
Which I'm proud of, but
it's not sufficient.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.420
Like, it's one of those things
that's great, nice golf clap,

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.180
let's keep moving.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.600
The bigger issue for me is,
is the product and the problem

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.930
that I'm working on
day-to-day basis really

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.840
all that important?

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.214
And that's, I
think, a little bit

00:30:58.214 --> 00:31:00.377
of the commentary that's
been very frequent.

00:31:00.377 --> 00:31:02.210
Does anybody need another
photo sharing app?

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.980
Does anybody need
another messaging app?

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.620
Well, yeah.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.260
Does anybody need an
identity platform?

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.876
OK.

00:31:06.876 --> 00:31:08.750
If I take a look at it
from that perspective,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.874
no, but if I take a look
at it from the perspective

00:31:10.874 --> 00:31:14.624
of democratizing
access, to being

00:31:14.624 --> 00:31:16.040
able to represent
yourself online,

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.550
to taking some kind
of curatorial control

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.480
over how you are represented
in a Google search

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.119
results page or
something like that,

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:25.160
I feel like we're doing
something very important,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.470
and I'm going to double
down on making certain

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.840
that most people that
can use it are using it

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.882
and are aware of
what we're building.

00:31:30.882 --> 00:31:32.090
BRADEN KOWITZ: Yeah, I agree.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.501
I think it can be
very easy to be

00:31:33.501 --> 00:31:35.000
cynical about the
world of startups.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.080
To pick out a couple startups
and say, oh, these people

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.570
are not making the world better.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.920
But with startups, it's
a very big umbrella.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.930
And I've been lucky
enough to work

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.630
with people that are helping
businesses get access to credit

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.100
where otherwise they
wouldn't to cancer care.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.560
And just really important
stuff for the world.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.760
And if you choose to
play in this arena,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.950
you can choose where
you spend your time

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.660
and where you focus it.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.120
JENNA BILOTTA:
The other thing is

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.670
that you don't really
know how people

00:31:58.670 --> 00:31:59.900
are going to use
your products or how

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.566
it's going to change their lives
until you ship it to the world.

00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:04.890
So we have a ton of military
couples using our app

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.580
to stay connected
remotely, and they're

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.379
able to hug their phone and hug
their enlisted spouse that's

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:12.420
halfway across the world.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.880
And we had people using it to
keep track of Hurricane Sandy

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.260
damage where their
loved ones are.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.430
And I think I've heard
stories of people

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.680
who were in labor, who couldn't
get a cab, they called an Uber.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.940
You just never
know how-- there's

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.820
pockets of in our
selfishness to build products

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.130
that we want to use.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:35.320
I think there's pockets of
truly affecting people's lives

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.470
in a positive way
that's not just

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:43.860
for 20-year-old
hooded Harvard grads.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.600
RYAN FREITAS: Cynicism
is an easy gig.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.100
I come back to this
a lot because we

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.433
were talking about this earlier.

00:32:49.433 --> 00:32:52.560
Every co-founding team probably
needs a cynic and an optimist.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.810
Someone to keep the wheels
on while the other person's

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.065
out there really selling
it, selling the vision.

00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:59.440
Maybe even far beyond where
the reality of everything is.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.970
Getting, as my co-founder
says, outkicking the coverage

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.710
every once in while.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.710
But that cynicism
needs to not impact

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.540
the way we view the quality
and the type of work that

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.040
were doing.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.190
There's always that
potential for something

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:17.930
beautiful to happen even in at
most base of problem solving.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.034
MOLLY STEVENS: Excellent.

00:33:19.034 --> 00:33:21.450
So I think we're going to take
questions from the audience

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:21.949
now.

00:33:21.949 --> 00:33:25.140
So please, I don't
know if there's a mic

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.220
or if you just speak up.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.035
There's a mic, so.

00:33:30.035 --> 00:33:31.660
JENNA BILOTTA: Please
ask us questions.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.910
We're all so lonely already.

00:33:35.628 --> 00:33:37.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:43.050
You mentioned the pain of having
to giving up the delight just

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.370
to focus more on
important tasks.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:49.710
And you mentioned satisfying
investors where sometimes you

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.560
have to satisfy investors
that don't exist yet.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.970
So my question is actually, what
do you think of-- or actually,

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.880
if and when should product
and design or user experience

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.570
should be separated to two
different people, or teams?

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:12.150
JENNA BILOTTA: I am the CPO
of my company of six people,

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.290
but yeah.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.960
My co-founder and
I are responsible

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.725
for the long-term vision of
what we want the company to be,

00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:19.850
and how we want it to grow.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.287
But I'm responsible for
diving down into that.

00:34:23.287 --> 00:34:25.120
And what does it look
like for the products?

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.489
What platforms are
we going to ship to?

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.489
I mean, we make a lot
of decisions together,

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.989
but then I think having
the same person responsible

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:33.989
for product and design
at a really small startup

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.629
is the right, I mean--

00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:36.920
RYAN FREITAS: It's unavoidable.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.420
JENNA BILOTTA: I'm
going to say it's

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.449
the correct thing,
because I'm an [BLEEP]

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:44.864
but I think it's the right thing
to do for really small company,

00:34:44.864 --> 00:34:46.530
is to have the person
that's responsible

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.290
for the product
also be a designer.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.706
RYAN FREITAS: But
there also needs

00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:53.064
to be some kind of friction
between the way the business is

00:34:53.064 --> 00:34:54.480
being run and the
design decisions

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.271
that are being made,
because otherwise it's

00:34:56.271 --> 00:34:59.734
just the opportunity is
dictating the solution.

00:34:59.734 --> 00:35:01.650
You need somebody actually
thinking critically

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.540
about how to get at the
solution, as opposed

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.165
to just saying, OK,
this is the market.

00:35:05.165 --> 00:35:07.289
This is what we're going
to do from a dollar basis,

00:35:07.289 --> 00:35:09.420
and these are the feature
set-- we asked everybody,

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.919
and this is the features
that we were told to build.

00:35:11.919 --> 00:35:13.960
JENNA BILOTTA: If you're
looking for a co-founder

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.860
and you're a designer,
go for a business person.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.230
Don't go for another designer
or another product person.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.010
Two designer founders seems
like way too many cooks

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.929
in that kitchen already.

00:35:25.929 --> 00:35:26.845
Seems like a disaster.

00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:29.990
MOLLY STEVENS: All right.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.570
Another question?

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.900
AUDIENCE: Hello, all.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.900
JENNA BILOTTA: Hi, Sean.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.990
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
that you guys talked about,

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:39.210
it's about motivation.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:43.980
So designers as decision makers,
and people within companies,

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.560
it seems like they're looking
for more responsibility

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.410
for being closer to the
decisions that are made,

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:56.120
and so it seems like that might
be the motivation behind why

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.454
a designer might
decide to be a founder.

00:35:58.454 --> 00:36:00.120
But then, from what
you guys are saying,

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.266
it sounds like a lot of the
responsibility that you pick up

00:36:03.266 --> 00:36:07.870
doesn't really have anything
to do with design at all.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.800
And then on top of
that, it can be lonely,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.030
hard to stay human,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:16.340
So I guess maybe
personally for you guys,

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.560
as well as just in
general, what's the upside,

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.670
and does it really make
sense for a designer

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.450
to be a founder in order
to get more responsibility?

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.105
Or is it really something
else that drives you?

00:36:26.105 --> 00:36:27.730
RYAN FREITAS: I have
one thing on this.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.350
Because I've been
listening to designers

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.700
complain about not having
a seat at the table

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.980
for going on 20 years.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.850
It's ludicrous.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:39.800
You have a seat at the table,
just sit the [BLEEP] down.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.112
There's this perceived
or learned helplessness

00:36:42.112 --> 00:36:43.570
on the part of the
design community

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.900
that they can't get involved
in business decisions,

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.390
or that no one wants them there,
or they don't have a voice,

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.630
you're welcome.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.330
There's an opportunity
to get in there.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.660
You are no longer laughed
at in pitch meetings

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.160
because you're a
designer and you're

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.785
sitting down with a
business co-founder

00:36:57.785 --> 00:37:00.740
in order to get something built.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.020
That's one thing.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.620
The second piece
is, yes, absolutely,

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.710
if you are a
designer and you feel

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.920
like you want to have some
control over the thing that's

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.711
going to be built, or
the thing that you're

00:37:08.711 --> 00:37:10.780
going to work on for either
the rest of your life

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.610
or for the next 10 years,
absolutely, take the jump.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.060
There's no reason not to.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.851
JENNA BILOTTA: I'm
going to say no to that.

00:37:16.851 --> 00:37:19.540
Because if the only reason
that you're starting a startup

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.340
is to be the boss of
something, then don't do it.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.407
Because you will burn
out on your idea,

00:37:24.407 --> 00:37:26.990
you'll burn out on your product,
you'll pivot a million times,

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.670
and then you'll sink into
the trough of despair anyway.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.000
You have to have both the
willingness and the desire

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.900
to be the person that
the buck stops with,

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.760
which is an outrageously huge
and devastating responsibility

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.230
because designers take
things into themselves.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.450
But the [BLEEP] umbrella is
really hard for a designer,

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.420
because you just
absorb the empathy,

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.750
you absorb it all into
yourself, but you have nowhere

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.630
to output it to.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.710
I would say that unless
you have an idea that's

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.380
burning a hole in your
brain, and the drive

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.070
to want to be your
own boss and be

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.830
responsible for
other people's lives.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.740
If you have one or
the other, at least

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.730
from my personal
experience, I would not

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.750
do it if you are
not just waking up

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.005
at night thinking of the
same idea for like a year.

00:38:11.005 --> 00:38:12.380
BRADEN KOWITZ: On
the other hand,

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.360
designers have such
an amazing skill

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.820
set for founding companies.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.839
We are so good at
faking things, and we

00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:20.630
can make stuff just
look good on the veneer

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.920
but actually be
nothing underneath,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.836
like it's just a little
prototype or whatever.

00:38:23.836 --> 00:38:27.180
That's totally what you
need to start a startup.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.180
And it depends on what
you consider design.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.660
If all you consider design is
the visual layer, then yeah,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.000
you're not going to be
getting to do much of that.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.970
But if you consider design as
figuring out what people really

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.670
need and crafting an
organization of culture that

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.540
can deliver that to
them, your design work

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.970
is designing the team,
and then absolutely you

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.260
can still be a designer.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.885
JENNA BILOTTA: I
would also say there's

00:38:48.885 --> 00:38:52.260
a huge difference in the
drive to make a product,

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.930
and the drive to create
a company or a business.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.050
Those two are
completely separate,

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:03.790
and well, they're
mostly separate.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.770
But you got to
figure out deep down

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.400
in your soul searching, whether
you want to make a product

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.220
or whether you want
to make a business.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:10.920
CHAD THORNTON: It
sounds weird to say,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.810
but some of most thrilling
moments in the last year

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.405
I was working on were more about
designing the business model

00:39:15.405 --> 00:39:17.760
than about designing the
nuances of the product.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.190
So if you can find a way
to get excited about that,

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.060
then that opens up so
many possibilities.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.910
MOLLY STEVENS: More questions?

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.960
One over there.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.790
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks guys.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.460
My question is about the problem
of protecting a successful part

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.510
of your business or product,
versus really quickly doing

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.090
the necessary iteration
and innovation

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.860
to take it to the next level.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:49.500
I think it affects
every product.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.090
Maybe for each company
it's different.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:58.110
I think Uber definitely needs
to protect the fundamental part

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.665
of its business that is
incredibly successful,

00:40:00.665 --> 00:40:05.150
but maybe it's a
problem or question

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.360
about a local [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.300
But how do you approach
that and continue

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:15.657
to innovate while also
being successful, I guess?

00:40:15.657 --> 00:40:17.240
RYAN FREITAS: That's
an Uber question.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.790
BRADEN KOWITZ: It's definitely
a big business question.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.255
I think when you're small,
you don't have much to risk,

00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:23.100
so you can just do all
sorts of crazy stuff.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.180
RYAN FREITAS: Yeah, but
you also have to-- I

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.520
think where you innovate
is at the fringes.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.160
And you try to innovate
at the outside and go in.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.890
Like one of the things
we're learning right now,

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.920
building tools that
help our users turn

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.920
their pages into a deliverable
of some kind to other people.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.700
So we just released
a app called Intro

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.575
with the sole purpose,
the only thing it does

00:40:42.575 --> 00:40:44.710
is make introductions and
turns your about.me page

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.410
into a digital business card.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.799
We are hoping that that
pattern-- and we're competing

00:40:49.799 --> 00:40:51.965
with literally handing a
physical business card over

00:40:51.965 --> 00:40:52.673
to somebody else.

00:40:52.673 --> 00:40:55.720
We're hoping that pattern
informs other ideas around how

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.590
our users receive
the page, and how

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.480
they want to engage with it.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.640
I'm not trying to mess with any
of the representation tools,

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.150
any of the feed, any of
that yet until I understand

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.880
what the behaviors
that I'm engendering

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.220
with these small
pieces, what they have

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.020
to do with the rest
of the product.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.900
CHAD THORNTON: I think
within product teams,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.580
it's easy to say
this product's going

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.020
to do a lot of hill climbing.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.400
And this product line
or set of features

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.350
is really going to take
the big step forward.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.510
I think it's a lot harder
for one team to say,

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.030
OK, now is the
time to hill climb,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.375
and now we're going
to take some time

00:41:25.375 --> 00:41:26.670
and actually do something
really different.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.200
Those are different
dispositions,

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.747
and that's a really hard
thing to get within one team.

00:41:30.747 --> 00:41:32.330
RYAN FREITAS: The
biggest problem also

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.760
is within a large organization,
you wind up with the Microsoft

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.396
problem where Office
becomes the core,

00:41:36.396 --> 00:41:38.020
and you don't mess
with Office, and you

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.970
let Office innervate everything,
and no one can-- it's

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:42.839
sacrosanct.

00:41:42.839 --> 00:41:45.130
Sacrosanct is the worst thing
that can possibly happen,

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.220
because it means that
you're not paying attention

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.170
to-- it may be the
core of the business,

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.010
but it immediately
becomes revenue-driven,

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.450
and it's making
decisions for everyone

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.491
else in the organization.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.130
It just seems really dangerous.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.630
JENNA BILOTTA: It's
especially weird

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.200
when you think about the
core of a successful business

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.180
probably was an accident anyway.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.160
And that it wasn't really
intentionally successful.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.567
It's really weird to
think about protecting it.

00:42:11.567 --> 00:42:13.150
But as soon as it
starts making money,

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.770
you just feel like
you can't turn off

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:17.649
the money faucet for any reason.

00:42:17.649 --> 00:42:19.440
But then companies get
into this situation,

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.530
where if they don't become the
next version of themselves,

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.360
somebody else will.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.901
Because there's a lot of us out
there that are really hungry,

00:42:24.901 --> 00:42:28.640
and we're sacrificing our
lives to build something great,

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.180
and you never know.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.110
We're also going to trip
into our own successes, too.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.250
MOLLY STEVENS: One more
question, if there is one.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.500
There's one here in the front.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.454
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:42:43.454 --> 00:42:45.623
My name's Matt, and I
have a little bit more

00:42:45.623 --> 00:42:49.240
of a product-centered question.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.050
When you guys come up with
ideas for what to build

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.520
and you show it to your
friends, virtually everyone's

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.330
going to give you
positive feedback.

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.770
But I'm curious how you
guys qualify whether or not

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:07.412
something is worth solving,
or worth your time?

00:43:07.412 --> 00:43:09.370
JENNA BILOTTA: Well first
of all, not everybody

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.470
gives you-- I mean, maybe you
have better friends than I do.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.640
But the first
versions of Avocado

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.310
we showed to people, people were
like, oh, why would I use that?

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.680
I have SMS.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.690
What are you doing?

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:22.670
You're wasting your
life, kind of situation.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:26.810
But I think that that's where
the business mind comes in.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.930
So if you're a designer
looking for a co-founder,

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.804
having somebody that's
really business-savvy,

00:43:30.804 --> 00:43:33.610
or taking that on
yourself to identify what

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.440
are the characteristics
of the market?

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.717
When you're in early
stage, seed-stage startup,

00:43:37.717 --> 00:43:39.800
the thing that you'll hear
from everybody on Earth

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.549
is product market fit,
product market fit,

00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:43.090
do you have product market fit?

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.750
I challenge one
person in this room

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.040
to really clearly define
that in one sentence.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.460
What does that mean?

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.140
Nobody knows.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.910
You're trying to solve a problem
for some set of users that

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.579
don't have a clear
set of attributes,

00:43:54.579 --> 00:43:56.120
and you're basically
out there trying

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.650
to define what that
set of attribute is.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.024
And then you have
to think, well,

00:43:59.024 --> 00:44:00.480
how big is that
set of attributes?

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.170
How big are the people
that fit into that bucket?

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.860
And can I build a
business off of this,

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.430
or is this like a side
project where I just

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.846
want to make a
really cool product

00:44:07.846 --> 00:44:09.645
for a small number of people?

00:44:09.645 --> 00:44:11.270
And that's a decision
you have to make,

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.476
whether to actually throw some
money behind legal fees and all

00:44:14.476 --> 00:44:16.850
that, or whether you're just
going to make it and ship it

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:20.379
into the world and
see what happens.

00:44:20.379 --> 00:44:22.420
RYAN FREITAS: I think at
the beginning, at least,

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.730
being self-critical
is highly important.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.785
Being able to take a step back.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.660
In writing, in
design, in everything.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.990
It's helpful to
both have someone

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.650
to be an editor
to help you with,

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:40.930
but you also have to
take a perspective of,

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.110
this thing that I've
created is not perfect.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:46.440
The internal voice needs
to be negative towards it.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.320
Over time, you'll learn
putting stuff on the world,

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.120
you need a very thick skin
because people will absolutely

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.160
tear you apart.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.110
I mean, I build a free product.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:59.900
The amount of critique
that I receive,

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.290
I have to not let it get to me.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.249
I have to be aware of what I'm
trying to do and the problem

00:45:04.249 --> 00:45:05.290
that I'm trying to solve.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.980
Because if I let what--
the editor of Valleywag

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.440
told me that my
product was shit.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.170
OK, great, that's just
your opinion, man.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:18.460
I just have to be
able to move on.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.960
But if you're in the
early days, if you're

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.700
getting a bunch of
positive feedback,

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.324
that might get you to the point
where you can put something out

00:45:25.324 --> 00:45:26.980
in the world and
get the real stuff.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.067
And I heartily encourage
you to put it out there

00:45:29.067 --> 00:45:30.400
into the world, because it's a--

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.470
JENNA BILOTTA: I have
one last question.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:34.370
Would you do it again?

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.601
RYAN FREITAS: Not
the way I did it.

00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:37.850
JENNA BILOTTA: What about you?
