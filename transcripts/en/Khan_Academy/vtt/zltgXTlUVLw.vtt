00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.900
Which of these functions is odd?

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.750
And so let's remind
ourselves what

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.841
it means for a
function to be odd.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.340
So I have a function--
well, they've

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.422
already used f, g,
and h, so I'll use j.

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:14.660
So function j is odd.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.280
If you evaluate j at some
value-- so let's say j of a.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.760
And if you evaluate that j at
the negative of that value,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.170
and if these two things are
the negative of each other,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.400
then my function is odd.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.100
If these two things
were the same--

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.974
if they didn't have this
negative here-- then

00:00:32.974 --> 00:00:34.770
it would be an even function.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.930
So let's see which of these
meet the criteria of being odd.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.150
So let's look at f of x.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.190
So we could pick a
particular point.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.810
So let's say when
x is equal to 2.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.750
So we get f of 2 is equal to 2.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.670
Now, what is f of negative 2?

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.160
f of negative 2
looks like it is 6.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.180
f of negative 2 is equal to 6.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.210
So these aren't the
negative of each other.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.275
In order for this to
be odd, f of negative 2

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:05.650
would have had to be equal to
the negative of this, would

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.020
have had to be
equal to negative 2.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.300
So f of x is definitely not odd.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.410
So all I have to do is
find even one case that

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.820
violated this
constraint to be odd.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.110
And so I can say it's
definitely not odd.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.460
Now let's look at g of x.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.360
So I could use the same-- let's
see, when x is equal to 2,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.400
we get g of 2 is
equal to negative 7.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.460
Now let's look at
when g is negative 2.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.630
So we get g of negative 2
is also equal to negative 7.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.680
So here we have a
situation-- and it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.020
looks like that's the case for
any x we pick-- that g of x

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.990
is going to be equal
to g of negative x.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.400
So g of x is equal
to g of negative x.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.272
It's symmetric
around the y-- or I

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:01.230
should say the vertical
axis-- right over here.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.172
So g of x is even, not odd.

00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:05.630
So which of these
functions is odd?

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.770
Definitely not g of x.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.729
So our last hope is h of x.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.560
Let's see if h of x seems
to meet the criteria.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.410
I'll do it in this green color.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.730
So if we take h of 1-- and we
can look at it even visually.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.660
So h of 1 gets us right
over here. h of negative 1

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.060
seems to get us an equal amount,
an equal distance, negative.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.330
So it seems to fit for 1.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.780
For 2-- well, 2
is at the x-axis.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.220
But that's definitely h of 2
is 0. h of negative 2 is 0.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.970
But those are the
negatives of each other.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.940
0 is equal to negative 0.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.210
If we go to, say, h of 4, h
of 4 is this negative number.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.680
And h of negative 4 seems
to be a positive number

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.120
of the same magnitude.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.420
So once again, this is
the negative of this.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.840
So it looks like this is
indeed an odd function.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.340
And another way to visually
spot an odd function

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.490
is a function-- it's going
to go through the origin,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.080
and you could essentially
flip it over on both axes.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.700
So if you flip this, the right
half, over the left half,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.660
and then flip that over
the horizontal axis,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.700
you are going to get
this right over here.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.847
So you see here we're
going up and to the right.

00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:26.680
Here we're going to go
down and to the left.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.180
And then you curve
right over there.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.685
You curve up just like that.

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:32.060
But the easiest way to test
it is just to do what we did,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.550
look at a given x.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.020
So for example, when x
is equal to 8, h of 8

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.050
looks like this
number right around 8.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.520
h of negative 8 looks like it's
pretty close to negative 8.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.590
So they seem to be the
negative of each other.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.882
It sounds like a car crash
just happened outside.

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:50.340
Anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.910
Not the car crash,
the math problem.
