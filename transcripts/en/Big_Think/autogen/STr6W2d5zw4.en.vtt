you

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.380
 
 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.620
 
right now I'm enjoying thinking about

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:10.630
right now I'm enjoying thinking about
 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.270
right now I'm enjoying thinking about
what we'll see at the Large Hadron

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280
what we'll see at the Large Hadron
 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.520
what we'll see at the Large Hadron
Collider what is it that they could find

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530
Collider what is it that they could find
 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.070
Collider what is it that they could find
that they're not looking for yet you

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080
that they're not looking for yet you
 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.710
that they're not looking for yet you
know making sure that this you know it's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720
know making sure that this you know it's
 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.269
know making sure that this you know it's
what we have making sure it does as much

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279
what we have making sure it does as much
 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.550
what we have making sure it does as much
as I can also thinking about what we can

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560
as I can also thinking about what we can
 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.560
as I can also thinking about what we can
see in in Dark Matter experiments making

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570
see in in Dark Matter experiments making
 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.420
see in in Dark Matter experiments making
sure again that we've considered all the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430
sure again that we've considered all the
 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.249
sure again that we've considered all the
possibilities and we've both for how to

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259
possibilities and we've both for how to
 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.170
possibilities and we've both for how to
search and what could be out there and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180
search and what could be out there and
 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.840
search and what could be out there and
make sure that we can look for that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
make sure that we can look for that
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.670
make sure that we can look for that
other candidates for dark matter you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680
other candidates for dark matter you
 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.500
other candidates for dark matter you
know what could it be so that's right

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510
know what could it be so that's right
 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.060
know what could it be so that's right
now I'm thinking really because we are

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070
now I'm thinking really because we are
 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.650
now I'm thinking really because we are
in this era where these experiments are

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660
in this era where these experiments are
 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.880
in this era where these experiments are
turning on so it's important to really

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890
turning on so it's important to really
 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.590
turning on so it's important to really
make sure that we use them for all

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600
make sure that we use them for all
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.640
make sure that we use them for all
they're worth

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650
 
 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.630
 
well right now I'm interested in art and

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640
well right now I'm interested in art and
 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.050
well right now I'm interested in art and
music I wrote a libretto for a small

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060
music I wrote a libretto for a small
 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.690
music I wrote a libretto for a small
what we call projective opera which was

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700
what we call projective opera which was
 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.430
what we call projective opera which was
kind of a different kind of way to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440
kind of a different kind of way to
 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.770
kind of a different kind of way to
communicate ideas to a public it's not a

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780
communicate ideas to a public it's not a
 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.360
communicate ideas to a public it's not a
linear story where we're explaining

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370
linear story where we're explaining
 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.640
linear story where we're explaining
things but just to communicate why we

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650
things but just to communicate why we
 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.650
things but just to communicate why we
care about exploration and discovery for

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660
care about exploration and discovery for
 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.910
care about exploration and discovery for
me it was just a really interesting

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
me it was just a really interesting
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.070
me it was just a really interesting
experience to see what it's like to do

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080
experience to see what it's like to do
 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.350
experience to see what it's like to do
something connected with performance it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360
something connected with performance it
 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.150
something connected with performance it
was performed at the Pompidou Center is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160
was performed at the Pompidou Center is
 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.350
was performed at the Pompidou Center is
performed in the Opera House in

performed in the Opera House in
 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.120
performed in the Opera House in
Barcelona and that was a very exciting

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130
Barcelona and that was a very exciting
 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.250
Barcelona and that was a very exciting
and interesting thing for me I think

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260
and interesting thing for me I think
 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.870
and interesting thing for me I think
right now it's also a little bit

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880
right now it's also a little bit
 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.370
right now it's also a little bit
interesting to follow what's going on

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380
interesting to follow what's going on
 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.230
interesting to follow what's going on
with the economy what's going on with

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240
with the economy what's going on with
 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.450
with the economy what's going on with
various political things and by fun I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460
various political things and by fun I
 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.280
various political things and by fun I
mean kind of disturbing sometimes but I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290
mean kind of disturbing sometimes but I
 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.660
mean kind of disturbing sometimes but I
think there's a lot of interesting

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670
think there's a lot of interesting
 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.100
think there's a lot of interesting
questions that are lurking there that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110
questions that are lurking there that
 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.950
questions that are lurking there that
are fun to think about
