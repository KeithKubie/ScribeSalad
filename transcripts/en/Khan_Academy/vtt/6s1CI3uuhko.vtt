00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.760
I've drawn an arbitrary
triangle right over here.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.010
And I've labeled the measures
of the interior angles.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.780
The measure of this angle is x.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.580
This one's y.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.750
This one is z.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.830
And what I want to
prove is that the sum

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.960
of the measures of the interior
angles of a triangle, that x

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.410
plus y plus z is
equal to 180 degrees.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.245
And the way that
I'm going to do it

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:25.050
is using our knowledge
of parallel lines,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.660
or transversals
of parallel lines,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.600
and corresponding angles.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.407
And to do that,
I'm going to extend

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:32.740
each of these sides of the
triangle, which right now are

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.370
line segments, but
extend them into lines.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.000
So this side down
here, if I keep

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.320
going on and on forever
in the same directions,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.220
then now all of a sudden
I have an orange line.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.750
And what I want to do is
construct another line

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.140
that is parallel to
the orange line that

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.070
goes through this vertex of
the triangle right over here.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.860
And I can always do that.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.390
I could just start
from this point,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.520
and go in the same
direction as this line,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.760
and I will never intersect.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.210
I'm not getting any closer or
further away from that line.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
So I'm never going to
intersect that line.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.900
So these two lines right
over here are parallel.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.780
This is parallel to that.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.280
Now I'm going to
go to the other two

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.660
sides of my original triangle
and extend them into lines.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.860
So I'm going to extend
this one into a line.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.504
So, do that as neatly as I can.

00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:32.170
So I'm going to extend
that into a line.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.390
And you see that this is clearly
a transversal of these two

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.370
parallel lines.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.670
Now if we have a transversal
here of two parallel lines,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.930
then we must have some
corresponding angles.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.260
And we see that
this angle is formed

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.550
when the transversal intersects
the bottom orange line.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.160
Well what's the
corresponding angle

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.000
when the transversal
intersects this top blue line?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.360
What's the angle on the top
right of the intersection?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.470
Angle on the top right of the
intersection must also be x.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.240
The other thing that
pops out at you,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.710
is there's another
vertical angle with x,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.600
another angle that
must be equivalent.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.400
On the opposite side
of this intersection,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.740
you have this angle
right over here.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.010
These two angles are vertical.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.200
So if this has measure
x, then this one

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.424
must have measure x as well.

00:02:18.424 --> 00:02:20.840
Let's do the same thing with
the last side of the triangle

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.160
that we have not
extended into a line yet.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.370
So let's do that.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.380
So if we take this one.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.010
So we just keep going.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.060
So it becomes a line.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.710
So now it becomes a transversal
of the two parallel lines

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.220
just like the magenta line did.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.340
And we say, hey look this
angle y right over here,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.990
this angle is formed from the
intersection of the transversal

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.580
on the bottom parallel line.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.270
What angle to
correspond to up here?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.940
Well this is kind of on the
left side of the intersection.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.060
It corresponds to this
angle right over here,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.100
where the green line,
the green transversal

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.810
intersects the
blue parallel line.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.380
Well what angle
is vertical to it?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.630
Well, this angle.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.990
So this is going to
have measure y as well.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.890
So now we're really at the
home stretch of our proof

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.787
because we will see that
the measure-- we have

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:06.870
this angle and this angle.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.340
This has measure angle x.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.000
This has measure z.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.880
They're both adjacent angles.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.560
If we take the two outer
rays that form the angle,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.780
and we think about this
angle right over here,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.220
what's this measure of this
wide angle right over there?

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.712
Well, it's going to be x plus z.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.140
And that angle is supplementary
to this angle right over here

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.380
that has measure y.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.460
So the measure of
x-- the measure

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.530
of this wide angle,
which is x plus z,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.570
plus the measure of this
magenta angle, which is y,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.110
must be equal to 180
degrees because these two

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.080
angles are supplementary.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.360
So x-- so the measure of
the wide angle, x plus z,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.580
plus the measure of the
magenta angle, which

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.600
is supplementary
to the wide angle,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.229
it must be equal to 180 degrees
because they are supplementary.

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.770
Well we could just
reorder this if we

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.050
want to put in
alphabetical order.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.310
But we've just
completed our proof.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.860
The measure of the
interior angles

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.260
of the triangle,
x plus z plus y.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.800
We could write this
as x plus y plus z

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.750
if the lack of
alphabetical order

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.079
is making you uncomfortable.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.980
We could just rewrite
this as x plus y plus z

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.360
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.350
And we are done.
