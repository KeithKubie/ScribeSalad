Western social theorists from Hobbes and
 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.100
Western social theorists from Hobbes and
Locke to Marx and Weber this is the hard

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110
Locke to Marx and Weber this is the hard
 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.260
Locke to Marx and Weber this is the hard
part this is the slogging through the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270
part this is the slogging through the
 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.550
part this is the slogging through the
dead white men part and I think that's

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560
dead white men part and I think that's
 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.010
dead white men part and I think that's
important and I think it's valuable and

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020
important and I think it's valuable and
 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.300
important and I think it's valuable and
difficult as it is because and the

difficult as it is because and the
 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.820

reason why this this work is interesting

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830
reason why this this work is interesting
 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.490
reason why this this work is interesting
and important and I I urge you to take

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500
and important and I I urge you to take
 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.370
and important and I I urge you to take
this part seriously difficult as it is

this part seriously difficult as it is

this part seriously difficult as it is
is that when Hobbes was in Locke we're
