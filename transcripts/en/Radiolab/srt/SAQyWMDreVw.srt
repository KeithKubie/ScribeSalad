1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,430
All right, let's do it.
Yup. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,520
This is more perfect mini series
about the Supreme Court and um,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,840
today's story from a reporter.
Shawn always eff up your last name.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,450
Can you just say it?
Ramas from Ramez from,

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,520
I always put the accent in
the morning place. Anyhow,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,670
let me set the table for you. We
live in a representative democracy.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,010
And what does that actually
mean? Practically speaking?

8
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,210
Like when do we come in
contact with that democracy?

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,940
Two places seems to me mainly
one when we vote, right? Yeah.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,350
You're asking me? Yeah. I was deep
in thought if you vote, if you vote.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,020
It's true. I know like college educated,

12
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:37,020
super progressive human beings who
are like, why would I ever vote?

13
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,040
It doesn't mean anything. Exactly.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,350
Not to mention people who just don't
even care about the world. Yeah.

15
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,630
It sorta makes my point like
voting is the first way.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,650
And for a lot of people it's entirely
optional. The second way is not,

17
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,490
you will be fine.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,520
You don't do it. And I mean serving
on a jury. This is where like we,

19
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:56,930
the people decide who goes
to jail, who gets free,

20
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,130
who lives, who dies.

21
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:02,390
This is where we actually
do democracy today. Uh,

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,280
we start with the story of a guy who
supreme, who is Supreme Court famous,

23
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,800
would you say? Yeah, he's in the
books. He's like a chapter. Yeah.

24
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,350
He's like one of the most important names
you've never heard of because he's at

25
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:17,351
the center of this ongoing battle about
who gets to serve on juries and his name

26
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,580
depending on who you are,

27
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,610
either symbolizes the best parts of
American democracy or the most cynical,

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,500
should I say his name? Yeah, go for
it. James Batson. James Kirkland.

29
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,610
That's, Hello

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,723
James.

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,940
I went to his house in Northville.

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,080
Tell me your full name and tell me
where you're from and that James Batson,

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,820
Louisville, Kentucky, James Batson,

34
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,520
his name just kept coming up over and
over again when I was looking through the

35
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:51,090
history of jury selection in America.
So I called him up and I was like, Hey,

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,420
I'm this radio reporter in New York City
and I'm really interested in your case

37
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:56,370
because there's this other case
before the court right now.

38
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,050
Could I come talk to you? And he's,
he was like, oh, yeah, sure. Okay,

39
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:05,730
make sure my full name and shitty
mentioned. Of course he's tall,

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,530
he's built like a fridge. Um,
he's a black man. Drove a truck,

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,980
local and cross country far from
being business 15 hours one way.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,660
Where was that? Florida as a kid.
He was, he was an aid student.

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,500
Graduated from her and technical
high school, Hughes, uh, you know,

44
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:25,170
like vocational school, specializing
in electrical engineering,

45
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:27,780
industrial electricity.
He seemed pretty popular,

46
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,870
perfect tennis water Sunday
school when I was 18,

47
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,710
but shortly after that it
seemed like the bottom fell out.

48
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,643
[inaudible]

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,140
James Batson grew up in the West End of
Louisville in the 1970s and the west end

50
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:49,050
was super rough. People
selling dope prostitution, uh,

51
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,260
just everything had to do with
past money at a young age.

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,030
Fast money was like the American dream. I,

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,030
it's pretty hard when a lot of people
around you got nice things and they got

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,620
them because they're doing something
illegal and you keep coming up with rabid

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,420
error to shaking your head like you
know [inaudible] you pull both of your

56
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,210
pockets out and ain't nothing
to neither one of them.

57
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,770
He said it all started when he
was 10 he wanted a pair of shoes.

58
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:24,040
He couldn't afford them. Chuck
Tyler's, well, when I first came out,

59
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,480
if you didn't have a pair of those,

60
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,960
you get on what they call buddies
loaded buddies, cheap tennis shoes.

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,100
Him and his brother asked
his mom for money and they,

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,280
she gave them some money but not
enough so to make up the difference.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,780
They went out and they stole people's
empty soda bottles and turn them in for

64
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:45,781
like the deposits three sent our Nicola
piece stole the pop bottles to get Chuck

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,173
Tyler.

66
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,640
There was my first experience with
pure legal money stolen pop bottles,

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,090
so everything else there. Fast
forward a couple of years,

68
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,140
James is more grown up.

69
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,220
He start doing some petty crime in
and he starts breaking into houses.

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,550
They actually gave me a name,
call me to pants pocket.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,710
Birdwell when the crime would happen,

72
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:13,000
burglar would take only stuff competing
in his pocket, like purses and jewelry.

73
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,880
No merchandise. He didn't fit in
his pocket. He wouldn't take it.

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,223
And that was you.

75
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,150
I'm not admitting that was me possible
deniability because there is two murder

76
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:25,020
names I'm asking you was
a year. I take the fields.

77
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,340
So James starts stealing bigger
things and he starts getting arrested,

78
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,390
starts going in and out of the courts
and then one of those small in and out

79
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:38,380
cases, it became, I think
American legal history.

80
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,700
They got me out of a car, 1982 cops
pull them over. You pull me out the car.

81
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,310
They said you have the right to remain
silent and anything and went through that

82
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,510
little protocol,

83
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:50,800
whatever they tell him some burglaries
that happened in an area and it they said

84
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:55,720
I did them. Well, you stealing
stuff. Yeah. At the time I,

85
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,810
I had been doing some burglaries
or whatever, but anyway,

86
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,290
but James said he didn't do this one
and that they didn't have the proof.

87
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,900
He was his driving around in
his car and they picked him up.

88
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,230
When they arrested me, I'm thinking they
didn't really have a case against me.

89
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,240
They didn't catch me
breaking into a house.

90
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,740
You got me out of the car
in no fingerprints, no
where he thinks he can win.

91
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,870
I feel like I could beat case. So I'm
like, I want a jury trial and I'm,

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,980
the mere fact that you and I are talking
about James Bateson's case 30 plus

93
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,140
years later is amazing.

94
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,750
That's the prosecutor. My name is Joe
Guttman. I'm from Louisville, Kentucky.

95
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,130
Uh, grew up in Louisville,

96
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,860
raised in Louisville wanting to
be a lawyer since he was a kid.

97
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,130
My parents went through a divorce when
I was very young and I wanted to go to

98
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:44,131
law school to help kids and divorces 1982
when Joe Guttman first gets the Batson

99
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:48,070
case, he's 26 years old and
had just become a lawyer. Uh,

100
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,900
James's case was in the first six months
that I was in the prosecutor's office.

101
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
Pretty impressive. Uh, first year. Um, no,

102
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,190
starting out. I lost my first

103
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,010
eight trials. Really? Yeah. This is
when it's our Bateson's case. You know,

104
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,780
this low level burglary of breaking
of a house in a purse being stolen.

105
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,030
He was like, oh, maybe this'll be my,

106
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,030
when the evidence appeared that
he was guilty of the crime,

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,180
James was accused and identified
as the one who's having done it.

108
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,840
Two eye witnesses. They're saying
James did it, but James is saying,

109
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,100
no I didn't. You don't have any proof.

110
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,500
He says the cops probably showed these
witnesses photos of him before because

111
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,120
that you need never seen
them before in his life. So,

112
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,060
so governments on the case, it goes
to trial and he had a hung jury.

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
They ended up being a hung jury.

114
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,120
It means they couldn't come to a
unanimous decision. So James gets off.

115
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,450
Why was it a hung jury? Well, in Kentucky
you have to have a unanimous verdict.

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,740
So the defense is looking for that
one juror that keeps from convicting.

117
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,100
There is apparently one
juror who just didn't buy it,

118
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,580
didn't buy the evidence and thought
James was legit. It was a black woman.

119
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,720
One black lady came to visit me after
the jury was over. She said, I really,

120
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:56,250
really don't think you're guilty.

121
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,240
The rest of the jury was trying to make
me say that she was guilty and I was

122
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,700
saying not guilty. So
ended up being a hung jury.

123
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,800
That was disappointed at that point I
was having second thoughts about um,

124
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,750
you know, is this the right career for me?

125
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,960
So Joe Guttman, he says, I'm going
to try this case one more time.

126
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,070
It was pretty close to guilty. I
had this one juror who hung it up.

127
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,420
So let me do it one more time.

128
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,530
And he does something this
time a little differently

129
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,990
just to set it up. As you know, when
you get a jury summons, you go in,

130
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,520
you're on a jury pool, and at the
beginning of a trial all rise.

131
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,830
Jurors please stand and raise your
right hand. You have jury selection.

132
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,940
Unh of you do solemnly swear or affirm
that you will true answers tonight to

133
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,300
such questions as may be asked you
touching your call if the cat's with both

134
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:47,430
sides, the prosecution, the
defense, sometimes the judge,

135
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,640
they get jurors into a room and
they start asking lots of questions.

136
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:53,810
Is there anyone here who's been the
victim of a crime? Have you needed,

137
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,420
you had family members that have
been victims of crime. Okay.

138
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:00,000
I saw a couple of hands. They
start interviewing jurors.

139
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:03,120
Do you have any opinions one way or the
other about the criminal justice system

140
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:06,070
in general to figure out which
jurors do we want the [inaudible]?

141
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,360
I do remember you're involved
in any organizations.

142
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,180
I'm the member of a church.

143
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,960
Which jurors do we want to get rid of and
that's the more important part of this

144
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:19,440
process. Which jurors do we
want to toss off this jury pool?

145
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,030
So what are the rules
to get rid of jurors?

146
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,170
There's two ways to get rid of jurors
to get down to that group of 12 in this

147
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:32,640
case. And the first way is called striking
for cause the state would move to,

148
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:37,470
excuse him for cause at this time striking
for cause is like when they ask you

149
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:41,280
can you be fair in this case if you
say, you know, no I really can't.

150
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:45,000
I have really strong feelings about
the people or the subject matter.

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,280
That's a strike for cause. Or it's like,

152
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,320
hey that lady who's sitting in the
chair, the defendant that's um,

153
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,920
that's my cousin. We grew up together.
No, like conflict of interest.

154
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,770
Convolutions that's my boss. We'd
go out every Saturday for brunch.

155
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,120
Whatever it is. You're too close
to this. You can't be fair. Got It.

156
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,790
So that one's, cause that's
pretty much common sense.

157
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,870
It makes sense to everyone.

158
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:11,190
But the second way is the heart of
this whole matter. This whole story.

159
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,750
It's called a peremptory
challenge. Preemptory or not?

160
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,960
Peremptory peremptory that's a word.
Depending on how you punch it into Google,

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,270
it will be like, that's a type
of a son. What does it mean?

162
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,320
What does peremptory mean?

163
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:26,820
Peremptory challenge means you get a
certain number of strikes just to get rid

164
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:30,120
of people you think
might not be fair to you,

165
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,420
but you can really use them anyway
you want. And with these strikes,

166
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,720
you don't have to give any reason.
Wow. And how many of these do you get?

167
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,080
So it varies from state to state. In
some states it's 20 and other states,

168
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,230
that's four in Kentucky then and now each
side gets eight eight jurors that they

169
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:51,100
just get to put the excellent and so
you're not going to sit on this trial hook

170
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:53,080
or crook and they don't have
to explain themselves at all.

171
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,280
They don't have to explain anything.

172
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:57,970
And this isn't just some weird legal
rule we made up like 20 years ago.

173
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:01,480
This is something that has been
around. It's older than America.

174
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,220
He goes back to England
in the 11th 12th century.

175
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,170
And before that some say it goes back
to like one oh four BC Roman times.

176
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,970
Really, really? And the idea is, I feel
like the visualization is like a seesaw.

177
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,370
Like okay, we need to get to
this perfect group of 12 people.

178
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:21,420
And you know there's going to be
people who are biased either side.

179
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,300
So each side gets to eliminate
people. You get three, you get three,

180
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:25,931
you get four,

181
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:30,460
you get four and then we'll come to
this balance in the jury of a group of

182
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,290
people who are going to be fair.

183
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,320
So if both sides are sort of trying
to tilt it their way from either side,

184
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,210
the thinking is it'll
end up balanced. Yeah.

185
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,390
And also the thinking was that this
would give both sides more faith in the

186
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:45,391
process and at the same time protect both
sides from like the tyranny of a trial

187
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,900
judge who has too much
power. Gotcha. Okay.

188
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,140
And what happens in this case
is the second trial begins.

189
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,310
So take me into the moment of jury
selection, which is I imagine early in,

190
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,730
that's the first thing that
happens. Set a scene. Well,

191
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,080
the only people that were in the
courtroom were some family members and Mr

192
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,400
Bateson, his attorney, a
detective and me and the jury.

193
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,260
So the reason we're talking about this
case and Joe Guttman and James Batson is

194
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:16,470
because the next thing that happens
is Joe Guttman gets up there,

195
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,210
he scans the jury pool. And at this
point he says there were 13 people left,

196
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,400
four that were black,
nine that were white.

197
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,200
And he uses his peremptory
challenges to strike off. One, two,

198
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,830
three, four black
jurors. They're all gone.

199
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,440
Leaving an all white shirt.

200
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,440
Do you remember striking four minority
people off this jury? Uh, well,

201
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,550
uh, I mean I did a, do I specifically
remember the reason for each?

202
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:45,090
Uh,

203
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,090
no adult I asked Joe was the reason
because they were in fact black.

204
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,490
No, I can see that they were
not stricken because of race.

205
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,590
And I remember specifically that one of
the jurors lived in the neighborhood.

206
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,400
He doesn't exactly remember what his
reasons were for all four black jurors.

207
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:08,401
But what's important for our story is to
know that James Batson is sitting there

208
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,780
in the room as all of this is happening.

209
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,790
And I'm like, ah,

210
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,670
just completely struck out of blacks
off the jury pool. It ain't right.

211
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,300
And I told my lawyer, I said, you
objected that they, you know, lawyer says,

212
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:25,080
why would I object? James said,
because it's not fair. He said, no,

213
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:26,370
that's a longstanding rule.

214
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,100
He's allowed to do that and you
can strike what would be wrong.

215
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,390
Was he loyal white or was he black?
He was white. Judge white or black.

216
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,290
He was white.

217
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,200
And aside from those four people that
had just been struck off the jury,

218
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,460
everybody in the courtroom was white.

219
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,880
So again, told my lawyer to object. And
again, the lawyers says, he said, no,

220
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,440
you, I've told you you can't object to
this. So what do you mean you can't,

221
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,270
you work for me. You do what? I say.
You just object anyway. I don't care.

222
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,210
This longstanding rule object,

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,980
he did it all came behind
that one. Objection.

224
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
It's one tiny moment. Yeah.

225
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,600
What happened is after the
jury was selected, Doug Dale,

226
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,370
James, his attorney said, judge,
how I want to make an objection.

227
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,730
Uh, we went up to the
bench. He said, your honor,

228
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,410
you can see there's an all white jury.

229
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,990
I would like for him
to explain his strikes,

230
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,130
but before I could get another word
out of my mouth, Judge Ryan said,

231
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:29,960
Mr Gutman does not have to explain his
rights. It's not the law. Let's move on.

232
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,140
Move on. So they moved on with an all
white jury and I got found guilty.

233
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,200
They get 20 years. Hmm. For Burglary? Yes.

234
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,760
So Batson goes to prison,
Danville, Kentucky,

235
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,180
and he says his first move when
he got there or po immediately.

236
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,520
And ultimately his appeal ends
up in the hands of this guy,

237
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,320
David Niehaus, Jefferson county
public defender's office.

238
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,010
And the house decides to
do something ambitious.

239
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,920
What we did is we call it and
taking a tour of the jurisdictions,

240
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,840
Washington Gallup barn in [inaudible].

241
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,380
It takes a legal road trip to me house
and his team start looking at other

242
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:22,600
states, looking at other regions to find
out what this is a problem elsewhere.

243
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Is this just something limited to
the south or is it something else?

244
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,650
Do you mean like are people
in other places doing what?

245
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:33,220
Joe got mid dead and using peremptories
to kick black people off a jury's

246
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,670
[inaudible]. Right. And what he
found is that this was happening.

247
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Sounds ideal and I need to check
in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio,

248
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,930
pretty much everywhere.

249
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,620
So they filed an appeal which worked
its way up through the courts.

250
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,860
And in December, 1985 thank you gentleman.

251
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,200
Locations submitted hear arguments
year in a battle against Kentucky.

252
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,490
The case arrives at the Supreme
Court of the United States.

253
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,650
I get a call one day from the Associated
Press. That's Joe Guttman saying,

254
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,010
how do you feel about the Supreme Court
accepting the case of James Kirkland?

255
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,610
Vanson and I was almost speechless.
And where you sitting on the bench? Uh,

256
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,510
I did, uh, go just to observe and learn

257
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,270
district main hundred sign thinking
your proceeding whenever you're ready.

258
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,990
Thank you your honor. Mr Chief
Justice and may it please the court.

259
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,940
So here's that ultimately went down,

260
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,520
that's inside me house.

261
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,850
He argues that these strikes are being
used to take black people off of juries.

262
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,740
And this was happening everywhere.

263
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,270
We were able to list some 25 jurisdictions
and that the practice violated the

264
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,750
14th amendment, which was equal
protection. And the sixth amendment,

265
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,730
which was a right to a jury of your peers,

266
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:47,270
a jury that is as representative
of the community as possible.

267
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,020
So if Louisville is like 17% black,

268
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,580
the jury should probably be about 17%
black and the prosecutors shouldn't just

269
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:59,930
be allowed to skew that without
having to give a reason. First of all,

270
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,400
Kentucky's response to require an
explanation of peremptory challenges would

271
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,061
destroy,

272
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:08,870
we believe the historical nature and
function of the device itself until

273
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,170
Kentucky saying, we shouldn't
have to justify these strikes.

274
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,570
The court has told us
that again and again.

275
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,650
It has always been unfettered
and controlled by the
court unexplained and this

276
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:22,970
practice goes back centuries and
yes, there may be some abuses,

277
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,620
but this is a tool that lawyers need.

278
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,340
Thank you gentleman. The case
is submitted four months later,

279
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:32,720
the court delivers its verdict

280
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,680
and in a seven to two decision

281
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,700
that's and when the court found that the
prosecutor's actions for sure violated

282
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,690
the 14th amendment.

283
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,730
They said racial discrimination of any
kind in jury selection is not allowed.

284
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,800
Q Dan Rather. The high court rule
today is illegal totes illegal.

285
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,420
Even on a peremptory challenge.

286
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,280
It is illegal for a lawyer to reject
the juror on the basis of rights.

287
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,880
James Batson sentence was immediately
vacated. How'd that feel? Okay,

288
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:04,900
it's undescribable.

289
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,590
If you were in prison and you know
your sentence is being taken away,

290
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,480
I mean that's great feeling.
I'll still break every day.

291
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,630
And in this conversation come up, y'all
could just be hanging out playing chess.

292
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,300
Oh, I got a law and the
law books Batson rule.

293
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,390
And that was the biggest deal of all this.

294
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,570
The headline there was this new rule
and rule the bats and bets and match.

295
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,470
And that's and rule named after him.

296
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,430
So justice was put new limits on
what is called preemptory challenge.

297
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,300
The Batson rule. The Batson rule is an
echo of what James did in court that day.

298
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,320
When you see people, minorities getting
booted off of a jury, you can say,

299
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,440
your honor, I think that's a batching
violation. That's in violation.

300
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,610
And then the other side be it,

301
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:51,611
the defense of the prosecution has to
provide non-racial reasons for why they

302
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:54,840
eliminated that juror. And for a lot
of people, this was a breakthrough.

303
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,360
This is like finally we figured
out how to do this right.

304
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,150
There was a system in
place to protect everyone.

305
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,840
And that system was even extended to
civil cases and eventually to women as

306
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:07,410
well. Uh, it was a big deal
when the case was decided.

307
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,440
And the initial elation was quickly
tempered with a strong dose of reality.

308
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,880
This is Jeff Robinson.

309
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:24,050
He's the director of the APLU Center for
justice because what bats and prevents

310
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,440
is deliberate racial discrimination.

311
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,290
And, uh, almost immediately
all over the country,

312
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,720
prosecutors started training each other,

313
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,860
teaching each other on how to get
around Bateson. That's Bryan Stevenson,

314
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:43,220
he's the director of the equal justice
initiative in Montgomery, Alabama.

315
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,170
I there at trainings
all across the country.

316
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,730
And some of these are on video
data and I found fun. I mean,

317
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:53,090
it's on Youtube when you're picking a
jewelry and you gotta stay to these basic

318
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,980
rules. This is one of
those videos. This one,

319
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,270
it's a Philadelphia prosecutor named
Jack McMahon lecturing to a room full of

320
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,490
young prosecutors on how to pick a jury,

321
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,710
you know, and in, in selecting blacks,
you don't want the real educated ones.

322
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,870
And my experience, black women,
young black women are very bad. Uh,

323
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:13,080
there's an antagonism, I guess maybe
cause they're downtrodden on two respects.

324
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,060
There they've got two minorities
or women and their blacks.

325
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:18,900
And so there are downtrod on
two areas and they somehow, uh,

326
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,630
want to take it out on somebody and
you don't want it to be you. And so

327
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,120
the craziest thing about this video is
that it was filmed just a few months

328
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:29,380
after the Batson decision.

329
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,870
Batson versus Kentucky. I'm sure you've
all become aware of that case. Yeah.

330
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,200
Jack Man basically tells
these prosecutors, look,
we've got this new rule.

331
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,200
Here's how you break it. You strike
the black person off the jury.

332
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,230
But just say it's for another reason
because that's what Batson requires is a

333
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:45,890
racially neutral.

334
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,400
My advice would be in that situation
is when you do have a black jury,

335
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,080
are you questioning them at length and
honest little sheet that you have marked

336
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:57,660
something down that you can articulate
later time if something happens.

337
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,770
So let's say you strike three blacks to
start with first three people write it

338
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:04,760
down right then and there. I'd write it
right in my little box there. You know,

339
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,370
the woman had a kid about the same age
as the defendant and I thought she'd be

340
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,660
sympathetic to a more,

341
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,020
she's unemployed and I just don't like
unemployed people because I find they're

342
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:13,930
not too stable. Quizzes

343
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:19,130
almost this training to create a catalog
of reasons that on the face where race

344
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:19,950
neutral,

345
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,600
just say you're excluding them because
they're too tall or they're too old. Oh,

346
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,420
that person was wearing a black
sweater. Things like, well,

347
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:31,770
he lives in a bad neighborhood.
Person would maintain eye contact,

348
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:34,470
their body language, where
they belong to a church,

349
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,220
tattoos where they're a nurse. Any of
those reasons have them marked down.

350
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,620
As long as a prosecutor doesn't say,

351
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:45,621
I excused that person because they're
black bats and says it's completely okay.

352
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,100
I was actually working on a case. Uh,
this is lawyer Bryan Stevenson again,

353
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,980
my office, the at the time was called
the southern prisoners defense committee.

354
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,790
This was, and I was in Atlanta,
Georgia before I moved to Alabama.

355
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,630
And when was this?

356
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,460
This was 1986 and we were defending
someone down in Swainsboro, Georgia,

357
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,210
a guy by the name of gamble. Uh, and, uh,

358
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:11,000
the Batson decision came down, uh,

359
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,750
and objections were made when the
prosecutor used his peremptory strikes to

360
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:18,350
exclude all of the African Americans.
And we said, wait a minute, your honor,

361
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:20,600
there's a new decision
Batson versus Kentucky,

362
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,140
which means that the prosecutor can't
do this. And the court said, well,

363
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:24,974
I've read Bateson.

364
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,130
What this means is that the prosecutor
has to give a race neutral reasons.

365
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,280
And so the prosecutor, I've got
my race neutral reasons is, well,

366
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:35,300
I struck this woman because she
looks just like the defendant.

367
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,490
That tendon was an African American
man. They said, wait a minute,

368
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:40,900
what does that she does? And the
judge said, oh, I see that. He said,

369
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:44,120
I struck judge that I see no, as
he did what the prosecutor said,

370
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:48,050
I struck this man because he lives in
south Swainsboro and that's where the

371
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:50,570
defendant lives. And we were,
of course, we say, look,

372
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:53,720
all the black people live in south
Waynesboro, all the white people,

373
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,550
that's not a race neutral
reason. The judge had no,

374
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:59,570
that is a race neutral reason.
He said, I struck one person, uh,

375
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,860
because this man was in the military and
he was discharged after five years in

376
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:06,050
the military. And in my
experience, your honor,

377
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:11,410
you only get discharged honorably after
an even number of years or the jury was

378
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:12,890
put back on the stand. We said, well,

379
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:15,770
were you discharged from the
military honorably? Yes, I was.

380
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:19,130
I was actually decorated. I got
this metal, I got this award.

381
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,390
I've got these things. Well,

382
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:23,840
I still accept the prosecutors
reading for excluding that person. No.

383
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,340
My favorite was the prosecutors.
Some of those for your phone? No,

384
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,440
it gets better. It gets
better. Roscoe said,

385
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,400
I struck this man because he testified
that he was a mason and he said,

386
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:38,150
your honor, I just don't want anybody
who's a member of a masonic lodge.

387
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,730
All my jury, they have their
own codes, their own rituals,

388
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,830
they're all in culture. I don't want that.

389
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,100
And the jury was put back on
this day and we asked the juror,

390
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,190
are you a member of a Masonic Lodge?
And the jury said, no, I'm not. He said,

391
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:53,210
I'm a brick mason. And the judge
says, I still know what you mean,

392
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,120
I'll let you exclude that person. Right.

393
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,570
And so almost from the very beginning
there was this cynicism is game playing.

394
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:05,630
I used to tell people Bateson's not
going to eliminate racial bias and jury

395
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:10,010
selection, but it will make the jury
selection process a lot more entertaining.

396
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,810
You all should come to court and
just watch the show. [inaudible]

397
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,120
that's why. So you could argue that not
only did Batson not change anything,

398
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:24,290
but that's in made things worse. Um, as
one lawyer, Steven Bright, put it to me.

399
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,410
I think what Batson is really is
basically a set of procedures to sort of

400
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:34,520
legitimize and cover up the race
discrimination that's going on.

401
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,310
You had this smelly,

402
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,110
putrid problem of racial discrimination
in jury selection and instead of tossing

403
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:46,100
it out, we just prayed for
breeze all over. He just

404
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,370
kind of perfumed it vaguely
sheep Cologne. It's still there.

405
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,840
It just vaguely hidden. And
now with the Batson rule,

406
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,460
if you think the prosecution or the
defense is striking people off because of

407
00:23:58,461 --> 00:23:59,270
race,

408
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,860
you have to call them out and then you
have to somehow try and prove that the

409
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:08,750
reason they're providing is a lie. And
that's really, really difficult to do.

410
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,420
Since 1986 for example, in
the state of Washington,

411
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,450
there have been probably 47 48 challenges
on Batson issues where people have

412
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,250
been convicted and they've
said, wait a minute.

413
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:26,690
The prosecutors were excusing people of
color from the jury because they were

414
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:30,350
people of color. Out of
those 46 to 50 challenges,

415
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,620
there's been one reversal.

416
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,730
The state of Tennessee has not reversed
a single case under Bateson in the 30

417
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:41,730
years for it. It said, said the
Batson decision came down as a result.

418
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:46,200
He says there's still many counties in
America where the diversity of the jury

419
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:51,160
has not increased very much
at all. So for example,

420
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,420
in one Louisiana Parish,

421
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:56,800
they looked at felony cases over an eight
year period and found that nearly half

422
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:00,190
the black jurors were
struck in Houston county,

423
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:02,500
Alabama over a five year period.

424
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,220
The data establish that 80% of the African
Americans qualify for jury service.

425
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,133
We were struck

426
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,800
80% 80% and that's in death
penalty cases, so wow.

427
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,180
I mean if you think about that
like a big percentage of the time,

428
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,590
these are lawyers who are going around
the bats and rule going around the law

429
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,210
going around the constitution to get
these all white juries who are then

430
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,380
oftentimes pudding

431
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,700
black men to death and that reminds
me of some pretty dark history.

432
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:36,070
Yeah. Wow. Super basic question. Yeah.

433
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,143
I mean

434
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,270
that video training video,

435
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,230
the assumption in that video is it having
black people on the jury would hurt?

436
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:47,710
That guy would hurt the
prosecutor. Yeah. Is that,

437
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,270
should we just assume that
or I mean is there anything,

438
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,570
any data that would say
that's even remotely true?

439
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,100
The hardest thing about looking at this
stuff analytically is that juries are

440
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:58,630
like a black box.

441
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,170
They don't let journalists and academics
in often to study what's going on.

442
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,910
The jury is kind of sacred that way.
Yeah. But the few times we've gotten data,

443
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:13,090
like there's this group called the
Capitol Jury Project that looks at data

444
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:16,120
specifically in capital cases because
that's where this stuff ends up being life

445
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:16,954
or death.

446
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,020
So they looked at data in like 350 cases
in 14 states over a number of years and

447
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:27,901
they found that white men are more likely
to go for the death penalty than black

448
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:29,260
men.

449
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,380
When you get to sentencing that number
that the difference between white and

450
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,970
black, it's really exaggerated.

451
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:38,050
Like white men are seven times more
likely to want the death penalty than a

452
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:39,010
black person. There.

453
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,040
Another study that was done in Florida
and this one looked at felony cases over

454
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,490
like 10 years and they found that all
white jury pools in Florida can be do

455
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:52,380
black defendants 16% more often
than white defendants. Okay.

456
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,560
But what was really interesting is like
that that gap was practically eliminated

457
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:58,790
when at least one member of the
jury pool was black. Interesting.

458
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,980
You put one black person in the jury
pool and that difference is annihilated.

459
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,640
Yeah. And you can test the
obvious question why? I mean,

460
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,560
obviously criminal cases usually involve
cops and the reason that's often cited

461
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,000
is that you know,

462
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,620
black jurors are less
likely to believe cops.

463
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,580
Lecturers are more likely to insert
some sense of suspicion into the s the

464
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,080
states or the Commonwealth or
whatever his testimony. Yeah,

465
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,240
and almost everyone I talked to gave me
a version of this that that you know,

466
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:30,170
when you have black people on a jury,

467
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:33,530
they deliberate more and that black
people are less likely to trust law

468
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:34,011
enforcement,

469
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:38,850
especially Jack McMahon who was the
guy we heard from in that video.

470
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,360
Well listen,

471
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,360
anybody that knows me knows I am about
as the anti racist person that you could

472
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:45,481
ever imagine.

473
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:50,220
I might stone cold
liberal to the nth degree,

474
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:55,221
but I was talking about practicalities
of picking the jury back then and I still

475
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:58,950
stand by that. I mean if
you're a prosecutor, all right,

476
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,420
let me ask you this question. And
you're trying to drug case so to speak,

477
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:06,810
and your and your defense
and the defendant is going
to claim that the cops are

478
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:11,400
lying. Okay. And you're
the prosecutor. Now,

479
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:17,270
what demographic group has had more
exposure to police line than minority

480
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:20,820
communities?

481
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,820
They have seen a police lie
and will believe police lie
more than some white guy

482
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:29,940
lives in a rich area. I believe
that police officer, every time,

483
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,870
everything he says,

484
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,010
and so as a prosecutor you're trying
to win the case and that person is not

485
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:38,760
going to be a person who's going to be
more questioning of your witnesses and

486
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:43,020
you're given the opportunity through
peremptory challenges to strike them.

487
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,670
Why wouldn't you? You'd be a fool not to.

488
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,840
Well, I guess, uh, I s I see
the argument that, you know,

489
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:52,070
use your peremptory challenges to get
the best jury you can to win. Right,

490
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,600
but doesn't eliminating a black juror
because you believe they might have

491
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:01,601
certain biases against a police officer
versus a white teacher in some way

492
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:05,950
violate the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment? No,

493
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,010
I don't think so. Not at all.

494
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,860
Because it's not because
of the color of their skin.

495
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,260
It's because of their
demographics and where the,

496
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,810
who they've dealt with. It's a societal
demographic concept. It's just,

497
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,750
it's just the fact of
life. It's just like,

498
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,190
but I think those facts of life and
those societal demographic [inaudible]

499
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,860
concepts all stem from
the color of their skin.

500
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,500
Oh Wow. That's it. That's it. That,

501
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,050
that maybe a deeper issue that we
can't deal with in jury selection. Uh,

502
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,250
you're right. But the reality
is the reality is that, that,

503
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:41,650
that that's what the situation, so,

504
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,290
so you're saying that if you're
the prosecutor, you should say, oh,

505
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
well this guy will probably
be worse. Uh, for me,

506
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,850
he probably believed those cops are lying,

507
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:51,970
but I'm going to take them because I
want to uphold the, you know, come on.

508
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,830
I mean, that's just not
realistic. That's just,

509
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,850
there isn't a prosecutor in a country
that would do that. Say, well, I want to,

510
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:01,960
I want to show my altruism and I'm
gonna keep this guy on my jury who may

511
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:06,310
disbelieve my essential witnesses
because I want to be out. You're Wistia.

512
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,440
I mean, come on. That's
just not the way life is.

513
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,673
[inaudible]

514
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,080
can we go, how to solve
a problem like Bateson?

515
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,210
Perfect. We'll continue in a moment.

I'm Preet Bharara every week
on my podcast. Stay tuned.

518
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,890
I answer your questions about what's
really happening in Washington.

519
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,410
I wonder if it is legal for press or
the Trump to initiate military action

520
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,610
against North Korea.

521
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,920
What happens if Mueller returns an
indictment against the president?

522
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,180
I just want to know,
are you a table genius?

524

This is more perfect mini series about
the supreme court. I'm Jad Abumrad.

525
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm Sean Ramas from
let's just for a second,

526
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:39,210
explain how we got into this whole morass
about racial bias in jury selection.

527
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,420
I think we should, it's because of a case.
It was in front of the Supreme Court.

528
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,050
Uh, this term. Yup. Will hear argument
first this morning in case 14,

529
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:50,490
83 49 foster versus
Chapman. So basic facts.

530
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,320
This is a murder case in Georgia.

531
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,950
A younger black man kills
an elderly white woman.

532
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,080
The prosecutors dismiss a bunch of black
jurors and the defense having this new

533
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:03,780
bets and rules says
hold up, can't do that.

534
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,340
And the prosecutors give these race
neutral reasons and the judge says,

535
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,420
that looks good to me.

536
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,220
And then years later something sort of
incredible happens through like one of

537
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:17,370
those freedom of
information act type things.

538
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,550
The defense actually gets to see the notes
the prosecution had during the trial.

539
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,830
The notes they kept during jury selection.

540
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,610
This is one of those rare times when we
pull back the curtain and we find out

541
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:32,730
what the prosecutors were doing.
This is lawyer Steven Bright.

542
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:36,420
He actually argued the foster case in
front of the Supreme Court late last year

543
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,820
and he says what you saw in these
notes was that the prosecution,

544
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
they literally wrote a little B next to
the name of each and every black juror B

545
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:52,090
one B two B three, uh, highlighting
all the blacks and, and,

546
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:56,300
and green on the, on the list of all
the people summoned for jury duty.

547
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,820
It's like race, racial discrimination
is really hard to prove.

548
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,710
This is actual physical
proof in a file in the state.

549
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,070
Like this is the smoking gun we've
been waiting for. So what did the PR,

550
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,210
what did the prosecutor,

551
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,190
how did the prosecution argued
this in front of a Supreme Court?

552
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,830
Prosecution was like, you know what?
Actually once the notes were found,

553
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,090
they said foster is,

554
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,870
we were just writing those bs because
we wanted to make sure we noticed the

555
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,720
black jurors. We wanted
to keep track of them.

556
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,230
The reasonable explanation in this
case is four months prior to trial,

557
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,130
defense counsel files a motion and
says the strike of any black juror,

558
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,600
we're filing a Batson challenge.

559
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,830
That's the lawyer representing
Georgia Beth Burton, and she's saying,

560
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,270
of course we're going to notice race.

561
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:37,170
This is the post Bateson world and we're
going to note race and we're going to

562
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:37,930
write it down.

563
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,970
I would be more surprised, quite frankly,

564
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:42,000
if there wasn't some sort of highlighting.

565
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:42,771
In other words,

566
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:47,771
the argument you're making here is that
is that the reason he highlighted all

567
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:52,450
the black jurors in green, he
being the original prosecutor, uh,

568
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,020
and a said a block but about the black
jurors and did all these different things

569
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,920
was because he was preparing a defense
in case of a Batson challenge. Correct.

570
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,590
That's just as prior asking, well,

571
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:08,591
why didn't you make that argument like
when the case was actually happening

572
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,740
years and years ago

573
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,880
and it was several years. Yes. So
if that had been his real reason,

574
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,710
why isn't it a little surprising that
he never thought of it or didn't tell

575
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:22,270
anybody until you raised this
argument in your main brief

576
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,800
and, and I would, I would say
that's on state habeas counsel.

577
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,510
Hmm.

578
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,630
Uh, so the good news is that

579
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,410
in a seven to one decision,

580
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:39,411
the Supreme Court agreed that
this prosecutor's reasons
were utterly ridiculous.

581
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,360
Well, it isn't. This is a,
I'm just going to ask you,

582
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:47,010
isn't this as clear about in violation
as accord is ever going to see that

583
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:48,600
Justice Kagan? I don't think it is.

584
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,770
The bad news is that this case was
in front of the Supreme Court at all.

585
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,610
It had to get appealed up to the highest
court in the land before someone said,

586
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,410
Oh yeah, that's [inaudible] the Batson
violation. That's how hard it is. Yeah.

587
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:08,140
And the Supreme Court though, it made a
forceful decision. Seven out of eight,

588
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,460
they didn't make a new rule. They
said, this isn't how it works.

589
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,690
They didn't try offer up a Batson 2.0 or
they didn't double down or throw it out

590
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:19,990
or do some new rule. No, they
said this is really wrong,

591
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,710
but they didn't go as far to say,
well clearly this doesn't work.

592
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,640
So we still got Bateson. Yeah,
still got Bateson. So, okay,

593
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:31,840
if we want to diverse juries and we
know that Bateson doesn't really work,

594
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,173
what do we do?

595
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,670
So I asked everyone I talked to that
question and got a lot of different

596
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:42,200
answers, but this was the obvious
one. And Nancy, Nancy Margaret,

597
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,770
who's a professor of law, IIT, Chicago,
Kent College of Law starts us off.

598
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,120
What I'd like the court to do is
eliminate peremptory challenges.

599
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,020
It's a no brainer again, that Steven
Bright, he's a lawyer. We have to,

600
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,070
I mean it's like,

601
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,340
it's like the Supreme Court gives you
these rules of peremptory challenges to

602
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:03,940
strike people and then says, well, wait
a minute, don't just strike people.

603
00:36:03,941 --> 00:36:06,360
You know, we're gonna look into all
the ways that you strike the people.

604
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,830
Well then don't give them at all then
for crying out loud. It's real simple.

605
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,800
Even Jack McMahon, the guy from that
training video, he was open to it.

606
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,520
We've had 30 years of experiment
with Bateson and it's not working.

607
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,680
We now have to go the route that Justice
Marshall suggested back in [inaudible]

608
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,390
Batson. This court has never stated,
not do not speak for the constitution.

609
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:32,130
The rule in the Batson decision,
you've got Thurgood Marshall,

610
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,180
like the most important attorney in the
civil rights movement turned the first

611
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:37,410
Black Supreme Court justice.

612
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,650
He in the same paragraph
called the Batson decision,

613
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,340
historic and then said,
this isn't going to work.

614
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,600
This decision isn't going to do anything.
He was basically a fortune teller.

615
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,020
He said both those things in the
same breath, in one paragraph,

616
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:55,860
he started out going, this decision today,
historic by the end of the paragraph,

617
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,250
you're never going to fix this until
you get rid of peremptory challenges.

618
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,730
[inaudible] 9% to both say, just do
away with peremptory strikes. Look dead.

619
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,910
Fall into constitution. If
both sides are challenges,

620
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,390
if code says do not

621
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,900
[inaudible], no, sorry, will not
violate the constitution. He said,

622
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,490
as long as you have peremptory
challenges, you will have discrimination.

623
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,190
But what surprised me most in
reporting this story is that,

624
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:26,770
like I talked [inaudible] talk to

625
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,850
people on the left side of the criminal
justice system on the right side of the

626
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:34,870
criminal justice system, ACLU
types, law professors, academics,

627
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,260
conservative prosecutors, all of
these people, when you say, guys,

628
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:39,820
we've got to get rid of
peremptory challenges, right?

629
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,160
Almost every single one will say,
no, no, no. It's kind of cool.

630
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,680
That's a crucially important tool. We
made them. It is crucially important.

631
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,090
You know, it's an easy solution. Just
get rid of peremptories. No, hell no.

632
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,030
That's Ellie ms style or
legal editor, law professor,

633
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,330
Son Wolfe from Santa Clara University
and lawyer David Niehaus again.

634
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,200
And here's one of the arguments I
heard. If you take these things away,

635
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:07,260
all the decisions about striking jurors
would be made by the judge on the

636
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,880
question of whether the juror
could be fair and impartial.

637
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,940
And for that to work you have to have a
fair judge and there are an awful lot of

638
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,080
judges who aren't fair.

639
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,920
Here's another argument I heard from
Jeffrey Robinson from the ACLU and this is

640
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:25,390
based on my experience of 34 years
in the criminal justice system.

641
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,410
Jeff Robinson says, if you can find some
way to take race out of the equation,

642
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,700
peremptories are super useful and
he told me about this one case,

643
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,010
very high profile case in the

644
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,210
state of Washington.

645
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,600
This case was incredibly complicated
and also potentially involved a coerced

646
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:48,811
confession by some undercover cops and
there's a police officer on the jury

647
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:51,520
panel. He says, I can be fair.

648
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,610
I know the police officers
that investigated this case.

649
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:58,000
I've worked with them before. I
think they're really good people,

650
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,770
but don't worry, I can be fair.

651
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,190
Everything about his
background was saying,

652
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,990
I do not want this man to serve
on this jury, but he was saying,

653
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,220
I can be fair.

654
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,880
I could not exclude him on a challenge
for cause [inaudible] because he said he

655
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:16,841
could be fair.

656
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:21,070
The fact that he's a police
officer doesn't mean he
can't be fair but is insane.

657
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,520
I know some of these people involved
in this case enough to get him, uh,

658
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:27,130
dismissed for cause it's
enough to get more questioning.

659
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,130
But how well do you know I'm not very
well. So you're saying in that case,

660
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:31,090
if you said, okay judge,

661
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:34,690
I'd like to dismiss juror 17 for car
cause the judge would say there's not a

662
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:35,740
record per cause.

663
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:40,080
I don't think any judge in this country
would dismiss that juror for cause. Wow.

664
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,610
And so a peremptory
challenge is important.

665
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,880
So I've watched more jury selection
videos on youtube than any person ever

666
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,500
should. And

667
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,990
it's this amazing thing
where you see these people,

668
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,510
they're not necessarily used
to being in a courtroom.

669
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,580
They're certainly not used to being
grilled in public. 500 people in suits.

670
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,940
They get up there to the jury panel
and they get asked these questions.

671
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,600
Does everyone agree that bias
doesn't have any place in the trial?

672
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,670
Over and over again? Can you
be ferrying impartial? Yes sir.

673
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,970
You're like a blank slate and you
just got to listen to the evidence.

674
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,140
Can you do all that? Yes, I
can. Okay. Nobody Says No.

675
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,110
Everyone feels like yes, I
can be fair. And you know,

676
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:25,330
this is the time to tell us.
That's why we're asking you this.

677
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,150
I'm thinking I could, okay,

678
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,850
I can be totally unbiased and I think
some of them believe that they can

679
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:35,140
actually do this for nearly impossible
task and others they know they can't,

680
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,460
but they might say yes anyway.

681
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:41,310
Anyone who tries the case believe
me knows that bias. Jurors comment,

682
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,770
they don't reveal things,
they lie about things.

683
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:45,090
There's people that
when you're questioning,

684
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,830
I'm in a jury that you
know they're lying to you.

685
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,860
They're either trying to get on the
jury or trying to get off the jury bias.

686
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:51,600
People are being allowed to serve.

687
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:56,870
So any tool that can help reduce the
number of bias jurors on jurors is

688
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:58,620
essential to justice.

689
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,360
So yeah, if you've got a really
crappy outlook on jurors and humans,

690
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,830
then maybe you need more
peremptory challenges.

691
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:07,710
But the way Jeffrey Robinson put it to
me was that if you're using peremptory

692
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:12,000
challenges the right way, it forces
you to be like equal opportunity,

693
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:15,510
suspicious, suspicious of everyone.

694
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,000
And that's the only way to be fair.

695
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,650
My parents were both active in the
civil rights movement in Memphis,

696
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:26,760
Tennessee as active as two people. You
could ever want to meet both black.

697
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,110
I would never let my mother sit on a
criminal defense jury because my mother's

698
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:38,570
view about black defendants was you're
the reason I have to lock the door in my

699
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:39,404
neighborhood.

700
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,730
You're the reason that I get disrespected
when I go out into the community and

701
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:47,930
I'm going to take it out on you.
My father's position would be,

702
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,010
I wouldn't believe a police officer if
he told me it was raining and the water

703
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,510
was coming down on my head.

704
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,690
And so what this is about is actually
putting into effect what the rules say.

705
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,470
Talk to jurors and find
out what they think.

706
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,190
But what about Thurgood
Marshall's idea that you know,

707
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,930
if you have peremptory challenges, if
you give people a way to discriminate,

708
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,130
they will discriminate.

709
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,053
Well,

710
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,290
I was born in 1956 and so in 1954
Thurgood Marshall argued Brown versus the

711
00:42:20,561 --> 00:42:21,850
board of Education,

712
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,410
which had a significant impact on my life.

713
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Thurgood Marshall was someone that I
have respected and someone I have admired

714
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:33,040
virtually my entire life.

715
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:37,690
But I can't agree with him that I want
all peremptory challenges eliminated.

716
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:42,100
And why do you think Thurgood Marshall
Justice Marshall when straight to no

717
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:42,490
perimeter?

718
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,490
I think Justice Marshall concluded that
he did not have faith in America to be

719
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:53,350
able to make these kinds of decisions.
And I understand why he concluded that.

720
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,540
And you do you have that faith?

721
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,100
I still do. And how long that
will last? I don't know. Hmm.

722
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,710
But I still do right now.

723
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,113
[inaudible]

724
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,190
Robinson says that to give up on these
peremptories is like giving up on who we

725
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:20,640
might be one day because
of who we are right now.

726
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,080
That's conceding that we are so divided
by race that we will never be able to

727
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,500
try and fix it. And I'm not
prepared to concede that

728
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,190
[inaudible]

729
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,480
okay. One last thing for my trip.

730
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,340
De Louisville told Joe,
Hey, what's up James?

731
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:47,180
All right. Close by something that
blew me away. I'm Joe Guttman.

732
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:50,480
I'm a teacher at central high
school, also an attorney at law,

733
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,070
James Batson, truck grabber
and construction worker.

734
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:56,300
Amongst other things.

735
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:01,010
I probably should add that I'm the
former prosecutor of Mr Bateson's cases.

736
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,740
Joe Guttman and James Batson.

737
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,270
Those two people whose conflict in a
courtroom back in 1983 gave us the Batson

738
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,660
rule. They are now in 2016.

739
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,960
Hmm. Friends. I've I've to
him about him. Yes, dude.

740
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,550
Yep. We're friends. All
right, let's do it. Yup. Hey,

741
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:24,090
I'm Jad Abumrad this is more
perfect miniseries about
the supreme court and, um,

742
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,410
today's story from a reporter.
Shawn, I always f up your last name.

743
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,010
Can you just say it? Ramez from
Ramas firm, I always put the accent,

744
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,100
the wrong place. Anyhow,

745
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,280
let me set the table for you. We
live in a representative democracy.

746
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,590
And what does that actually
mean? Practically speaking?

747
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,240
Like when do we come in contact with that?

748
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:44,160
Democracy to places seems to me
mainly one when we vote, right?

749
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,930
Yeah. You asking me? Yeah, I was deep
in thought, if you vote, if you vote.

750
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,630
It's true. I know like college educated,

751
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:54,630
super progressive human beings who
are like, why would I ever vote?

752
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:55,650
It doesn't mean anything. Exactly.

753
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,930
Not to mention people who just don't
even care about the world. Yeah.

754
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,380
It sort of makes my point like voting
is the first way and for a lot of people

755
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:03,120
it's entirely optional. The second right

756
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:05,870
away is not, you will be
fine if you don't do it.

757
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,100
And I mean serving on a
jury, this is where like we,

758
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:14,510
the people decide who goes
to jail, who gets free,

759
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,740
who lives, who dies.

760
00:45:15,741 --> 00:45:20,000
This is where we actually
do democracy today. Uh,

761
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:24,860
we start with the story of a guy who
supreme, who is Supreme Court famous,

762
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:27,380
would you say? Yeah. He's in the
books. He's like a chapter. Yeah.

763
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:29,930
He's like one of the most important names
you've never heard of because he's at

764
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:34,880
the center of this ongoing battle about
who gets to serve on juries and his

765
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:37,160
name. Depending on who you are,

766
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:42,190
either symbolizes the best parts of
American democracy or the most cynical,

767
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:47,090
should I say his name? Yeah, go for
it. James Batson. James Kirkland.

768
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,200
That's, Hello

769
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,223
James Shot.

770
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,480
I went to his house and Norville tell me
your full name and tell me where you're

771
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:02,410
from and that James Batson,
Louisville, Kentucky, James Batson,

772
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:05,110
his name just kept coming up over and
over again when I was looking through the

773
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:08,680
history of jury selection in America.
So I called him up and I was like, Hey,

774
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,010
I'm this radio reporter in New York City
and I'm really interested in your case

775
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:13,960
because there's this other case
before the court right now.

776
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,640
Could I come talk to you? And he's,
he was like, Oh yeah, sure. Okay,

777
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:23,320
make sure my full name and shitty
mentioned. Of course he's tall.

778
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,120
He's built like a fridge. Um,
he's a black man. Drove truck,

779
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,570
local and cross country far
for business, 15 hours one way.

780
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:36,250
Where does that Florida as a kid,
he was, he was an aide student.

781
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,090
Graduated from her and technical
high school. Hughes, uh, you know,

782
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:42,760
like a vocational school specializing
in electrical engineering,

783
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,310
industrial electricity.
He seemed pretty popular.

784
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,430
[inaudible] perfect tennis water
Sunday school when I was 18,

785
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,300
but shortly after that it
seemed like the bottom fell out.

786
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,730
James Batson grew up in the West End of
Louisville in the 1970s and the west end

787
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:07,120
was super rough with people
selling dope prostitution. Uh,

788
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,850
everything had to do with
fast money at a young age.

789
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,780
Fast money was like,
oh, the American dream.

790
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:21,310
I mean it's pretty hard when a lot of
people round you got nice thing and they

791
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:26,130
got them because they're doing something
illegal and you keep calling up rabid.

792
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,320
Here you're shaking your
head like, you know what,

793
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,990
rabbit or [inaudible] you pull both
of your pockets and ain't nothing,

794
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,360
didn't need them. One of them, he
said it all started when he was 10.

795
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:40,370
He wanted a pair of shoes. He couldn't
afford them. Chuck Tyler's, well,

796
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:43,090
when I first came out, if you
didn't have a pair of those,

797
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:46,690
you hit on what they call buddies,
old buddies, cheap tennis shoes.

798
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,010
Him and his brother asked his mom for
the money and she gave them some money,

799
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:53,860
but not enough, so to
make up the difference.

800
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:58,390
They went out and they stole people's
empty soda bottles and turn them in for

801
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:03,391
like the deposits [inaudible] Nicola
piece stolen up pop bottles to get chuck

802
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,700
Taylors. There was my
first experience with.
