[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
SPEAKER 1: Hi, everyone.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Welcome to "Talks at Google."

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.995
Today's speaker is meteorologist
and "Celebrity MasterChef"

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:17.258
contestant Evelyn Cusack.

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:20.222
So let's give her
a warm welcome.

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:21.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:27.510
EVELYN CUSACK: Hi, thanks
very much for coming.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.760
I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.650
we forecast weather.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.480
So if that's right, I'm
a little of meteorology.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.550
So we can start--

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.410
this the view from the
European satellite--

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.530
Meteor sat.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.420
Now, sorry, it's a bit fast.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.720
But I know you're
all zippy here.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.520
So already, there's Africa.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.090
So the satellite is located
at 37,000 kilometers

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.940
over the equator and at
the 0 line longitude.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.070
So you can see how tiny
Ireland is in this.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.495
So this is a real view.

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:03.640
In atlases, their
vision is distorted.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.525
So the best few
from the satellite

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:07.400
is actually over Africa.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.950
Now, this stuff
here is-- the cloud

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.706
is the tropical thunderstorms.

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:14.850
And I think you can
see a connection there.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.320
Do you see it's going
around that way?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.030
So this is 2012.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.943
Here's Ireland.

00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:22.776
And all this white
stuff-- they are actually

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:26.480
a series of Atlantic storms
that have produced flooding.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.250
And here's the dry,
sunny, hot Sahara Desert.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.010
And here's the Patagonia
Desert down here.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.000
So you've got the
desert belts here,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.290
the tropical thunderstorms.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.040
And then you've got
Atlantic westerlies.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.870
And also, it's called
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.850
So that's the basic pattern
of weather around the world.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.540
And Ireland just happens to lie
in the path of these Atlantic

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.040
westerlies.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.456
So that's why it
rains quite a lot

00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:58.490
and why it's not
dry, warm, and sunny.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.416
If you want dry, warm,
and sunny weather,

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:03.300
go down here, all right?

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.938
Although I do feel if we were
only about 10 or 15 degrees

00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:10.780
more south, it would be a
bit warmer and a bit dryer.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.530
But all in all, it's pretty dry.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.650
Now, I don't know if you
watch the weather on RTE.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.950
But this is my
colleague Helen Curran.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.360
So we actually
have a blue screen.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.500
And we do point to the
blue screen at the back.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.420
But we're not totally blind
as [INAUDIBLE] in the corner.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.510
And we have a countdown
clock, which basically you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.790
have about two minutes
for the broadcast.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.000
So that 28 on means
it's 28 minutes to air.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.420
So the broadcast is
about two minutes long.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.630
Now, in the olden days,
they used to cut me off,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.929
because I'd always go on longer.

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:48.720
[INAUDIBLE] things.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.060
So I usually take
about 30 seconds.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.100
Well, the news always look for
extra time, so to hell with it.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.810
So here's what the viewer sees.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.990
So now do you know what
these fluffy clouds are?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.948
Does anyone watch
"The Simpsons"?

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:03.764
Yeah.

00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:05.390
So they are "The
Simpsons" clouds.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.630
They are cumulus clouds.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.500
Now, if you look out
the window, there

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.860
aren't really cumulus clouds.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.880
They are stratus clouds.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.980
So stratus is the
Latin for a layer.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.000
Whereas cumulus is
the Latin for heat.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.320
Now, they're kind of nice,
little friendly, fluffy clouds.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.110
But when they get very--

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.880
when the atmosphere
is very unstable,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.220
they build up to the atmosphere.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.760
And we get pretty violent clouds
that are called cumulonimbus.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.640
Now, sometimes these are
formed near volcanoes,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.040
because the volcanic
cash actually acts

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.940
as a seeding for the clouds.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.365
So this is a nice website here
to get lots of nice images.

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:50.320
And so the cumulonimbus clouds
produce hail and thunderstorms.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.860
And the clouds we saw
at the equator there--

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.330
they are cumulonimbus clouds.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.600
So you can actually get
killed in one of these

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.390
from lightening.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.500
And lots of these
produce tornadoes.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.320
You know the "Wizard
of Oz" when Dorothy

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.606
was taken up in a tornado?

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:08.426
That came from a
cumulonimbus cloud.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.371
Now, is anyone
here from Iceland?

00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:18.319
Good.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:22.056
So I'd pronounce it [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:22.056 --> 00:04:22.910
That's fine.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.270
So this is it looking
down from the Meteor sat.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.520
So there's Iceland.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.134
So there's the actual
volcanic cloud.

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:31.800
And you see Ireland
there in the corner.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.220
So who said it always
rains in Ireland?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.830
The white stuff is the clouds.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.940
So it's pretty sunny
there in the west.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.230
So I guess you'd like
to know how we actually

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.550
forecast the weather.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.980
So we don't go to
our app on the phone,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.410
because we produce
what's on the app.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.881
So I'm going to tell you how
we do that now a little bit

00:04:49.881 --> 00:04:50.380
hopefully.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.960
So meteorology in Ireland
goes back quite a lot.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.190
You've all heard of
Boyle's law, have you?

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.890
Studied physics in school.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.780
So there's Robert Boyle,
1659, the famous gas law.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.790
And this was one of the earlier
observatories in Ireland--

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.100
Phoenix Park, 1829.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.340
So it's hard to see here-- but
taking his weather reading.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.365
So scientific-- or
not forecasting--

00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:24.450
the discussion of science in
Ireland goes back to the 1600s.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.400
And the [INAUDIBLE] era, if
you want to call it [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.830
era, is when the
telegraphic cable was laid

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.632
from North America to Ireland.

00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:37.805
If you like, it really was
the internet of its day.

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:38.346
So that's it.

00:05:38.346 --> 00:05:41.610
And you can see it at the
National Maritime Museum

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.390
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.776
I meant to bring a sample of it.

00:05:44.776 --> 00:05:45.776
I forgot my [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:45.776 --> 00:05:47.141
Sorry about that.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.700
The Irish Met Service,
where I work for,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.290
really wasn't
established until 1937.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.800
And [INAUDIBLE] in
1933, Charles Lindbergh

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.390
chose Foynes, County Limerick
as an essential eastern terminus

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.688
for the transatlantic
flight water route.

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:08.290
So going from North
America to Shannon--

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.736
so the weather was-- they
obviously needed a forecast.

00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:14.520
So that's when we came into
existence, if you like.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.730
It was to service.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.650
Now, I shudder to think of the
flying conditions and forecasts

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.390
in those days.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.100
But sure, it's
progressed anyway.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.320
And everyone wasn't killed.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.935
So here's an observer.

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:31.780
Do you know what that
screen is called?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.704
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:35.476
EVELYN CUSACK: [INAUDIBLE] yeah.

00:06:35.476 --> 00:06:38.980
And the person that
designed that [INAUDIBLE],

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.860
he was the [INAUDIBLE]
the son of--

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.110
you know who kidnapped
Robert Louis Stevenson?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.270
So here's all our stuff.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.280
There's thermometers--
humidity measurement.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.340
But most of our
stations [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.462
are actually automatic now.

00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:00.670
So at Met Eireann, we build
our own weather stations.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.178
And there's a colleague, Frank.

00:07:03.178 --> 00:07:08.000
A lot of our older stations
have closed down actually.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.660
We have one Kilkenny going
way back into early '50s.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.880
And the reason it
had to close down

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.950
was the locals started
building houses

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.176
around it, which was very
inconsiderate of them,

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.956
because we need a
nice, open area,

00:07:26.956 --> 00:07:28.536
because if you have
houses around, it

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:30.160
will interfere with
the wind direction.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.490
It will also create a
little heat island load.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.600
It's much more in the city
than out in the middle

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.030
of the country, because
the buildings actually

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.180
radiate heat.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.360
So it's a well-known
phenomenon-- an urban heat

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.120
island, say in London, or Paris,
or New York, very large cities,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.308
it can be up to 10 degrees
higher in the night than

00:07:49.308 --> 00:07:50.580
in the adjoining.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.890
So that's why you can
probably hear of a rural frost

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.396
or frost out in the country.

00:07:55.396 --> 00:07:58.733
And sometimes we're forecasting
frost [INAUDIBLE] again.

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:00.850
But that's because
you live in the city.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.485
So that's a good
excuse [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:06.030
So one of the main
things of importance

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.500
here at our web
station is this fence.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.047
So do you think--

00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:12.210
do you know?

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.360
OK, we obviously don't
want people breaking in.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.120
But more importantly, we
don't little wild animals

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.680
coming in and interfering
with our rain reporter

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.848
and adding to the totals.

00:08:25.544 --> 00:08:28.220
So, sorry, just a bit fuzzy.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.070
But can you make out--
that's the Earth underneath.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.240
That's a ship.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.289
That's an airplane.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.799
That's a weather balloon.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.020
There's satellites.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.270
So the WMO-- that's the World
Meteorological Organization,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.960
who do an amazing amount
of observations now--

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.570
so 10,000 surface
weather stations

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.140
right around the
world, 1,000 upper-air.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.080
The weather is obviously
three dimensional.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.460
Most of our weather
occurs in the troposphere,

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.390
which is about 12 kilometers
up, which isn't very much when

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.340
you think of it.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.720
It's really just 12 kilometers
between us and oblivion.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.330
So if you have a
peach, or an apple,

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.012
the atmosphere is just
like the skin on the apple.

00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:11.910
It's very little.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.810
And the weather is
even a smaller part.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.670
So in Ireland, we have two
upper-air weather stations.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.652
We send up weather
balloons and [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:21.652 --> 00:09:23.485
And then we have drifting
buoys, or boo-ees,

00:09:23.485 --> 00:09:25.480
as we say in North America.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.560
We have hundreds of weather
radars, commercial air check

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.750
observations, and then you
have 50, 60, 70 research

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.890
satellites-- weather
satellites, which

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.010
observe the climate,
not only at the weather,

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:43.880
but also the climate and the
condensation in the atmosphere.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.429
Now, the first
step in a forecast

00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:48.970
is you must observe
what's happening.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.030
Just say, for example,
at midday today.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.920
And then, after
years of research,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.180
we figured out more or less
the physics of the atmosphere.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.752
But I'm not going to go into it.

00:09:58.752 --> 00:10:00.168
It's a nice picture
for you there.

00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:01.730
So it's all the
different processes.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.115
The sun shines on the Earth.

00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:06.330
It goes through the atmosphere.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.230
But you know it's usually that
the atmosphere doesn't observe

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.610
much of the sun's rays,
because otherwise, we

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.810
wouldn't see anything.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.030
So, if you like, the
atmosphere is more or less

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.200
transparent to the sun's rays--

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.190
the light from the sun.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.520
And in fact, the sun
heats up the ground.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.785
And the ground
radiates out heat.

00:10:26.785 --> 00:10:28.930
And that's what heats.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.920
[INAUDIBLE] when you go
out in the sun, the sun

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.600
heats your skin.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.505
But the sun doesn't heat the
air, because most of the air

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:39.410
is nitrogen and oxygen.
It's about 78% nitrogen

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.930
and 21% oxygen. So
what does that leave?

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.240
78% plus 21%.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.330
So it only leaves 1% from
the other stuff, which

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.490
is water vapor,
which is the rain

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.650
and carbon dioxide [INAUDIBLE]
the greenhouse gases.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.530
So anyway, we take
our observations.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:03.670
We construct a meteorological
model using the known physics

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.892
of the atmosphere.

00:11:05.892 --> 00:11:09.650
And then we feed them into
a very powerful computer,

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.310
which is our European Center
for Medium-range Weather

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.810
Forecasting.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.230
Now, I just got this
from the ECMWF website--

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.880
2 quadrillion
calculations a second.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.680
That's quite a lot, is it?

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.570
That's a quadrillion.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.230
OK, we won't google it.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.700
So that's supercomputer.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.291
I was over visiting in summer.

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.290
And it was sort of like
visiting the mother ship

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.485
in this lovely movie.

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:35.710
We weren't allowed
to take photos.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.320
And it was really cold.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.047
Your engineer, who can
tell you all about it

00:11:41.047 --> 00:11:42.952
from the data center,
is really freezing.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.410
But we weren't
allowed to touch it.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.130
But we were allowed
to worship it.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:54.520
There's been a new upgrade
on [INAUDIBLE] summer.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.025
So I just want to
explain a little bit.

00:11:57.025 --> 00:12:00.380
OK, we have the physics
of the atmosphere.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.185
And the weather is a
deterministic system

00:12:02.185 --> 00:12:03.905
in the sense what is weather.

00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:07.190
And each molecule
in the atmosphere--

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.130
each molecule would
have a kinetic energy.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.320
Temperature is just
the movement of atoms.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.000
So, if you like, weather is
a very deterministic system

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.700
in the sense if you know
what each molecule is doing

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.550
at one point in time,
using these equations,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.640
you can predict forward in time.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.520
The only problem is
there is so many of them

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.990
that we can't know what
each molecule is doing.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:39.215
So we create mathematical grids.

00:12:39.215 --> 00:12:44.365
And then of all of the millions
of molecules in each grid,

00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:46.890
we smear it out and do
an average temperature,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:47.630
if you like.

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.845
To forecast the weather,
the weather, as we saw,

00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:55.320
it's going around, and around,
and around, and around,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.310
and around.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.040
The atmosphere is
spinning the Earth.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.070
And the Earth is
going around the sun.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.190
So we have these grids.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.700
This is about 900 million grid
points at 9 kilometer spacing

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.940
between each grid point.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.230
Now, this is for a global
model, so I just wanted to--

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.890
but for Ireland, we have what's
called a high-resolution model.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.940
And our high-resolution
model have grid points

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.910
at 2.5 kilometer spacing.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.930
And we're working towards
a 1 kilometer spacing.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.460
So what it really
is is that we're

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.390
trying to model the surface
of the Earth and also

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.340
the atmosphere.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.100
So it's going up 137 layers
up to the 12 kilometers.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.530
I won't spend a
lot of time on it.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.370
But the higher the
resolution, the more

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.940
we can model the atmosphere
better and the weather.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.230
So each, if you like,
national met service,

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.980
we have our own
high-resolution models

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.106
for our own countries
and the area.

00:13:54.106 --> 00:13:56.450
So we model the
Wicklow Mountains.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.140
And then the Swiss
Weather Service

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.790
would be modeling the Alps.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.248
You can imagine
what a nightmare it

00:14:02.248 --> 00:14:04.700
is trying to forecast the
Alps with the valleys--

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.620
up and down up and down.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.880
So this is an example plotted.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.690
So we get that from our
model both from the ECMWF

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.860
and from our own harmony
high-resolution model.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.085
And really, my job has
been very, very simple,

00:14:18.085 --> 00:14:20.560
because I just interpret
this for you guys

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.612
and then go on television and
give you the weather forecast.

00:14:26.612 --> 00:14:28.826
But there is such a limit.

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.570
And you've probably
heard of chaos

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.675
and all that sort of stuff.

00:14:32.675 --> 00:14:35.012
It's very important [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:35.012 --> 00:14:39.760
But we've reckoned at the moment
that 10 days ahead is the most.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.770
And it's because-- remember I
said we can't know the initial

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.520
conditions perfectly,
because weather is--

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.763
for the millions, and
billions, and billions

00:14:51.763 --> 00:14:54.081
of molecules in the
atmosphere, and we

00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:55.725
can't model that perfectly.

00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:59.050
So there's some certainty
in the initial conditions.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.580
And those and
second just multiply

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.775
as you go forward in time.

00:15:02.775 --> 00:15:06.340
So we've reckoned about
a week to 10 days ahead.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.000
Now, maybe in 100 years time,
my colleague of the future

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.660
will be standing
here in front of you.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.614
And maybe they'll play this
back and say, oh, so cute

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:19.200
to imagine they could only
forecast 10 days ahead.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.310
So hopefully that will be true.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.370
That's how we think
now at this stage.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.520
When I started at first, I
started on television in 1998,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.110
it was really even
scarier because we weren't

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.670
even didn't had a lot of
confidence tomorrow's forecast,

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.830
but you sure had
to give it anyway.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:37.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.220
So I have gone on TV.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.390
I had to make sure I wasn't
wearing the same jacket.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.690
Actually, I just had
5 to 10 days ahead,

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.760
because a lot of the
media and certain websites

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.460
were like-- it's going
to be a cold winter.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.890
It's going to be a
fantastic summer.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.030
Well, if there
were forecasts that

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.540
could forecast that time ahead,
sure, I would give it to you.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.660
That's my job.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.669
It's not as if [INAUDIBLE],
or in the British Met Office--

00:16:05.669 --> 00:16:07.460
oh, we know it's going
to be a good summer.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.220
But we're not
going to tell them.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.800
They have some type of secret.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.750
And I'll give you a
concrete example of this.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.375
We have to apply for--

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:23.180
there's just about
12 to 14 forecasters

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.630
working in the met area.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.710
And we're a very
small met service.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.150
Because I'm one of the oldest,
I'm on top of the roster.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.060
So I have to take my
summer leave in January,

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.360
which is kind of annoying.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.150
So if I knew the
forecast for the summer,

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.500
I would obviously
pick the best time.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.270
So way back in 1995, it was the
hottest and the driest summer

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:43.770
on record.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.622
Where's [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:45.622 --> 00:16:48.230
I don't know.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.740
So the three weeks I picked
was the only break in weather

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.540
in that long, hot summer.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.780
So for my three weeks, it
rained almost continuously.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.902
And four weeks before it
and four weeks after it,

00:17:00.902 --> 00:17:02.320
it was warm and sunny.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.300
So I would be silly not to
use that forecast [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.324
So we go 10 days ahead.

00:17:10.324 --> 00:17:11.890
But I just want to
show you this now.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.960
I know your head will
hurt looking at this.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.599
So it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.619
And I just picked it up.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.694
This is called
ensemble forecasting.

00:17:20.694 --> 00:17:22.960
So just look at precipitation--

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.750
precipitation is anything
that falls from the sky.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.964
So it's rain, sleet, snow,
hail, drizzle, so anything

00:17:30.964 --> 00:17:32.760
that falls from the
sky is precipitation.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.162
So this is yesterday's forecast.

00:17:34.162 --> 00:17:35.500
It was similar to today.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.680
Here's Wednesday the
8th, 9th, 10th, 11th--

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.760
so pretty much dry.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.660
Look.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.330
So there's a little bit.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.030
But you can see
there is a spread.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.160
So what we do is
because we don't

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.650
know the initial stage of
the atmosphere perfectly,

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:58.840
we run the model 52 times by
perturbing the initial state.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.290
We vary certain parts
of the atmosphere

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.840
that we have uncertainty about.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.360
And we run it 52 times.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.580
Again, maybe in 100 years time,
they'll say, oh, it's so cute.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.160
They ran the model 52 times.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.560
Maybe they'll be running it a
million times with a million

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.050
different perturbation
at that stage.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.590
But you know, ECMWF--

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.490
it's the world leader in
medium-range forecasting.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.680
So by medium range, we're
talking about 10 days.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.820
So this is an ensemble.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.320
It's sort of a
probability, if you like.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.880
Now, in Ireland, we don't really
use probability forecasting

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.205
much, because our
weather is so variable.

00:18:36.205 --> 00:18:39.740
It's easier-- see if you're
forecasting for, let's say,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.740
Dublin or New York, you can
give more of a probability

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.840
for one moment in
time or for a midday,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.375
or for a particular day.

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:51.930
But for a whole country,
and for a climate like ours,

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.210
we can actually vary
from rain and showers.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.610
Now, do you know the different
between rain and showers?

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.920
So I'm going to tell you.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.620
But anyway, Met Eirann-- that's
where I work in Glasnevin.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.310
So our first mission statement--

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.890
"Ensure the protection and
safety of life and property

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.740
by issuing a public weather
forecast and warnings."

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.000
So if there was a method of
forecasting a really bad winter

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.560
ahead, that's my job.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.330
That's what the
public pay me for.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.520
So I would use it.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.160
So let's move on, Evelyn.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.382
Let's get off this fence here.

00:19:28.382 --> 00:19:30.510
So here's Ireland.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.120
So you are probably
familiar with [INAUDIBLE],

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.610
Mizen Head, Slyne Head.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.240
Have you heard the
weather forecast?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.160
So we issue all these forecasts.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.700
And recently, we've
issued a warning system--

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.860
so yellow, orange, and red.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.740
Thankfully, we haven't done
any red warnings this year.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.210
It's been a very
quiet winter so far.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.630
We defined winter as December,
January, and February

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:56.240
in Ireland.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.060
The reason we do in that
space are temperature.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.460
And these are the coldest
months except for this year.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.225
So when I was
growing up, we used

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:08.646
to define spring as the
first of February, which

00:20:08.646 --> 00:20:10.470
is St. Brigid's Day.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.039
But that's based more in light.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:14.330
You know the way it's getting
brighter in the evenings.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.060
But statistically
and meteorologically,

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.340
the coldest months in Ireland
and in the Northern Hemisphere

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.258
are December,
January, and February.

00:20:21.258 --> 00:20:23.174
So it doesn't matter how
you define something,

00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:26.070
as long as everybody knows
why you're defining it.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.450
Shakespeare said that.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.870
You know, what's in a name?

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.310
Is it a rose?

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.765
Blah, blah, blah.

00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:37.010
A rose is just as sweet by
any other name or whatever.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.210
That's what's important
in science, isn't it?

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.722
That we all have
the same definition.

00:20:41.722 --> 00:20:43.140
It doesn't matter.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.835
In fact, that's language.

00:20:44.835 --> 00:20:46.840
Personally, I have no
interest in languages,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.390
or studying languages, because
it's not real knowledge.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.650
It's just what people
are using as words.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.222
But it's important
to communications.

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:59.055
But there are all
different criteria we use.

00:20:59.055 --> 00:20:59.510
I'm not going to
go through them.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.350
It's too boring.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.058
Except for winds.

00:21:01.058 --> 00:21:02.000
Status red.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.086
We used a status red
warning when we expect winds

00:21:05.086 --> 00:21:08.560
over 130 kilometers per hour.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.060
Now, we're part of the European
consortium of Meteoalarm.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.260
This is very good.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.490
If you're ever
traveling around Europe,

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.535
you get this on our website or
the Meteoalarm Ireland website.

00:21:22.535 --> 00:21:25.080
And it gives an idea
of severe weather.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.065
So recently, that analysis--
if you ever go skiing,

00:21:28.065 --> 00:21:30.640
it was warning of avalanches.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.435
And these are all the countries
and models [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:37.830
That would be handy for the
Eurovision, wouldn't it?

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:44.300
So I know Google are actually
in talks with [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.000
to use this idea.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.910
So it's very good,
because these warnings

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.790
are issued by all the
national met services.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.760
So there's a lot of independent
weather companies around now,

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.800
which is great.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.380
It's fine.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.730
But it's important that
there's a warning--

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.090
that there aren't all these
spurious warnings, I think.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:10.237
So the official warnings
for severe weather in Europe

00:22:10.237 --> 00:22:12.160
are done by the
meteorological services.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.760
And I think we all work
to the same standards

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.660
and have scientific conferences.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.490
So again, we don't want
spurious warnings--

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.070
it's going to be a
really cold winter

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.420
with severe thunderstorms,
and blizzards, and everything.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.110
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:35.280
So from last year, we are in
collaboration with the British

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.310
Met Office naming storms.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.720
So do you remember
any of these storms?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.980
So Barney-- [INAUDIBLE] Desmond
gave you a lot of flooding.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:48.140
And in fact, the midlands was
flooded for several months

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.720
from Storm Desmond.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.670
And it's been a very
quiet winter this year.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.546
We haven't really
had any storms.

00:22:56.546 --> 00:23:01.880
And this just affected
southern parts of Britain.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.510
The way we're doing it is if we
expect an Atlantic storm to hit

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.376
any part of Ireland,
England, Wales, or Scotland--

00:23:09.376 --> 00:23:12.040
is anybody from Ireland,
England, Wales, Scotland?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.780
Yeah.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.800
We're going to name it.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.710
So we've had none this year.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.940
Now, I'm on the committee
to name the storm.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.512
So I will take all bribes.

00:23:21.512 --> 00:23:22.336
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:25.850
And I've got my
daughter in here, Fleur.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.082
So I wasn't sure.

00:23:27.082 --> 00:23:30.880
If it turns out
to be a bad storm,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.662
a Fleur caused destruction.

00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:35.900
But in fact, it may
not even happen yet,

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.810
because we haven't
even had a storm.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.590
Now I shouldn't say we have
a couple of months left.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.032
But certainly, as you saw
in our ECMWF medium range,

00:23:45.032 --> 00:23:47.924
we expect pretty quiet
conditions for the next week

00:23:47.924 --> 00:23:51.298
to 10 days.

00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:54.335
But the storm naming
goes back a while--

00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:58.110
so the Ulysses storm of 1903.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.200
The reason it's called
the Ulysses Storm

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.290
is James Joyce's
really boring novel

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.120
"Ulysses," which
is supposed to be

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.952
one of the greatest works
of literature of all time.

00:24:07.952 --> 00:24:11.680
Hands up who's read it.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.440
AUDIENCE: I can't
remember any of it.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.624
EVELYN CUSACK: In fact, I
even joined a study group

00:24:16.624 --> 00:24:18.730
studying it, you know--

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.080
just--

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.096 --> 00:24:23.530
"Finnegan's Wake" is worse.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:30.210
I know [INAUDIBLE]--
scientist [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:34.350
So that's a recreation
of the storm.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.181
Obviously, there
were no warnings.

00:24:36.181 --> 00:24:40.210
Oh, yeah, it knocked
down almost 3,000 trees.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.500
Try and say that--

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.036
3,000 trees in the Phoenix Park.

00:24:46.036 --> 00:24:50.896
But this is what a storm
looks like from satellite--

00:24:50.896 --> 00:24:53.460
from the Meteor sats.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.730
Everything is in swirls
in our Universe, isn't it?

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:03.240
So at Ireland's
latitudes, our weather

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.740
is in constant [INAUDIBLE]
between colder coming down

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.290
from the north and warmer
coming up from the south.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.030
So where the two
air masses clash,

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.310
you get what's known
as a frontal zone.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.390
The reason it's
called a weather front

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:22.620
is that the meteorologist
Vilhelm Bjerknes from Norway

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.410
discovered this, if you
like, from observation.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.336
It was during World War
I in the Western Front.

00:25:28.336 --> 00:25:32.516
So we likened the weather
front as two opposing armies--

00:25:32.516 --> 00:25:34.340
the warm and cold.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.280
So I'm now going to explain to
you the difference between rain

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.860
and showers.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.260
So our rain is at the front.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.000
So it lasts for several hours.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.570
It could last for a day.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.800
So can you think back--
when did we last have rain?

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.920
On Monday.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.980
So that was a front, because
it lasted for many hours,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.830
didn't it?

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.890
And then the rain could
clear, and beautiful sunshine,

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.030
and sunshine and showers.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.510
So some people said, oh, you're
really hedging your bets,

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.010
aren't you?

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.906
Right here in
sunshine and showers.

00:26:03.906 --> 00:26:07.570
But you remember we saw the
cumulonimbus with the hail

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.080
and the thunderstorm.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.158
That occurs in these clouds--

00:26:11.158 --> 00:26:12.116
cumulus-- cumulonimbus.

00:26:12.116 --> 00:26:17.180
And this is the stratus,
which is just gentle.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.810
But you can get very
poor visibility there.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.340
So does anyone do hill walking?

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.770
Yeah, so never go hill walking
when there's a front coming in.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.676
And you can find that from that
[INAUDIBLE] from the radar,

00:26:30.676 --> 00:26:31.800
because that's really good.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.870
That can you show
you the actual rain.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.480
So better move on.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.450
But you know "Crocodile Dundee"?

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.687
You know that saying,
you call that a knife?

00:26:40.687 --> 00:26:43.960
Well, this is,
call that a storm?

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.765
But unfortunately
Hurricane Mitch--

00:26:45.765 --> 00:26:47.910
it was a devastating hurricane.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.680
I know Hurricane Katrina
gets all the-- you know,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.480
was really bad flooding.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.046
But this was
actually devastating.

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:56.630
It hit Central America.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.930
And there isn't the
same infrastructure.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.230
And even though
it was warned of,

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.854
it's not as easy to evacuate,
because where do you go?

00:27:06.854 --> 00:27:08.020
There's all these mountains.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.692
And over 9,000 people died, even
though forecasters knew-- we

00:27:12.692 --> 00:27:14.386
could see it on the satellite.

00:27:14.386 --> 00:27:18.260
And this is 1998.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.190
And I remember working,
and it was, god,

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.460
look at the size of it.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.530
And it went right in
across Central America--

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.937
absolutely devastating.

00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:27.520
So in fact, I just
checked last night.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.610
9,000 people died.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.470
9,000 people are missing.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.420
So even though you
can forecast, it

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.825
isn't always possible
obviously to save people.

00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:42.430
And that's satellite, which
is looking down from space--

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.640
this is a weather radar.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.056
And here is the difference
again between rain and showers.

00:27:46.056 --> 00:27:48.150
So there's rain, and
there's [INAUDIBLE] showers.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:48.900
Is that all right?

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.300
So radar-- this
isn't a forecast.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.930
Radar sends out radio pulses.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.641
And it's reflected back.

00:27:57.641 --> 00:28:00.050
And it shows you where
your precipitation is.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.099
So use radar if you're going
out for a walk or whatever,

00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:06.350
and you can judge
the weather yourself.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.670
So here is our
rainfall stations.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:14.430
We actually have about
500 rainfall stations now.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:17.380
And it looks like
a map of Ireland.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.290
But it's actually a map
of the annual rainfall.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.513
So most of the rain
occurs at mountains,

00:28:22.513 --> 00:28:25.950
because when the air
comes across the Atlantic,

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.455
it's full of moisture.

00:28:27.455 --> 00:28:29.390
And it can go
through a mountain.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.530
So it rises up, and then
you get precipitation out.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.240
So here is a very wet place--

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.820
very wet.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.460
So these are the mountains.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.460
But look at Dublin.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.290
So if you can read the legend
there, it's between 0 and 600--

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.250
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.902
The annual rainfall in Dublin
at the greater Dublin area

00:28:47.902 --> 00:28:49.790
is just about 800
or 900 millimeters.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.686
So Dublin actually is one of
the driest parts of the country.

00:28:53.686 --> 00:28:56.430
And one of the reasons is
because just south of us we

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.940
have the Wicklow Mountains.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.285
So a lot of our rain comes
in from the Atlantic.

00:29:00.285 --> 00:29:03.670
As it's coming in, the
wind becomes southerly.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.620
So the rain falls
out of the Wicklows.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.883
So especially on the southern
side of the Wicklow Mountains,

00:29:08.883 --> 00:29:12.115
it's a very wet spot.

00:29:12.115 --> 00:29:17.580
And it's hard to read these,
but these are annual sunshine.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.460
So winter-- I just have written
it in rather quickly here.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.660
[INAUDIBLE] sunshine
in the Northwest--

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.896
225.

00:29:23.896 --> 00:29:27.020
So maybe a part of the saying
the sunny side of the East

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.880
[INAUDIBLE] really is true.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.930
In the summer, 600,l but
you know all of the eastern

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.790
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.580
That's again, because
a lot of our weather

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.840
comes in from the
Atlantic, and it's actually

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.115
basically dried out by the
time it gets to the east.

00:29:41.115 --> 00:29:42.860
But we can get very
bad weather in Dublin

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.550
when it's coming
in from the east.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:52.402
So the highest speed ever
is 98 knots [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:52.402 --> 00:29:56.450
And I'm not comparing it to all
around the world [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.950
The highest ever
temperature-- at 33.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.153
Now, back on our
warnings-- what?

00:30:02.153 --> 00:30:04.152
AUDIENCE: So the Europeans
are laughing at the--

00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:04.971
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:04.971 --> 00:30:06.137
EVELYN CUSACK: Yeah, I know.

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:06.689
I know.

00:30:06.689 --> 00:30:08.230
Actually, I'm not
going to talk back.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.460
But we actually issue
weather warnings

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.290
if we expect
temperature of over 27.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.648
So I'm almost delighted to say--

00:30:17.648 --> 00:30:20.980
so we actually issue a
red alert if ti's over 30.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.710
And that's just a
balmy summer's day.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.710
So I won't go back, but you
know the Meteoalarm one.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:34.490
So a red for Ireland is nothing
for the south, for Sicily.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:40.830
So each country, each national
met service, issue warnings

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.340
for their own area
that can affect

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.490
their own citizens relative
to their own types of weather.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.970
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.077
So at what time were you--

00:30:52.077 --> 00:30:53.285
AUDIENCE: Three more minutes.

00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:55.265
EVELYN CUSACK: Three minutes?

00:30:55.265 --> 00:30:57.720
Jeepers, OK, we're going to
zip through the entire time

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.330
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:02.430
So the Earth is 4.5
billion years old.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.130
So there's been loads
of different climates.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.570
At one stage, we think there
was actually a snowball Earth.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:13.170
All of the Earth
was covered in ice.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:17.850
But we're going to zip along now
to about 370 million years ago.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.080
It's very interesting.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.550
Has anyone been to
Valentia Island?

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.800
It's a very interesting place.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.340
You can look at where the first
transatlantic telegraph station

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.130
came in and also these tracks.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.435
It was discovered by a young
geology student from UCD

00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:35.620
in the 1980s.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.280
And they're actually-- you know
we all started off like, well,

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.740
that's bacteria first of all.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.110
We all think we come from eggs.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.490
But in fact, we all
started off as bacteria

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.250
4 billion years ago.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.410
Then we evolved
underneath the sea.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:54.880
And then somehow 370 million
years ago-- well, not suddenly,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.445
of course, we crawled out.

00:31:56.445 --> 00:31:59.010
And the first tracks
of the first tetrapods

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.020
can be seen on Valentia Island.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.600
But at that stage, Ireland
had a lovely, balmy climate--

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.535
beautiful tropical climate.

00:32:08.535 --> 00:32:11.540
But we went through a
series-- actually, just to--

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.140
I don't have a graphic.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.840
You know the way all the
continents of the world

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.770
are all drifting around?

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.720
It's called clay tectonics
where our modern climate really

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.300
wasn't established until
4 million years ago--

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.780
very near.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.020
The age of the Earth is
4.5 billion years ago.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:33.950
But 4 million years
ago, South America

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:37.650
drifted north to create
the Isthmus of Panama.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:41.140
And that cut off the Atlantic
Ocean from the Pacific Ocean.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.000
And that set off
the Gulf Stream.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.420
And that's when our modern
climate was established.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.660
So when you hear all this
thing about global warming

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.850
and, oh, sure, what
are they talking about?

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.600
It was much warmer in the past.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.830
When the dinosaurs roamed the
Earth, it was much more, yes,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.816
we know.

00:32:58.816 --> 00:33:01.070
But when the dinosaurs
roamed the Earth,

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.960
we had one supercontinent
called Pangea.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.620
Basically, the Earth was
one giant desert that

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.370
stretched from pole to pole.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.140
So when we're talking about
climate change at the north,

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:16.246
it's really only in relation
to the last 4 million years.

00:33:16.246 --> 00:33:20.360
And we get a good information
about the climate of that time

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.620
from the ice cores in
Antarctica essentially.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.710
But the last ice age
ended 12,000 years ago.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.870
And really, that's when
our modern civilizations

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.090
has taken off--

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.920
mathematics, literature,
drawing, art, et cetera.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:43.000
And in fact, in 1859, an Irish
man there-- he looks cute--

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.930
John Tyndall.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:49.900
He actually a lot of why
the sky is blue and first

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.355
described global warming.

00:33:51.355 --> 00:33:57.050
He predicted it in 1859,
which is quite shocking really

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.094
that it was so long ago.

00:33:59.094 --> 00:34:00.970
Some possible climate
change for Ireland.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.053
We're not sure, obviously.

00:34:02.053 --> 00:34:03.235
It hasn't happened yet.

00:34:03.235 --> 00:34:06.150
But a sea level rise
looks pretty definite,

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.919
because the sea temperatures
are increasing a lot.

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.460
And when you increase
the temperature

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.501
of the sea, what happens?

00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:14.690
The molecules start
vibrating more,

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.820
and they get further apart.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.350
And then physically,
the sea expands.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.480
You get more evaporation
then, because when

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.690
the sun shines on the sea,
it gives the water molecules

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:25.620
more energy.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.754
And some of them evaporate.

00:34:26.754 --> 00:34:29.219
So you do get more clouds,
perhaps more precipitation,

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.129
and a higher sea level.

00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:34.110
That's unequivocal.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.800
How it will affect the
weather systems as such

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.929
is more problematic,
because the weather

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:42.380
is a very complicated system.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.179
I'll [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.159
It doesn't matter.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:49.550
But this is a temperature chart
from 1900 to 2015 or something.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.489
And it's a global temperature.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:56.415
There's quite a dip there, but
it has been steadily rising.

00:34:56.415 --> 00:34:59.510
And Ireland is part
of that trend .

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.510
And you can read more
about it on our website,

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.670
and the Royal Irish
Academy Professor Ray Bates

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.271
is one of the world's
leaders in that.

00:35:09.271 --> 00:35:11.800
But even though the climate
is getting warmer, of course,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.320
we get colder interludes.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.816
And does anyone remember that?

00:35:14.816 --> 00:35:17.744
That was only 2010.

00:35:17.744 --> 00:35:19.980
And there was a frost
and icing in Dublin,

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.570
even in the urban heat island.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.720
I'm going to end with
this Hubble picture

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.840
just because I like it.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.820
So where Ireland, or
the world, the Earth

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:35.330
is in our own solar system,
we have one little sun.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.480
And we're literally the
third rock from the sun.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.620
And we say we're in
the Goldilocks zone,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.280
because we have
developed in this zone.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.390
So our solar system
is just belonging

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:54.510
to one star in maybe 200
billion stars in our own galaxy.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.230
And then looking out, there is--

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.730
I don't know--
billions and billions

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:02.140
or 100 billion galaxies
that we know of out there.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.350
So with all of this
knowledge, the latest thinking

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.675
from cosmologists
is that we've heard

00:36:09.675 --> 00:36:11.480
of dark matter and dark energy.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.176
And everything we can see--
all the physical things we can

00:36:14.176 --> 00:36:15.410
see--

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.910
only 5% of the
observable Universe.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.520
So we don't [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.456
So that's why I have to say--
young people of the world-- we

00:36:27.456 --> 00:36:30.950
need you to study science,
maths, everything-- et cetera.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.600
So that's my little
homily ending.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.096
So these are some of the
little slides that we used.

00:36:37.096 --> 00:36:39.500
And thank you for
your attention.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.210
And I am showing this,
because it's very unusual.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.044
This is a visual
satellite of Ireland.

00:36:46.044 --> 00:36:47.932
You can actually see Ireland.

00:36:47.932 --> 00:36:50.937
Now, there isn't a yellow
line around Ireland.

00:36:50.937 --> 00:36:52.270
[INAUDIBLE] picturing one group.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.278
Let's put it on afterwards,
because a lot of the time,

00:36:55.278 --> 00:36:56.922
Ireland is covered in clouds.

00:36:56.922 --> 00:36:59.590
So we just-- we can see
the outline in the yellow.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.635
So this is very unusual.

00:37:01.635 --> 00:37:02.944
When was it?

00:37:02.944 --> 00:37:05.656
2015-- April-- hmm.

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:08.710
And this white stuff here
actually isn't cloud.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.490
Well, it is cloud.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.016
It's sea fog.

00:37:11.016 --> 00:37:14.920
What we define fog is
a cloud with no legs.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.020
So I think that's it.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:16.790
Oh, yeah.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.666
I have one more.

00:37:19.666 --> 00:37:21.040
In case you were
going to ask me.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.368
Nobody asked me, is it
going to be a nice summer?

00:37:23.368 --> 00:37:26.642
And animals and plants can't
predict weather, all right?

00:37:26.642 --> 00:37:29.258
Although I know you guys
wouldn't think that.

00:37:29.258 --> 00:37:31.950
Would you like me to
give you some homework?

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:35.230
So has anyone watched "Cosmos"?

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.370
Yeah, OK, so when I was growing
up, Carl Sagan on the right--

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:42.941
he's my hero, who is an
American professor of physics.

00:37:42.941 --> 00:37:47.886
And he started off [INAUDIBLE]
science communication.

00:37:47.886 --> 00:37:50.596
And you can get his
series on YouTube.

00:37:50.596 --> 00:37:53.512
The graphics are
kind of cute now.

00:37:53.512 --> 00:37:57.705
But if you just listen
to him, he's amazing.

00:37:57.705 --> 00:38:00.040
And it's just been
remade recently

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.279
by Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.820
So it's certainly
worth the time when

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.445
you're finished
watching "Breaking Bad"

00:38:04.445 --> 00:38:05.957
or whatever you guys watch.

00:38:05.957 --> 00:38:07.790
And here's some nice,
light reading for you.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.694
OK, thank you very much.

00:38:09.694 --> 00:38:11.598
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:16.834
JAMES MORRIS: Hi, how are you?

00:38:16.834 --> 00:38:18.585
I'm James Morris.

00:38:18.585 --> 00:38:21.515
[INAUDIBLE], if you haven't.

00:38:21.515 --> 00:38:22.390
I am one of you guys.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.490
I'm a googler.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.870
And my job is brilliantly
affected by what

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.200
you see outside in the water.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.497
I work for the data
center in Dublin.

00:38:29.497 --> 00:38:31.580
And we're the only data
center in the global fleet

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.888
that depend on [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:34.888 --> 00:38:36.340
Would you look out there?

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.580
You see the clouds.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.840
It's not too hot.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.765
It's not too cold.

00:38:39.765 --> 00:38:41.730
We've [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:44.145
This is exactly what we need--

00:38:44.145 --> 00:38:45.600
exactly what we need.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.302
All right?

00:38:46.302 --> 00:38:50.107
[INAUDIBLE] to cool the data
center, we open the window.

00:38:50.107 --> 00:38:51.940
To check the weather,
we stick our hand out.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.290
If it's get wet, it's raining.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.764
If it gets cold, it's windy--
not fully true, all right?

00:38:56.764 --> 00:38:58.180
We use what's
called air handlers.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.670
And we have air side cooling.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.615
So every data
center in the fleet

00:39:02.615 --> 00:39:05.760
uses cooling towers, which
consume a huge amount of water

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.380
for cooling air, all right?

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.590
[INAUDIBLE] there and
are pretty much steady,

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.660
ambient temperature
all year round.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.810
We suck cold air
into the big fans

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.270
in the side of the building
into the data center floor.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.360
All right?

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.824
Any idea of what the temperature
of the data center floor is?

00:39:21.824 --> 00:39:22.920
Any guesses?

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.741
AUDIENCE: 12 Celsius?

00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:25.824
JAMES MORRIS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:26.365
AUDIENCE: 15?

00:39:26.365 --> 00:39:28.730
JAMES MORRIS: Someone has
been to the data center.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.165
It's at 27.

00:39:30.165 --> 00:39:31.170
AUDIENCE: 27 what?

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.300
JAMES MORRIS: 27 degrees?

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.952
That's the ambient temperature
inside the data hall.

00:39:34.952 --> 00:39:35.910
EVELYN CUSACK: Celsius?

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.270
JAMES MORRIS: Celsius.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.520
EVELYN CUSACK: Orange warning.

00:39:40.662 --> 00:39:42.409
JAMES MORRIS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:42.409 --> 00:39:44.450
We need technicians to
work at the Eastern Shores

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.870
for data center
floor and all that.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:46.370
All right?

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.180
So the building
is designed to run

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.836
at a fairly warm
temperatures we have

00:39:49.836 --> 00:39:53.274
that's most efficient, which
means that this is perfect.

00:39:53.274 --> 00:39:55.340
At times, this weather
is actually is even

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.450
too cold for what we want.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.160
And we recirculate
the waste hot air

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.240
from the rack of servers
out to the air handlers,

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.300
mix it with cold air coming in,
and control our temperatures.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.082
And we have what's called a BMS,
a Building Management System,

00:40:07.082 --> 00:40:09.585
which automatically keeps the
temperature at the set point.

00:40:09.585 --> 00:40:12.772
So it's set pressure--
roughly a set humidity,

00:40:12.772 --> 00:40:14.563
but we're not too
concerned about humidity,

00:40:14.563 --> 00:40:16.690
and it's set at
winter at 27 degrees.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:17.190
All right?

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.830
So if you look out
and say, oh, god,

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.260
I hate the weather in
Ireland, I want to go back

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.242
to where I come from--

00:40:21.242 --> 00:40:23.697
I want to go to Spain--
whatever-- this is perfect.

00:40:23.697 --> 00:40:24.540
This is boring.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.130
And as Ben Treynor, one of the
top guys in Google always says,

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:29.530
boring is good.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.460
This is good for us.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.320
All right?

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.308
EVELYN CUSACK:
[INAUDIBLE] boring.

00:40:33.308 --> 00:40:34.474
JAMES MORRIS: Irish weather.

00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:35.452
Irish weather.

00:40:35.452 --> 00:40:38.005
OK, so you want to
start Q&amp;A, all right?

00:40:38.005 --> 00:40:39.380
I want to ask the
first question.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.070
I think it's a very
important question.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.736
Evelyn, you said that
animals and plants

00:40:42.736 --> 00:40:44.196
can't predict the weather.

00:40:44.196 --> 00:40:46.586
Can postmen in New Zealand
predict the weather?

00:40:46.586 --> 00:40:48.065
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:48.065 --> 00:40:49.550
EVELYN CUSACK: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.990
Do you really want me to answer?

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.966
Can I sit here?

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.480
No, because if they
could, as I said,

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.000
we would use their forecasts,
especially [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.120
Animals and plants respond
to current conditions.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.272
The weather that hits Ireland
in five days time, or in 10 days

00:41:08.272 --> 00:41:10.614
time, doesn't exist yet.

00:41:10.614 --> 00:41:12.530
The weather that hit
Ireland in five days time

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.940
is usually at the other side
of the Atlantic [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.230
So animals can't possibly know.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:20.410
How could they?

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:23.735
Think logically.

00:41:23.735 --> 00:41:24.830
JAMES MORRIS:
Hollywood design then?

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.413
EVELYN CUSACK:
Hollywood design, yeah.

00:41:26.413 --> 00:41:29.292
And plants actually respond
to current conditions

00:41:29.292 --> 00:41:32.220
as well and growing conditions.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.185
So when I was growing up,
there was a saying, oh,

00:41:36.185 --> 00:41:39.110
if the trees, or the
bushes, the hedgerows,

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.170
have a lot of berries, it
means Mother Nature is looking

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.600
after the little birdies, and
it's going to be a hard winter.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.540
We'll know.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.832
Mother Nature is pretty
cruel essentially,

00:41:50.832 --> 00:41:53.290
because at the moment, there
is thousands of little birdies

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.790
been eaten alive, aren't they?

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.250
So Mother Nature-- sorry,
it's for your lunch.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.942
Mother Nature isn't looking
out for little birdies.

00:42:01.942 --> 00:42:03.400
The reason there's
a lot of berries

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.093
on the trees, et
cetera, is because it

00:42:05.093 --> 00:42:06.735
was a very good growth season.

00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:11.041
The spring was very good-- so
sorry to burst your bubble.

00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:13.040
JAMES MORRIS: OK, so we'll
open it to the floor.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.240
Has anybody any questions?

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.130
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.050
Shout if you want.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.450
So I actually used the
word yesterday [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.707
Irish phrase that we always
say, red sky at night,

00:42:27.707 --> 00:42:28.498
shepherd's delight.

00:42:28.498 --> 00:42:30.818
Red sky in the morning,
shepherd's warning,

00:42:30.818 --> 00:42:33.636
meaning if it's red at night,
[INAUDIBLE] the next day,

00:42:33.636 --> 00:42:34.523
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:34.523 --> 00:42:35.564
Is there any truth to it?

00:42:35.564 --> 00:42:37.940
EVELYN CUSACK: Well,
there is a little bit.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.260
But it doesn't always work.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.526
So it's pretty useless then.

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:47.990
But there was a lovely
red sky yesterday morning.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:51.420
So we actually said in
the weather office, ooh,

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.080
all the shepherd's
would be worried,

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.070
but we know it's
not going to rain.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:00.080
So there is some truth to it.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.120
It's to do with
the weather coming

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.030
in from the west and all that.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.275
There's sort of truth.

00:43:06.275 --> 00:43:11.010
But being serious, if you
go back 100 years, 50 years,

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.450
there's no such thing
as weather forecasts.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.460
So people had to use--

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.950
not science or nature.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.820
That always sounds like
science and nature.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.440
But to try and
judge the weather--

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.612
so sometimes it is a sign
that fine weather is coming in

00:43:26.612 --> 00:43:28.542
or wet weather is coming in.

00:43:28.542 --> 00:43:29.042
Yeah?

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.581
AUDIENCE: Is there
rationale for sunny Monday

00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:37.445
through Friday
and rainy weekend?

00:43:37.445 --> 00:43:41.220
EVELYN CUSACK: Well, we
actually have that saying--

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.270
rain is brought on by
bank holiday weekends.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:50.980
Yeah, and the fine weather
occurs during the [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:51.590
So, yeah.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.480
No, there's no rationale at all.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.401
I take if we're working
Monday to Friday,

00:44:00.401 --> 00:44:01.900
we don't notice the
weather so much.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.441
And then you want to go out on
the weekend, and it's raining,

00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:06.015
you really notice that usually--

00:44:06.015 --> 00:44:08.502
doesn't rain very
much in Dublin anyway.

00:44:08.502 --> 00:44:10.237
Did I tell you the
weather is good?

00:44:10.237 --> 00:44:10.736
Huh?

00:44:10.736 --> 00:44:11.652
AUDIENCE: It's lovely.

00:44:11.652 --> 00:44:14.390
EVELYN CUSACK: It's lovely.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.970
Does everyone here
work in Dublin?

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.250
If you were over in
Donegal or Galway,

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.950
it is very beautiful there.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.350
But it rains three,
four five times as much.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.060
AUDIENCE: In terms of the
warnings that you issue.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.410
That only started
last year [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:34.264
EVELYN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:44:34.264 --> 00:44:38.030
AUDIENCE: It seems that you
err on the side of issuing

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:41.245
a warning rather than not
issuing a warning [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:44.559
It always seems like always a
warning, and then [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:45.850
EVELYN CUSACK: Nothing happens.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the weather anyway.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.260
But, yeah, nothing
happens there.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.860
It's not as bad as it appears.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.693
EVELYN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.828
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
agents are [INAUDIBLE] that.

00:44:57.828 --> 00:45:01.850
And it wasn't quite
as bad as I imagined.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.930
EVELYN CUSACK: No,
I suppose it varies.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:07.410
Generally the worst of
the winter-- the West

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.000
and the Northwest-- the storms
are tracking it that way.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.740
So if we had an orange
warning out for Dublin--

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.760
I think we did actually.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.145
I can't remember.

00:45:17.145 --> 00:45:22.210
The thing about wind
is that some areas--

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.125
we're confined to a county.

00:45:24.125 --> 00:45:26.200
So some areas can
get it stronger

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.660
than others, because you
get effects with wind.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.930
So I don't know that we--

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:34.335
we shouldn't err on
the side of caution.

00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:36.950
But at some place
in the county, we

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:40.666
would hope that those
strong winds would occur--

00:45:40.666 --> 00:45:42.850
not hope, predict.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.210
So I'm sorry about
your experience.

00:45:48.424 --> 00:45:49.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:49.876
EVELYN CUSACK: No, no, no.

00:45:49.876 --> 00:45:50.375
That's fine.

00:45:50.375 --> 00:45:52.640
But do be careful, because
I'm a cyclist myself.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.620
And you can get that-- shhh,
yeah, where did that come from?

00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.400
So, obviously, if there
is an orange warning out,

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:04.550
it is probably going to
hopefully windy at some stage.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.121
So it may not be when
you cycle in the morning.

00:46:07.121 --> 00:46:08.564
But it might be in the evening.

00:46:08.564 --> 00:46:09.530
So just be careful.

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:11.600
But in my experience,
the forecasts

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.780
have improved enormously.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.030
And one of the reasons--
well, not one of the reasons.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:19.300
The reason is that our
meteorological models

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.490
have improved
enormously due to better

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:25.110
modeling of the atmosphere
and increased computing power.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.962
But as I said, there
probably will be a limit.

00:46:27.962 --> 00:46:31.090
But our [INAUDIBLE] and
high-resolution models

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:34.331
we're working towards
a 1 kilometer grid,

00:46:34.331 --> 00:46:36.543
so maybe in the next
five years or so that

00:46:36.543 --> 00:46:37.930
will improve even further.

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:40.090
But there's always going
to be uncertainties.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:41.930
And what's really
kind of annoying--

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.385
Ireland is such a small country.

00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:46.260
But it's not that we
have different climates,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.570
but because of the
mountains and that,

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.800
as you saw in that
rainfall chart--

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.367
a lot of the time, we're,
as forecasters talk

00:46:53.367 --> 00:46:55.320
about rain coming in
from the Atlantic,

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.620
and it's [INAUDIBLE] eastwards.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.480
But you saw there
how dry Dublin is.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.400
The Wicklow Mountains take a
lot of the rain from Dublin.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.010
So really Dublin should
have its own forecast.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.478
But if I can't mention
Dublin on TV at night--

00:47:11.456 --> 00:47:12.445
I'd just be shot.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:20.185
On the lee side
of the mountains,

00:47:20.185 --> 00:47:23.990
it's going to be dryer,
because the windward side takes

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:25.090
the rain.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.635
But it just so happens that
Dublin, a million and a half

00:47:28.635 --> 00:47:34.280
people, live on the lee side
of the Wicklow Mountains.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.890
And it is very dry here.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.715
So really we're
right all the time.

00:47:37.715 --> 00:47:40.095
It's just Dublin.

00:47:40.095 --> 00:47:41.178
JAMES MORRIS: Anyone else?

00:47:43.992 --> 00:47:45.314
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:47:45.314 --> 00:47:46.605
Have you ever met Michael Fish?

00:47:46.605 --> 00:47:49.696
And have you ever had
a Michael Fish moment?

00:47:49.696 --> 00:47:54.852
EVELYN CUSACK: Well, not yet,
but I think Michael passed away

00:47:54.852 --> 00:47:56.060
during the summer, didn't he?

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:56.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.580
EVELYN CUSACK: No,
but I haven't met him.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.680
I go over to the met office.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.900
We do collaborate a lot.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.766
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:07.958 --> 00:48:10.007
Have I had a
Michael Fish moment?

00:48:10.007 --> 00:48:12.090
Well, I've often given
totally incorrect forecasts

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:13.090
unfortunately--

00:48:16.042 --> 00:48:18.370
nothing huge as yet.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.540
But each day is a new day.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.090
And doing live broadcasting--

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:25.930
I always figure the
worst has happened

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.430
or anything that can
happen has happened.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.160
But there's always something
new to surprise me.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.150
For example, last
year or the year

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.720
before, I was literally
doing my live broadcast

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.078
after the 9 o' clock news.

00:48:39.078 --> 00:48:41.420
And suddenly, the lights
went out in the studio.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.156
And I know it seems stupid.

00:48:44.156 --> 00:48:46.780
I should have known that people
actually couldn't see anything.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.830
Or maybe it's television.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:48.705
They couldn't see it.

00:48:48.705 --> 00:48:49.380
I can't see it.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.255
That was just stupid.

00:48:50.255 --> 00:48:51.880
But I just kept doing it anyway.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.060
And then I ran
around afterwards.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.439
Who turned off the lights?

00:48:55.439 --> 00:48:57.855
And somebody actually turned
the lights off in the studio.

00:48:57.855 --> 00:49:00.764
And he said, I thought
you were finished.

00:49:00.764 --> 00:49:04.064
Did you look at the television?

00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:04.980
And then another time.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.600
For example, I
dropped the flicker.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.020
And then I actually
did pick it up.

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:13.944
Because we had to move
it on like, you know--

00:49:13.944 --> 00:49:16.304
drop it.

00:49:16.304 --> 00:49:19.690
And literally, we
don't have radio mics.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.390
So there's a mic hanging on.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.930
So I'm just waiting for
when I trip over it.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:24.890
I shouldn't say that.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.040
It's going to happen.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.910
Very early on in my career, I
was on a program, an afternoon

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.630
show, telling the weather.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.866
And there was a veterinary
slot afterwards following.

00:49:36.866 --> 00:49:39.104
And they had swans
in the studio.

00:49:39.104 --> 00:49:42.942
The swan went berserk.

00:49:42.942 --> 00:49:44.770
So that was fun.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:47.700
But he didn't actually come
in and gouge my eyes out.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.140
JAMES MORRIS: OK, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.511
One more question.

00:49:51.511 --> 00:49:54.573
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:54.573 --> 00:49:55.992
I looked at the
[INAUDIBLE] later

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:59.462
[INAUDIBLE], and as
you said, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:59.462 --> 00:50:01.394
What I did notice
[INAUDIBLE] west

00:50:01.394 --> 00:50:02.843
will be waiting
for ages to hear.

00:50:02.843 --> 00:50:04.292
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:06.115
And I've just
started this course.

00:50:06.115 --> 00:50:09.576
Would [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:09.576 --> 00:50:11.450
EVELYN CUSACK: It might
have something, yeah.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:12.741
AUDIENCE: If you're expecting--

00:50:12.741 --> 00:50:13.770
[INAUDIBLE] 15 minutes.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:17.890
EVELYN CUSACK: Yeah, it's
really annoying for me

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:18.740
as a meteorologist.

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.790
So it's really nice if
you have a rain in Dublin,

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.610
because if it doesn't
rain in Dublin,

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.406
it feels as if the
forecast is wrong.

00:50:25.406 --> 00:50:28.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:31.530
I think it's actually what
[INAUDIBLE] three days

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:34.676
and not rain, but we will
think of the weather being

00:50:34.676 --> 00:50:37.010
bad [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.860
EVELYN CUSACK: Yeah, but I
think if you're a cyclist,

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.320
you can increase it.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.608
There is few mornings it's
actually raining, isn't it?

00:50:43.608 --> 00:50:45.775
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], but
especially this winter.

00:50:45.775 --> 00:50:48.150
EVELYN CUSACK: This winter is
really incredible, yeah, so

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.841
far.

00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:52.125
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
this week [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:52.125 --> 00:50:53.705
Dublin gets cold.

00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:54.830
EVELYN CUSACK: So the wind?

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:56.720
EVELYN CUSACK: Oh, yeah,
so leave the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.350
So maybe this is status orange.

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:01.550
It's true [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:07.696
Yeah, the heat could cause it
literally to evaporate as it--

00:51:07.696 --> 00:51:08.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.890
EVELYN CUSACK: The rain
could be falling down,

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.050
and then the heat will
cause it to evaporate.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:13.067
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:13.067 --> 00:51:13.900
EVELYN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.350
So Dublin is one of the
driest and warmest parts

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.102
of the country.

00:51:18.102 --> 00:51:21.569
So welcome to our world.

00:51:21.569 --> 00:51:24.110
JAMES MORRIS: I just want to
end it with two small questions.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.960
So when I told my sons I was
coming today to meet Evelyn,

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.960
they were very excited.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.000
My 11 year old--
his name is Ewan.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.380
I confirm Storm
Ewan has started.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:30.822
EVELYN CUSACK: Oh!

00:51:30.822 --> 00:51:31.697
SPEAKER 2: All right?

00:51:31.697 --> 00:51:32.849
It's well underway till 12.

00:51:32.849 --> 00:51:33.640
It's getting worse.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.712
EVELYN CUSACK: Oh, gosh.

00:51:34.712 --> 00:51:36.920
SPEAKER 2: He asked me the
question every child asks,

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.916
all right?

00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:39.124
What's your favorite weather?

00:51:39.124 --> 00:51:42.090
EVELYN CUSACK: What's
my favorite weather?

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:42.910
OK.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:48.760
22 degrees-- sunny sky--

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.650
maybe a little bit of cumulus--
you have the [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.900
"Simpsons" cumulus--

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:57.112
just maybe a little bit-- and
a gentle breeze of about 7

00:51:57.112 --> 00:51:59.250
knots--

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:02.690
and a glass of Chablis--

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:06.629
maybe fried hocks.

00:52:06.629 --> 00:52:09.170
JAMES MORRIS: And finally, my
nine-year-old son, Devin, never

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:10.640
looks at the weather-- couldn't
care less about the weather,

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.630
all right?

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.270
But he does watch the "Late,
Late Toy Show" on repeat

00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:16.550
for about six months
into the year every year

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:20.034
and wanted to know what it
was like to be on [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:20.034 --> 00:52:22.200
EVELYN CUSACK: Well, it was
a great privilege for me

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.699
to be asked.

00:52:22.699 --> 00:52:26.210
So this little boy
made a weather game.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.850
And he wanted to meet
a weather person.

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.250
And so I was asked on.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.170
So it was kind of scary.

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.750
But yeah, it was
a great privilege,

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.450
because it is the most
watched program followed,

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:40.970
of course, by the weather.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.418
So yeah, it was very nice, yeah.

00:52:42.418 --> 00:52:44.418
JAMES MORRIS: We actually
watched it last night.

00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:45.920
It was little Johnny from Ennis.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.560
EVELYN CUSACK: Little
Johnny [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.500
JAMES MORRIS: And the
game was [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.800
EVELYN CUSACK: Yeah,
and he gave me a copy.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.160
But I had actually mentioned
before, because sometimes I

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.396
give talks around the country.

00:52:54.396 --> 00:52:56.150
And he actually came to my talk.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.870
His mother emailed me for it--

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:00.235
would it be OK to bring him?

00:53:00.235 --> 00:53:02.610
Because he was only nine, and
he had school the next day.

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:04.160
I said, yeah, bring him out.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.627
Just bring out a pillow,
a duvet in the car,

00:53:07.627 --> 00:53:09.210
so he can fall asleep
on the way home.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:09.842
So he did come.

00:53:09.842 --> 00:53:12.500
So that was nice.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:17.206
JAMES MORRIS: OK, so on behalf
of Google and [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:17.206 --> 00:53:19.142
Thank you very
much for your time.

00:53:19.142 --> 00:53:20.110
EVELYN CUSACK: Oh,
thanks for having me

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:20.594
It's lovely to meet you.

00:53:20.594 --> 00:53:22.385
JAMES MORRIS: I hope
everybody enjoyed it .

00:53:22.385 --> 00:53:23.982
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.770
EVELYN CUSACK: [INAUDIBLE]
thank you very much.

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:32.900
And keep following [INAUDIBLE]
weather, all right?

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.902
Don't forget-- oh, we are
issuing a new app in summer,

00:53:35.902 --> 00:53:36.874
so hopefully--

00:53:36.874 --> 00:53:41.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.110
Thank you.
