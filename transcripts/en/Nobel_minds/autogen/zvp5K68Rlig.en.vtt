00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's just not healthy and and I think
 

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.090 align:start position:0%
it's just not healthy and and I think
also<00:12:47.160><c> I</c><00:12:47.550><c> mean</c><00:12:48.060><c> human</c><00:12:48.330><c> nature</c><00:12:48.660><c> has</c><00:12:49.100><c> developed</c>

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
also I mean human nature has developed
 

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.490 align:start position:0%
also I mean human nature has developed

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.190 align:start position:0%
some requirements for particular things
so<00:12:52.830><c> I</c><00:12:52.860><c> think</c><00:12:53.010><c> meat</c><00:12:53.400><c> as</c><00:12:53.610><c> part</c><00:12:53.940><c> of</c><00:12:54.060><c> it</c><00:12:54.270><c> I</c><00:12:54.510><c> mean</c><00:12:55.110><c> we</c>

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
so I think meat as part of it I mean we
 

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.380 align:start position:0%

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:51.390 align:start position:0%
will be by certain that case what will
 

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.060 align:start position:0%
will be by certain that case what will
have<00:40:51.600><c> risen</c><00:40:51.840><c> and</c><00:40:52.350><c> this</c><00:40:52.590><c> is</c><00:40:52.740><c> the</c><00:40:52.859><c> biggest</c>

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.070 align:start position:0%
have risen and this is the biggest
 

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.890 align:start position:0%
have risen and this is the biggest
problem<00:40:53.310><c> I</c><00:40:53.609><c> think</c><00:40:53.850><c> you</c><00:40:54.450><c> have</c><00:40:54.570><c> to</c><00:40:54.660><c> play</c>

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
problem I think you have to play
 

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.170 align:start position:0%
problem I think you have to play
something<00:40:55.320><c> about</c><00:40:55.500><c> the</c><00:40:55.680><c> population</c><00:40:56.180><c> increase</c>

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
something about the population increase
 

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
something about the population increase
yeah<00:40:57.750><c> and</c><00:40:57.930><c> we</c><00:40:58.260><c> cannot</c><00:40:58.560><c> I</c><00:40:58.710><c> mean</c><00:40:58.859><c> the</c><00:40:58.950><c> planet</c><00:40:59.340><c> is</c>

00:40:59.480 --> 00:40:59.490 align:start position:0%
yeah and we cannot I mean the planet is
 

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.090 align:start position:0%
yeah and we cannot I mean the planet is
full<00:40:59.820><c> yeah</c><00:41:00.330><c> and</c><00:41:00.540><c> the</c><00:41:00.960><c> country</c><00:41:01.290><c> is</c><00:41:01.410><c> taken</c><00:41:01.859><c> and</c>

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
full yeah and the country is taken and
 

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
full yeah and the country is taken and
this<00:41:02.460><c> is</c><00:41:02.609><c> I</c><00:41:02.880><c> would</c><00:41:03.630><c> like</c><00:41:03.840><c> to</c><00:41:04.050><c> I</c><00:41:04.290><c> think</c><00:41:04.830><c> it's</c>

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.130 align:start position:0%
this is I would like to I think it's
 

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:06.710 align:start position:0%
this is I would like to I think it's
really<00:41:05.550><c> important</c><00:41:05.970><c> also</c><00:41:06.119><c> to</c><00:41:06.240><c> think</c><00:41:06.540><c> about</c>

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
really important also to think about
 

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
really important also to think about
agricultural<00:41:07.380><c> development</c><00:41:07.950><c> because</c><00:41:08.790><c> the</c>

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:08.970 align:start position:0%
agricultural development because the
 

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.540 align:start position:0%
agricultural development because the
land<00:41:09.180><c> is</c><00:41:09.420><c> limited</c><00:41:10.050><c> we</c><00:41:10.410><c> cannot</c><00:41:10.800><c> break</c><00:41:11.280><c> we</c>

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:11.550 align:start position:0%
land is limited we cannot break we
 

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.870 align:start position:0%
land is limited we cannot break we
cannot<00:41:11.850><c> increase</c><00:41:12.180><c> the</c><00:41:13.020><c> deformable</c><00:41:13.880><c> country</c>

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
cannot increase the deformable country
 

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.020 align:start position:0%
cannot increase the deformable country
inside<00:41:15.330><c> so</c><00:41:16.200><c> we</c><00:41:16.230><c> have</c><00:41:16.560><c> to</c><00:41:16.740><c> learn</c><00:41:16.890><c> how</c><00:41:16.950><c> to</c><00:41:17.250><c> I</c><00:41:17.820><c> mean</c>

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:18.030 align:start position:0%
inside so we have to learn how to I mean
 

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.540 align:start position:0%
inside so we have to learn how to I mean
we<00:41:18.480><c> have</c><00:41:18.630><c> some</c><00:41:19.020><c> people</c><00:41:19.470><c> this</c><00:41:19.710><c> morning</c><00:41:19.920><c> except</c>

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:20.550 align:start position:0%
we have some people this morning except
 

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:23.690 align:start position:0%
we have some people this morning except
we<00:41:20.940><c> shouldn't</c><00:41:21.210><c> always</c><00:41:21.830><c> set</c><00:41:22.830><c> on</c><00:41:22.980><c> yield</c><00:41:23.310><c> but</c><00:41:23.520><c> on</c>

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't always set on yield but on
 

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.370 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't always set on yield but on
quality<00:41:24.180><c> I</c><00:41:24.359><c> mean</c><00:41:24.540><c> we</c><00:41:24.660><c> cannot</c><00:41:24.869><c> afford</c><00:41:25.020><c> it</c>

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
quality I mean we cannot afford it
 

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.070 align:start position:0%
quality I mean we cannot afford it
actually<00:41:25.770><c> we</c><00:41:25.830><c> need</c><00:41:26.130><c> that</c><00:41:26.970><c> the</c><00:41:27.210><c> high</c><00:41:27.359><c> yields</c><00:41:27.840><c> in</c>

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
actually we need that the high yields in
 

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.900 align:start position:0%
actually we need that the high yields in
order<00:41:28.410><c> to</c><00:41:28.560><c> be</c><00:41:29.010><c> able</c><00:41:29.130><c> to</c><00:41:29.400><c> and</c><00:41:29.580><c> you</c><00:41:29.640><c> know</c><00:41:29.670><c> what</c>

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:29.910 align:start position:0%
order to be able to and you know what
 

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
order to be able to and you know what
I'm<00:41:30.180><c> optimistic</c><00:41:30.540><c> so</c><00:41:31.020><c> I</c><00:41:31.080><c> think</c><00:41:31.380><c> with</c><00:41:31.560><c> all</c><00:41:31.590><c> this</c>

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:31.890 align:start position:0%
I'm optimistic so I think with all this
 

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.910 align:start position:0%
I'm optimistic so I think with all this
knowledge<00:41:32.130><c> we've</c><00:41:32.490><c> got</c><00:41:32.670><c> now</c><00:41:32.880><c> and</c><00:41:33.150><c> with</c><00:41:33.960><c> us</c><00:41:34.170><c> it</c>

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge we've got now and with us it
 

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.900 align:start position:0%
knowledge we've got now and with us it
goes<00:41:35.310><c> from</c><00:41:35.700><c> the</c><00:41:36.119><c> UN</c><00:41:36.480><c> we</c><00:41:37.200><c> can</c><00:41:37.410><c> out</c><00:41:37.590><c> you</c><00:41:37.920><c> don't</c>

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:38.910 align:start position:0%
goes from the UN we can out you don't
 

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.970 align:start position:0%
goes from the UN we can out you don't
get<00:41:39.090><c> many</c><00:41:39.450><c> of</c><00:41:39.720><c> those</c><00:41:39.869><c> issues</c><00:41:40.109><c> at</c><00:41:40.440><c> the</c><00:41:40.500><c> same</c>

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%

00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
time you are not one by one so we may be
 

00:41:43.859 --> 00:41:45.530 align:start position:0%
time you are not one by one so we may be
