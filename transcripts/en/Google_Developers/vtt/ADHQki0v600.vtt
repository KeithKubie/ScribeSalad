MARY HIMINKOOL: Hi.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.295
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:10.300
Good morning and welcome to day
three of Google I/O. Hope

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.390
you've had an amazing
time so far.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.550
We are delighted to have you
with us this morning for our

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.880
panel, "Designing for the Other
Half: Sexy Isn't Always

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.740
Pink." My name is Mary
Himinkool, and I'm the head of

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.220
Global Entrepreneurship
Outreach at Google.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.530
Our team looks after all of
Google's partnerships and

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.630
programs around the world
to support startups and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.790
entrepreneurs, and we feel very
privileged to work with

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.290
and learn from so many amazing

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.710
entrepreneurs around the world.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.600
We have five of them
with us here today.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.740
And today we're going to explore
a discussion of really

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.010
how to build amazing products
that resonate with both women

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.360
and men, how to scale and start
great companies, how to

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.620
build community, really an
analysis of the business and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950
product landscape and
opportunities

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.290
around women as well.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.710
So I'd like to start
by introducing

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.680
my fantastic panelists.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.370
First we have Tracy Chou,
who is with Pinterest.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.850
And Tracy is a back-end

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.330
software engineer at Pinterest.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.140
She was previously at Quora,
where she was an early

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.370
engineer there.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.050
She's also had roles at both
Facebook and Google.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.680
Tracy studied at Stanford where
she earned her BS in

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.190
Electrical Engineering and her
Master's in Computer Science.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.970
We also have Leah Busque, who is
the founder of TaskRabbit.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.500
Since its founding in 2008, Leah
has scaled TaskRabbit to

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.890
over 45 employees, and the
services live in eight

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.350
different cities.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.870
Prior to that, Leah was a
software engineer at IBM, and

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.520
she's been recognized as one
of the 100 most creative

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.530
people in business by Fast
Company, and also one of the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.495
15 women to watch by
Inc. Magazine.

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:45.310
So we're thrilled to
have her with us.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.450
Next to me here is
Margaret Wallace.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.000
Margaret is an active
entrepreneur in the gaming,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.160
technology, and media sectors.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
She is the CEO of Playmatics,
which is a New York-based

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.170
company focused on rich social
gaming experiences.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.300
And before Playmatics,
Margaret was the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.470
CEO of Rebel Monkey.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.500
She's also spent time at
Shockwave.com, at PF.Magic, at

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.560
Mattel and Mindscape.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.420
And she recently created a
very cool game last year,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.110
which is a shadow government
game that lets users run their

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.726
own version of a virtual
version of the US.

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:22.290
We're also excited to have
Jess Lee, who is the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.200
co-founder and CEO of Polyvore,
which was voted one

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.990
of Fast Company's 50 most
innovative companies in 2012.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.030
Before that, Jess worked at
Google, where she was the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.270
product manager for
Google Maps.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.170
And she has a Bachelor's
in Computer

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.820
Science from Stanford.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.520
Jess is also a very talented
artist, and she's an avid

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520
comic book collector.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.700
She has over 1,000
comic books.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.480
We're also delighted to have
Sepi Nasiri with us.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.320
Sepi is the director of all
things offline at Women 2.0.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.480
She's responsible for global
partnerships and for

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.665
sponsorships.

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:59.090
And Sepi got her start as a
managing editor of an LA

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.480
global magazine.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.560
A fun tidbit about Sepi is
that two years ago she

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.460
launched her first app in the
Apple store, and it is the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.770
Date Saver Platinum application,
which gives users

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.350
a portable bathroom fan.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.930
So we have to ask her
about that later.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.040
But welcome, all of you.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.980
We're delighted to have you.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.070
And welcome to everybody here.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.310
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.710
So I'd like to start by turning
it over to our great

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.090
panelists this morning, and ask
each of you to share with

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.350
us a one-minute introduction of
your company and its core

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.340
mission, starting with
you, Margaret.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.500
MARGARET WALLACE: Hi.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.900
Good morning, everybody.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.650
It's really great to see
everyone in the room.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.460
My name is Margaret Wallace.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.330
I am a CEO of a company
called Playmatics.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.960
I co-founded Playmatics
with Nick Fortugno.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.070
He's a game designer probably
best known for having designed

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.890
"Diner Dash," which I think a
few of us in this room may

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.030
have played.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.490
I've been in gaming--

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.360
at the intersection of gaming,
tech, and media-- since--

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.150
it's kind of not cool to
say it-- since 1996.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.460
And I've worked on all sides
of the equation, on the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.540
publisher sides of technology
companies, I've

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.120
raised venture capital.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.030
And Playmatics is a
15-person company

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.510
based in New York City.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.930
About a year and a half ago,
we raised some angel

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.970
investment to create a game
called "Shadow Government,"

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.050
which is a real world political
simulation of the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.850
United States that runs off of
a 30-year-old algorithmic

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.920
model called the T21.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.330
But we really focus on
designing engaging--

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.260
hopefully engaging--

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.690
social games for both
women and men.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.230
And we try not to clone.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.730
So that's sort of a quick
intro of who I am.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.140
Nice to meet everybody
here, too.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.560
TRACY CHOU: Hi, I'm
Tracy Chou.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.560
I'm with Pinterest.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.830
If you haven't used Pinterest
before, it's a place online

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.690
where you can collect and find
the images and things that

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.050
really inspire you and
that you love.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.680
And we're really hoping to be
a place for discovery on the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.820
web and working on building
that out.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.570
My background is in engineering,
and I really love

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.460
working and building consumer
web products.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.770
So I love thinking about the
technical aspects, but also

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.940
translating product ideas
into the back ends.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.450
SEPIDEH NASIRI: Good morning.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.730
My name is Sepi Nasiri, and I'm,
as mentioned, director of

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.050
all things offline
at Women 2.0.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.040
Women 2.0's mission is to
increase the number of female

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.420
founders in technology
startups.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.400
And to do so, we have our online
component, which is our

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.720
blog network, and we also have
our offline products,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.970
including our conference
and our events.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.470
LEAH BUSQUE: Hi, everyone.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.280
My name is Leah Busque.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.130
I'm the CEO of TaskRabbit.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.790
TaskRabbit is an online
marketplace where people can

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.420
go to outsource small jobs and
tasks to others in their

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.950
neighborhood.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.460
So if you need dry cleaning
picked up or groceries

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.300
delivered, you can go on
TaskRabbit.com or download our

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.840
mobile app, name the price
you're willing to pay to have

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.200
a job done, and then we match
you with our network of

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.460
hundreds of background-checked
TaskRabbits in your

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.220
neighborhood.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.680
Our mission is really
to empower people to

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.930
do what they love.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.160
JESS LEE: I'm Jess Lee, the

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.460
co-founder and CEO of Polyvore.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.770
Polyvore is a fashion community
site with over 15

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.270
million unique visitors
a month.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.650
I guess Mary just outed me as
a comic book nerd and as

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.030
someone who loves to draw.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.400
I really wanted to go to art
school when I was growing up,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.570
and my parents told me no,
because they're Asian.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.370
So I ended up studying
computer science.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.150
And I was really excited to come
across Polyvore, because

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.970
Polyvore is a place where people
can just mix and match

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.730
items they love in a very
artistic way to

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.690
create these collages.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.410
So we essentially have a
platform and tools that

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.540
empower other people to be
artistic and creative.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.780
So it's something that I'm
really passionate about.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.300
And I think it's sort of akin to
a fashion magazine, except

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.120
it's created by a global
community of fashionistas from

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.570
all over the world.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.130
Yeah.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.550
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank you.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.090
Thank you all for joining us.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.890
So I'd like to start
by looking a bit

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.690
at the product landscape.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.230
And so, starting with Tracy
with Pinterest.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.900
Tell us about the evolution of
Pinterest and how your users

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.810
are interacting with the site.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.560
TRACY CHOU: Sure.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.910
I can give a little
bit of history.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.780
So Pinterest has actually been
around for a few years now.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.410
It was founded--

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.290
started getting kicked
off in 2009.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.760
And most people didn't hear
about it until late 2011.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.860
So it's actually quite a long
time of trying to iterate on

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.235
the product and get traction
with users.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.190
It's meant to be a general
platform for collecting and

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:41.400
sharing images, and it's
resonated a lot with people

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.800
who work in industries that are
very inspiration-driven.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.450
So a lot of architects
were on early.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.740
Like, one of our founders,
who is a designer, was in

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.550
architecture school, and so he
found a lot of similarities

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.780
between Pinterest and the
physical boards in which he

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.650
would be collecting
inspiration.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.970
There's a lot of people
who are doing arts

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.685
and crafts on Pinterest.

00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.900
Just like getting ideas and
thinking about things that

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.450
they want to do.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.290
As we've evolved, it's just been
this gradual process of

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.840
acquiring a community and
thinking about reaching out to

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.050
people, figuring out what makes
the most sense for them,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.096
and responding to
feedback a lot.

00:08:23.096 --> 00:08:25.090
I guess--

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.230
I'm not sure what else
there is to say.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.300
It's just keep talking
to your community,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.230
seeing what they want.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.240
But there's not too much, so
it's like too mind blowing.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.370
As we've evolved, we've just
been acquiring more and more

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.169
people who are interested in
looking at different recipes

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.210
that people are pinning,
finding

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.310
inspiration for their homes.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.110
So there's a pretty wide ranging
appeal for just like--

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.440
it started off with a lot
of women in the Midwest.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.190
But it's starting to find
greater appeal.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.790
MARY HIMINKOOL: And
Tracy, you're on

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.600
the engineering side.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.120
So when you guys built the
product, did you design it

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.500
specifically with
women in mind?

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:04.770
TRACY CHOU: No.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.210
It's meant to be a
general platform.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.740
So the founding team was
actually three men.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:17.410
And the team has been majority
men for a long time.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.960
We really want to build
a general platform.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.860
But as any sort of site like--

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.390
that focuses on community, who
you seed the community with

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.860
will determine a lot of
the early demographic.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.590
Previously, I was at Quora,
which is also meant to be a

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.910
general platform for questions
and answers.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.500
But it also started off
being primarily male.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.650
And it just is a function
of who you seed

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.470
the community with.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.300
And you can start growing beyond
that initial seed as

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.430
you figure out your product.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.940
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank you.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.210
Thank you.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.650
So speaking of growth and
scale, Leah, I have a

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.840
question for you.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.310
So TaskRabbit has scaled rapidly
into eight cities.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.190
And can you share with us what
the trigger points are for you

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.440
to know when to invest more
resources and double down in a

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.250
specific city, market, or
on a product feature?

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.650
What's the inflection
point for you?

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.870
LEAH BUSQUE: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.470
When I think back about a year
ago, we were just in a couple

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.550
of markets.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.800
And at that time, Boston and
San Francisco were our two

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.930
main markets.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.050
We started to dig into our
database and our data, and

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.390
really did a deep dive
on who our top

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.180
users were at the time.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.370
Who were the top people
posting tasks?

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.480
And so in a two-sided
marketplace, we have the Task

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.110
Rabbits and we have
the Task Posters.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.940
And so once we did the analysis
of who our top task

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.060
posters were in Boston and San
Francisco, we started to see

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.230
some trends and some
commonality.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.390
And that was the point where
we learned that our two top

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.510
demographics both skewed
slightly female.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.710
The first demo was 25 to
35-year-old young professional

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.370
living in an urban
environment.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.265
She was outsourcing things
like, I need help with my

00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:03.990
grocery shopping, handyman
services, laundry.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.420
And then the next demographic
up-- it was a jump--

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.490
and it was the 35 to 45-year-old
female, typically

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.410
a mom with kids, working
full time.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.130
And it wasn't just moms,
because we saw on the

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.490
TaskRabbit side a lot of stay
at home moms that were doing

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.610
TaskRabbit to bring in income
and bring in money.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.470
And they were out running their
own errands anyway, and

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.220
didn't mind picking things
up for people.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.340
So once we had enough data to
really deep dive into our main

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.400
core demographics, that's when
we started to make explicit

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.490
decisions about design, about
product features, about

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.880
implementation that we felt
would cultivate the best user

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.100
experience around those
demographics.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.630
MARY HIMINKOOL: Wonderful.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.970
Wonderful.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.800
Margaret.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.800
So gaming is a topic that we
know resonates well with both

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.420
men and women.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.890
You have such deep expertise
in the area.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.000
I'm hoping you can share with us
more context and some data

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.940
points on the landscape
of gaming.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.840
And are there any patterns
or trends that

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.240
have surprised you?

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.560
MARGARET WALLACE: Yeah.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.680
So that's a great question.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.490
And Playmatics, we create a
range of IP, whether you're

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.440
talking about original IP.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.950
We work with brands.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.560
And we also work a lot in the
growing and contentious field

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.560
of gamification, which is sort
of adding game-like dynamics

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.860
to non-gaming consumer
services.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.550
And I would say, in gaming in
particular, the biggest change

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.190
that I've seen since--

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.190
gosh, the '90s, when I was
working on the first ever

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.840
virtual pets programs
"Dogs and Cats"--

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.520
is, the female audiences
have become a very

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.200
core demographic for--

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.710
as you probably all know in this
audience-- casual games

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.130
and social games.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.710
And I don't know how many people
here are in the gaming

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.060
world, but we have a phrase
called whales.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.530
I don't know if it's used in
other industry sectors, but in

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.390
the past five years,
free-to-play games have really

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.980
become the cash cow,
so to speak, of

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.850
social and casual games.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.390
So these are games that are
free to download, free to

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.270
play, but to progress and
accelerate your experience or

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.930
have a more customizable
experience, one buys virtual

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.130
currency and purchases
accelerators or virtual goods

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.770
to progress through the game.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.930
And even as recently--

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.170
there have been tons
of studies which

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.930
show that 1 to 2%--

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.150
if you're lucky--

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.180
will become purchasing players
in these games.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.860
And there's a study-- there are
many studies, but I found

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.050
one which was released by
Papaya Mobile back in

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.650
September, 2011, which
identified for their network

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.720
that 70% of the whales--

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.630
and whales are people
who spend $100 or

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.030
more in your game--

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.250
are female.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.890
And I can tell you, while there
is a renewed interest in

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.010
casual social gaming around
mid-core gaming--

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.820
so targeting sort of more
traditional gaming audiences--

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.870
that's probably the audience
that my game "Shadow

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.950
Government" appeals to--

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.460
we all know, from all the
successes of social gaming

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.120
companies, especially in the
Bay Area, that 70 to 80% of

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.730
their players are females
and often comprise

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.240
the majority of whales.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.360
So on the one hand, it's
something to be celebrated and

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.820
pointed out that women represent
a huge amount of

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.620
purchasing power within social
and casual gaming.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.410
And yet a lot of the social
games that we see on the

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.430
market have often been
criticized as being a bit

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.770
exploitative, playing on
people's addictions.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.880
And it's just an interesting
question.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.190
What does it mean that the
largest audience for these

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.400
games are women?

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.480
So on the one hand, it's
a success story.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.820
It's something to call
attention to.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:04.320
But on the other hand, it kind
of causes me to question how

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.920
we monetize our audience,
and what are--

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.410
I know ethics can be a bad
word in the world of

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.330
entrepreneurship sometimes--

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.320
but what are the ethics around
monetizing that audience?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.890
MARY HIMINKOOL: Very
interesting.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.000
So then, general question
for anybody.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.110
What patterns have you seen in
how your user base monetizes?

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.640
Any interesting trends
or things of note?

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.830
SEPIDEH NASIRI: I think the most
important part is, what

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.130
is your user base asking for?

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:40.320
So for Women 2.0, it's mostly
other educational components.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.810
So we launched, last year, a
video about how to build your

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:46.600
own iPhone app.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.990
And within two weeks we had
over 9,000 downloads.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.200
So it shows that if you listen
to your audience or your user

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.550
base, you're able to monetize.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.050
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank
you, Sepi.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.980
And on that note, Women 2.0,
your organization, does

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.180
specifically outreach
to women.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.920
So what have you found
to be sticky?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.600
And what are the topics and
themes that resonate most

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.850
among your user base?

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.570
SEPIDEH NASIRI: Sticky
questions

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.400
would be career based.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.410
Women in tech, or women just
general, they're still finding

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.520
ways to grow.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.480
And where they would like
to take their career--

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.130
particularly because women
have different

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.080
responsibilities than men.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.560
And showing that, as a mom, you
can still have a company

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.510
and grow your company and
educating them of how to have

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.070
a life and work balance
is important.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.670
So those would be the first
questions we get everyday.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.820
And besides that, when you have
decided to build your own

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.360
company, then how do
I get funding?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.230
And most importantly, what
Women 2.0 provides is the

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.200
platform for networking, for
example, or networking events

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.020
where you can build your
network, who is also going to

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.790
be the ones who are partnering
with you and

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.522
funding you, et cetera.

00:17:05.522 --> 00:17:05.930
MARY HIMINKOOL: Great.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.280
So on that point about
community, Jess, Polyvore is

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.569
very much about community.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.630
You guys have over 15 million
monthly unique visitors.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.010
Can you share with us your
thoughts on how to build

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.069
community among your users,
both women and men?

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.560
And how do you solicit feedback
from your community?

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:21.859
JESS LEE: Sure.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.400
So Polyvore is very much rooted
in the community.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.170
We're nothing without our
awesomely talented user base.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.600
They're the people who grab
products from all over the web

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.690
and import them into Polyvore.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.260
They're the people who put
together the beautiful

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.600
collages and sets, some
of which are--

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.360
in terms of aesthetic quality
and taste-- are up there with

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.660
the top editors of Vogue.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.090
So I'm very, very proud of the
community that we've built.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.590
It's been about the community
from the very beginning,

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.820
partly because--

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.040
so I think a good example is,
I actually came out of our

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.880
user community.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.945
So I was working at
Google Maps and I

00:17:52.945 --> 00:17:53.700
was very happy there.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.970
And then one day my office--

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.770
my cube-mate showed me, hey,
check out this site, Polyvore,

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:58.860
that my friend is working on.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.050
And I played with it, and
I was just blown away.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.260
It was sort of like the
perfect mix of art and

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:03.880
technology.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.960
And I was just using it two
to three hours a night.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.480
And then I wrote to the
founder at the time.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.290
And I said, hey,
this is great--

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.340
I have some feedback for you.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.330
A lot of complaints, actually.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.180
So I wrote him a long
list of complaints.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.980
And then he wrote back and said,
hey, why don't you come

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.500
fix this yourself?

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.800
So then I ended up coming
on board at Polyvore.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.490
And so I was already part of
the user community, so I

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.900
already had friends
in the community.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.400
And this is before Facebook
Connect existed, so this was

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.800
like people who did not
actually know each

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.260
other in real life.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.190
But we became friends.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.430
And so ever since then, I've
always stayed in touch with

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.370
all those community members.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.710
And we take it very seriously.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.390
Our philosophy around the
community is to always go the

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.350
extra mile.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.550
So when people write in, we
take the time to actually

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.760
write back.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.450
For our very, very top members--
and some of these

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.740
people have been using this
site for like five years,

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.840
they're so loyal.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.970
They post their sets to
Facebook, they post their sets

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.660
to Twitter.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.030
They're the people who have
actually helped us grow,

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.940
because they tell their friends
about the site.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.730
So I think a good example
of how we listen to our

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.400
community--

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.430
we recently had a meetup.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.750
We try to actually bring
our members in

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.660
every once in a while.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.700
So on Friday, we had a meetup
with about 11 members.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.370
Flew some in from-- there was
one girl from Brazil,

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.590
Wisconsin, Hawaii.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.270
These people have dedicated
years of their life.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.320
Like one girl had been using
the site since she was 13

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.490
years old, and now she's 18.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.070
So she kind of grew
up on Polyvore.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.640
So we brought them all in and
we just really tried to show

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.920
them how much we appreciate
them and how

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.610
much we love them.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.500
So we pampered them.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.280
We had a little makeup station
for them to get makeovers

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.740
sponsored by Bare Essentials.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.570
And then we did a couple
of sessions with them.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.100
One, we had our designers walk
through how we roll out

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.760
changes on the site, because--

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.590
as I'm sure a lot of people
know-- when you change

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.530
something on a site that people
are used to, they get

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.010
really mad.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.260
It's called change
aversion, right?

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.200
It doesn't matter if it's a good
change or a bad change.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.890
Oftentimes the initial
reaction is I

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.340
hate it, it's different.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.460
So we walk them through how
we look at that process.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.910
And part of it is we actually
count all the comments on the

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.210
blogs from our users.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:00.920
And sometimes we change

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.770
something and get 500 comments.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.940
So we count all of them, and
then we measure how many were

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.990
positive and negative.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.840
And I think what's special
about our community is

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.630
sometimes there's a lot of
negative comments, and then

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.220
someone's like, hey,
leave them alone.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.120
They're working really hard.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.310
They answered my email
immediately.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.720
So it's good to have a
community, because they in

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.340
turn defend you when something
goes wrong.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.120
And we've made mistakes, and
we've rolled them back.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.140
People are generally
very understanding.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.370
But we flew out these members.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.520
We showed them a good time.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.950
We previewed a couple of new
features with them, got a lot

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:26.930
of feedback.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.950
And it was really special.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.150
The special day for them to
meet each other as well.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.420
There are a couple of
cool stories that

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.340
came out of the community.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.960
I found out that one
of our members is--

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.190
she met a girl on the site who
she's now inviting to her

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.030
wedding that she'd never
met before, which

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:40.560
I thought was pretty--

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.840
I would never invite someone I'd
never met to my wedding.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.690
And then it turned out that
three of the members had

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.390
actually been--

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.970
and we didn't know this
beforehand-- but they had been

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.090
inspired to actually go to
fashion school and graphic

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.080
design school because of all
their time spent on Polyvore.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.080
They really realized how good
they were at graphic design.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.210
And so now they're
pursuing careers.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.250
That's really meaningful.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.440
It's really meaningful
for us, for the team.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.330
And then it's a good opportunity
for us to really

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.370
show them how much we appreciate
them, and then in

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.090
turn to get feedback
from them.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.090
MARY HIMINKOOL: Extension
of that question

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.080
to any of the panelists.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.540
Any key lessons learned or
insights on how to engage user

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.760
feedback and incorporate
it into your products?

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.280
LEAH BUSQUE: I can start.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.600
So I think the key is just make
it really, really easy

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.320
for your users to give
you feedback.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.340
So at TaskRabbit we have
24/7 customer service.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.490
We have chat.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.030
We have phones.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.160
We're on email all the time.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.470
In the product flow, we also
have little hooks where people

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.720
can easily leave their comments
and feedback.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.100
And I think the key is, when we
see something that hasn't

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.020
gone quite right, or that we
could improve, we'll follow up

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.740
with the user with a phonecall
or an email.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.650
We really try to understand
how we can make sure that

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.060
every time someone has
an experience on

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.760
TaskRabbit, it's amazing.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.660
And if it's not of the highest
quality, then we're

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.780
immediately digging in
to figure out why

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.520
and what we can improve.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.130
And then the second thing I'd
say, along the lines of what

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:12.070
Jess mentioned with product, is
we have weekly user testing

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.430
sessions or user research
sessions.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.290
And basically every week,
Thursdays, we have a group of

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.620
users come in.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.680
We don't know what we're going
to show them every week.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.260
Sometimes the marketing team
will run by some messaging or

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.560
new ad campaigns with them.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.180
Sometimes the designers will
show them what they're working

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.800
on, going forward from a user
experience standpoint.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.150
Sometimes we just have questions
about pricing or

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.750
what they want to see more of.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:43.400
And so I think having a
consistent pattern of a way to

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.600
get in front of your users
all the time is

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.850
really, really important.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.700
MARGARET WALLACE: And just to
jump in really quickly on the

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.390
gaming front.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.450
Game designers always engage
in this debate.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.370
How much should one be
led by the community?

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.220
How much can the community
anticipate design?

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.490
So in gaming it's always a fine
line between listening to

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.420
the community and responding,
but also taking those leaps of

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.170
faith or incorporating that
magic sauce that goes into

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.300
making hopefully great games.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.090
However, I think any of us
who've been in gaming the past

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.200
few years-- especially in the
social gaming sector-- know

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.680
how much analytics have really
risen to the forefront, almost

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.030
to a reductive fashion where
game designers will come up

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.330
with an engagement loop for
a game or some kind of

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.730
monetization loop, and before
that even gets implemented,

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.130
that gets run through a whole
series of analytics.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.080
Real time analytics--

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.910
we use a package called Swerve
which is really wonderful.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.350
But the larger the social game
company, the less and less

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.800
things are left up to chance,
because it really becomes

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.680
about spreadsheets.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.280
So it has its benefits, but
I think it also has its

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.810
drawbacks on the
creative front.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.720
JESS LEE: I do think you also
have to figure out the right

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.750
kinds of questions to
ask your community.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.280
What we've found is when you
ask, hey, what do you think of

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.330
this idea or this feature?

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.540
They'll say, yeah, that
sounds really great.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.770
So that's not as useful as
saying, here, look at this

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.560
actual prototype of this.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.450
Tell us what you think.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.960
Can you complete this
given task?

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.610
So you really have to--

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.940
and you also have to listen not
just to what users say but

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.270
what they do.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.390
So rolling out an A/B
experiment, where you try the

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.850
new feature.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.140
You can either-- so the
process that we use is

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:34.130
oftentimes we test with a top
group of VIP members, sort of.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.650
And then we get their feedback,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:36.740
a qualitative feedback.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.430
And then we move to like
a 5% or 10% experiment.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.490
You need to figure out what
sample size actually makes

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.620
sense for you.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.890
And then we actually
measure some of the

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:44.870
metrics we care about.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.910
And then we roll it out to
the whole community.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.230
And then we know that
if it's a big

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.410
change they may complain.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.910
So then we have in reserve some
other things that we may

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.370
roll out soon afterwards that
will sort of mitigate the

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.140
negativity.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.650
And then we're very
quick to respond.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.030
Like, as soon as the launch
happens, everyone is watching

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.120
the blog post and monitoring
for comments.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.700
Because there's definitely
things we don't think of.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.810
And then we try to
implement those

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.250
things as fast as possible.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.170
And what we find is that our
community actually notices.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.525
They say, hey, I noticed that
that changed immediately after

00:25:12.525 --> 00:25:13.700
I reported it.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.900
I saw that you added that
commenting feature I asked for

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.490
a day afterwards.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.000
That's so cool.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.860
Thank you.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.120
So I think it's good to be
really, really responsive

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.030
right after your launch, too.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.380
It's not done when
it's launched.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.790
MARY HIMINKOOL: A really good
insight, definitely.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.030
TRACY CHOU: I have one thing
to add which is, on the

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.690
company side, it's also very
important to dedicate

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.880
resources to community in terms
of employees, like the

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.730
head count.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:39.530
At Pinterest we have six or
seven community team people

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.310
out of a total of
50 right now.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:45.080
And they are very
empowered to--

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.860
I mean, they have a lot
of responsibility.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.400
And we have them sit with
product and engineering when

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.490
we're making design decisions.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.320
So it's not just responding to
new product features when

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.800
we're about to roll them out.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.350
We have community team sitting
with us and saying, I'm

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.410
getting a lot of reports from
users that they really like

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.510
this or they really
don't like this.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.910
So we should incorporate it
into the new designs that

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:07.690
we're rolling out.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.590
So just making community a
priority within the company is

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.640
very important.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.460
And the other thing is having
a good system to track what

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.780
the community is saying.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.910
So we track different types
of tickets in Zendesk.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.730
And we have graphs of how many
tickets we're getting for

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.090
different types of issues.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.590
And that just helps us to know
what people care about in a

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.564
very quantitative but also
qualitative way.

00:26:31.564 --> 00:26:33.840
MARY HIMINKOOL: So on that point
of building a great team

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.210
within the company and scaling
a great company.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.980
How do you guys approach hiring
and building a team?

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.860
And what is your interview
process like?

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.970
LEAH BUSQUE: So at TaskRabbit,
we've kind of honed in on a

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.380
process over the course of
about 12 months or so.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.680
And so whoever we're
interviewing, whatever

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.340
candidate comes in, typically
they initially do a phone call

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.740
with Ryan, who's our
talent scout.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.600
And then they come in and they
meet the hiring manager, but

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.080
then they also meet a
few other key team

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.990
members on the team.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.740
And if that goes well, they'll
come in for a second round of

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.130
interviews with a wider group.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.120
And this round of interviews is
really important because we

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.110
pick people across teams
and across functions.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.440
And so we're not only looking
for folks that have various

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.750
skill sets and can actually do
the job really well, but also

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.580
folks that are going to work
well and are a great culture

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.870
fit across the entire company.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.280
And then from there, something
that I've always been very

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.710
adamant and passionate about
is, I don't care how big we

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.980
get, I want to meet every
single person that comes

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.060
through the door.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.720
And we'll see how long that
scales to, I'm not sure.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.880
But we have this sort of founder
round interviews.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:57.260
And it's not really set up so
that I have the power to say

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.340
yea or nay on someone.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.740
That's not what it is at all.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.850
It's actually really important
to me for those candidates to

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:08.130
know that I want to know who
they are, and that I am a

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.260
resource to them, and that
I want to be engaged

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.080
with them as well.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.390
And it doesn't matter what
team they're on or what

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.910
they're working on.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.550
It's important to me to have
that sort of open door policy,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:24.290
and that starts as part of the
candidate interview process.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.300
So that's worked really
well for us.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.950
But we're continuing to change
and iterate it over time.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.140
SEPIDEH NASIRI: So we have
similar, actually, ways of

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.900
interviewing when we add
someone to our team.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.920
One of the main, I guess, focus
for us is personality.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.230
Our team currently has three
main people, which includes

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.630
our CEO and co-founder Shaherose
Charania, and Angie

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.430
Chang, and then myself.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.280
And what we do is we always have
this philosophy, can you

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.700
share a pillow with this
person if you have to?

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.760
We do work late.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.380
And we consider everyone
who we add to

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.820
our team as a family.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.300
You eat with them, you sometimes
have to share that

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.710
pillow in the office.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.110
So making sure that we all have
the same chemistry and

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.740
we're all focused on the same
goals is important.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.840
And we do have teams
across the country

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.350
internationally as well.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:30.200
So we do chat with them and make
sure that they feel with

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.450
us that they're included.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.620
MARGARET WALLACE: Some of the
people at Playmatics are folks

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.410
that I've worked with in
previous companies.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:44.000
One guy who was the original
programmer on the first "Diner

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.750
Dash" game, I've known and
worked with him for 12 years.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:51.450
And so I'm really fortunate to
have good people that you keep

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.080
with you along the way.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.070
But we're a small,
scrappy startup.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.790
And so we rely largely on
not only referrals--

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.870
and if you're lucky enough to
know a lot of people, it's

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.460
pretty easy to pull in resources
as you need them.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.860
My co-founder teaches at a local
university in the game

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.730
design program.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.740
So in terms of fresh talent,
we're always meeting and

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.070
recruiting fresh talent.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.520
We have something called the
camping test, kind of like the

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.360
pillow test.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.790
Can I go camping with
this person?

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.230
Because really, at the end of
the day-- and I've made this

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.680
mistake before.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.520
I've made fewer and fewer
mistakes in hiring than when I

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.440
first started out, where
I made a bunch.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.140
One kind of thing I've learned
is culture and cultural fit.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.600
It doesn't matter if this person
is a superstar, if they

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.010
are the Einstein of whatever
area they're focusing on, if

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.330
they cannot work with other
people, when you're a

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.550
15-person company, it's just
not going to work.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.160
And it's going to really
sour the morale of

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.120
the rest of the office.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.860
So I've learned, and my
co-founder have learned, we've

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.130
been really lucky just bringing
in good people,

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:53.410
bringing in bright people.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.440
And if there is a problem,
just really addressing it

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.420
immediately.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.260
Because when one runs a startup,
as you can imagine,

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.930
it's the little mistakes that
you don't think of, that six

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.670
months or three months down the
line that you just think,

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.640
oh, why didn't I act sooner?

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.430
So that's kind of our process.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.140
Everybody gets to meet just
about everyone else.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.890
But my co-founder and I are
the final decision makers.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.770
We're a small company.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.260
We have to be stealth
and scrappy.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.210
So it kind of works
out like that.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:23.000
We do have pretty good diversity
on the team, which

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.620
I'm pretty proud of.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.400
And it's really largely because
the applicants that

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.930
come to us are from diverse
backgrounds.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.890
MARY HIMINKOOL: So everybody
remember the camping test and

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.510
the pillow test.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.990
I love to talk about the process
of fund-raising, as

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.390
funding is obviously a very
important component of scaling

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.500
a business.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.630
Any insights from you guys
on the process, how you

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.916
approached it, what your
considerations were?

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:50.390
MARGARET WALLACE: Oh, I'm
sorry, I don't mean to--

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:51.760
just really quickly.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.750
It always takes longer than
you think it does.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.330
If the money is too easy
to come by, that

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:58.600
should be a red flag.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.930
If the money is too hard to come
by, you keep getting the

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.680
same answers, that should be
potentially a red flag.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.460
It's a diligent process.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.910
It's a process of constantly
refining and improving.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.480
Like I said, I've successfully
raised venture capital, I've

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.140
unsuccessfully raised it, and
I've successfully raised angel

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.040
investment.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.400
And every single meeting that
one has with potential

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.880
investors is a chance
to learn.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.520
So the biggest point of advice
I would give to anyone in the

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.790
audience is, when you have these
meetings, even meetings

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.620
that are quote throwaway
meetings with C-level people

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.650
that you may not be interested
in, C-tier people you may not

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.500
interested in working with,
write everything down.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.870
You'll find that the same
questions often bubble up, and

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.550
those are things you need to
address in order to probably

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.960
successfully fundraise
in the future.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.330
JESS LEE: So at Polyvore we've
raised three rounds, although

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.400
the total sum is
not that high.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.090
And so A, B, and C are actually
very different.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.620
So for the A, we raised about
$2.5 million from Benchmark

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.630
Capital in 2007.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.090
And I think in the
beginning when--

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.730
it could be seed,
it could be A--

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.840
the easiest way to raise
is to have traction.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.870
That's kind of obvious, and
also very difficult.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.610
But that was the approach that
we took at the time.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:10.560
We already built--

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.990
the site was already built and
sort of a little bit on its

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.450
way, so it became an easier
sort of sell.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:20.440
The Series B was in 2009 in the
summer, and this was when

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.600
the economy was like ehh.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.840
So a much more difficult
time to raise.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.290
Even though we were doing well,
it was just much harder.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.070
So we were hitting Sand
Hill Road and

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.050
talking to all the VCs.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.500
And I think through that process
we learned--- we honed

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.350
sort of what our deck
should look like.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.850
Like, what are the key things
you really need to cover,

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.780
which are product,
market and team.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.460
And of the three, it actually
turns out, I think, that

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.140
market is really important.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.270
If your product is not solving
a large enough market, then

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.440
you won't get certain kinds
of VCs to invest.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.770
So we successfully raised our B
from Matrix Capital-- about

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.820
$5.6 million in 2009.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.990
And then our C, which we just
closed in January--

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.790
this was before the Facebook
IPO, which I've heard has

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:58.890
affected valuations.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:03.170
But that one was, I guess,
again, different market

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:03.530
conditions.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.310
So this was after a lot of
companies had raised a lot of

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.440
money in 2011 and the
market was-- the

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.000
climate was very good.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.850
So that was a much easier
round to raise.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.650
And then at that point
we had more traction.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.520
So we closed a $14 million
round in January.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.310
All very different.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.449
So our C we raised from DAG,
a more-- sort of a standard

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:24.980
Silicon Valley type VC--

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.030
great firm, and then Goldman
Sachs, which is very--

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.820
not traditionally--

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.860
I think we were like the eighth
company they had ever

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.800
invested in, so very different
sort of due diligence process.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.580
Due diligence is obviously
much more strict in the C

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.340
stage or the later stage, but
Goldman Sachs is especially

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:46.940
strict because they're
a big public company.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.260
So they have a lot of process
they have to go through to get

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.699
the money approved.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.020
MARY HIMINKOOL: Great.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.280
Great.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.219
So we have a lot of
entrepreneurs here in the

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:57.690
audience with us today.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.785
What advice do you ladies have
for startups or companies who

00:35:00.785 --> 00:35:04.960
are looking on how to design
with women in mind?

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.865
And how targeted is
your marketing?

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.180
LEAH BUSQUE: I would say just
general advice is find great

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.090
mentors, advisers, people that
you can surround yourself with

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.680
that you can use as a sounding
board, bounce around ideas.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.270
If you feel like going into your
idea or company, you know

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.560
exactly who the demographic is,
then find an adviser or

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.490
mentor that you feel
matches that.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:35.900
So you can use them to do a
lot of research early on.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.210
But then I would say don't
assume you know who you're

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:43.210
building for until you actually
build it and get

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:45.950
those users and start looking
through the data.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:50.130
And that's going to tell you and
influence your decisions

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.350
about how to move forward.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.280
So I think it's more about
constantly just iterating on

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.530
customer feedback in your
community, rather than

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.490
assuming you know exactly
who you're designing

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.740
for to begin with.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.680
TRACY CHOU: A couple points.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.790
One is if you can try to build
up your intuition as much as

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.650
possible early on, like
Leah was saying.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.310
If you can get mentors or get
people to come in so you

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.610
understand generally what
direction you want your

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.380
product to go in, that's most
important as you're getting

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.560
started and you don't have
any data to work with.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.720
And users aren't going to
tell you what they want.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.530
And one way also to--

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.360
one hack to get better intuition
about the products

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.360
that you're trying to build is
getting people from those

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.490
demographics into your company
working there.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.730
If you can hire female
engineers, that helps.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.040
If you can hire female product
managers, people who are

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.960
actually using the products,
they're going to be there.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.910
And that feedback loop is just
so much faster than having to

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:48.400
go out and do user research or
run some A/B tests and wait

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.220
for two weeks to get the data.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.190
If you just have someone who's
there and can say, like, I'm

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.260
part of this demographic, and
this is what I like, and this

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.150
is what I think a lot of other
people will like, it's just

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:01.070
much easier to build
those products.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.440
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank you.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.880
In just a couple minutes,
we'll start

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.030
taking audience questions.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.840
So if anybody has questions in
mind, please go ahead and line

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.750
up and we'll take them in
just a few minutes.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.940
So a question then about-- a
lot of your products have

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.270
spread very virally.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.700
And in addition to this organic
growth, how do you

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.260
approach proactive marketing
to the extent that you do?

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:27.170
LEAH BUSQUE: So for us, 75% of
our users come in via word of

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.320
mouth, NPR, just general
awareness.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:29.900
So that's awesome.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.330
Because it's free channels.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:34.810
And it is very organic
and viral.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:39.340
But when we think about money
that we do spend on marketing,

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:45.280
whether it's SEM or display or
re-targeting, we try to get

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.940
very targeted about
the demographic.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.550
And so we'll do partnerships,
for instance, with mom's

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:56.710
groups, or with community school
organizations, PTAs.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.310
So we know that those are
our top heavy users.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.990
And so finding the right outlets
of where those users

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.120
are is really important if
you're going to spend.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.940
TRACY CHOU: One thing for
Pinterest is, even though we

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.320
haven't done a lot of marketing
per se, we are

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.250
pretty strategic about
what press will do.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.740
So if you're located in Silicon
Valley and you're a

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.440
startup here, it's very easy
to get a lot of coverage by

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.870
the tech blogs.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.210
If that's not where your users
are, there's not really much

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.700
point in going to the tech
blogs, unless you're trying to

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.700
do recruiting.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.120
But for us, we tend to do press
or let people write

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.710
about us, if it's in some
publication where we will be

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.480
the only tech piece.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.690
And we try to be where our
users are going to be.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.340
So if we're trying to get more
people in home decor, then

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.410
going to the magazines about
interior decoration makes

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.700
sense, or going to the
mommy bloggers,

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.230
those all make sense.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.480
But not as much TechCrunch.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.310
JESS LEE: So we don't actually
have a marketing team, but we

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.300
do do marketing through word of

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.080
mouth through our community.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.990
And there's a standard, build
a great product and then

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.890
they'll talk about it.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.440
There's always that.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.560
But on top of that, we actually
try to cultivate

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.750
great opportunities for
our community members.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.560
So the fashion industry
is a very top

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.850
down kind of industry.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.920
And Polyvore has a very
bottoms up approach.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.430
We're empowering all these
fashionistas all over the

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.980
world to sort of have
a voice in fashion.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.830
And so we've tried to create
opportunities with our

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.530
advertisers.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.630
So they often end up being
revenue generating

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.270
opportunities for us as well,
which is kind of nice.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.740
But some examples are, we
partnered with Rebecca

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.490
Minkoff, who's a handbag
designer, an independent

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:33.930
accessories designer.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:38.540
And she wanted to promote her
morning-after clutch, which is

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.260
her most famous sort of
bag that she makes.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.690
And so we put together a
campaign on Polyvore where we

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.410
asked our members to design
their own version of her bag,

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.600
and they could put studs on it
and sort of pimp it out.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.560
And we got over 6,000

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.320
submissions from our community.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.450
And then the winner, who turned
out to be this girl

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.720
named Dee in Detroit, she got
to travel to New York for

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.310
Fashion Week and sit in Rebecca
Minkoff's show and

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.460
watch her creation-- her bag
actually got produced and it

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.160
went down the runway--

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.750
she got to see that.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.240
She had never been to
New York before.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.260
She'd never been to
Fashion Week.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.700
And so for her that was
a major opportunity.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.150
And the bag got produced and
sold in Saks, so doing those

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.630
kinds of things, like, she's
going to remember

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.610
that for a long time.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.710
Our community remembered it.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:21.430
Everyone was so excited.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:22.900
They were so supportive
of her.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.500
The bag was named after her, it
was called the Dee Clutch,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.500
and it actually sold out.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.860
So the things like that, I
think, when you can cultivate

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.095
things around your members and
have them talk about you,

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:34.330
that's much better than talking
about yourself.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:34.910
MARY HIMINKOOL: Absolutely.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.510
So first audience question.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.490
AUDIENCE: So has it been a
problem for something like

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.980
TaskRabbit at all, or
how big a problem

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.710
for nonstandard uses?

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.490
Like, someone putting a task
up to maybe have a lot of

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:53.050
people do reviews of a site or
a game, or to get promotion

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.820
and sort of Mechanical Turk kind
of artificial promotion?

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.160
Is that-- any kind of outside
uses like that--

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.700
is that a big problem?

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.020
MARY HIMINKOOL: Also, audience
members, we'd love for you to

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.750
introduce yourselves.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:03.260
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.280
Jason Sackett.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.560
LEAH BUSQUE: Hi, Jason.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.250
Thanks for your question.

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.080
So it hasn't been
a huge problem.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.090
We've seen it on a
couple occasions.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.840
I think, for us, the key is we
ask our task posters to put in

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.830
credit card information
upfront.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.850
And we use that to verify
identity and keep our

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.030
TaskRabbit safe.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.690
And we pre-authorize cards.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:28.510
So that rules out a
lot of the spam.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.060
But then on top of that, we
also have what we call a

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.750
self-policing community.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:37.050
So anyone in the community can
flag a task as inappropriate,

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.720
and then it's immediately looked
at by our internal

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.830
operations team and taken down
if it's deemed inappropriate.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:47.130
So we haven't really come across
a lot of those types of

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.780
issues yet.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.210
Maybe they're coming,
I don't know.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.690
But that's how we've
handled it to date.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was thinking
more about the ethical

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:59.330
considerations of media and
games and these sort of

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.570
addictive loops and stuff.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:05.280
And this particular task is not
necessarily inappropriate.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.660
It depends on what's
inappropriate.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.960
So there's a lot of room there,
a lot of gray area.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.400
MARGARET WALLACE: Yes, and that
is the unspoken secret.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.330
A lot of those social mobile
games kind of work their

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:23.510
numbers that way by finding
people to write reviews.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.230
And not necessarily
using TaskRabbit,

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.000
but it's a big concern.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:31.456 --> 00:42:33.040
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Pablo Perez.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.530
I have a question for
Tracy of Pinterest.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:38.930
But I'd also like to hear
everybody else's opinion, too.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:43.710
Pinterest, it sounds like, it
took a couple of years for it

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:47.340
to really take off.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.460
At what point was that tipping
point where you just saw it

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.560
really accelerate?

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.110
And did social networks
play into it?

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.640
Or was it the users?

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.770
TRACY CHOU: Really
great question.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.900
Thank you.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.360
We've asked ourselves this
very same question.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.750
We don't know the answer.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:08.780
So if you're just looking at the
numbers and the shape of

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.130
the graph, it was sometime last
spring or summer where it

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:14.870
started to pick up a
little bit more.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:19.175
And there were huge growth
spikes at the end of last year

00:43:19.175 --> 00:43:21.900
and beginning of this year.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.560
We don't actually really
know what they were.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.500
From the beginning, Facebook
and Twitter were already

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:31.140
around, so those distribution
channels already existed.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.700
And there was no particular
event that precipitated, like

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.740
an inflection point.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.930
I think it's just keeping at
it, and eventually, if you

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:45.208
have the right growth rate,
it will start picking up.

00:43:45.208 --> 00:43:45.624
LEAH BUSQUE: Yeah.

00:43:45.624 --> 00:43:48.920
I would add, I think, for
TaskRabbit and a lot of other

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.220
companies, it's so much
about timing.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.770
Sometimes the consumer mindset
just needs time to develop.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:00.630
And I started TaskRabbit back
in the end of 2008.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.230
It was September, 2008.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.290
And actually when I launched
it, right when the stock

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.260
market was crashing, and all
these people were getting laid

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.640
off, and I just quit my job at
IBM, which I was starting to

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.090
rethink at the time.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:15.040
And what was interesting is that
ended up being a really

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.020
great time to launch a platform
like TaskRabbit,

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.980
because it gave people a way
to make money, to make ends

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.190
meet, to get by.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.300
And then it grew from there.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.380
So I think so much of it is
just the market needs to

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.160
develop and how the
market changes.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:34.090
And then the consumer mindset
tends to shift as well.

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:37.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:38.840
I'm Tommy.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.890
So I have a question
about Google+.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.580
So I hear that Google+
has a heavy skew

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.290
towards male audience.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.380
I was curious, do you have any
insight into what about their

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.800
product makes it heavily skew
towards male as opposed to

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.840
female, and how could
they improve?

00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:58.960
MARGARET WALLACE: We
use Google Hangouts

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.310
for our board meetings.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.620
And so we use Google+
pretty heavily.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.170
And I really--

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:09.740
I think that, personally, my
opinion as a user is it

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.605
probably just needs a UI
overhaul, and kind of more--

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.360
it's really, I guess, maybe the
original audience it also

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.600
kind of appealed to and
revolved around.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.820
But we use it all the time.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.410
I love it.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:26.710
I think Hangouts is
revolutionary.

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.100
Probably a UI thing.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.350
It's a UI thing.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.930
MARY HIMINKOOL: I guess an
extension of that question,

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.040
though, for each of
your products.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.060
Do you notice how important is
UI design when catering to a

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.650
specific sector of
an audience?

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.720
JESS LEE: So I like that the
panel title is like, it's not

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.830
always pink.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.440
So if you look at Polyvore,
which is definitely targeted

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.240
at women, that we don't
support menswear

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.710
on the site at all.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.730
Our UI is actually very spare
and white and black.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.260
If you took out all the sets
and you looked at just the

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.620
elements we provide, you
might even say that

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.890
it's kind of masculine.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.080
We use Gotham font.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.390
It's just very spare.

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.720
And the reason for that is we
want to put our brand and our

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.880
UI in the background, and
put the community in the

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.610
foreground.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:15.620
Because they already make really
gorgeous layouts and

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.100
sets that express
who they are.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.020
So we don't want to
compete with that.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.380
We don't want to put like a
pink or a blue or anything

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.690
else that might distract from
what they're already doing.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.980
So I don't think it's actually
necessary to have a

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.590
particularly feminine
visual design in

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.260
order to attract women.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.380
And about Google+, I
have one theory.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.460
It is just a theory, but
I think the seed of any

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.980
community is very,
very important.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.400
Polyvore was seeded with women
on fashion forums.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.480
I think Google+ was actually
seeded with Google employees.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.030
So it was tech, and honestly,
mostly male.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:52.420
So I think that's part
of how it grew.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.090
So those people invited their
friends, which-- and then I

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:55.980
think that's sort
of the route.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.020
Whereas if you look at Facebook
started at colleges.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.520
So like cool kid at college
or, I don't

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.210
know, maybe not cool.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:04.800
Ivy league kids at college.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.070
Yeah.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.350
And then MySpace, I
think, probably

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:07.590
started with, like, music.

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:09.600
And so it's all about
the seed.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.580
And I think the seed for Google+
was just different.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.240
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank you.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.490
Next question?

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:21.220
AUDIENCE: My name is A.J.,
I'm from Montreal.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:26.430
So I am actually really sad to
hear that Polyvore only has

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:27.080
female clothing.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.330
And I was going to try it out.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.110
And actually, yeah, maybe
that's some constructive

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:35.780
criticism for you.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.880
So my question is actually--

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.190
so women are clearly, like, a
minority in the tech industry

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.140
in that there's fewer of them.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:49.850
How do you feel about the
representation of women in the

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:50.380
tech industry?

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.130
We've been talking a
lot about your very

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.040
inspirational stories.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.490
And that's really inspiring
for me.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:58.730
But I want to know about your
thoughts on the way that women

00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:59.330
are represented.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:02.580
And also, are you targeting
other minorities in your

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.830
design processes?

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.370
JESS LEE: I would love to add
menswear one day to Polyvore.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.070
But our philosophy has always
been do a few things well,

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.270
like a very, very narrow focus
on a few things that we really

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:17.650
want to nail women's
fashion first.

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:19.070
But I'd love to expand to other

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.150
categories at some point.

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.380
So women in tech in general.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.660
So I remember when--

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.390
I think it was the year after
I graduated from Stanford.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.460
The Computer Science department
had a t-shirt that

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.980
said Stanford Computer
Science.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.370
And it was--

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:34.840
I guess it was an unofficial
t-shirt, but it was like nine

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.240
guys and one girl, like
stick figures.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.300
And it was really true.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.310
I remember around in my CS
class, and I could name all

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:42.000
the other girls, because there
were just so few of them.

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.010
So I realized that.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:48.990
And then I graduated and
then I went to Google.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:53.050
And I was very, very lucky
that Google is a very

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:53.830
equitable place.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:54.740
It's all about meritocracy.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.590
And I think that's actually one
of the great things about

00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:57.670
tech in general.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.820
It is more meritocratic, maybe,
than other industries.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.060
But I was very lucky to have
key female mentors.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.390
My first boss at Google was
Marissa Mayer, who's amazing.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.130
And I was just very lucky.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.220
So also my mom is
an entrepreneur.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.230
She ran sort of her own--

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.030
she's an interpreter,
Japanese-English interpreter.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.260
And she ran sort of
her home office.

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.870
I had a lot of female
role models.

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.920
So I figured that the best thing
that I could do to give

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.730
back is probably just
help mentor.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:27.670
And it's actually not even
just specific to women.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.720
I don't usually speak on a lot
of panels about designing for

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.560
women, or women in tech.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.170
But what I found is the most
useful thing is actually just

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:36.740
when entrepreneurs are
starting out and have

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.440
questions, just taking
the time to meet--

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.980
say yes to every coffee.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.420
And just a little
bit of advice.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.290
Because I remember all the
people who really helped me

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:45.750
very early on at Polyvore.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:46.640
There were people--

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.420
the Frenzy team let us squat
in their office for like a

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.700
year without paying any rent.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.710
So we tried to do the same.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:52.320
We paid it forward.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.500
We had another company squat
with us for six months.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.490
So just giving back a little
bit of yourself, I think,

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:58.700
makes all the difference
in the world, both

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.350
for women and men.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.340
SEPIDEH NASIRI: I think
also bringing

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.030
awareness, such as today.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:07.150
We have a panel of women here
talking about who they are,

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:08.070
what they have achieved.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:09.830
You don't see that
quite often.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:13.400
And when you don't have
those role models for

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.100
you to watch out--

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.530
OK, I can be the next generation
of entrepreneur, I

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.450
can build my successful company,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.950
then we don't grow up to have
that passion to be the next

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:25.560
entrepreneur or successful
individual.

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.200
For me, the same-- my dad
is as an entrepreneur.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.810
So I had that privilege to see
what I could be someday,

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.540
whether studying technology, or
being an engineer, or just

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.350
a founder and just creating
something.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:45.340
And having no limits
to who I can be.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:49.310
And so Google, as mentioned, has
been trying to do that and

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.560
is successful.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:53.070
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank you.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.470
Well, I think we just have
a few minutes left.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.410
So what I would love is if the
next two audience members

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:58.140
could both ask their questions,
and then we can

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.150
answer them as a group.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:04.740
Anthony Bowles, senior web
dev at Shop It To Me.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.420
Jess, you alluded to how
data-driven decisions are

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.380
built into your product
process.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.260
Margaret, you've dropped
Swerve as a

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.080
tool that you're using.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.100
Tracy, you mentioned A/B
testing, but you also talked

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.430
about intuition.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:24.310
So I'm curious if I could get
some information from you

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.460
about your process in managing
the priorities and the

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.180
features that you think,
on the one hand,

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.110
are going to be great.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:34.690
But then you need to also have
data behind the decisions that

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.100
are going into which features
you are going to roll out to

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.420
five, 10, X percent
of your user base.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:45.160
So certainly we, as a company
of 17 people, do not have a

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.430
dearth of ideas of things
we'd love to do.

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:51.120
But with the limited number of
resources of engineering, it's

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.000
tough to tackle all those.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.110
So if any of you have something
that you're

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.360
passionate about and you'd
love to share with the

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.940
community about how you manage
the product to engineering,

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.110
making sure you give them the
features that you think are

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:07.015
going to be game changers for
your respective entities.

00:52:07.015 --> 00:52:08.050
LEAH BUSQUE: I'll answer it.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.560
I actually have a very
timely example.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.070
Because we're in the middle of
this A/B test right now.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.710
And it's a new task form that
we've been testing.

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.370
And we wanted to really simplify
the user experience.

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.980
And we kept hearing from users
as they would come in every

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.480
week that, oh, it's too hard
to post a task, and there's

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.460
too many questions.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.340
And so we really tried
to make it simple.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.675
And we came up with this
gorgeous design.

00:52:31.675 --> 00:52:35.030
It's just really, really
pleasing and completely

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.250
different from our current
task form.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.630
And we rolled it out in
three categories.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.760
Shopping, delivery, and other.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.530
Just sort of a catch-all.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.500
And we A/B tested it in
those categories.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.860
And so we've been running
the test now.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.030
We thought we'd run it for a
couple weeks, and we'd get

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.670
enough data to make a call which
way we wanted to go.

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.920
We've been running it for
like six weeks now.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.060
And I just talked to Seema,
who's our director of product.

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.380
And she's like, I have some
sad news for you.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.480
And I said, Oh my god.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.700
What happened?

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.340
And she's like, the simple
shopping form, the simple

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.430
test, it's failing.

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.770
It's just not working.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.670
And it was such a struggle,
because myself, the team,

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.620
everyone wanted it
to work so badly.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.580
And you have to live and
die by the data.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:24.780
It doesn't work.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.370
And so it's sad that we ran the
tests and we had the one,

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:32.390
the A test that we wanted to
work, but it just doesn't.

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.060
And so now it's time to
just kind of cut our

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.620
losses and move on.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.450
So I would say live and
die by the data.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:43.770
But also have that qualitative
research going on an ongoing

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.042
basis that you can get
feedback with.

00:53:46.042 --> 00:53:47.310
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank
you very much.

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:47.805
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:53:47.805 --> 00:53:50.780
Thanks.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Dan.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.390
You've talked a bit about how
the seed community seems to

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:58.460
determine how the community
ends up

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.050
ultimately turning out.

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:02.570
And I was kind of curious if
you think that's how it's

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:03.290
always going to be.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:05.100
Like I remember reading a few
weeks ago about Reddit.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.450
They initially seeded Reddit
with a bunch of articles that

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.120
they wanted to see the
community support.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.130
And so, is this something
that you could

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:13.910
eventually move away from?

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.620
Or does your initial seed really
determine the entire

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.055
lifespan of your community?

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.970
TRACY CHOU: It doesn't have to
determine the entire lifespan.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:24.950
I think you have to
start somewhere.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.480
And if you can do well there,
then you can start figuring

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.590
out what are the adjacent areas
to move into, and grow

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.820
from there.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.630
I'm sure when Wikipedia
started it was not a

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.630
comprehensive collection
of articles

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:37.240
about all topics ever.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.290
But they started off where they
were strong and could

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:40.980
move into different areas.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:43.970
I saw this at Quora where Quora
started off with lots of

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:47.010
questions about startups in
tech in Silicon Valley.

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:49.700
They ran some analysis a couple
months ago, and they

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.900
were just looking at most
uploaded answers

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.100
in different topics.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.810
And there is now six very
strong topic areas.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:59.242
So one of them was still
startups in tech, but there

00:54:59.242 --> 00:54:59.700
was also food.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.250
There was also screenwriting
and Hollywood.

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:04.520
There's politics.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.490
And so you can be strategic
about branching out into

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:09.550
different areas.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:13.390
And we've been seeing the same
thing for Pinterest, where we

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:17.050
started off with more women,
and there is a certain

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.510
demographic that we're
in within the US.

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:21.700
But we're starting to expand
internationally, and the

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:26.110
gender split there is much more
even in the places we've

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:28.730
rolled out to in the Spanish
speaking countries.

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:29.250
MARY HIMINKOOL: Thank you.

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:30.040
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.060
MARY HIMINKOOL: So
last question,

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.050
some parting thoughts.

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:34.880
We've talked a lot about how
we've all been influenced by

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.400
mentors, by the community.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.560
What is the most valuable piece
of feedback that you've

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.670
received as an entrepreneur that
you'd like to pass on?

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.040
And what's next for you?

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.860
What's top of mind for
you right now?

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:51.260
MARGARET WALLACE: I would say
the most valuable experience

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.900
I've had as an entrepreneur--

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:56.450
I feel fortunate in some ways,
because I've had such great

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:59.470
experiences working in tech
and media and gaming.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.990
Point to an earlier question--

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:06.270
we do design our products with
gender but also racial

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:07.320
diversity in mind.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.150
I was just in Singapore
a few weeks ago.

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:12.150
And the exploding game community
coming out of

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.520
Indonesia was shocking.

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:19.600
But the thing I'm focusing on
now is our game "Shadow

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.450
Government," perpetuating it in
as many markets as we can.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:25.740
And the best piece of advice
I've ever received is accept

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.920
failure swiftly and
gracefully.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.190
Don't wallow on it.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:30.050
Move on.

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:32.870
People might try to drag you
back down in, not even

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:33.600
intentionally.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.870
But be like, oh--

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:35.870
don't even accept it.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:40.120
Just pick yourself up and
move on and keep going.

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:45.330
JESS LEE: I have--

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:46.690
I think there's two things.

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:47.740
One is--

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.255
and it's almost the philosophy
of our company.

00:56:49.255 --> 00:56:51.330
It's do a few things well.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.530
Especially in the early days, it
might be tempting to build

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.320
out your prototype with every
bell and whistle that you've

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:56.860
ever thought of.

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.970
But really think about what that
core most important thing

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:02.780
is, and just be exceptional at
that one thing first, then add

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.090
that second thing.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:05.690
Because otherwise you're
going to--

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:08.410
it's also difficult just to
analyze your results.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:09.260
So do a few things well.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.940
And I think that applies to
all parts of your company.

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.050
And the other piece
is very similar.

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:19.840
It's basically just
don't give up.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.920
It's easy to look at the
companies that you read about

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.210
in TechCrunch and think, wow,

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:24.590
everyone is doing so amazingly.

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:26.610
But what you don't see is sort
of like the blood, sweat, and

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:27.550
tears underneath.

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:30.000
You also don't read about all
the companies that are

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.640
struggling.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:30.880
Right?

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.980
Like, for every one company in
TechCrunch that seems to be an

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:38.770
overnight success, there's like
99,000 others that are

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:39.560
still working at it.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:44.640
And you may think that,
aw, I'm so far--

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.750
I'm not that company.

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:48.900
But just keep going.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.950
It's common to make mistakes.

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:56.670
It's common to hire
the wrong people.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.520
All the great companies have
made all the same mistakes

00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.400
that you're probably making.

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.650
So, yeah.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.570
SEPIDEH NASIRI: One advice I
would be able to give you guys

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:10.020
all is don't marry yourself
to one idea.

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:14.010
You have an overall vision, but
your products may change,

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:16.370
or it may merge and grow.

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:20.880
So just focusing on one thing
that you thought first, you

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.190
might get lost and your user
base might move on if they

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.690
don't see a growth.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:29.215
LEAH BUSQUE: The best piece of
advice I ever got was from one

00:58:29.215 --> 00:58:32.650
of my mentors, Scott Griffith,
who is the CEO of Zipcar.

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.460
And he said to me-- this is
what got me to leave IBM.

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.030
He said, Leah, I
love your idea.

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:38.340
I think you're on
to something.

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.530
I think you should see how
far you can take it.

00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:43.100
And he kept saying to me, see
how far you can take it.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.660
And so that's what I continue
to do on a daily basis.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:50.880
And I think if you can not get
overwhelmed, maybe, by this

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.050
sort of big picture and all the
stuff that you need to do,

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:58.260
but just think about pushing it
forward every single day,

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:02.180
that eventually you'll have a
company and it'll be sort of

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.430
snowballing away.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.630
TRACY CHOU: My one thing is
to always be improving.

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:14.040
So just continually be improving
yourself and your

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.320
company and your product.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:17.960
That's about it.

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:21.060
If you're always improving,
you're in pretty good shape.

00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.610
MARY HIMINKOOL: Well, you're all
are remarkably talented.

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:24.620
And we really appreciate you
taking the time to share your

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.450
insights with us.

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:28.430

the Google I/O day, and
