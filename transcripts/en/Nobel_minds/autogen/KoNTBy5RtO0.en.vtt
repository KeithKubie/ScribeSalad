00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
I think pretty early actually so when we

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220
I think pretty early actually so when we
 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.839
I think pretty early actually so when we
saw that the fine pattern of these hands

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849
saw that the fine pattern of these hands
 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.919
saw that the fine pattern of these hands
forms a strictly hexagonal structure so

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
forms a strictly hexagonal structure so
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.049
forms a strictly hexagonal structure so
very very regular almost like a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
very very regular almost like a
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.390
very very regular almost like a
coordinate system then that was a whole

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
coordinate system then that was a whole
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.910
coordinate system then that was a whole
different from what anyone had expected

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
different from what anyone had expected
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.380
different from what anyone had expected
that we knew this would be kind of

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390
that we knew this would be kind of
 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.500
that we knew this would be kind of
revolutionary so we worked on really

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
revolutionary so we worked on really
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.410
revolutionary so we worked on really
being sure that there was no mistake in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
being sure that there was no mistake in
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120
being sure that there was no mistake in
the data with lots of control

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
the data with lots of control
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459
the data with lots of control
experiments and we sent it to nature and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
experiments and we sent it to nature and
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.410
experiments and we sent it to nature and
went right in so that kind of confirmed

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
went right in so that kind of confirmed
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.729
went right in so that kind of confirmed
our suspicions but it was important yet

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
our suspicions but it was important yet
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.180
our suspicions but it was important yet
it was of course difficult to imagine

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
it was of course difficult to imagine
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910
it was of course difficult to imagine
that only nine years later it would be a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
that only nine years later it would be a
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.959
that only nine years later it would be a
Nobel Prize that is perhaps beyond but

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
Nobel Prize that is perhaps beyond but
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.090
Nobel Prize that is perhaps beyond but
still we we knew that it was very

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
still we we knew that it was very
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250
still we we knew that it was very
important from the beginning yeah and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
important from the beginning yeah and
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650
important from the beginning yeah and
the exciting part of of these cells is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
the exciting part of of these cells is
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.979
the exciting part of of these cells is
like ender said that we try to do all is

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
like ender said that we try to do all is
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.009
like ender said that we try to do all is
control to find out Easter especially

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
control to find out Easter especially
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.800
control to find out Easter especially
specific order does the rat see

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810
specific order does the rat see
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.410
specific order does the rat see
something specific that makes this sir

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
something specific that makes this sir
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.740
something specific that makes this sir
grid pattern and there's none and and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
grid pattern and there's none and and
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350
grid pattern and there's none and and
that means that this pattern is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
that means that this pattern is
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.710
that means that this pattern is
generated by the brain itself and then

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
generated by the brain itself and then
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.249
generated by the brain itself and then
it's like going into the brain and

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259
it's like going into the brain and
 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.289
it's like going into the brain and
detecting the mystery of the brain by

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
detecting the mystery of the brain by
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.270
detecting the mystery of the brain by
studying these cells and if we start to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
studying these cells and if we start to
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.060
studying these cells and if we start to
understand even more how they are

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
understand even more how they are
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.880
understand even more how they are
generated we understand so much about

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
generated we understand so much about
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.540
generated we understand so much about
town during the brainless working
