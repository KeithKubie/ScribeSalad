00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:09.050
RACHEL: Please give Bret
and Jason a heartfelt

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.590
welcome to Google Chicago.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.955
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:19.400
BRET GORNIK: Thanks, Rachel.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.410
Thanks everybody for
taking some time out

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.732
of your day to be here.

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:23.940
We're super happy to be here.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.250
We're really excited to shed our
viewpoint, our light on having

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.503
the best day every day.

00:00:29.503 --> 00:00:30.170
My name is Bret.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.670
I'm the co-founder
of Live Better.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.212
JASON LOEBIG: My
name's Jason Loebig.

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:34.368
I'm the other co-founder.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.410
BRET GORNIK: We're super
excited to be here today

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.170
to be talking about
how we live the best

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.550
day ever, every day, even
when you knock over your water

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.050
bottle.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.380
We're going to
start with a quote.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.410
"Normal is getting dressed in
clothes that you buy for work

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.480
and driving through
traffic in a car

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.240
that you're still paying for
in order to get to the job

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.270
you need to pay for
the clothes and the car

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.520
and the house you
leave vacant all day,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.860
so you can afford
to live in it."

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.360
We didn't like
normal, so we decided

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
to do this for a living.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.637

[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.070
JASON LOEBIG: So
four years ago, I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.430
had a really hard time
waking up for work.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.170
I've not always been
a morning person,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.110
although I might consider
myself to be now.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.350
I was a public accountant,
like Rachel mentioned.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.660
But I knew that that
was not what I really

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.830
wanted to be doing.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.170
I wasn't waking up,
coming into the office,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.870
rushing to get to
somewhere I wanted to be,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.780
and I knew that there was
a little bit of passion

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.590
and purpose in teaching
people about wellness.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.400
I love the people I worked with,
but that tangible impact that I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.830
wanted to be making
at my place of work

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.020
was really just not there.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.230
And that led me towards Live
Better to reconnect with Bret,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.580
and then have that be a
normal Tuesday afternoon.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.610
BRET GORNIK: Four years ago, I
had an hour and a half commute

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.010
to a data analytics job
that I found zero value in.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.850
I loved everything I was
doing outside of work

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.440
and enjoyed all the activities
when I was not in the office.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.490
Once I devoted my
life to my purpose,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.470
I have had the best day
ever, every single day,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.480
even on a Tuesday.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.590
So we'll give a little intro
about how Live Better started.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.320
Jason and I met in college
through Jason's wife,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.850
when he would come to visit
the University of Illinois.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.250
We were drinking buddies.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.630
Drinking is an understatement.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.120
We were a little
bit more than that.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.050
We enjoyed ourselves.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.370
We had a good time.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.690
And we met up again a
little bit after college,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.550
after a few years off.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.100
I was working at Kohl's
Corporate at the time,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.370
and then ended up transitioning
to Walgreens Corporate.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.150
When I came back to Chicago,
I saw Jason out at a bar,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.450
and if any of you know Jason,
he's a nice, bubbly, fun,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.680
charismatic guy.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.030
He looked like shit.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.530
And I said, hey,
what's going on?

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.660
Why aren't you happy?

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.100
What's up?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.100
And he told me that, hey, man,
I'm working a 95-hour week,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.170
and I have to go
into work tomorrow.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.070
Tomorrow was a Sunday.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.260
I said, hey, man, I'm
thinking of an idea.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.290
Let's go sit down
next week and chat.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.630
So we sat down a
week later, what

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.310
we thought would
be for a dinner,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.930
and has been our journey.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.540
For the last four years,
we've met every single day.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.980
We have started
training clients,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.220
like I did today at
5:00 in the morning,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.970
ended up working
throughout the entire day

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.160
at our corporate
jobs, would sneak on

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.600
to Instant Messenger chat or
run away at lunch to meet.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.080
We'd train clients
in the evening.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.480
We'd meet until we would
have to fall asleep.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.060
Wake up again in the morning.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.050
We've done that for
the last four years.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.900
This has been a serious hustle.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.950
Nothing has happened overnight.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.380
We have made this our own thing.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.170
Our intuition led us to
helping people with wellness.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.300
JASON LOEBIG: So I just
want to give a little bit

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.140
broader perspective
over what Live Better is

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.890
and how we do it.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.020
So Rachel gave a great intro.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.360
We wear about 35
different hats, currently

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.420
working on making that 20.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.950
But Live Better is a dynamic
health and wellness company,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.370
and we just like to say that
we specialize in experiences.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.460
So that could be something like
the wellness retreat we ran

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.010
in El Salvador-- we've
done a few of those--

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.460
all the way to big corporate
consulting projects.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.070
We have written a Warm Up
for Work program for United

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.320
Airlines ramp operations
teams, all the people that

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.070
move your checked bags, helping
them stay healthier at work.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.890
We've done things like
performance coaching

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.450
for executive clients.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.480
We've done visualizations
for professional athletes

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.600
before races and
games, all the way down

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.180
to one-on-one
training for clients

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.233
as well as mindfulness
initiatives for children.

00:05:45.233 --> 00:05:47.400
So we've been going into
some high risk school areas

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.940
to teach yoga and meditation
as behavioral modification.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.060
And this long
journey has allowed

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.610
us to have several
different experiences, which

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.560
have been aided,
certainly, by Bret

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.100
and I both being Nike
trainers, most recently, Nike

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.880
run coaches.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.513
We teach classes at
various boot camps,

00:06:04.513 --> 00:06:06.930
which is a really great way
to get in front of a super fun

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.110
community.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.840
And then we also
teach yoga, which

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.900
we've done on retreats, all
the way to doing things for fun

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.870
like rooftop yoga
during the summer.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.570
Our big sort of purpose
at the beginning

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.270
was trying to marry
up our experience

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.990
we had in the corporate
world, which was not all bad.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.180
We learned all the great
soft skills like showing up

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.510
on time for meetings and how to
host calls and conduct yourself

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.040
in a professional setting--

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.640
and help marry that with all
of these health experiences

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.500
that we've had,
because we know what

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.110
it's like to sit in that
seat for really long hours

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.050
at a time.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.470
I know what it's like to
travel Monday through Thursday

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.990
with early flights, late
night returning home

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.910
with no food in the fridge.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.010
And that's ultimately
what we wanted to do

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.310
was help our clients
and community

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.770
find strategies and ways to make
every day the best day ever,

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.140
no matter what it is you
liked doing for work.

00:07:04.618 --> 00:07:06.410
BRET GORNIK: So we've
mentioned a few times

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.540
that we host wellness retreats.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.670
On every retreat we
host, we hand out

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.390
a copy of our favorite book,
which is "The Alchemist,"

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.350
and I'd like to read a
quote from that book.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.490
"'What is the world's greatest
lie?' the little boy asks.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.510
The old man replies,
'It's this--

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.470
that at a certain
point in our lives,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.410
we lose control of
what's happening to us,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.990
and our lives become
controlled by fate.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.430
That's the world's
greatest lie.'"

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.860
We're here today to
tell you that you are

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.590
in 100% control of your life.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.660
You guys decided to show up.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.500
You guys are here
right now by your will.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.470
Every single decision that you
make every day is your choice.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.500
It is extremely important
to become and really

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.990
believe in those decisions--

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.600
that we get to control our fate.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.320
We decide where we want to take
our lives, what we want to do,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.060
and how we want to get there.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.575
You create your life.

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:08.700
JASON LOEBIG: So throughout
this journey that we've

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.075
had at Live Better,
we've sort of

00:08:10.075 --> 00:08:14.880
settled on two really
foundational ideas

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.790
and steps we take
to build this life.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.480
So step number one
is your purpose.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.580
And while many of
you in this room

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.140
might be looking
up there saying,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.930
I'm not really quite sure
I've found that yet, that's

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.400
totally OK.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.820
And we'll touch on that again
later, but this is your why.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.039
So if you haven't
found what that is,

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.980
or if you're not quite sure what
that deep, ultimate purpose is,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.429
like, this is my calling.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:40.836
I was born to do this.

00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:42.419
I've been doing this
since I was five.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.993
All I've ever done
is play the piano.

00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:44.910
That's what I'm doing.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.890
If you're like,
ah, that's not me,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.330
these are the things that
keep you up at night.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.342
The things that you wonder
about that pull at heartstrings.

00:08:53.342 --> 00:08:55.050
If you've ever
volunteered for something,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.310
that makes a big impact--

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.810
anything that keeps
you up at night.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.180
They're also the thing-- that
also might be the thing that

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.140
wakes you up in the morning.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.810
So I already mentioned I didn't
used to be a morning person.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.640
Now getting out of
bed is a hell of a lot

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.480
easier when it's for something
that I really want to be doing.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.880
Even on the days
where I'm tired,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.650
I still can pop
out of bed knowing

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.440
that I'm going to make the
difference and the impact

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.880
that I set out to do.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.220
And that is exactly the
second step and kind

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.560
of where Live Better
truly lives is self-care.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.950
This is the fuel that you
use to pursue that purpose.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.440
Without it, you are a
suboptimal version of yourself.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.190
So if you give me 80% of
your energy and attention,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:40.240
you are robbing me of 20%
of your ultimate gift.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.370
If you add that up,
you walk in, you're

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.360
robbing your co-workers of
work that needs to be done.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.800
You are robbing your
relationships of energy,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.490
and you are not presenting
the best version of yourself.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.140
This is Live Better's
true mission.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.200
How do we help you
with your self-care,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.112
and then encourage you
back towards your purpose?

00:10:02.112 --> 00:10:03.070
Think about this, too--

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.020
that the more energy
you have, the more

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.600
energy you have to
pursue that purpose.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.680
The larger that purpose
becomes, the more

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.380
it demands of your energy.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.060
And round and round we go.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.690
So if you're not quite
sure what your purpose is,

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.510
one good step to
find it might be

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.000
to fill up your energy
tank as high as it

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
can go so that you're ready
to take on those opportunities

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.340
when they come to you,
because if you come home

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.720
from a job or activities
that you really don't like,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.910
and instead of going out
there and meeting people,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.610
trying new things,
being positive,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.040
which attracts
other people to you,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.020
we don't allow anything
back towards us.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.190
We sort of shut that off.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.700
We go home.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.200
We sleep.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.010
We can't function
the way that we want.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.800
We wake up tired the next day.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.380
We go into something that we
don't like, and round and round

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.850
you go in the other direction.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.700
And we create this
snowball effect.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.200
So what's the
ultimate goal of this?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.570
What happens when
we find our purpose,

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.170
we apply self-care to it?

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.010
We have the best day
ever every single day.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.498
And everybody kind of
shakes that off at first.

00:11:07.498 --> 00:11:09.540
They're like, oh, well,
that's just not possible.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.220
I'm having a horrible day today.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.810
Like, F you.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.810
But this is not a Mr.
Positive nice guy attitude

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.940
at all-- quite the contrary.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:24.570
This mindset is for the
days when shit hits the fan.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.810
It's the days where everything
goes wrong, when you wake up

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.800
to your phone flashing.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.342
You already have
way too many emails,

00:11:30.342 --> 00:11:31.895
way too many text messages.

00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:33.270
Something from
your personal life

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.970
bleeds into your work life.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.970
You have a decision,
like Bret talked about,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.200
every single day to either
victimize yourself, or get up,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.970
figure it out, make the best
decision possible, and move on.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.150
It's your decision to make
the next moment better

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.850
than the last moment, to
make the afternoon better

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.540
than the shitty
morning that you had.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.510
If your morning and
your afternoon go south,

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.230
these are the PM
routines and the things

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.567
we can do for fun to kick us
out of that cycle of suffering.

00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:07.400
And I think that's
really important to note,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.760
because a lot of us feel
like life is happening to us.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.430
Like, why do these horrible
things keep happening to me?

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.270
Why do people in my life keep
doing these things to me?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.100
Why do I keep getting injured?

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.580
I tore my hamstring last
year, about a year ago,

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.920
off the bone in a
surfing accident,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.320
and my entire life is my body.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.650
If I can't use it, it's
really hard for me to work.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.990
Everything I do for
fun is around moving,

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.820
so it kind of shook my identity
down to its core by saying,

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.850
everything you do for money
and everything you do for fun

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.677
has now taken a backseat.

00:12:44.677 --> 00:12:46.510
And it could have been
very easy for me just

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.710
to sit on the couch, wallow
in it, complain about the fact

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.230
that I got hurt, and
I couldn't do this.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.810
But instead I just did push-ups
and pull-ups instead of went

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.790
out for a run or doing squats.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.500
I got surgery and
went back to teaching

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.720
four days later on crutches.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.860
It's just my decision that
life happens around all of us,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.840
and everything ends up being
just your reaction to it.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.330
It's not happening to you.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.800
You're the center of your own
universe but of nobody else's.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.930
So it's understanding
that in context.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.610
And if we think about,
what happens if we add up

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.620
all of these best days ever?

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.660
This is your best life ever.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.590
It's an accumulation
of these days.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.382
So it's worth it to consider,
moment to moment, day to day,

00:13:28.382 --> 00:13:30.340
how do we have the best
day ever, because we're

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.165
stringing these together.

00:13:33.165 --> 00:13:34.790
One thing I just want
to address really

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.480
quickly is that work-life
balance is made up.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.420
So apart from maybe the world's
greatest lie that Bret read you

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.520
on the slide, the next
one might be the concept

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.280
of work-life balance itself.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.640
It's also an extremely
dangerous contrast to make,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.240
because if you
consider or associate

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.060
life, what you do after work,
with all the fun things,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.190
then you are associating
work with the antithesis

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.740
of life, which would be death.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.770
And you're all in here
still breathing, right?

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.980
So we must consider
what we do for work,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:12.740
the majority of your life, as
part of that life equation.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.800
If you are mailing it
in every day at work,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.860
you are robbing your
co-workers of your talents,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.630
and they're either
picking up your slack,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.730
or you are underperforming
personally,

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.700
which then lets your team down.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.840
The things that you carry from
your personal life outside of,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.870
let's call work, back into
work affects your work,

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.015
and you certainly carry
your work home with you.

00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:38.390
So we're going to talk about
a lot of strategies and ways

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.160
to get around some
of that, to be

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.000
able to perform better at work.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.880
But if you're showing
up everyday at 9:01,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.130
and you're leaving
everyday at 4:59--

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.620
if everybody does that,
it breeds a culture

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.140
of mediocrity and apathy.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.520
Well, if no one else
cares, why should I care?

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.430
So then we talk about this
idea of work-life balance

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.800
like my life after
work is more important.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.890
But that's not true.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.760
What this very ill-worded
concept was trying to say

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.090
is that we should better
prioritize what we care about,

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.320
the impact we're making at work,
how you feel at work, because

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.540
then this blends
together into your day.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.300
I think we can better determine
how we carry work into our home

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.880
life, and then how we
carry home life back

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.470
into work, if we consider how
to prioritize our entire day,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.570
rather than making that
distinction between,

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.870
this is who I am and how I feel
at work, and this is who I am

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.070
and how I feel at home.

00:15:39.073 --> 00:15:40.740
BRET GORNIK: So we
have a few principles

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.350
that we would like
to iterate and talk

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.070
about throughout our talk today.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.770
Number one is discipline
equals freedom.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.560
If you're unfamiliar with this,
it might seem counterintuitive

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.470
at first, that restricting
ourselves can actually

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.030
create freedom.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.390
But this is a truth.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.770
This is a fact.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.630
If we think about it, we dive
into one of my favorite topics,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.330
which is one of
the ways in which I

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.040
was able to leave behind what
I thought I was doing for work,

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.110
and now pursue my
dream every single day.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.490
And this is a concept
of decision fatigue.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.750
So our bodies fatigue when we
work out, when we go for a run.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.870
We about physical fatigue,
but our minds fatigue as well.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.700
Every single decision that
you make throughout the day

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.540
takes away some of
your mental energy.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.370
So we think about
small decisions.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.810
What socks are
you going to wear?

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.310
What are you going
to eat for lunch?

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.893
What are you going
to do this weekend?

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.890
Then we think about
big decisions.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.690
Am I ready to buy a condo?

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.700
Am I ready to ask this
woman to marry me?

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.950
Am I ready to go into this
meeting today at 3 o'clock,

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.390
my monthly meeting with my boss,
and tell him I need a raise?

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.640
So we break this down
on a granular level

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.440
by assigning points
to these decisions.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.710
So let's say everybody
wakes up every single day

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.370
with 100 decision points--

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.660
picking out your socks,
picking out your breakfast,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.010
one, two, five points.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.150
It's nothing big.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.740
That meeting with your boss--

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.327
that's going to take
40, 50, 60 points.

00:17:06.327 --> 00:17:07.369
So just think about this.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.010
Think about every single
day, every decision you make

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.140
is draining something.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.210
This includes swiping
up through Instagram,

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.650
being on social media,
listening to phone calls,

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.400
watching TV in the
background while you're

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.880
trying to do something.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.440
All of these take mental energy.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.790
So let's go into an example.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.079
You wake up in the morning.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.730
You snooze your
alarm three times.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.320
You pick up your phone--

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.120
emails, social media.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.420
You scroll through.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.520
You step out of bed.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.090
You walk into your closet.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.310
You like this shirt.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.973
You like these pants,
these socks, these shoes.

00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:41.640
You try them on.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.640
You go on in the mirror.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.190
Nah.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.460
I'm going to go
take out this one.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.630
You go switch your clothes.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.770
You go out in the
mirror one more time.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.580
You look at your phone.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.622
You're like, oh, wow, it's
75 degrees in Chicago?

00:17:49.622 --> 00:17:50.490
I'm wearing shorts.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.570
You go back in.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.790
You put on the shorts.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.020
Already, we've
drained ourselves.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.780
Then you realize that
you are late for work

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.320
because of all
that time it took.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.408
So you rush to work.

00:18:00.408 --> 00:18:01.200
You get in to work.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.893
You sit down.

00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:03.060
You haven't eaten breakfast.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.165
You're hungry.

00:18:04.165 --> 00:18:05.040
That starts to bleat.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.970
It starts to bleat.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.178
You start to get more and
more work put on your desk.

00:18:08.178 --> 00:18:09.670
Now it's 11 o'clock.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.010
Lunch is at 12:00.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.750
What do we start doing?

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.062
Texting our friends.

00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:15.270
Chatting with our colleagues.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.780
Where should we eat?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.320
What should we get?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.900
Where should we go?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.520
Where do you have a deal?

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.603
What's Uber Eats going on?

00:18:18.603 --> 00:18:20.290
All of this different stuff.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.970
And with that, we drain
from 11:00 until 11:35.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.550
All of that time is
sucked out of your day

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.850
and your mental energy, deciding
on what to eat for lunch.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.520
Then at 11:35, your
boss slams something

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.320
on your desk that's due at 1:00.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.120
So all that time
you just wasted,

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.250
you now have to do this project.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.960
You perform it suboptimally.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.550
You hand it in at 1 o'clock.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.860
You know that you didn't
do a good job on it.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.800
Then you just go down, decide
to eat whatever's available.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.700
Now it's 2 o'clock.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.200
Your meeting's at
3 o'clock that you

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.248
wanted to ask for that raise.

00:18:51.248 --> 00:18:52.290
You're a little fatigued.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.170
You're a little tired.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.253
So you say, you know what?

00:18:54.253 --> 00:18:56.250
I'll push that
off to next month.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.380
This compounds every single day.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.658
You get home from work.

00:18:59.658 --> 00:19:00.200
You're tired.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.867
You're fatigued.

00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:01.880
You throw on Netflix--

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.258
one episode, two, three,
eight, a full season.

00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:07.675
You fell asleep
during one of the,

00:19:07.675 --> 00:19:09.030
so you gotta watch the next one.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.990
You order pizza.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.710
You go to sleep.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.250
You repeat.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.120
A lot of us have had those days.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.780
So let's take a step back.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.420
Let's think about
how we can optimize

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.390
our day, every
single day, create

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.510
a cumulative effect on how we
can make ourselves our best

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.440
selves.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.980
The night before, you
got your clothes ready.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.510
You made your overnight oats.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.540
You got your lunch ready.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.000
You're ready to go.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.125
You wake up in the morning.

00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:36.700
You don't snooze your alarm.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.075
You don't do that
in the morning.

00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:40.440
You wake up, and you
stretch, and you breathe.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.820
You put on your clothes.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.190
You grab your gym bag.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.070
You grab your food.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.360
You walk out.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.910
You have used zero points.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.150
You get to work.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:49.860
You're full.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.880
Your energy's up.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.050
You crush the morning.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.650
That envelope slams at your
desk at 11:30, or that email.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.590
You're ready to rock.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.132
You crush it.

00:19:57.132 --> 00:19:59.190
You hand it in at 12:30.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.170
Now you have 30
minutes for yourself

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.585
to prepare for that
3 o'clock meeting.

00:20:03.585 --> 00:20:04.710
You head into that meeting.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.670
You smash it.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.080
You say, I'm ready for a raise.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.900
Your boss goes, of course,
you are always full of energy.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.783
Everything you do helps
everybody in this office grow.

00:20:12.783 --> 00:20:15.450
I was thinking about giving that
to you in this meeting as well.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.530
You come home from work.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.530
Instead of being tired,
you go right to the gym.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.340
You work out.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.518
Now you have more energy.

00:20:21.518 --> 00:20:23.310
You just put in a lot
of work on your body,

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.290
so you decide to make
a healthy dinner.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.760
After that healthy
dinner, instead

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.710
of wasting time watching
Netflix, you read a book.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.410
That book teaches you something.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.690
Now we compound
this, day after day.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.940
Six months from now, instead
of reading that book,

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.240
you're thinking, I kind
of want to write a book.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.950
Two years from now,
you wrote a book.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.190
You laugh.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.690
We did that.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.830
We meal prepped.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.850
We still do.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.010
We get our clothes
ready the night before.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.430
So now we're going to go over
ways in which we can do this.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.070
So let's make
actionable decisions.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.880
We can sit up here
and talk all day,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.980
but if you guys don't
walk out of here

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.105
and fucking do anything,
it's not worth being here.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.130
So we have a morning
and PM routine.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.050
Everybody does, whether
you think about it or not.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.300
Everybody can optimize it.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.170
Everybody can do a
little bit better.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.570
So let's break this down.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.280
Every single thing we do
has to have a purpose.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.530
So here's my example.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.668
I wake up in the morning.

00:21:21.668 --> 00:21:23.710
I go through four rounds
of a breathing technique

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.930
we're going to go
over here today,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.972
so you know how to do it.

00:21:25.972 --> 00:21:28.080
I hydrate, flush my body out.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.100
I do my personal
care, brush my teeth,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.160
make sure that I'm presentable,
so I can give talks like this.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.680
I stretch and release so that
I'm ready to rock physically,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.388
because physically,
like Jason mentioned,

00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:39.690
is a very important part
of our day-to-day jobs.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.760
Then I run through my day so
that I'm psychologically ready.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.230
Notice no phone, no
wasted time, no points

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.700
used, because I do the same
thing every single day.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.130
Then we get home from
work, and our PM routine

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.740
is just as important
as our morning routine.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.750
So I shut off all
my electronics.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.910
I drink a tea before bed
to get my body cooled down.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.450
I read, I stretch,
and I decide what

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.900
I'm going to do the next day.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.960
Each one of these routines is
no longer than 10 or 15 minutes.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.870
We all have that time, but
it compounds, day after day

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.500
after day.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.510
Then we start to assess,
how is this working?

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.170
What is working for me?

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.740
How can I create this
life to be even better?

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.800
Once we decide on these
routines and implement them

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.300
every single day, we can start
having the best day ever.

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:32.730
JASON LOEBIG: So before we get
to this breathing exercise,

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.250
Bret talked about
decision fatigue

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.870
being this point system.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.775
So we arbitrarily
assigned 100 points to it.

00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:41.150
Well, you're probably thinking
like, OK, well, right now,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.742
maybe I only have 70 points.

00:22:43.742 --> 00:22:44.450
I don't have 100.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.620
I don't feel that great.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.280
Well, there are two
things you can do.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.030
Number one, you can increase
your points, or number two,

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.148
you can preserve them.

00:22:51.148 --> 00:22:53.690
So we're going to talk about
two quick ways to increase them.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.360
The first one would be
through your nutrition,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.700
so the food we eat is the
foundation of the energy

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.110
that we provide our body.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.693
Would you raise your
hand really quick

00:23:01.693 --> 00:23:04.365
if you've ever eaten
pizza during a lunch

00:23:04.365 --> 00:23:05.990
meeting or any type
of meeting and gone

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.747
back not feeling very good?

00:23:08.747 --> 00:23:09.830
Yeah, literally, everyone.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.140
Don't know why we still order
pizza for lunch meetings.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.240
Don't eat the damn pizza.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.530
You know that you're
not going to feel good

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.785
coming back from that meeting.

00:23:17.785 --> 00:23:19.910
We have all this little
social stigma like, oh, you

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:20.830
didn't grab a slice.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.120
Like, I'm watching you.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.400
You have to be able to be
a leader in your office

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.220
and say, hey, maybe we should
order some healthier food

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:28.880
this time.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.820
Or just simply
say, no, thank you.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.320
I'm good.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.510
I brought it in.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.580
You make the decision
every single time

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.940
to put the fork in your mouth.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.380
No one is force feeding you
that pizza, making you do it.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.410
So we have to come up with a
better relationship with food.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.030
One quick little point for
the parents in the room--

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.450
I would also suggest not
making the relationship

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:52.170
between good and bad
food subjective on taste.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.492
So every time you
say, all right,

00:23:54.492 --> 00:23:55.950
you can have your
dessert, but make

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.170
sure we finish all
of our veggies first,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.970
or you can get to
this food, after you

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.740
make sure you eat
all this food, you're

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.420
creating the exact
same association

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.180
that work-life balance created
with a positive and negative.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.060
You're associating the negative
food with the healthy portion

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.420
in order to get to the positive,
good-tasting food, which

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.640
is dessert.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.280
And that gets ingrained in us.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.160
Everyone's like, oh,
let's eat dessert first.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.910
Life is short.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.690
Well, maybe life is short,
because we eat dessert first.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.910
So just think about that.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.870
The second is exercise.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.870
So if I asked you right
now if all of us got up,

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.370
and we went outside
for a run, and I

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.092
said, run as far as you possibly
can, you might get a mile.

00:24:36.092 --> 00:24:37.300
You might get a couple miles.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.150
If you're runners in the room,
just disregard this example.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.410
We're going to come back to
talk about training for a goal,

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.220
like a marathon.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.720
But if I trained you for six
months, and then I went out,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.720
and I said, I want you
to run as far as you can,

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.940
you'd be able to
run a lot further.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.000
So there is-- we
have the capacity

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.360
to increase the amount
of work we can do.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.060
And endurance applies to a
lot more than just running.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.660
It applies to our
emotional health as well.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.660
So the second thing is,
how do we preserve points?

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.100
So sort of moving around this
holistic model of health,

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.820
we can manage our sleep.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.140
Sleep is the most accessible,
best performance-enhancing drug

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.910
that you have access to.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.000
If you don't get enough
sleep, you certainly feel it.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.860
Most of the time, if
we do get enough sleep,

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.570
and we're not in
a deficit, we get

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.490
that pop out of bed feeling.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.750
I'm ready to go.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:25.740
We're all after that.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.350
Almost none of us get that.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.640
It's like a
penultimate sleep goal.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.450
The second way would be
to manage your stress,

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.950
and that's something that we're
going to walk through today.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.050
Bret mentioned a breathing
exercise that he does.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.660
We're going to do that.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.700
Just kind of quickly
on the graphic,

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.200
that is the stereotypical image
of what we consider meditation,

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.510
but it's not all monks sitting
in the mountains and mudras.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.240
It's for graphic visualization.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.880
Meditation is just simply
the scientific practice

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.740
of relaxing your
brain to preserve

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.450
some of those
resources, and it's

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.540
just rooted in a very
simple breathing exercise

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.380
that we're going to go through.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.520
But I want you to think
about, instead of succumbing

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.440
to decision fatigue,
because we've

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.120
run out of all these points,
because we're stressed out,

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.960
because we have all
these things going on,

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.540
what if we could just take a
quick break, in the morning,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.030
once during work, and
once in the evening?

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.100
And we could do that.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.310
If we can do that, it allows us
to decrease some of the stress,

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.120
some of this overwhelm to
help the analytical side

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.160
of your brain
relax a little bit,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.660
so we can start to
kick back up some

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.670
of the creative
side of your brain

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.170
that helps us
relax and have fun.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.427
So we're not going to
metadata necessarily,

00:26:40.427 --> 00:26:42.510
but we are going to do
this quick little breathing

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.960
exercise.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.710
So I want you all just
to close your eyes.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:48.860
You're going to sit
up nice and tall.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.500
And I want you just
to start taking

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.060
deep breaths in
through your nose

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.400
and out through your mouth.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.710
Each exhale you
take, I want it to be

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.830
audible enough so that your
neighbor to your left and right

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.330
can hear it.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:10.320
I want the inhale you take to
be nice and quiet and calm.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.890
As we start to do this,
I want you to add a count

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.000
to your breathing.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.180
So when we start this count,
we'll go through four cycles.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.150
You will inhale for
an easy count of four.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:30.420
You will gently hold your
breath for a count of seven.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.510
And then even more
gently, but audibly,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.760
exhale for a count of eight.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.010
These counts do not
need to be full seconds.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.290
The better you get at this,
the more relaxed you get,

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.900
the longer these counts
might actually get.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.590
So we're going to go through
four cycles all together.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.850
I want you to inhale softly
in through your nose for four.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.340
Hold for seven.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.300
And then exhale out for eight.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.180
Your neighbor should be
able to hear you exhale.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.030
Inhale for four.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.550
Hold for seven.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.420
Exhale for eight.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.280
Inhale for four.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.270
Hold for seven.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.160
Exhale for eight.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.870
Do one more.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.010
Inhale for four.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.530
Hold for seven.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.510
And audible exhale for eight.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.010
And just gently open your eyes.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.220
How many of you noticeably, from
the start to finish of that,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:46.060
just feel like even a
little bit more calm?

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.890
So we start to let the
sympathetic side of our nervous

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.500
system, the side that we get
amped up for, the side that

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.990
our morning routine gets us
going for, our coffee gets us

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.080
going for-- first, second,
third, fourth cup--

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.560
that our workout
gets us going for.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.893
We're always sympathetic, but
if we never turn that off,

00:29:00.893 --> 00:29:03.290
we never give our body
a chance to relax.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.202
That took under two minutes.

00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:09.070
If you don't have enough time
in your day to close your eyes

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.320
or even just to step into
the bathroom for two minutes

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.810
to do that, then we need to
reprioritize a little bit,

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.260
because even something
as simple as that

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.480
can help relax your
brain down to remove

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.850
some of this chronic stress
that we're all underneath.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:25.680
It can become very,
very important.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.450
BRET GORNIK: And so we dive
into our second principle.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.160
You are the average
of the five people

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.884
you spend the most time with.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.240
This includes your colleagues,
your friends, your family,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.010
and in today's day and
age, social media--

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:48.222
podcasts, who you're following,
who you're interacting with.

00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:51.770
We spend a lot of time
on our mobile devices,

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.530
a lot of time at work, a lot of
time with family, a lot of time

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.820
with friends.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.670
So for a moment, I want
you to just think about,

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.030
who are those
people in your life?

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.230
And are those people in your
life propelling you or holding

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.273
you back?

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:10.440
Are those the ones that
challenge you in the morning

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:14.130
to get up to a
workout, or are they

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.410
the ones that challenge you
to eat that slice of pizza

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.852
at lunch?

00:30:17.852 --> 00:30:21.840
This is a very serious topic,
because we spend a lot of time

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.705
with a lot of different people.

00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:25.080
And like we've
mentioned earlier,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.770
you choose those people.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.170
You choose to go to work.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.240
You choose to go to
your family functions.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.150
You choose to go out
with your friends.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.080
You choose to go
to a workout class.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.800
That is your choice.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.540
And again, in
today's day and age,

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.990
we have the power
of social media

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.790
to choose whoever we
want to hang out with.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.620
You can listen to podcasts.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.480
You can read books.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.120
You can follow amazing
people on social media,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.230
or you can do the opposite.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.020
And so with this, we
challenge everybody

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.500
to come up with their
board of advisors.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.470
Run yourself like a
business, because you are.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.850
You are your brand.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.500
You are your life.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.260
So we divide this
into three areas--

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:10.680
your health, your business,
and your recreation.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.620
I want you to think about
right now three people

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:20.850
in each one of these spots that
you want to spend time with.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.920
Who's going to motivate
you to work out?

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.640
Who wants to go
get an acai bowl?

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.280
Who would help
you start an idea?

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.480
Who thinks it's cool to
read books on the weekends?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.730
Who would challenge
you on a weekend

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.600
instead of going out to
brunch to go rock climbing

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.680
or go on an adventurous trip?

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.260
These are the type of
people we need to spend

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.520
the majority of our time with.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.740
We must realize that
you make the choice.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.930
Now this isn't easy, because
a lot of us are sunk in.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:01.510
You've had friends since you've
been growing up, which is fine.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.930
But we need to just
realize that we can still

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:08.070
decide, through so many
different mediums now, that we

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.683
can create this epic
board of advisors.

00:32:11.683 --> 00:32:13.100
JASON LOEBIG: I
think the toughest

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.710
thing about considering
some of these relationships

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:19.370
in this list are maybe the
people that don't actually

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.020
make it.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.260
So a lot of us have had these
foundational relationships

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.140
for a very long
time, but just as we

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.200
can consider the
relationships in our life that

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.620
are essential to us, like
who might make up the three

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.760
people you trust with
your health the most,

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.440
it's also really,
really important

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.200
to evaluate the relationships
in your life, which

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.010
no longer serve you, that no
longer serve your purpose, that

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:50.300
no longer serve your self-care,
and that no longer serve where

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.880
you want to go in your future.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.680
And these are the
hardest relationships

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.360
to consider, because
they're the ones

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.580
that you need to let go of.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.598
And I don't mean
"let go of" like you

00:33:01.598 --> 00:33:03.140
stop talking to your
drinking buddies

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.810
from college or the kids you
went to grade school with.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.230
You can very much still love
them, still tell them that.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:14.575
You just simply divert less of
your energy in their direction.

00:33:14.575 --> 00:33:16.700
The other thing that's
really important to consider

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.890
is how flexible this list is.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:25.270
So by recreation, we
mean what you do for fun.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.160
The people that you
drank with in college,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.300
you may no longer be
that close with as you

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.400
start to have children.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.930
You hang out with whomever
your kids are hanging out with.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.060
So the things that
you care about

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.620
are going to change based on
the condition of your life.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.610
And they also certainly change
based on what you care about

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.660
and who you care about.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.930
So constantly evaluating
these relationships,

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.750
and not in a shallow
way, but just in a way

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.127
that you know that who you
surround yourself with matters.

00:33:57.127 --> 00:33:58.210
It really, really matters.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.450
It has a huge effect.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.810
You start caring about the same
things that they care about.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.390
What car do they drive, and
what house do they live in?

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.520
Where do I want to go on trips?

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.630
What do I do for fun?

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.088
What are you doing
on the weekends?

00:34:10.088 --> 00:34:11.719
Like, what are you doing later?

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.190
Those things seep into
your own lifestyle,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.710
and if we don't
consider it, they

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.239
start to creep in a little bit.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.040
So if you've got your
phone on you right now,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.730
Bret and I are all about
taking action right away.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.552
I'd like to introduce
just one quick activity.

00:34:27.552 --> 00:34:29.510
We'd like you to show
your gratitude right now.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.627
So if you have you phone,
please take it out.

00:34:31.627 --> 00:34:33.210
This is the only
time you can do that.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.699
Take it out, and text
somebody on that board

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.850
of advisors-- health,
business, recreation,

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.563
[INAUDIBLE] relationships.

00:34:40.563 --> 00:34:41.980
My mom's sitting
in the front row.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:47.219
So by default, text your mom,
if you're not quite sure.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.100
I want you to explicitly
communicate to them

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.679
why you trust them
and why you want

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.090
them to hold you accountable.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.159
That's the most important part.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.130
This is not like, hey, I rely
on you for health information.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.270
Like, thank you.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.360
No, I'm relying on you
to keep me on track.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.910
So first, please ask
them for permission.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.240
Say, please.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.120
Tell them to have the
best day ever, and then

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.420
definitely don't let them down.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.420
That's the biggest part.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.990
If you want a quick prompt,
I wrote one to Bret.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.990
[INAUDIBLE] Live Better.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.115
Talks at Google right now--

00:35:19.115 --> 00:35:20.600
I'm evaluating my relationships.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.310
You're on my health
team, and I want

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.830
you to keep me on track with
my training and nutrition.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:28.100
Please let me know if
you're OK with that.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.210
I appreciate you, and I want
to say thank you in advance.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.500
So if you're not quite
sure what to write,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.740
just swap out "Bret"
for someone else

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.030
that you trust with your health.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.910
This is really
important, because we

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.860
have to consider why
we're doing this.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.310
You're the easiest person
in the whole room to fool.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.480
So creating some
outside accountability

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.720
is really, really important.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.390
They're giving an
objective viewpoint.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.432
When you spend that time
thinking about yourself,

00:35:58.432 --> 00:36:00.230
you're victimizing
yourself a little bit.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.240
Get out of your
own head by asking

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.520
somebody else for advice.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.590
So while you're finishing up
sending this very nice text

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:13.010
message, I'm going
to let Bret explain

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.860
a little bit about
his story and how

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.920
Bret has used this concept
of board of advisors

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.010
and really considering
how the people in his life

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.490
have changed it.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:27.850
BRET GORNIK: So this is
one of my favorite quotes.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.530
"Set your life on fire.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.990
Seek those who fan your flames."

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:37.040
So two health guys
coming up here talking--

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.880
we run every day.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.450
We work out.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:39.050
We teach.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.575
We eat green juice.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.640
I want to give you guys a
little anecdote about myself.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.320
I was a savage in college.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.920
I've drank more than
any of you in this room.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.930
JASON LOEBIG: Combined.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:00.760
BRET GORNIK: Combined.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.964
Jason and I met under
those circumstances.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:10.910
I was a bartender I would
chug bottles of Rumple Minze.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.760
I would drink 20 beers before
I would go out to the bar.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.190
I would proceed to take
my shirt off in the bar.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.050
I didn't give a shit.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.250
So I came from there.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:28.660
That was me in college,
after I graduated.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.980
I thought that's what life was.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.100
I thought that my value
was being that guy,

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.878
being the MVP on spring break.

00:37:36.878 --> 00:37:37.920
What does that even mean?

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:46.030
But it was when I
found my purpose,

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.680
I started to realize
that wasn't me.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.060
Now I still go just as
hard, but in health.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:59.300
So I surrounded myself with
those that fanned my flames--

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.690
my wife, Jason,
all of my friends

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.490
that are in this industry.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.480
And it was hard.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.730
I've had friends since
I was in high school

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.800
that I still consider
my best friends.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.960
But I spend a lot
less time with them.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.872
Why did I do that?

00:38:19.872 --> 00:38:20.580
So I can be here.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:28.230
It was not easy, and days
go by where it's tough.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:36.940
But it's worth it when
you have a purpose.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.890
And it means something when
those people reach out to you

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:45.150
for advice, when they
come to you, because you

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.940
are doing something
that seems so bizarre.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.618
How do you make
money doing that?

00:38:50.618 --> 00:38:51.910
Are you sure you want to leave?

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.950
You don't have a for 401(k).

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.490
Fuck that.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.470
My purpose was found.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:00.550
I found that.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.670
You have to find that.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.680
Then you have to
surround yourself

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.650
by the people that elevate
you, that bring you up

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.500
to another level, and
that's not going to be easy.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.260
Nothing about
doing this is easy.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.390
If it was easy,
everybody would do it.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.150
There's nothing fun about easy.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:25.070
So we want to offer you guys
ways in which we can do this

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.740
together.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.830
JASON LOEBIG: So at Live Better,
this is exactly the community

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.540
that we're trying to build.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.320
We run wellness retreats,
like the video that you saw,

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.380
which is kind of our
ultimate experience.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.010
It's where you get to explore
things and ideas like this

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.720
and have conversations
with other people

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.770
that care about things
like this every single day.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:51.490
And you get to do it in an
environment and setting that

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.240
doesn't distract you.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.150
We've got touch
points in Chicago,

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.130
like a book club we
host once a month.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.060
Lots of people in
this room are in it.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.710
So we meet up.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.020
We also get people
to Google Hangout

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.360
in from all over the place.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.590
We run events during the summer
like rooftop yoga or dinners.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:15.150
We train private clients
and do one-on-one coaching.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:19.140
We try and provide as
many different outlets

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:24.120
to help you be accountable to
what it is you want to achieve.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.770
We've got to wake up Wednesday--

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.700
newsletter that comes out
every Wednesday morning

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.080
that we try and make
motivational and a little bit

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.240
educational to get your week--

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.840
to give your week a
little bit of momentum.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.630
We've got this podcast, where we
have interesting conversations

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.180
with people that are thinking
about life and business

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.450
a little bit different.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.980
These are all ways in
which we found inspiration

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.280
from other people and are
paying that forward back

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.440
to our clients and community.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.380
And that brings us to our
third principle, which

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.520
is adapted from a
Bill Gates quote,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.070
and he talks about in a
decade, but I don't even

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.850
know what I'm doing next week.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.388
So we've shrunk
it down a little.

00:41:04.388 --> 00:41:06.680
It's that people overestimate
what they can do in a day

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.410
and underestimate what
they can do in a year.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.170
Most of us enter every
day extremely stressed.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.990
We're overwhelmed.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:14.782
We're running from one
meeting to the next.

00:41:14.782 --> 00:41:16.490
It's this text message,
this phone call.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:18.490
We're on the phone, feeding
the kid in the back,

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.840
driving with our knee,
posting to our Instagram

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.743
at the same time.

00:41:22.743 --> 00:41:24.660
We're depressed about
what happened yesterday.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.618
We're anxious about what
might happen tomorrow,

00:41:26.618 --> 00:41:29.750
and we're stressed about
what's happening right now.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:33.110
We feel like life's getting
a little bit out of control.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.202
It's like, ah, I was
too busy to workout.

00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:37.160
No, you didn't prioritize
the time to work out.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.090
You let something else happen.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:42.490
What happens if we
reframe those emotions?

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.010
What happens if we are grateful
for what happened yesterday,

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.590
hopeful for what we
get to do tomorrow,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.680
and just content to be where
our feet are right now?

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:56.062
You're in this room, taking
just an hour out of your day,

00:41:56.062 --> 00:41:57.520
even if you take
nothing away, just

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.220
to listen to a different
viewpoint, somebody who's

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.470
doing something a little bit
different from their life

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:07.870
with what you might be
doing, and that is impactful.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.040
And that is important.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.310
So how do we create that
on a day-to-day basis?

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.890
It's by creating the
structure, framework,

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.050
and the people
surrounding us to apply

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.860
better goal-setting
strategies to execute that.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.720
It's doing the right things,
being effective, and doing them

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.430
well, which is being efficient.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.040
It's marrying those
two things together.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.540
That is ultimately
where we start

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.740
to move to accumulate
all of these best days

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.870
ever into this longer life.

00:42:37.068 --> 00:42:38.610
BRET GORNIK: So one
of the ways we do

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.500
this is through goal-setting.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.360
And we break this goal-setting
down into four different areas.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.070
Macro-- what is the goal?

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:50.082
So Jason and I have never
run a marathon in our lives,

00:42:50.082 --> 00:42:52.290
and we're not just going to
run the Chicago marathon,

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:53.415
but we're going to race it.

00:42:53.415 --> 00:42:55.165
We're going to do it
in under three hours.

00:42:55.165 --> 00:42:56.370
We've decided on that goal.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:58.320
We're going to start
with a health example,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.237
and then we'll just give
you guys another one.

00:43:00.237 --> 00:43:04.155
So we break that down into meso,
meso goals, smaller chunks.

00:43:04.155 --> 00:43:06.330
If you've ever watched
me on my Instagram,

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:09.630
throw up these monthly goals.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.960
That is the goal for the month.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.650
So in August, we're going to run
40 miles a week, because that

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:15.720
will feed in to the macro goal.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.000
Then we break it down
one step further, micro--

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.370
what are you doing
today for that meso goal

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.940
and that macro goal?

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.690
Today, we're going to
run four miles easy,

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:26.880
get our pace up, feel good.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.033
All great.

00:43:28.033 --> 00:43:28.950
You got your planners.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:29.780
You got the stickers.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.540
You got the notes.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.570
You got all these
awesome ways to track it.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.300
That's number four.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.600
How do we track it?

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.530
So for this example,
we use the Nike app.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.750
So we're able to run
with our app, track it.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.225
There's a community
on there to get

00:43:43.225 --> 00:43:45.600
people involved so that people
can see what you're doing.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.730
You have to be motivated.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:48.720
We look at each
others' all the time,

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.600
so tracking is super important.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.610
Without tracking,
that cool sheet

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.400
of paper with the sticky
notes and all that on there

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.810
doesn't mean shit,
because you won't do it.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.350
So let's think about
another example.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.800
And again, we're not trying
to be shallow with this one,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.810
but let's talk
about relationships.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.300
Jason and I are both
happily married,

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.990
and one of the tools
that I use is--

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:15.080
another plug here--

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.900
Google Calendar to schedule time
for two things, three things.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.040
Number one, time for
myself throughout my day,

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.180
which has a lot of different
things going on, to just think

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.370
about my relationships--

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.630
my wife, my friends,
and my family.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:36.790
So once a week, 30 minutes
just to think about it--

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.050
no objective, no goal.

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.990
I'm going to do that.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.390
It's on my calendar.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:43.290
Number two is
every single month,

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.170
I write three gratitude
letters to people

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.350
that inspire me, friends,
family, people that I've never

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.760
met, just to share that up.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.830
And then four is scheduling
events with my wife.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:56.402
There's nothing
wrong with that--

00:44:56.402 --> 00:45:01.250
dinners, fun nights out,
conversations about things

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.410
that aren't easy to talk about.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.320
I have to do that, and it works.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.970
So it's OK to schedule things
out in your relationships.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:10.530
It's OK to do things like that.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.030
It's great.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.750
You are putting forth
effort to be your best self.

00:45:19.151 --> 00:45:24.040
JASON LOEBIG: Our sort
of final ending thought--

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.560
if you've never heard the
man in the arena quote,

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.970
I'm going to read it for you.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.980
If you have heard it
before, please just

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.740
consider how it might affect
you within the context

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.950
of the things that
we're talking about.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:37.750
It's powerful enough to
take time to read it to you.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.840
So, "It is not the
critic who counts,

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.610
not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles,

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.650
or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.430
The credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena,

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:56.360
whose face is marred by
dust and sweat and blood,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.730
who strives valiantly, who
errs, who comes up short again

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:04.360
and again, because there
is no effort without error

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.530
and shortcoming, but
who does actually

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.750
strive to do the
deeds, who knows

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:13.290
great enthusiasms, the great
devotions, who spends himself

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:17.070
in a worthy cause, who,
at best, knows in the end

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.800
the triumph of high achievement,
and who, at the worst,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.810
if he fails, at least
fails while daring greatly

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.470
so that his place shall never
be with those cold and timid

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:32.250
souls, who neither know
victory nor defeat."

00:46:34.717 --> 00:46:36.550
This quote encompasses
so many of the things

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:37.960
that we talked about--

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.260
just trying and doing
it, doing things

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.390
with enthusiasm and
a positive mindset.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.060
The worthy cause
is your purpose.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.607
You can think about having your
best day ever all you want.

00:46:48.607 --> 00:46:50.440
You can map out your
New Year's resolutions.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.290
You can map out your
perfect marathon PR time.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:55.060
You can think about
that side hustle

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.250
you considered once or that trip
you want to take in the future,

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.140
but if you don't
actually do it--

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.850
Nike got this right
from the start.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:04.830
Just do it.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:09.050
If you don't actually do it, the
perfect plan you never follow

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:10.088
is worthless.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.000
You're working out the
perfect rep scheme.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.180
The perfect workout
is the worst one,

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.770
if you don't go out and do it.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.190
And those cold and timid souls--

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:26.890
that's a little bit powerful--
sitting on the sidelines--

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:28.660
those are the people
critiquing you

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.440
that have never tried
to do what you've done.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.080
Social media has been a
little bit bad about this.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.190
We can just sit behind our
phone or computer and comment.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.200
Somebody who else
is living their life

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.380
and trying to do something
with it, and that judgment

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.820
is creeping in and causing
a little self-doubt.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:50.030
Fuck that.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:51.560
You're the one in the arena.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.698
You're the one putting
your foot forward.

00:47:53.698 --> 00:47:55.740
It doesn't matter if you
fail, only that you try.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:01.430
The strength that comes from
trying creates consistency.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:06.532
We encourage you to get
out there and do it.

00:48:06.532 --> 00:48:11.180
BRET GORNIK: And so from there,
we end with one key point

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.680
that Jason just mentioned.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.260
None of this matters, if
you don't go do anything.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.490
None of it matters if
you don't go do anything.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.170
Consistency is everything.

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.380
You must do it every single day.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.350
You're tired?

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.170
You still got to
get your workout in.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:33.430
You had a rough meeting?

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:35.500
You still got to
get your vibe up.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.920
All of these things must
happen consistently,

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.428
because it creates momentum.

00:48:40.428 --> 00:48:42.220
Like I mentioned with
that morning routine,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.040
kind of joking about writing a
book, how do you think authors

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:45.980
write books?

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.930
They write.

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:50.260
You are a professional
in your life.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.930
That is a different
mindset than an amateur.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.280
The amateur does it.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.270
They go for the run.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.100
They jog.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.380
No, we're professionals.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.310
Every single one of you here
is a professional in your life.

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.130
And the only way to be the
best professional you can

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:07.720
is through consistency.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.858
It creates a positive
snowball effect.

00:49:09.858 --> 00:49:12.025
You roll that ball down the
hill, it gains momentum.

00:49:12.025 --> 00:49:13.820
You start bringing people in.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.070
You start highlighting things.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.900
You start going to
events like this.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.150
You make yourself
your best self.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:25.150
JASON LOEBIG: I think the
true purpose of self-care

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.070
and why we kind
of start with that

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.530
is what you get to
do with it after.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.900
It's not-- the end game
is not nice-looking abs

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.330
and a slim waistline.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:39.500
You've been working
on losing weight.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.000
Great.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.667
You lost weight.

00:49:40.667 --> 00:49:41.515
Now what?

00:49:41.515 --> 00:49:43.210
What are you going to do?

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:47.140
Is this a lighter, happier,
stronger human being?

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.100
You focused on
running this race.

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:49.600
Great.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.100
You finish.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.020
Now what?

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.580
This is what self-care is.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.808
It's taking that and
applying all the things

00:49:55.808 --> 00:49:57.600
that you learned from
doing it and that you

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.190
gained from doing
it, and it's just

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.990
helping the people around you.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:03.060
You're not quite sure
what your purpose is yet.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.190
How about starting
exactly where you're

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.690
at with what you're
capable of doing

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.030
to help the person sitting
next to you, to help somebody

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:10.330
in your community?

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:11.820
I don't care if
it's volunteering

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:16.064
10 minutes of your time,
$10 of your income.

00:50:16.064 --> 00:50:18.560
What you do with your energy--

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.750
that's what matters.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:24.290
That's where we turn
self-care into purpose.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:26.100
That is the next step.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.950
There's another
great Rumi quote that

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:29.780
says, "Live life
as if everything

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.540
is rigged in your favor."

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.740
And it ties back
to "The Alchemist,"

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.440
that the whole world
is conspiring to help

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.140
you do what you need to do.

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.600
And then when shit
hits the fan, that's

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.520
why we have all
these strategies.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:49.050
When you get injured mid-racing
cycle, when you have something

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:52.320
go horribly wrong in
your personal life amidst

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.230
the best stretch of
your professional life,

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:57.890
how do you handle that?

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:01.870
Without energy, no chance.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:03.770
That's where this
becomes super important.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.890
It's your responsibility
to show up

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:09.350
like a professional
with your tank full.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.020
You have the opportunity
to make an impact

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.290
on the world on your own terms.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.290
And if you let
it, the world will

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:21.600
dictate what that is, instead
of the other way around.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.190
This is how we get to live
our best life every single day

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:28.890
and what it means to have the
best day ever every single day.

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.890
BRET GORNIK: So we have
one final activity.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.630
Everybody, stand up.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.532
So we're going to
try to go viral.

00:51:35.532 --> 00:51:36.990
I brought my selfie
stick, so we're

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.800
going to do a
little video, where

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.325
I'm going to cue everybody to
say, "Have the best day ever."

00:51:41.325 --> 00:51:42.700
And I'm not just
going to say it.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.160
Zach, I need you to yell it.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.840
Everybody here, you
have to yell it.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.955
You guys ready?

00:51:46.955 --> 00:51:47.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.450
BRET GORNIK: All right,
we're going to do that again.

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:49.242
Are you guys ready?

00:51:49.242 --> 00:51:49.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.918
BRET GORNIK: All right.

00:51:50.918 --> 00:51:54.540
So I'm going to say, 1, 2,
3, and then everybody says,

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.912
have the best day ever.

00:51:56.912 --> 00:51:58.334
All right?

00:51:58.334 --> 00:51:59.760
JASON LOEBIG: [LAUGHING]

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.330
BRET GORNIK: Are we live?

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:01.055
JASON LOEBIG: Make
sure it's recording.

00:52:01.055 --> 00:52:01.540
BRET GORNIK: Oh, we're live.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:01.980
JASON LOEBIG: Yeah, we're on.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.620
We're in it.

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.060
BRET GORNIK: You guys good?

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:03.690
JASON LOEBIG:
Yeah, you count it.

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:04.260
BRET GORNIK: I'm
going to be going--

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.540
like, I want screams
and high fives

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.090
and jumping jacks, hugs,
kisses, whatever you want to do.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:10.660
All right, are we ready?

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.250
Are we hyped?

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:11.760
Let's go.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.420
Come on.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.212
Let's get it going.

00:52:13.212 --> 00:52:13.820
Let's go.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.210
All right.

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.755
So it's going to be 1, 2, 3,
and then we're going to say,

00:52:17.755 --> 00:52:18.280
all right.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:18.780
Ready?

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.400
JASON LOEBIG:
That's a good swing.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.790
BRET GORNIK: One, two, three.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:25.498
ALL: Have the best day ever.

00:52:25.498 --> 00:52:26.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:27.590
BRET GORNIK: Let's go!

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:29.680
Let's go!

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.910
Talks at Google, what up?

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.340
JASON LOEBIG: We hope that--

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.650
we hope that everybody
can live better.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:41.560
We thank you guys very,
very much for coming.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:45.810
[APPLAUSE]
