00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:01.938
In the late 1950s,

00:00:01.938 --> 00:00:04.440
William Phillips noticed a correlation

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.348
between unemployment and inflation

00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:09.604
and I have a picture of this gentleman right over here,

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:10.746
Irving Fisher

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:13.681
because he actually noticed that relationship a few decades before

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.771
but the relationship has taken on Phillips's name really because

00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.272
his publication kind of captured people's imagination

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:24.520
and the relationship is not that surprising

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.271
it seems to fall a little bit out of common sense

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.770
but we'll talk about examples that seem to go against this relationship

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.012
If I were to plot the unemployment percentage right here

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:40.211
on my horizontal axis

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:45.349
and I plot inflation on my vertical axis,

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:51.347
so let me put inflation here

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:53.937
Then he noticed, (and I'm just gonna pick random data points)

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:59.081
but in one year where there was high inflation, there was low unemployment

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:00.346
and then in another year,

00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:03.015
where there was high unemployment, there was low inflation

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:05.185
and it's not clear which one's causing which

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.210
or maybe they both circle back on each other

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.475
and then in other years, maybe where you had medium inflation

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:15.208
or relatively low unemployment

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:19.184
so he looked at a bunch of years and plotted them on an axis like this

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:20.934
(let me do them all in the same color)

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:22.099
so you take a bunch of years

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.935
and you plot them here

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:28.747
so now you have higher inflation, slightly higher unemployment than that year over there

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:32.209
and I could just keep plotting some points over here

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:33.934
you could have deflation

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.476
and what he saw is that there's a correlation here

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:37.850
that there's an inverse relationship

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.681
that if you were trying to fit a curve to these points

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:44.270
and you could have more points here, I'm just picking them at random,

00:01:44.347 --> 00:01:50.407
you could fit a curve that looks something like this

00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:54.676
generally saying, when you have high inflation,

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:59.075
so when you're up here, you have high inflation

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:10.157
and low unemployment

00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:11.943
the low unemployment part is a good thing

00:02:11.943 --> 00:02:22.835
and now here you have low inflation and high unemployment

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:29.241
and if this curve goes below the horizontal axis you would actually have deflation

00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:32.074
and it makes reasonable sense

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:35.405
we've kind of talked bout it in common sense terms before

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:39.405
but you can imagine - once again, it's not clear which one's causing which -

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:41.943
but you can imagine a world, just reasoning through it,

00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:46.624
that if you have low unemployment, or you could view that as high employment,

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:55.217
one way to view low unemployment is that you have a high utilisation of the labour market

00:02:55.217 --> 00:03:05.482
well, now, in this situation, workers have more leverage

00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:07.274
and if workers have more leverage

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:12.738
then employers will have to increase wages

00:03:12.738 --> 00:03:15.276
to attract and retain employees

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:18.034
they have more leverage and they have more options

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:19.905
there are a lot of people looking to hire them

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:36.403
employers raise wages to attract and retain employees

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:41.570
but of course when you increase wages you're increasing buying power, generally for workers

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:51.677
so this is increasing workers' buying power

00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:54.402
which would increase their demand

00:03:58.385 --> 00:03:59.815
for goods and services

00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:02.009
and if they're increasing the demand for goods and services,

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.070
they're going to increase the utilisation of all of the factors of production:

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.276
of land, of capital, of entrepreneurship,

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:14.234
and of labour, so that's going to lower unemployment even more

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:16.735
and you can imagine if you already have low unemployment,

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:19.481
and this is just one of the factors of production,

00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:23.029
but if you think about all factors of productions, they are probably all highly utilised

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.568
the factories are running at close to full capacity

00:04:25.568 --> 00:04:28.342
the labour market is running at full capacity

00:04:28.342 --> 00:04:33.215
if you increase buying power, if you increase demand in that context,

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:35.068
so demand is going up

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:41.276
lower unemployment, labour utilisation is going down

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.067
there's less capacity, more demand

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:45.816
this is going to cause prices to go up

00:04:45.816 --> 00:04:52.149
so this is going to cause prices generally to go up

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:57.609
and then if prices go up, now workers have leverage and options of employment

00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:02.942
but they also have higher cost

00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:06.903
higher cost of living

00:05:06.903 --> 00:05:09.149
and this is a very kind of hand, wavy diagram,

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:11.546
but it's just to make you think about the overall dynamics

00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:14.009
so workers have more options and leverage

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.482
they also have a higher cost of living,

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:20.148
the whole economy is kind of operating at close to full tilt

00:05:20.148 --> 00:05:23.093
and so they're going to demand higher wages even more

00:05:23.093 --> 00:05:26.076
and then this thing can keep cycling and keep cycling

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.215
now, this seems a bit common sense,

00:05:28.215 --> 00:05:30.481
but there are exceptions to these

00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:34.275
in the 1970s, the US experienced stagflation

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:39.481
and that's kind of the worst: that's high inflation and high unemployment

00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:41.730
so that is right over here

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.147
and things that could cause it

00:05:43.147 --> 00:05:45.980
and particularly what people point to in the 1970s,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.761
and it's always important to realise that in economics people don't know for sure what was the exact cause

00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:54.147
and there seldom is only one cause

00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:56.480
but one of the things that's often pointed to

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.753
is that you had a supply shock

00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:04.000
and the supply shock was in oil

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.145
it made the cost of producing everything more expensive

00:06:07.145 --> 00:06:09.343
and so that just drove the prices up

00:06:09.343 --> 00:06:15.145
but really didn't allow the country as a whole to become more productive

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:18.730
one way to think about it is it drove the prices up here

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.395
causing a higher cost of living right over here

00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:28.076
but this part of this cycle that we associate with low unemployment and high inflation

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:32.119
was not occurring

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:37.811
and because those higher prices were essentially going out of the country,

00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:43.895
you could essentially imagine that they were squeezing out people's ability to pay for other things

00:06:43.895 --> 00:06:46.676
so the higher cost of living

00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:48.228
or the higher prices for oil

00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:51.359
you could draw a line from either one and I know it's getting messy now

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:56.977
you can imagine that it inhibited demand for domestic production

00:06:56.977 --> 00:06:59.565
so I'll draw "negative feedback" right over there

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:03.310
so it squeezed out people's desire to buy things because they had to pay so much for oil

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.643
and there's other explanations for it

00:07:05.643 --> 00:07:09.977
when people saw the low unemployment, the government wanted to print even more money

00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:15.393
to fuel things, but it did not get this virtual cycle happening

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.245
there were some arguments that there were structural reasons

00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:21.677
why the economy couldn't adapt properly

00:07:21.677 --> 00:07:26.087
so that employees and resources couldn't be allocated efficiently

00:07:26.087 --> 00:07:31.308
but the whole point of bringing up the 1970s is to show you that this isn't a law

00:07:31.308 --> 00:07:33.476
it's not clear what's causing what

00:07:33.476 --> 00:07:37.582
that there was a situation in the 1970s where you had stagflation

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:42.476
and the opposite of that was what we really saw in the late 90s

00:07:42.476 --> 00:07:48.011
where you had relatively low inflation and you had relatively low unemployment

00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:51.142
so this is a very good situation that we had in the late 90s

00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:54.808
and the argument that many people make why we were able to do that,

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.742
why this cycle didn't keep going on and on

00:07:57.742 --> 00:08:04.226
why the prices didn't go up is that you had this other trend of huge technological improvement

00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:12.141
you had computers, and telecommunications, the Internet, this kind of super productivity curve

00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:18.678
so even though you had the cycle, you had increased buying power, demand was going up,

00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:21.610
the proactivity of the country was increasing so much

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.389
that it did not lead to inflation

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:27.474
so that's what threw us there in the late 90s

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:29.550
so, in general, it's a neat thing to think about,

00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:33.056
at least to some degree it seems like common sense,

00:08:33.056 --> 00:08:38.342
but like in all things in economics, it's always a little bit more nuanced and complicated

00:08:38.342 --> 00:08:42.557
than just some little correlation that you might observe

00:08:42.557 --> 00:08:46.557
this could be generally true but there's always going to be exceptions to it
