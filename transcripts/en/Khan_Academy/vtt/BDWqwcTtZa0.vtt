00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
 

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.340
In this video we're going
to talk about the French

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.750
Revolution.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.370
And what makes this especially
significant is that not only

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.650
is this independence from a
monarchy-controlled empire,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.130
like in the American
independence, this is an

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.230
actual overthrowing
of a monarchy.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.350
A monarchy that controls
a major world power.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.540
Depending on how you view it,
the American Revolution came

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.770
first and kind of put out the
principles of self-governance

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.730
and why do we need kings
and all of that.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.520
But the French Revolution was
the first time that those type

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.160
of principles really took foot
in Europe and really overthrew

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.050
a monarchy.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.600
So just to understand kind of
the environment in which this

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.190
began, let's talk about what
France was like in 1789.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.260
Which most people kind of view
as the beginning of the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.190
Revolution.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.825
One, France was poor.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:03.870
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.210
Now, you wouldn't think that
France was poor, if you looked

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.860
at Louis XVI, who was
king of France.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.400
If you looked at Louis XVI,
and the clothes he wore.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.400
If you looked at
Marie-Antoinette, his wife,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.590
they don't look poor.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.050
They lived in the palace of

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.410
Versailles, which is ginormous.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.450
It's this massive palace, it
would compare to the greatest

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.090
palaces in the world.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.430
They were living a
lavish lifestyle.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.360
Just in case you want to know
where this is, this is what's

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.890
now almost a suburb of Paris.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.720
But at the time it was a village
20 or 30 kilometers

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.790
away from Paris.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.630
So they don't seem to be poor.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.360
But the the actual government
of France is poor.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.190
And when I say poor,
they're in debt.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.420
They've just had two major
military adventures.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.775
One was the American
Revolution.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:59.720
 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.880
They played a major part
in supporting the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.670
revolutionaries.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.070
Because they wanted to
stick it to their

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.300
enemy, Great Britain.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.800
They wanted their empire
to shrink a little bit.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.250
So France sent significant
military help and resources.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.910
And you could imagine, that's
not a cheap thing when you're

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.200
doing it across the
Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.300
And even before the American
Revolution, the Seven Years'

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:30.620
War that ended in 1763, this
really drained the amount of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.430
wealth that the French
government had.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.190
And for those of you who are
more American history focused,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.080
the Seven Years' War is really
the same thing as the French

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.660
and Indian War.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.220
The French and Indian War was
the North American theater of

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.140
the Seven Years' War.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.980
But the Seven Years' War is
the more general term.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.160
Because there was also a
conflict going on in Europe

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.970
simultaneously.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.710
The French and Indian
War and it was just

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.510
part of that conflict.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.090
And the Seven Years' actually
engulfed most of the powers of

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.880
Europe at the time.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.440
So France had participated in
this, ended in 1763, you had

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.770
the American Revolution.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.320
Both of these really just
drained the amount of funds

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.730
that the government
itself had.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.890
At the same time, the French
people were starving.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.950
 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.350
There was a generalized
famine at the time.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.650
They weren't producing enough
grain, people couldn't get

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.690
their bread to eat.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.040
So you can imagine,
when people are

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.650
starving they're not happy.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.970
And to kind of add insult to
injury, you would see your

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.350
royals living like this.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.130
But even worse than the royals,
who you don't see

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.610
every day, you saw
your nobility.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.990
Who is roughly a little over
1.5% of the population.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.500
But you saw the nobility really,
really, living it up.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:45.720
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.840
And the nobility, just so you
know, these are people with

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.110
fancy titles who inherit land
and wealth from generation to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.120
generation.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.840
They don't dress too differently
from the king.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.950
And they essentially live in
smaller versions of the palace

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.780
of Versailles.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.570
And if you're a peasant, you
work on their fields, do all

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.540
the work, you send them
some of your crops

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.590
and they pay no taxes.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.020
So from your point of view,
and it's not hard to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.040
understand why you would think
this, these are essentially

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.660
kind of parasites who are
completely ignoring the fact

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.670
that you are starving
and you're

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.779
paying all of the taxes.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.550
You can imagine people weren't
too happy about that.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.680
And then to top it all off,
you had all of these

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.450
philosophers hanging around
talking about the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.700
Enlightenment.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.520
 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.140
And this is kind of the whole
movement where people, and

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.340
authors, and poets, and
philosophers, are starting to

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.150
realize that, gee, maybe
we don't need kings.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.980
Maybe we don't need priests to
tell us what it means to be

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.560
good or bad.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.420
Maybe people could
essentially rule

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.830
themselves all of a sudden.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.620
And obviously, the biggest proof
of the Enlightenment was

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.520
the American Revolution.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.980
That was kind of the first
example of people rising up

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.960
and saying, we don't need
these kings anymore.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.460
We want to govern ourselves.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.080
For the people, by the people.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.750
So you also had kind of
this philosophical

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.820
movement going around.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.480
Now if you ask me my opinion of
what the biggest thing was,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.810
I think the people starving,
you can never underestimate

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.960
what people are willing to do
when they're actually hungry.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.440
And, this is kind
of more from the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.390
intellectual point of view.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.730
People said, oh there's
Enlightenment movement here.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.270
So this is the state
of France.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.980
They had a financial crisis.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.860
So a meeting was called, kind
of an emergency meeting, of

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.560
the major groups of France to
try to resolve some of these

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.340
problems. It's a fiscal crisis,
people are starving,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.240
what do you do?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.725
So they called the Convocation
of the Estates-General.

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:43.060
Let me write that down.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:54.310
 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.880
Which was a meeting of the
three estates of France.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.440
Now what are the three
estates of France?

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.210
You can really just view them
as the three major social

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.120
classes of France.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.690
The First Estate
was the clergy.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.790
The Second Estate
is the nobility.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.480
And then the Third Estate
is everyone else.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:26.870
 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.910
And this gives you a sense
of how skewed the

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.750
power structure was.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.550
Because people kind of grouped
the power as OK, these are the

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.520
three groups and maybe they can
vote against each other.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.570
But this was only 0.5% of the
population, this is 1.5% of

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.240
the population, this was
98% of the population.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.330
But these people had equal
weight with these guys.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.890
But these people had the burden
of most of the taxes.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.050
These are the people who are
doing all the work, producing

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.650
all of France's wealth,
dying in the wars.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.570
But these guys, despite their
small population, have more

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.350
weight than everybody else.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.760
So you had the Convocation of
the Estates-General, where

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.170
representatives of these three
estates met at the Palace of

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.940
Versailles to essentially figure
out what to do about

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.870
this fiscal crisis.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.160
Now obviously, these people
right here, the Third Estate,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.970
they were angry.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.910
They were like look, we've taken
the burden on ourselves

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.900
for much of the recent
history of France.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.530
We're tired of you guys getting
away with not paying

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.230
taxes and just kind of
leeching off of us.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.230
They were afraid that even more
of the tax burden was

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.050
going to be put on them.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.970
And the nobility, or the king,
or the clergy, that they

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.240
wouldn't have to make
sacrifices.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.280
So they came in already angry.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.400
And so they really wanted to
meet in one big room together.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.460
Because they actually had
roughly 600 representatives.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.460
Which only the king at the
last minute agreed to.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.770
Before, it was only going to
be equal numbers of them.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.090
These guys had 300 roughly.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.550
These guys had 300 as well.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.580
These guys were able to say,
hey we're 98% of the

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.740
population, maybe we should
have at least 600

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.660
representative.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.050
But even there, they wanted
to meet in the same room.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.930
And essentially try to
make it so it's one

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.410
representative, one vote.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.610
But obviously these other
estates, the clergy and the

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.140
nobility, said no, let's
each vote as estates.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.200
And at the end of the day, these
guys lost. So they were

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.440
essentially forced to kind of
organize independently as a

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:19.850
Third Estate.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.020
So that made them
even angrier.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.960
So they met at an assembly hall
and said, if these guys

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.210
are going to ignore us, not
only are we going to be in

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.720
this room and start organizing
ourselves.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.990
But we're not going to call this
the Convocation of the

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.340
Estates-General.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.289
We're going to declare
that we are the

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.724
National Assembly of France.

00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:45.390
 

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.950
That we represent the people.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.600
We are essentially going
to become the

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.680
parliamentary body of France.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.940
Instead of just being this
emergency Convocation of the

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.500
Estates-General.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.750
And they actually got some
sympathy from some elements of

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.970
the clergy and some elements
of the nobility.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:04.590
Now obviously, Louis XVI
was not amused by this

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.620
whole turn of events.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.180
Here he was, he was an absolute
monarch, which means

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.230
that he held pretty much all of
the power to do whatever he

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.130
saw was fit.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.150
And all of a sudden you had this
group of upstarts taking

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.910
advantage of this emergency
situation where he can't

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.090
continue to buy as many silk
robes as he was before.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.840
They're taking advantage of
the situation to declare a

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.600
National Assembly of France.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.880
To declare somehow that I'm
not an absolute monarch.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.580
That my power is going to be
taken by this assembly.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.310
So he wasn't happy.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.180
So when they took a break,
he locked the door of the

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.820
assembly room.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.520
So they couldn't get in.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.690
And he said, oh I think
there needs to be some

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.350
repairs in that room.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.660
Maybe you all can
assemble later.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.730
And that was kind of his
way of saying no.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.050
If you're declaring you're the
National Assembly of France,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.230
I'm not going to even
let you assemble.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.510
I'm not even going to let
you get in the room.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.170
So that clearly didn't do a lot
to make these guys, or in

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.510
particular these guys,
any happier.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.640
People are hungry.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.950
These people are living
lavishly.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.900
They've already been
not allowed to

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.310
vote in one room together.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.900
When they vote in their own
room, and declare themselves

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.700
as representatives of the people
of France, which they

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.350
really are, the king locks the
room, doesn't let them go in.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.030
So they go to an indoor tennis
court in Versailles.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.220
This is a picture of
it right here.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.680
This is an indoor
tennis court.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.150
 

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.310
And that gives you an idea of
how lavish Versailles was,

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:32.050
that it had an indoor tennis
court in the late 1700s.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.770
And they proclaimed the
Tennis Court Oath.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:41.790
 

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.960
Where they proclaimed, not are
we only the National Assembly

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.430
of France, but even more than
that, we all pledge to not

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.830
stop until we create a
constitution of France.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.650
 

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.570
So they went from being
a National Assembly to

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.820
essentially morphing into
a constituent assembly.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.070
We're going to create
a constitution.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:15.590
 

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.230
And they had sympathy from some
elements of the clergy

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.340
and the nobility.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.510
So eventually Louis XVI,
he kind of saw the

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.380
writing on the wall.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.690
The people are angry.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.550
And every time he tries
to mess with them,

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.770
they only get angrier.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.920
And they only go to even
more extreme measures.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.355
So just to kind of make it seem
like he's going along, he

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:35.900
says, OK that's cool, guys.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.620
Whatever you all want to do.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.850
Yeah, maybe I'm open to it,
we are in an emergency.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.620
And maybe it is unreasonable,
I have been a little bit

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.090
unreasonable.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.760
So he lets them be, he lets
them assemble again.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.070
But while that's happening,
people start to notice that

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.980
troops are converging
on Paris.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:12:04.120
 

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.260
And they're obviously being
sent there by the king.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.570
And not only are they just any
troops, a lot of the actual

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.870
troops, even though they are
French troops, there under the

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.330
authority of France's
military.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.260
They're actually
foreign troops.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.050
So, if you think about it, these
would be the ideal types

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.590
of troops to put down any
type of insurgency,

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.720
or any type of rebellion.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.430
Or even better, to go
in and dissolve

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.230
the National Assembly.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.760
So people start getting
a little bit

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.290
paranoid, you can imagine.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:38.050
Now on top of that, Louis XVI's
main financial adviser,

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.340
Necker, Jacques Necker.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.680
He was sympathetic to the Third
Estate, to the plight of

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.275
the Third Estate.

00:12:48.275 --> 00:12:55.770
And he said hey, Mr. King, I
think it's reasonable for you

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.170
to essentially budget your
expenses a little bit better.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.630
And maybe a little bit less
of a lavish lifestyle.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:05.070
Considering the state of the
government's budget.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.330
And the state of the people of
France, they're starving.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.510
Why don't you do that
a little bit?

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.370
But Louis XVI, instead
of taking his

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.240
advice, he fired him.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.610
He fired the financial
adviser.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:22.200
 

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.100
So taken together, troops are
converging on Paris, you have

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.020
this Tennis Court Oath, Louis
XVI has fired his adviser,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.760
people are going hungry.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.070
They're genuinely
going hungry.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.820
People in Paris said, the king
is going to try to suppress us

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.300
again, this is no good.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.540
And especially if he does
it with troops,

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.520
we have to arm ourselves.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.070
So they stormed the Bastille.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.890
This right here is a picture
of the Bastille.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.020
 

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.640
And this is most famous, when
you when you first learn about

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.630
it, or maybe this is the first
time you're learning about it.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.910
They put political prisoners
there and they freed the

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.700
political prisoners.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.280
But in reality, there
were only seven

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.400
prisoners in the Bastille.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.670
So it's not like thousands and
thousands of political

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.580
prisoners were being held there
and there were freed.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.150
The real value of the Bastille
to the revolutionaries, we

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.150
could say, is that there
were weapons there.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.440
There was a major arms
cache there.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.750
And so by storming the Bastille
and getting the

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.420
weapons, they all of a sudden
could essentially fend off any

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.390
type of threat that the
troops would have.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.970
But this is also kind of the
very beginning of the real

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.205
chaos of the French
Revolution.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.490
And as we're going to see over
the next several years, the

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.750
chaos only gets worse
and worse.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.500
It's almost on a lot of levels
a lot worse than the American

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.050
Revolution.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.070
Because what actually happened
in the cities and what fellow

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.630
Frenchman started doing to do
each other was really on many

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.900
levels barbaric.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.730
And you actually saw it here for
the first time, where the

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.190
governor of the Bastille, the
guy who was in charge of it,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.670
he had the standoff between
the troops.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.350
And he eventually called
for a ceasefire.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.050
Because he's like, oh there's
too much bloodshed.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.790
But once the revolutionaries got
to him, they stabbed them,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.110
they cut his head off, and
they put it on a pike.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.440
Then they went back to the mayor
of Paris, they shot him.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.560
So clearly, things were really
getting out of hand.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.130
But most people associate the
storming of the Bastille as

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.640
kind of the landmark event
of the French Revolution.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.650
Even today, people celebrate
Bastille Day.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:26.670
And that is July 14, 1789.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.890
So just to give you a sense
of how quickly all of this

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.150
happened, the Convocation
of the

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.570
Estates-General, that was in May.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.580
The Tennis Court Oath
was in June.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.800
And then in July, you have the
storming of the Bastille.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.000
And then in August, just to kind
of complete the idea that

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.640
we are definitely in a
revolutionary period.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.150
 

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.180
The National Assembly, that
started off at the tennis

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.160
courts with the Third Estate,
they declared their equivalent

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.780
of the Declaration
of Independence.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:12.530
They declared their Declaration
of the Rights of

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:18.600
Man and of the Citizen.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.720
 

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.080
Which was essentially their
version of the Declaration of

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.840
Independence.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.750
And it essentially put
everything into question of

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.980
what is life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness?

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.820
I'm using words from the
American Revolution.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.380
But this was their Declaration
of Independence.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.660
It wasn't a constitution, it
was just a statement of the

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.010
things that they think need
to govern any type of

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.190
constitution or country.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.400
Or the ideas that any country
should be based on.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.590
So I'm going to leave
you there.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.390
We've really now started
the French Revolution.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.320
And now, you're going to see
that over the next several

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.550
years, it's only going to get
bloodier and bloodier and even

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.520
more complex.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.750
And when everything is said and
done, it's actually not

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.670
going to end that
well in terms of

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.590
giving people liberty.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.199
