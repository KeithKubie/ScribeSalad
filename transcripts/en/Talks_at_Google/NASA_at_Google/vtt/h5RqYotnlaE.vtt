00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.790
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
everybody to another--

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.120
this is not authors at Google.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.410
This is astronauts
at the Google Talk.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.370
Today we have
Commander Reid Wiseman,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.840
was a flight engineer
on Expedition 41,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.650
which launched from
Kazakhstan on May 28, 2014

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.820
on board a Soyuz 39,
and he spent-- what?

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.690
Five months on
the space station?

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.590
REID WISEMAN: Five
and a half months.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.131
MALE SPEAKER: Five
and a half months.

00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.390
So when he was aboard
the space station

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.240
you can imagine he did a
lot of interesting things,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.050
like repairing things,
surviving in space,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.880
which is-- like you're away
from friends and family.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.400
You have strange
friends, probably,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.940
up there that you're
not picking yourself.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.140
Let's see.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.260
So they replaced a
failed power regulator,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.040
and prepped the station
for a reconfiguration that

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.970
will allow the
station to accommodate

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.730
future commercial crew vehicles
inside the space station.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.540
Is that the code
name for SpaceX?

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.810
We'll hear about that.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.890
Anyway, so Reid was born
in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.470
Married to the former Carroll
Taylor of Virginia Beach,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.700
Virginia.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.860
They have two daughters,
and Wiseman's parents,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.540
Bill and July Wiseman, reside
in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.230
He graduated from Dulaney
High School in Maryland.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.850
Bachelor of Science
degree in computer

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.490
and systems engineering.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.650
Recruiters?

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.640
Are there any recruiters here?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.910
From the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in New York.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.250
Master's of Science
degree in systems

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.020
engineering at John Hopkins
University Baltimore, Maryland.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.958
Please join me in welcoming
Reid Wiseman to Google.

00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.374
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.760
REID WISEMAN: But
just real quick.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.890
This is my second
trip to Google.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.370
There was a former
astronaut, Ed Lu,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.420
who worked here
for a little while,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419
and he took me on a
tour a couple years ago.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.250
And, wow, this place
is so much bigger now.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.517
I mean, it's amazing.

00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:15.850
And so I was reflecting just
while we were sitting there

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.430
waiting lunch at the
great cafe, I just

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.170
started to step back for a
second and think about Google

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.950
in my own personal
life, and holy smokes.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.329
I mean-- bless you.

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.870
When we're on the
space station we're

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750
running Picasa with
all of our photos.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.362
When I'm here, I don't even
think about my search engine.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:33.070
It's just Google.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.150
That's where all my news comes.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.460
That's where all my internet
information comes from.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.465
When I landed in San
Francisco airport

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:39.960
and I'm driving
down here, that's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.650
where my directions come from.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.120
My dad, he offered
me his GPS when

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.675
I was home so I get around
Maryland and I'm like, Dad.

00:02:46.675 --> 00:02:47.492
Come on.

00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:48.450
I got Google maps here.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.408
I mean, I got the whole
world right in my hand.

00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:53.210
So when you take a step
back and realize the work

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.510
that everyone here is
doing, and how much you all

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.240
are changing the world,
it just blows me away.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.470
And so it's really a great
honor for me to be here.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.310
Google's intertwined
beautifully into my life,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.230
and I personally appreciate all
the work that's going on here.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.510
And I get to see one of
my old friends, which

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.468
was totally by surprise,
which was really cool.

00:03:11.468 --> 00:03:13.300
Brandon, we used
to work together.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.630
So if you'll humor me
I'll talk for, hopefully,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.940
no more than about 25 minutes.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.850
I just want to run you through
the basis of my mission.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.110
Give you a little feeling
for what it's like in space.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.550
It might be a bit
generic for this crowd,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.170
but then if I can get some
questions from people--

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.630
because the way you all
think is just brilliant,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.165
and I really hope I get some
interesting, odd questions

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:32.280
that I can't answer.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.410
And then we'll go to
Google, we'll hit Wikipedia,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.410
and we will find the
solution to these problems.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.010
So just jumping right in.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.890
I did have to show a picture
of me at the dining facility

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.520
this afternoon.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.050
I would throw on-- I put on
about 10 pounds in space eating

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.990
space today.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.000
I set the record for most
weight gain up there,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.410
and it was all due to
chocolate pudding cake,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.820
and you can see that started
when I was about one year old.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.490
AUDIENCE: Isn't it
technically just mass gain?

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.480
REID WISEMAN:
That's a good point.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.771
It was just mass gain, but
I'll tell you when I landed,

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.207
it was definitely weight gain.

00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:00.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.869
I had to buy a whole
new set of pants.

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.410
We did the introduction, so this
is me and my family growing.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.310
I got an older brother Bill
who's five years older than me,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.920
and he got all the
brains the family,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.720
so he is just a huge thinker,
and I love talking to him.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.980
He's way outside my league.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.170
I went to RPI for
Rensselaer When I was there,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.330
I really loved computers.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.610
I loved computer networking.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.000
And I really wanted
to work at Intel,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.250
but there was something just
burning in me that I also

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.470
wanted to fly airplanes.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.260
And so, when I left
Rensselaer I joined the Navy,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.830
and I got super lucky to
fly F-14s and F-18s off

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.812
of aircraft carriers.

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:39.520
I spent about two a
half years of my life

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.750
at sea over this 12
year career in the Navy,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.470
and then I got to
go to Patuxent River

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.970
and do a lot of test pilot work
on some really new systems.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.320
I wasn't doing too much on new
airplanes but on new systems,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.660
and so when I look
at the way you all

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.680
invent, test, integrate,
reredesign-- to me

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.479
that's the best.

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.145
That's the best.

00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:03.860
When you take hardware,
look at how it works, tweak

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.250
the software, and then re-go.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.000
It's just awesome.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.600
So that was my
life for 12 years.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.940
And then in 2009, about 5,000
people wanted to come to NASA,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.185
and for some reason they
selected this group,

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:18.810
and I was lucky enough to be one
of the nine Americans selected

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.920
in '09.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.170
It's just a whole lot of luck.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.450
I had a nice background
with the military test

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.850
pilot and a couple degrees.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.350
But the reason I want to
show you all this picture

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.790
is, this is the first time in
our lives that we had floated.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.956
It was in the back of a C-9.

00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:32.794
If any of you have ever done a
zero-G flight-- if you haven't

00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:35.210
and you have a little spare
money, which maybe some of you

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.530
do, I recommend it.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.440
It's a total-- you can see from
our faces it's no fun at all,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.136
but it's great.

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:42.886
And the reason I want
to show this is this

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:45.890
was the 2009 class,
and I think it looks

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.370
a lot like the Google campus.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.562
There's a lot of folks
from different countries,

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:51.270
a lot of different
languages being spoke,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.740
we have Serena Aunon--
she's a medical doctor.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.464
Mike Hopkins here is an
Air Force test engineer--

00:05:58.464 --> 00:05:59.880
I know one of those
in the front--

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.610
and then we have a few
other medical doctors.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.420
Kate Rubens, she's just barely
peaking her blonde head out

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.560
in the back, and she
is like a bio genius.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.501
And she was studying
Ebola in the Congo

00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:14.250
when she was selected
to NASA, and so they

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.100
had to fly her out of there.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.090
Super smart.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.530
So anyway, NASA's
just a great-- just

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.770
like you guys-- a great,
diverse collection of folks

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.200
that all come together and
try to do really fun things.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.710
In 2011, I was lucky enough
to be assigned to a mission,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.900
and this is my primary
crew that I flew with.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.720
Obviously I'm on
the right there.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.880
In the center is a great, great
crazy character, Max Surayev.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.520
He's a Russian.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.320
He was a Russian
Air Force pilot,

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.510
so for my first five years
in the Navy he was the enemy,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.656
and then in the end he's
just my best friend.

00:06:44.656 --> 00:06:45.780
And he's got two daughters.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.910
I have two daughters.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.864
They all know each
other really well.

00:06:48.864 --> 00:06:49.780
We teach them English.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.010
They teach us Russian.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.260
And once you get below
the political tensions

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.684
of the US-Russia relationship,
when you get down to the people

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:59.350
and you work together
with these people,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.550
you realize they're
just great folks.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.730
And everybody's there for the
common goal, and I love that.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.940
Over here on the
left is Alex Gerst.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.180
He was our resident
smart guy in our crew.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.420
He is a geophysicist, a
volcanologist by trade.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.560
Grew up in Germany,
and he flew with us

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.930
with the European Space Agency.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.660
And he was like our
encyclopedia of knowledge,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.850
and you cannot get
anything past him.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.940
If you're off by even
1,000th, he will correct you

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.190
on everything, and so it's
really fun to play with him

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.678
because he kept us
sharp the whole time.

00:07:32.678 --> 00:07:34.553
Now I'll just jump into
a series of about two

00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:36.690
and a half to three
minute video clips.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.812
I was part of the 40th
and 41st expedition

00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:40.270
to the International
Space Station.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.450
We've flying to this thing since
about 2000, which was amazing.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.783
And for me, I'd always dreamed
of leaving in our planet,

00:07:47.783 --> 00:07:48.540
and this is the day.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.998
There's me saying
goodbye to my two

00:07:49.998 --> 00:07:52.650
daughters, which was the hardest
part, by far, of the mission.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.540
And I was on the bus heading
out to the launch pad there.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.285
We get in our suits,
and we walk out.

00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:58.350
And this guy hugging us is
the head of the Russian Space

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.030
Agency, and I loved
what he said to me.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.380
He just said, hey,
everything's gonna be fine.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.630
We built a great rocket for you.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.290
It's going to work.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.280
It was exactly what I
needed to hear before I

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.190
jumped on a bunch of fuel.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.430
And this is us
climbing up the ladder,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.290
and you see behind us just the
steam coming off of this thing.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.097
It was alive sitting in there.

00:08:14.097 --> 00:08:16.180
Once they light the engines
it's about three hours

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.554
we've already been sitting in
there, but it's super calm.

00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:19.520
We were so calm.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.400
You'll see when we switch
to the inside view.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.817
It's just a really
gentle liftoff.

00:08:22.817 --> 00:08:24.441
You don't even realize
you're in space.

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.230
You can see us shake
a little bit there,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.990
and then we're on our way.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.630
It was about 2:00
AM when we launched.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.320
This is a picture of
my family watching,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.986
so the only thing
lighting them up right

00:08:32.986 --> 00:08:34.830
now is our plume from
our rocket, which

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.690
was making my mom
very nervous, but I

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.018
think it's a cool picture.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:39.809
And then off we go.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.124
We go about 17,000 miles
an hour in the end,

00:08:43.124 --> 00:08:45.290
and it's only a nine minute
ride--a little over nine

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.790
minutes.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.930
So the force of
acceleration the whole time

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.432
is pretty impressive.

00:08:50.432 --> 00:08:52.640
You see that's us inside
and we're riding into space,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.555
and it just looks
calm as can be.

00:08:55.555 --> 00:08:57.180
Mainly because we
don't have that view,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.295
and we don't know the
gravity of the situation,

00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:00.045
no pun unintended.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.665
And so it's the Soyuz
Russian-built rocket.

00:09:04.665 --> 00:09:05.873
I launched out of Kazakhstan.

00:09:05.873 --> 00:09:07.410
It's a three stage rocket.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.970
The first stage
has five engines,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.469
so it's a pretty powerful
kick towards the end.

00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:13.510
About four and a half
times the force of gravity.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.290
And this is us, actually,
at engine cut off,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.914
so now we're in space
floating, and you

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:18.111
can see it's pretty dynamic.

00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:19.610
But then the best
part hits you when

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.901
you realize that you just
went through this crazy thing

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:22.874
and you're alive.

00:09:22.874 --> 00:09:25.290
And the raw emotion here, I
think, is pretty much perfect.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.832
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:29.290
And then, of course,
the next thing

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.623
is-- that's a toy from my
daughter floating around there

00:09:31.623 --> 00:09:32.880
that we had tied to the hatch.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.720
And then, we had a
couple GoPros with us,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.500
and I grabbed it off the
wall, and I decided--

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.960
the view outside, of course,
is what it's all about,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.270
and that was just amazing.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.770
And so, that's
not a NASA Studio.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.940
That's reality.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.364
I was there.

00:09:47.364 --> 00:09:49.780
And this is us getting ready
to dock to the space station.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.364
It's about a six
hour ride as we're

00:09:51.364 --> 00:09:53.280
phasing with the space
station-- catching up--

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.672
which is extremely quick.

00:09:54.672 --> 00:09:56.380
It used to take us
two days, but now they

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.830
just do a really accurate
insertion on ascent,

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.850
and they throw us right
at the space station.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.630
Cool thing for the
aero folks here.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.400
Totally automated.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.900
The entire ride
uphill is automated.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.922
We have no controls whatsoever.

00:10:11.922 --> 00:10:13.380
If anything went
wrong it was based

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.796
on the rocket deciding for
itself that something was wrong

00:10:15.796 --> 00:10:19.000
and basically ejecting
us off the top of it.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.120
The entire rendezvous sequence
here I didn't touch anything.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.830
All I was doing was keeping
us alive with our life support

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.633
systems, and the
rocket did everything.

00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:30.133
And the right side there is up
docking in the space station,

00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:34.057
and the left side is our
little tiny launch vehicle.

00:10:34.057 --> 00:10:35.640
Now, the first time
you get to float I

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.598
thought it'd be this
magical, crazy experience,

00:10:37.598 --> 00:10:40.077
but in reality it's
very uncomfortable.

00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:40.910
Nothing feels right.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.076
You don't know how to do it.

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:43.454
Everything is
awkward and clumsy.

00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:45.370
All your food is up at
the top of your throat,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.495
and you're trying
to swallow it down.

00:10:47.495 --> 00:10:50.120
At this point we hadn't gone to
the bathroom in about 10 hours,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.536
so the first words we uttered
as we came through the hatch

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:54.420
was, where's the bathroom?

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.340
He have got to go.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.340
Alex was the first through
the hatch for our crew,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.220
and then I came through third.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.050
And you can see, just the look
on my face-- I mean, I'm lost.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.510
I've trained for five years,
basically, for this moment

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.801
and I'm completely lost
because when you just take away

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.957
gravity from the situation, it
does crazy things to your mind.

00:11:10.957 --> 00:11:13.040
There were already three
astronauts up there-- one

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.860
American and two
Russians-- when we got up.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.609
And they had been up
for about two months,

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:18.935
and then we joined them,
and we became a crew of six.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.710
Little time lapse of
the view, and then-- we

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.750
didn't get to shoot
this video, but it's

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.746
a neat view of the space
station from outside.

00:11:34.746 --> 00:11:36.370
Let me see if this
laser pointer works.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.825
So when you look--
we're in San Francisco.

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:40.200
We're the ultimate
green machine,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.110
so all our power comes from
those eight solar arrays.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.580
Of course, I think it's like
a million pounds in orbit,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.913
so we kind of crushed some
of the environment getting it

00:11:47.913 --> 00:11:48.515
all up there.

00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:51.310
But once it's up there it's
totally self supportive.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.642
We live in the
center stack here.

00:11:54.642 --> 00:11:56.100
I'm sorry to use
the mouse pointer,

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.340
but this is kind of our
habitable area right there.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.200
This back half is the Russian
segment, and we go down there

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.997
and do some work
from time to time.

00:12:03.997 --> 00:12:06.330
And then this forward half
is all the Russian, Japanese,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.410
and European segments, and it's
just bustling with activity.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.210
This cross structure that
runs left to right here, all

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.450
that does is just holds up
our solar arrays, and then

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.020
our thermal panels,
which you see out here.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.400
And really the whole goal
of this entire operation

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.024
is first, to do general
research and see

00:12:23.024 --> 00:12:24.940
what happens to things
when you remove gravity

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.090
from the situation.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.230
But in reality,
this is the platform

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.610
that we will do the most
learning to go deeper

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.920
into space, and I'll
kind of touch on that

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.420
here in a couple of minutes.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.410
But first-- ah, it's going
to play automatically.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.630
I wanted to give you
guys this feeling of what

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.570
it's like when you just
take gravity away because it

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.990
captured my imagination.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.870
And I never was an operational
engineer or scientist,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.160
but when I got into
space, really what you are

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.970
is just a kid.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.529
Your inquisitive,
and it's just crazy.

00:12:55.529 --> 00:12:56.820
Some of you may have seen this.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.236
We decided to build
a water bubble

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.380
and stick a GoPro
inside of it, just

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.690
to see what it would
look like from the video.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.210
And so all these little
spheres are little air pockets

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.590
inside this larger
bubble that we had built.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.680
And watching something-- you
can see there's Steve Swanson.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.969
He's a PhD in computer
science, and just watching

00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:17.010
him behave like a little
child, and just giggling

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:17.968
over this water bottle.

00:13:17.968 --> 00:13:19.050
I just-- I loved it.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.590
I loved every minute of that.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.550
And it was great.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.532
That's Oleg Artemiev, a Russian.

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:25.740
Then I thought, what is the
surface tension of water?

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.190
Will these two
bubbles bounce off,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.650
or will they stick together?

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.340
And so in this case
they stuck together,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.300
but they had some pretty
good mass to them.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.631
So then I got out a syringe
with a Teflon catheter

00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:37.630
and I started making these
little water bubbles.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.030
And this pretty much ended
an entire Saturday afternoon

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.530
for me.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.632
I couldn't stop playing with
this stuff, and you'll see why.

00:13:43.632 --> 00:13:45.840
If you have enough force to
break the service tension

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.798
you add to your bubble.

00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:48.940
If you don't, you just
bounce little bubbles off

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.261
of this bigger water bubble.

00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:52.760
And then, the water
bubble's a lens.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.880
You can see my head in the
water bubble upside down there.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.476
And the closest thing that
I came to a shower in space

00:13:59.476 --> 00:14:01.350
were these little bubbles
bouncing off there.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.830
So then I'll add some water
here, and then halfway

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.460
through I'm just adding a little
bit of water and I thought, oh,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.700
would happen if I added air?

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.910
Would it pop the bubble?

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.090
Would I build air inside?

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.200
So that an air bubble now
being added to a water bubble,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.616
and it just bounces around the
inside of the water bubble.

00:14:17.616 --> 00:14:18.852
It was amazing to me.

00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:20.226
You'll see I hit
it from the side

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:22.517
and I actually bounce the
air bubble off the other side

00:14:22.517 --> 00:14:24.750
of the bubble, and
then the air bubble

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.340
is its own little
lens inside there.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.210
You can see my face
in the air bubble.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.940
But then we decided we got to
put a human inside the water

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.110
bubble, and so we built
one more water bubble.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.010
And since Alex Gerst
didn't have hair,

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.320
he was the one that was
going in the water bubble.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.070
And so you'll see here
we did it with him.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.937
It's amazing.

00:14:44.937 --> 00:14:47.020
The scariest thing is
afterwards he was like, wow,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.410
I could have drowned
in that water bubble

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.243
without any problem.

00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:00.952
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.440
At Google you guys have
amazing imaginations,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.731
and that should kind of set it.

00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.320
So the real reason that we're
up there is the science,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.720
and to me the science
is three phases.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.210
There is the core science--
this is my first week up there.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.665
I'm going to whack my head
on the floor here, I think.

00:15:30.665 --> 00:15:31.540
I knew it was coming.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.180
But we kind of got this
three phase science.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.730
We're doing physical science
about a third of our day.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.771
We're doing maintenance
about a third of our day,

00:15:41.771 --> 00:15:43.310
but living on an
orbiting outpost,

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.244
I think that
maintenance is probably

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.910
some of the best
science we do up there.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.310
Learning how to
fix our own machine

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.351
and keep this thing going
without too much ground

00:15:50.351 --> 00:15:50.870
support.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.620
And then the third phase is just
keeping our body in good shape,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.950
and we were all lab
experiments up there.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.160
And so more blood has
been taken from me

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.660
than I ever thought possible.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.070
Some of this is-- we have these
autonomous satellites here.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.189
They could either
work off of CO2,

00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:07.980
or here we have these
electromagnetic rings

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.850
around them, and we were
trying to do different orbiting

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.740
station keeping
experiments with just

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.530
using electromagnetic forces.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.499
And it worked OK.

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:16.290
It was pretty good.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.710
A lot of this is MIT based
research, and some of it's

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.680
going on over at AEMS.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.234
We also strapped a cell
phone onto these satellites

00:16:27.234 --> 00:16:29.400
and used the cellphone to
map inside of the station.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.545
And the satellites
knew where they are,

00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:32.390
and they could fly
all over the place.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.560
But the most fun science
that I got to be a part of

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.770
was towards the end of my
mission, we flew up 20 mice,

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.180
and that was another NASA
AEMS based research thing.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.540
And just watching these mice
go from scared little animals

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.550
on day one, two, and
three on space station

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.090
to the end when I saw
them around day 40,

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.700
and these guys were completely
adapted to floating.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.150
They would float from their
cheese over to their water,

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
and they'd even learn how
to run around the cage

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.890
to build themselves a little
exercise machine up there,

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.025
and you would watch them.

00:17:00.025 --> 00:17:00.900
They were all female.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.815
One little girl would run
around, then she would jump off

00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:04.565
and another one would
come and run around.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.611
And it was really cool to watch.

00:17:06.611 --> 00:17:08.819
From my perspective, it was
neat to watch them adapt.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.099
And then from the
science perspective,

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.890
they're little organisms
are going so fast,

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.280
it's like watching
a human, almost,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.780
over their entire
lifetime in space,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.750
and see how their bone
density is changing,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.030
their muscles are wasting.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.113
And I think down the road
the research that we can

00:17:21.113 --> 00:17:22.420
get from that will be awesome.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.079
We also did a lot of work
with protein crystal growth.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.130
A lot of colloidal research to
see how things settle or don't

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.154
settle without gravity.

00:17:29.154 --> 00:17:31.320
That's me mixing up some
stuff for Procter &amp; Gamble.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.330
In any given day we were
running-- each one of us

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.190
was around about five
hours of physical science.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.190
And the best part, I
guess, overall, we're

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.440
tied directly in with the
investigators on the ground.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.564
Talking to them on a radio.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.320
They've got a camera
over our shoulder.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.600
And we've flown in
space since the 1960s,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.720
but every time I did an
experiment the PI on the ground

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.470
would go, whoa, do that again.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.760
I totally didn't expect that.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.135
And it's just pulling away
gravity and then running these

00:17:58.135 --> 00:18:01.014
experiments, I would've thought
we had researched the life out

00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:02.430
of low Earth orbit,
but we hadn't.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.930
I mean, everything
we were doing was

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.010
kind of surprising
to these researchers,

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.800
and that made it fun.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.300
Here's about two months in, and
I'm not going to hit my head

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.880
but I missed the grab up there.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.039
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:15.830
But getting better.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.730
Less injuries.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.396
And this kind of going
into maintenance.

00:18:18.396 --> 00:18:20.090
This is our water regen system.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.017
So it takes all of our urine,
if processes it through here,

00:18:23.017 --> 00:18:24.600
and turns it back
into drinking water.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.141
It takes the sweat, it takes
any condensation out of the air,

00:18:27.141 --> 00:18:29.141
so we run pretty low humidity.

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:31.390
It takes about three days
to cycle through that thing,

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.790
so urine three days later
becomes your drinking water.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.610
Urine and sweat,
and it was great.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.670
I mean, we were reclaiming
like 95% of all of our water

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.170
up there.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.830
And it's to the point
where they're even

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.580
stripping the hydrogen
off the water molecules

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.110
to make oxygen to put
it into the cabin,

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.901
so it turns into our
breathing air as well.

00:18:47.901 --> 00:18:50.539
So that's the 5%
that we're losing.

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:52.080
This is us tearing
apart a space suit

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.140
that I'm going to do a space
walk in about a month later.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.220
And so the
maintenance that we're

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.890
doing, knowing that I'm
working on my space suit

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.520
that I'm about to
do a space walk in,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.040
was absolutely terrifying.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.570
There was no way
that I should be

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.653
pulling pumps out of this
thing and changing them.

00:19:04.653 --> 00:19:06.790
And this is Swanee working
on the toilet, which

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.240
is absolutely critical gear,
and when that thing broke it

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.989
basically-- everything
stopped on station,

00:19:10.989 --> 00:19:12.360
and we would work to fix it.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.262
So you're handyman to
the highest degree,

00:19:15.262 --> 00:19:17.720
and working on this complicated
stuff with the ground teams

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.310
was really awesome.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.910
And then, kind of
the third major part

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.200
was looking at my body, and I
became a fantastic ultrasound

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.910
tech looking at my calf
muscles, my thigh muscle,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.130
seeing how they're changing.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.260
My calves changed so
much it was unbelievable.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.718
They all went from the back of
my calf around to the front,

00:19:34.718 --> 00:19:37.220
around my shin area, because
you're just not walking.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.840
And you're using
the top of your feet

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.670
to lock under
handrails so you can

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.290
keep yourself stationary because
Newton wins every argument up

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.590
there.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.030
So it's a different way to work.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.170
And then our eyes, because
your blood kind of pools

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.725
all throughout your body
and not down at your legs,

00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:53.891
and puts a lot of pressure
on the back of your eyes,

00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:56.067
so we did lots of research
on the blood vessels,

00:19:56.067 --> 00:19:57.650
and what's going on
with the pressure.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.739
Some astronauts experience
total sight change

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:01.780
and they have to wear
reading glasses by the end.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.988
I was young enough that it
didn't affect me too much,

00:20:03.988 --> 00:20:05.870
but ultrasounding my own eye.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.630
All my heart valves
ultrasounded overtime.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.834
Carotid artery, brachial
artery, and this

00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:13.250
is how we keep
ourselves in shape.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.041
We actually have a
weight machine up there.

00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:16.729
We can do squats
up to 600 pounds.

00:20:16.729 --> 00:20:19.145
I'm not anywhere near capable
of that, so was doing squats

00:20:19.145 --> 00:20:20.480
up to about 300 pounds.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.980
Which, if you think about it,
since I didn't weigh anything,

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.880
is really not impressive at all.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.630
And then we have a
treadmill which I love.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.230
And our treadmill is
actually mounted on the wall,

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.250
so this is an Earth based view.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.583
So you're running straight
down at the Earth when you're

00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:32.625
running on the treadmill.

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:33.749
And the treadmill is crazy.

00:20:33.749 --> 00:20:35.970
The first time I got on
that, just feeling my insides

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.526
bouncing up and
down, my food-- you

00:20:37.526 --> 00:20:39.650
can feel food bouncing off
the top of your stomach.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.730
It's really interesting.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.340
And your legs would tingle.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.285
And then, who was
talking-- somebody

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.180
was talking about some really
cold stuff when I walked in.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.890
Was it you guys?

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:47.160
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.430
It was us.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.263
REID WISEMAN: Yeah, so
our freezers up there

00:20:49.263 --> 00:20:52.200
are running anywhere between
minus 90 C and minus 160

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.560
C, and all of our
samples that we

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.410
want to get ground
analysis we put

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.010
in those freezers, slow
everything way down,

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.170
and then we send them home
on a Dragon spaceship.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.310
I never liked working
in those freezers.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.907
They were so unbelievably cold.

00:21:07.907 --> 00:21:09.490
And why I'm doing
it in short sleeves?

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:16.170
After this I started wearing
long sleeves and long pants.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.600
And so how do we keep
this thing running?

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.630
This is a launch of a Orbital.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.390
This is Orbital 2.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.098
If any of you guys
follow space big time,

00:21:23.098 --> 00:21:24.720
this is the one
that made it to us,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.400
not the one that
didn't make it to us.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.940
And so what we do is we have
these two companies, Orbital

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.760
and SpaceX, and they are
just totally building

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.510
their own rockets.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.300
And then we are buying
that service from them,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.790
and launching them up
to the space station,

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.220
and it's really, really neat.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.440
I mean, just watching
these two companies work.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.350
They've come to
totally different ways

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.080
of doing business, but they've
both been very successful.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.100
And the way we
grab these things,

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.180
they don't actually dock.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.390
They just float up next
to us in low Earth orbit.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.924
We take the robotic arm out and
just grab them out of space,

00:21:51.924 --> 00:21:54.340
pull them over, and then plug
them into the space station.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.610
That's a view of the Orbital
coming up and getting

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.230
plugged in.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.729
Orbital is like a
great pickup truck.

00:22:00.729 --> 00:22:02.770
This thing came just loaded
with food and science

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.070
for us-- really awesome--
but it can't survive reentry,

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.820
so when we get all the
supplies out of it,

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.278
now that's where all our trash
goes from the space station.

00:22:10.278 --> 00:22:12.434
And let me tell you, if we
ever go somewhere really

00:22:12.434 --> 00:22:14.350
far like Mars we got to
take care of our trash

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.700
because we filled this
thing completely up.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.410
And you'll see when it reenters
Earth's atmosphere here

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.555
in a minute, it's fun to
watch all your trash burn up.

00:22:23.555 --> 00:22:25.930
So we release this one, and
I just hit one little button.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:26.710
That's the go home button.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.860
Obviously, this is a time lapse.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.234
It didn't happen
this fast, but I

00:22:29.234 --> 00:22:31.790
love this as like a Jetsons
moment watch the thing.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.930
And it'll go out--
it'll actually

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.660
accelerate, go up
over the top of us,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.820
and then it's coming down.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.528
And this was some
research we were doing,

00:22:38.528 --> 00:22:40.570
but it kind of almost
captures Orbital reentry

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.530
through the atmosphere.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.040
You see the big
tail building there?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.500
And then just as it goes off you
can see some flashes of light,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.020
and then all the
particles of trash

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.436
just kind of float
down behind it.

00:22:51.719 --> 00:22:53.260
And then the other
main cargo vehicle

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.134
that we have is just
right down in Hawthorne,

00:22:55.134 --> 00:22:57.860
California where they're
building the SpaceX Dragon,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.060
and this thing is fantastic.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.476
This is like our
science workhorse

00:23:00.476 --> 00:23:02.470
because it can survive reentry.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.960
And hopefully in
about three years

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.459
we'll be thrown
humans on that thing

00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:07.550
and sending them up there.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.080
And this is just a really
fantastic vehicle for us.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.554
So the same thing for Dragon.

00:23:12.554 --> 00:23:13.720
It just floats up beside us.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.460
You can see the robotic arm is
ready to go out and grab it,

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.420
and we'll go out and
grab it and bring it in.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.737
And I got a good picture of
that thing right over Hawthorne

00:23:21.737 --> 00:23:22.570
when I was up there.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.361
It was really nice.

00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:27.780
When I look at this,
all I think of is work.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.400
This thing carried so much work.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.570
When we docked SpaceX,
we didn't take a day off

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.592
for about 28 days.

00:23:33.592 --> 00:23:36.050
I mean, that little tiny capsule
carried that much research

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:36.650
on it.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.510
And it was all fun
stuff, but it was brutal.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.440
We worked almost as hard,
probably as you guys, I guess,

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.940
but we were really
cranking through.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.162
So obviously going out
into the vacuum of space,

00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:54.620
the only thing that's there to
protect us is the spacesuit.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.953
And this is the one that I've
just replaced the pump on,

00:23:56.953 --> 00:23:59.089
so I already was a little
bit nervous about it.

00:23:59.089 --> 00:24:00.880
But the thing that I'm
talking about here--

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.380
we don't have sound going-- but
I'm pretty afraid of heights.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.065
Like, I couldn't walk up
to the top of a building

00:24:05.065 --> 00:24:06.189
and look out over the edge.

00:24:06.189 --> 00:24:08.100
It just makes my
stomach go crazy.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.050
And so, I didn't know
when we were starting

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.660
these space walks and I had to
be the first one out the hatch,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.180
I know if I could
get out the hatch.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.350
Like can I physically get over
this hurdle of 250 miles up

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.540
to get out the hatch?

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.565
And so I opened up
the hatch, and all

00:24:20.565 --> 00:24:22.290
I looked down on was
the Pacific Ocean.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.470
There was a full moon
beating down on the clouds,

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.110
and it was like evil
just inviting me out.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.380
Just come on, Reid.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.240
Come on out.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.689
And I went outside,
and it was awesome.

00:24:31.689 --> 00:24:33.980
This is a view from inside
the space station looking up

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.227
at the airlock, and this is
me and my German buddy Alex

00:24:37.227 --> 00:24:39.060
coming out of the airlock
for the first time

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.990
and getting going.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.524
And once you get over the
fact that you're high up,

00:24:43.524 --> 00:24:45.190
you just know you let
go and you're just

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.860
going to be floating.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.735
We always stay tethered
to the space station.

00:24:47.735 --> 00:24:51.110
There's one of the
tethers in my right hand.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.904
It's really just a
phenomenal experience.

00:24:52.904 --> 00:24:54.570
The thing that you're
always looking for

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:55.570
is the sound of the fan.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.161
It's kind of blowing air around
the left side of your ear,

00:24:58.161 --> 00:24:59.910
and as long as that
fan's going your alive

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.922
and you're doing good.

00:25:00.922 --> 00:25:03.380
There's a part here where I've
kind of let go and push off,

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.930
and it still gives my stomach
like the willies a little bit.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.780
Right there pushing
off, and now I

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.050
have no hands on the space
station other than my tether.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.860
We use the big robotic arm.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.180
We actually had Alex Gerst
attached to that thing,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.960
and so he had extended
reach of about 100 feet.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.370
There's him kind of
cruising through outer space

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.430
on the end of the
robotic arm, and he's

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.054
carrying a gigantic
refrigerator, which

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:25.030
was a pump that had
failed last year,

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.980
and we were putting
that thing away.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.896
The view from out
there was amazing.

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:31.520
I got to go all over
the space station.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.603
I went all the way out the
port and starboard side

00:25:33.603 --> 00:25:34.340
repairing things.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.710
That's us all messed up
in these bundles of cables

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.209
rewiring the robotic arm.

00:25:39.209 --> 00:25:41.000
The highest intensity
thing I've ever done,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.916
and the most mentally
and physically grueling.

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:45.530
I came in from that and all
I wanted to do was go to bed.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.670
I was devastated
after both of them.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.530
Just completely worn
out, which is great.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.495
It's a great feeling.

00:25:51.495 --> 00:25:55.950
And that's my little body
there working on a pallet.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.750
Attempted a selfie.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.670
And then time to go home.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.040
Home is-- it's a great
feeling to get in that rocket.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.150
I was nervous getting
in, but just like launch,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.980
once you get in you know
it's time to go home.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.034
And it's an extremely
high energy event,

00:26:15.034 --> 00:26:17.450
and if something goes wrong,
well, it's just not your day.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.235
So we get in there,
we close a hatch,

00:26:20.235 --> 00:26:21.860
we get in these little
space suits that

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.370
are going to protect us in case
we have a depressurization,

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.800
and then we'll push some
buttons and back away

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.000
from the space station.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.190
And we back away, we kind of
go out up over the top again,

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.630
and then we'll lighter engines.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.380
Just a little bit
of a deceleration--

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.980
about 120 meters per second
deceleration-- and that's

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.190
enough just to send us home.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.110
And this is a little
video from inside of us

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.565
just a raging fireball
about 3,000 degrees.

00:26:44.565 --> 00:26:45.940
And those little
flashes of light

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.200
are part of our
blade of heat shield

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.754
that are supposed
to be burning off.

00:26:48.754 --> 00:26:50.170
But it's crazy
when you're sitting

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.890
in there at about
five Gs knowing

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.059
it's 3,000 degrees outside and
parts of you are burning up.

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:55.600
It's amazing.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.975
You can see the
window is totally

00:26:56.975 --> 00:26:59.160
burned by the end of reentry.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.290
And then after about
five minutes of craziness

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.900
the parachute comes out, and
it's just a great 15 minute

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.224
ride back down to the earth.

00:27:05.224 --> 00:27:07.640
And then you slam home after
six months of weightlessness,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.770
[GROANS] and it's painful.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.780
And we hit down, and
then we tipped over,

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.090
and so I wasn't feeling
super well at that point.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.177
And Max, my commander, I
was-- because of the way

00:27:19.177 --> 00:27:21.510
we tipped over I was up high,
and then Max and then Alex

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.020
was all the way
down on the ground.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.430
And Max says, hey
Reid, how you feeling?

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.330
And I said, I think
I'm going to puke, Max.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:30.360
And Alex is like, no, no,
no because he would have

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.860
been right in the line of fire.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.590
So coming home and landing, the
biggest thing that I remember

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.740
was walking, I felt
my calf muscles

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.040
just twitching like crazy
trying to keep me up.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.322
And then my head it was
like-- it would just

00:27:44.322 --> 00:27:46.530
flop over because you haven't
used your neck muscles.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.905
As much working
out as we do, you

00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:49.830
haven't used your neck
muscles in six months,

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:54.220
and so just getting my body
to remember that is actually

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.040
some mass at the
top of my shoulders

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.350
was the biggest thing.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.345
And then, I can't leave you guys
without talking about the view

00:28:01.345 --> 00:28:02.220
outside a little bit.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.220
So this is the cupola
that I'm in right here,

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.040
and I had to give some
RPI love, but that's

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.770
a great-- I mean, that's
really what it looks like when

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:08.936
your floating in the cupola.

00:28:08.936 --> 00:28:10.650
It's a great place to hang out.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.210
It's even a better place
to hang out at night.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:19.084
And I hijacked one little video
off the internet from YouTube.

00:28:19.084 --> 00:28:21.250
It was some of Don Pettit's
imagery, but it's great.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.890
This is coming down
over California

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.680
looking to the south, and
that little white dot there

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.830
is Las Vegas.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.520
Now you can see Baja on
the right side coming down

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.960
over some thunderstorms
there, in the Pacific,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.502
over Central America,
and then there's

00:28:36.502 --> 00:28:38.210
where Central America
kind of necks down,

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.175
and then we'll work our way
down towards the South America

00:28:42.175 --> 00:28:43.300
and Chile here in a minute.

00:28:45.989 --> 00:28:47.530
And don't feel bad
about the fog here

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.820
because Chile is always living
it just like you guys are.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.852
That's the line right
there of the fog

00:28:52.852 --> 00:28:54.310
kind of pushing up
from the Pacific

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.000
onto Chile as we look south.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.030
Chile is gorgeous.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.170
Gorgeous, gorgeous place.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.060
Coming down over Florida.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.704
Florida and the
keys, and then Cuba.

00:29:03.704 --> 00:29:05.620
Bunch of lightning storms
out over the Bahamas

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.370
and the Caribbean.

00:29:11.056 --> 00:29:12.680
There's Orion rising
in the background.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.650
This is over Asia.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.120
The green lights
are fishing boats.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.810
Coming down over all
of Europe, and then

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.630
Italy on the right side
with Sicily is very visible.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.530
And then the
Mediterranean coming up

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:26.420
over Greece your hometown,
and then over Cyprus,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.750
and there's Israel, Lebanon.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.340
Off to the right is
Egypt, Cairo, the Red Sea.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.030
Coming down over Saudi Arabia.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.520
And then we were super lucky.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.690
We had an amazing
aurora up there.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.310
And if you want
to talk radiation,

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.297
we would fly through an
aurora about like this,

00:29:40.297 --> 00:29:42.380
and then-- I was the IT
guy on the space station--

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.000
I would be changing out hard
drives on almost every laptop,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.270
so that was the end of them.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:51.550
HDD zero one error.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.089
And the aurora were
just incredible.

00:29:53.089 --> 00:29:54.880
I didn't really realize
that these are just

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.600
charged particles kind of
bouncing from poll to poll,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.930
and you would just watch
then flicker at insane rates,

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.810
and snake their
way across the sky,

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.465
and you're just
floating through them.

00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:06.090
You can never get
enough of the aurora.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.330
And they go from green to red.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:14.430
I've still never seen them from
Earth, which is unfortunate.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.440
I got to fix that soon.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.950
There's a lot-- I already
went to the Bahamas

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.390
because the view of the
Bahamas was so good.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.181
When I came back I
grabbed my wife and kids

00:30:20.181 --> 00:30:21.350
and we went to the Bahamas.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.700
I just had to see what
those waters looked

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.783
like in real life, and
they were every bit as good

00:30:24.783 --> 00:30:27.230
as I thought they would be.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.790
And then, just to end, everybody
likes pictures of themselves?

00:30:34.369 --> 00:30:35.910
Well, I guess this
is a picture of LA

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.618
mainly, so this isn't
a good one to show,

00:30:37.618 --> 00:30:40.510
but you can see Baja California
is running off to the left,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.077
and we're looking to the
west out to the Pacific.

00:30:43.077 --> 00:30:45.660
There's a little, tiny Naval air
station somewhere around here

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.010
of El Centro, and
then LA is that kind

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.390
of gray smudge on the lower
right side of the screen there.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.230
And it sounds funny,
but that's really--

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.047
Manhattan is the
biggest gray smudge

00:30:58.047 --> 00:30:59.130
on the face of the planet.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.982
I mean, it's just
amazing, and that's

00:31:00.982 --> 00:31:02.940
all the cities look like
until you look at them

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.380
through a really long lens.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.540
This is looking up now
into the Central Valley,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.430
and a little bit of fog
in the Bay Area there.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.850
And then, what turned out to
be one of my favorite views--

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.766
this is just to the east
of the Central Valley

00:31:14.766 --> 00:31:17.700
looking back to the west,
and just look at our country.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.950
I mean, I love it.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.299
All the valleys, all
the mountains, and then

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:22.840
looking back into
the Central Valley.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.009
And maybe it's fog or smog.

00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:24.550
I'm not sure.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.670
I think it's a little
bit of farming,

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:27.890
and then off to the coast.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:31.130
But the West half of
the US was amazing.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.969
Once you cross the east
half where I grew up

00:31:32.969 --> 00:31:34.010
in Maryland and all that.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.593
Once you cross the Mississippi
it just turns into green forest

00:31:36.593 --> 00:31:38.110
and it's absolutely boring.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.430
There's just nothing to
see unless it's nighttime,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.140
and at nighttime
you can see it all.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:43.890
I love this photo.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.660
This is you guys at
night, so Bay Area's here.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.640
You got LA off to the right.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.780
Vegas is this white square of
lights that's very obvious.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.040
But even this far south, just
avert your eyes a little bit

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.880
to the left and there's
the aurora up over Canada,

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.380
and really amazing.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.944
And this is a good
representation

00:32:03.944 --> 00:32:05.360
here about the
amount of stars you

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.610
would see with your human
eye at night and the aurora.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:13.030
That's about a
human perspective.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.510
Then I had really
nice, long lens.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.030
An 800 millimeter, and some
new cameras came about halfway

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.740
through, and then I could start
to get some really cool city

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.240
imagery.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.800
So there's a better view
of the Bay Area, San Jose,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.884
and was able to snake
one at night too.

00:32:27.884 --> 00:32:29.300
So San Jose is on
the right there.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.720
Obviously you guys know
this area better than I do,

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.200
but the night stuff was
so cool because it's just

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.490
such a vivid thing.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.630
And then I threw this one
in because it's Google.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.290
A kid asked me to go down and
take a longer exposure just

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.740
so he could see a
lot of stars, and I

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.000
don't know why I hadn't thought
of doing that but I did it.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.320
And when I saw this pop up
on the display of the camera

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.159
I was just completely
beside myself,

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.450
and it really changed the
way I think about everything.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.074
And I think that's what you guys
do so well here Google is just

00:32:57.074 --> 00:32:59.730
changing, looking around
the data at different angles

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.210
and seeing something
you didn't expect.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.240
I expected the Milky
Way there in the center.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.250
We've all seen that,
but what I didn't expect

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.770
was this awesome red
hue here, and then

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.090
this little green band that goes
across the atmosphere, and then

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.300
the whole Earth is kind
of lit up in this yellow.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.965
And Alex and I were talking for
a long time about what it is,

00:33:17.965 --> 00:33:20.090
and he was thinking, and
I agree with him, is we're

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.742
over the Saharan
Desert right here

00:33:21.742 --> 00:33:23.575
and it's probably dust
and sand particulates

00:33:23.575 --> 00:33:27.140
that's just floating
around in the atmosphere.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.300
So with that, I think
I'll stop talking,

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.225
and I'll let you guys
ask some questions.

00:33:32.225 --> 00:33:34.600
If I get this video to play--
I'll just move forward here

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.460
for a second and
just let some-- it's

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.700
just some funny, goofy video
but it'll make a good backdrop

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.040
while we're asking questions.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.465
MALE SPEAKER: Can
use the microphone.

00:33:45.465 --> 00:33:47.090
REID WISEMAN: This
is one of our best--

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.816
MALE SPEAKER: We're live here?

00:33:47.816 --> 00:33:48.750
REID WISEMAN: Yeah.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.170
Human perspective.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.170
This is Alex giving me a
cappuccino after lunch,

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.061
so he would do one and then I
would be one, and it was good.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.620
AUDIENCE: So I'm Kevin.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.080
You talked about how
you were in the Navy.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.470
I was too actually.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.719
I was part of the Nimitz
Striker on the USS Chosen.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.210
What did you fly
on, or what carrier?

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.304
REID WISEMAN: I started
on the-- yeah, carriers.

00:34:14.304 --> 00:34:15.429
I start on Abraham Lincoln.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.000
I did two deployments on the
Lincoln, and then I went over.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.310
I did-- yeah, just
managing food.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.270
And then I did a couple
deployments on the--

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.234
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:27.234 --> 00:34:29.150
Did a couple of deployments
on the Eisenhower,

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.560
so they were my main boats.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.139
I did a little stint on
the George Washington

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.847
as we took it around
South America, which

00:34:33.847 --> 00:34:35.581
was also a really neat cruise.

00:34:35.581 --> 00:34:37.330
Got to go through the
Straits of Magellan,

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:40.122
and that was when I bought my
first digital SLR was because I

00:34:40.122 --> 00:34:42.080
was going to take a
carrier through the Straits

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.564
of Magellan, and I didn't want
to do that without photos.

00:34:44.564 --> 00:34:46.230
And everybody made
fun of me because I'd

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.909
be up at 5:00 in the
morning in Tierra Del Fuego

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:52.026
taking pictures of sunrises, and
all my friends were like, ah,

00:34:52.026 --> 00:34:52.650
you're a pilot.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.816
You shouldn't be doing that.

00:34:53.816 --> 00:34:55.703
But some of the most
beautiful things

00:34:55.703 --> 00:34:57.530
I've ever seen in my life
was going through the Straits

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.030
of Magellan.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.435
It's a great place.

00:34:59.435 --> 00:35:00.643
AUDIENCE: We were west coast.

00:35:00.643 --> 00:35:02.567
We didn't do that.

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.400
REID WISEMAN: Take a
sailboat through there.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.370
AUDIENCE: So I've heard
through various stories

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:15.460
that the Russian space toilet
is the preferred space toilet.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.520
Is that true, and if so, why?

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.430
REID WISEMAN: So the
Russian space toilet

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.100
is so much the
preferred space that we

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.350
have two of them up there,
and the Americans basically

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:24.850
just bought the
Russian space toilet

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.530
and we put it on our segment.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.250
We used to have--
when the shuttle flew,

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.740
the shuttle had its own toilet.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.030
It was a very good system.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.765
I never got to use it in space.

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:34.890
I've seen it on the ground.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.370
I haven't used it on
the ground, but it

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.617
was a very, very good system.

00:35:38.617 --> 00:35:40.200
But it was also
extremely complicated.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.520
And the Russian system is
really just a small separator,

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.010
which is like the pump
in a vacuum cleaner,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.327
and it just draws a
little suction regardless

00:35:48.327 --> 00:35:49.410
of which way you're going.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:54.140
And it's not extremely
simple, but it's

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.210
very simple in comparison
to the shuttle system.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.880
And so everything
inside the guts

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.315
of that we can
just jump in there

00:35:59.315 --> 00:36:01.530
and fix, repair, swap
parts out, no problem.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.230
I mean, we did three or four
repairs on the space toilet

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:09.390
while we were up there, and so
the Russian one is definitely

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.772
the preferred toilet.

00:36:11.772 --> 00:36:12.710
AUDIENCE: Now I know.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.200
REID WISEMAN: Now you know.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.616
AUDIENCE: I've
wondered for years.

00:36:17.974 --> 00:36:19.890
AUDIENCE: How long did
it take you to get back

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.500
to normal health once you
got back, and are there

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.840
any long term or permanent
effects, especially

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.222
from radiation and the auroras?

00:36:27.222 --> 00:36:28.430
REID WISEMAN: Great question.

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:31.230
So I'll start from today
and I'll work backwards.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.790
So even just
standing here today I

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.300
have a little bit of
discomfort in my spine

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.490
as my back muscles
continue to work,

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.755
and our spine kind of softens.

00:36:38.755 --> 00:36:40.630
They're doing some
research on it right now.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.650
I wasn't a part of this study.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.860
It's really just starting,
but our spine actually

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.325
softens quite a bit
in space, and so

00:36:46.325 --> 00:36:48.450
I think it's going pretty
interesting research when

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.952
they look at what's going on.

00:36:49.952 --> 00:36:51.660
But that's been the
big, long term thing,

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.243
is just getting my
back back in shape.

00:36:53.243 --> 00:36:54.129
And then my stamina.

00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:56.170
I will leave here, and if
I sit down on the couch

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.617
I will take a nap
instantaneously.

00:36:57.617 --> 00:36:59.950
And I didn't used to do that,
but ever since I came back

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.408
from space I think
my body's gotten

00:37:01.408 --> 00:37:04.970
used to being a little
bit lazy in zero G. Yeah,

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.350
dancing is never good
in a public forum,

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.840
and this is going on YouTube.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.270
And so right after
landing, the biggest thing

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:14.920
was leg muscles, and my feet.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.052
I would stand-- I have
a tile kitchen floor,

00:37:17.052 --> 00:37:19.010
and I do like to cook,
so I'd be cooking dinner

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.530
the second or third
day I was back,

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.370
and after about 20 minutes
I just had to sit down.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.220
My feet could not take
that pressure anymore

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.150
on the bottoms of them.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.450
And just kind of getting you're
nervous system back running.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.805
I was a little bit sloppy.

00:37:31.805 --> 00:37:34.180
I'd been back home week and
I was feel really good--

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.395
pretty arrogant
really-- and I just

00:37:36.395 --> 00:37:38.270
went to flip a screwdriver
over and catch it,

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.590
and it whiffed completely.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.685
I mean, I didn't have any
altitude on it at all.

00:37:41.685 --> 00:37:43.935
It started to flip and went
right to the garage floor,

00:37:43.935 --> 00:37:46.590
and so I realized I was way
off where I should have been.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.010
But it all came
back really quick.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.650
So you think about
landing on Mars,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.400
and you could get right
out of the vehicle

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.580
and just start working
if you really needed to.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.496
The human body is a
pretty impressive machine.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.595
AUDIENCE: You were
pointing out when

00:38:00.595 --> 00:38:02.095
we were looking at
the space station

00:38:02.095 --> 00:38:03.886
from the outside at
the green solar panels,

00:38:03.886 --> 00:38:05.670
and I heard you
say thermal panels?

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:06.670
REID WISEMAN: Yeah, we--

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.050
AUDIENCE: that
something different?

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.800
REID WISEMAN: --have a couple
extremely over engineered

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.680
radiators that are supposed
to exhaust our heat out

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.301
into space, and they are used.

00:38:17.301 --> 00:38:19.300
We run ammonia through
them as the coolant lines

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.550
on the external side, and then
water on the internal side.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.645
And we do use them,
but their capability

00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:26.140
is way beyond the
heat rejection,

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.473
in the end, that we really need.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.109
The technology behind
them is pretty fantastic.

00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:33.524
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe
should explain

00:38:33.524 --> 00:38:34.630
why the heat exchangers?

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.350
Because it's getting
hot on sun side, right?

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.520
REID WISEMAN: Well, yeah.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.200
This is really what's going
through our internals,

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.080
like all of our
internal operations.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.100
And so outside the
space station we're

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.060
running around plus
or minus 300 degrees

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.870
as we go around the earth into
the daylight and into shade.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.500
And so we have shell heaters
to keep it warm at night,

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.830
and then we need some way
to radiate this heat away

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:56.330
in the day.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.340
So we use that, we
use coatings, we

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.136
use a thermal blankets,
stuff like that,

00:39:01.136 --> 00:39:02.760
but then those big
radiators are mainly

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.100
just taking the heat from
inside and rejecting them out

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.364
into space.

00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:08.030
If any of you guys
follow the World Cup,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.670
this is Alex getting
ready to tell me

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.640
if Germany beats America then
we have to shave our heads.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.940
And so this was the
last day I had there

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.755
hair quite awhile in space.

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:20.130
And then, if we had beaten
Germany we were going to paint

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.840
and American flag on
his head with some--

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.510
we had found some
paint up there.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.250
And sure enough, we lost.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.310
And I did not want to
shave my head at all.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:29.810
Not at all.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.890
It took some good convincing
from our commander

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.260
to get me to go.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:39.480
And so we shaved our heads,
and we had to stop for a while

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.960
to Mohawk stage.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.489
And took about a half a
day in space with Mohawks

00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:46.030
and then we went
the rest of the way.

00:39:52.234 --> 00:39:54.400
Cutting your hair in space
is-- it's actually great.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.070
You just hook a vacuum cleaner
up to the back of the clippers

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:58.770
and go to town.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.464
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:01.380
MALE SPEAKER: Hold on.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.582
AUDIENCE: That guy's trying
to spin around there.

00:40:04.582 --> 00:40:10.305
I saw a video from [INAUDIBLE]
and they were doing cat videos,

00:40:10.305 --> 00:40:13.020
and dropping them, and seeing
if he could flip over it.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.520
Were you guys part of that?

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.936
REID WISEMAN: We were not
part of that, but I tell you,

00:40:15.936 --> 00:40:17.900
if have I had a cat up there I
would have definitely dropped

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:17.970
it.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.830
I don't think much
would have happened.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.205
It would have just
floated there,

00:40:20.205 --> 00:40:22.380
but no, we weren't
a part of that.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.625
AUDIENCE: Because I remember
them talking about that

00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.174
and I was like, wait a minute.

00:40:26.174 --> 00:40:27.590
I don't know if
that's him or not.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.540
REID WISEMAN: [LAUGHS] Nope.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.115
Wasn't us.

00:40:29.115 --> 00:40:31.480
One thing that it kind of
brings to my mind though is I

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.190
thought often about I wish I had
a 10-year-old up there with me

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.916
because their brains
are so adaptive,

00:40:36.916 --> 00:40:38.290
and their bodies
are so adaptive.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.789
And the things that
they would think

00:40:39.789 --> 00:40:41.520
of-- like, my kids
right now will just

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.420
pull out their iPad Minis and
just go to town, and doing

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.180
stuff that I don't
even know to do,

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.721
but they just know how to do it
because they're just sponges.

00:40:48.721 --> 00:40:51.375
And so, I hope someday
in our lifetime

00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:53.500
we'll get where we have
commercial space station up

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.900
there, and we can send
some kids up, and just

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.691
watch them go nuts.

00:40:55.691 --> 00:40:57.810
I think it'd be really fun.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.720
They'd be more nuts.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.060
This is us doing fake
morning calisthenics.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:07.606 --> 00:41:08.980
MALE SPEAKER:
Reid, why don't you

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.502
say something about your social
networking stuff from space?

00:41:13.502 --> 00:41:16.681
You're known for that, right?

00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:18.430
REID WISEMAN: Yeah,
but it's a competitor,

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.555
so I can't talk about that.

00:41:19.555 --> 00:41:20.638
MALE SPEAKER: That's fine.

00:41:20.638 --> 00:41:21.390
Come on.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.807
REID WISEMAN: So
I didn't intend--

00:41:22.807 --> 00:41:24.806
I was a rookie going on
a long duration mission,

00:41:24.806 --> 00:41:26.850
and we haven't had a whole
lot of rookies at NASA

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:29.800
that have launched straight
into long duration space flight.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.350
Most times, most of
these older folks

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:33.600
have gone up on the shuttle,
spent two weeks in space,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.641
and come back and kind of
ease their way into it.

00:41:35.641 --> 00:41:40.470
So I didn't really want to do
a whole lot on social media.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:43.380
Swanee he's our athletics
trainer pretty much.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.580
I mean, the guy's amazing.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.120
So I didn't want to do a
whole lot on social media,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.745
but I did want to
share what it is like

00:41:47.745 --> 00:41:49.911
because most people have
the dream of weightlessness

00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:50.920
and going into space.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.580
I just wanted to
share that little bit,

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.920
so when I got up there I wanted
to put some of my emotions.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.795
What are my feelings?

00:41:55.795 --> 00:41:59.722
So I talked about how my body
felt, how I didn't feel great,

00:41:59.722 --> 00:42:01.180
what was going on
in the treadmill,

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.150
and then I realized
the view outside

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.640
is also extremely captivating.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.410
And so I just started taking
pictures and throwing them

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.190
online.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.400
And with the help of
some folks at NASA,

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.970
that Twitter account exploded.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.845
And I also really wanted
to take this world

00:42:15.845 --> 00:42:16.720
and put it in motion.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.379
Just watching Alex
here fake swimming

00:42:18.379 --> 00:42:20.420
through the Japanese
segment of the space station

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:24.540
is hysterical, and so I wanted
to kind of put motion into it.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:28.730
And so Vine had just started a
little bit before we launched,

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:33.060
and when I first got to
space we were in an area

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.400
around the sun called high
beta where the sun never

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.140
set for us in our orbital track,
and so we would go all day long

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.009
with no sunsets.

00:42:40.009 --> 00:42:41.550
But when I would
look out the cupola,

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:47.164
the sun just did a slow loop
over the course of the day.

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:48.580
And I thought that
was hysterical,

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.240
so I took a Vine
of that, and that

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.323
was the first Vine from
space where the sun's just

00:42:52.323 --> 00:42:54.260
always doing this
circle around the sky.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.100
Vine's a really neat way to
just share-- the human attention

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.780
span is shrinking.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.660
We can blame Twitter
for that, I don't know,

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.360
but Vine's six and a half
seconds of low grade video

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.350
seemed to be a great
recipe for space.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.850
I got to share lightning
storms, and the lightning

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.100
from space when you're looking
down on that from above

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.785
was probably the most
fascinating thing.

00:43:13.785 --> 00:43:15.910
Just watching all the
different kinds of lightning,

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.810
and how it would creep
across the clouds,

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.351
and just getting to
throw that online

00:43:19.351 --> 00:43:20.662
and share it was magnificent.

00:43:20.662 --> 00:43:22.370
And now I have a whole
journal of my time

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:23.440
up there, which is really neat.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.148
And I've used it a
lot since I came back.

00:43:31.585 --> 00:43:33.710
AUDIENCE: Hopefully this
isn't too space political,

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:37.220
but tagging onto your point
about the commercial space

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.410
station, what are
your thoughts on SLS

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.870
and the Orion capsule versus
SpaceX and commercial space

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:45.370
flight?

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:45.960
REID WISEMAN: You
know, it's kind

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.760
of the difference between
a Ferrari and a Ford F-150

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.570
pickup.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.682
Each one is great
in their own respect

00:43:52.682 --> 00:43:53.890
is the easiest way to put it.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.740
So Orion and SLS, if we
just launched that thing

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.297
to the space station it would
be a colossal waste of money.

00:44:00.297 --> 00:44:02.630
So we're talking about heavy
lift, long duration getting

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.986
stuff, really far away
from the Earth, and to do

00:44:04.986 --> 00:44:06.860
that we need to put a
lot of mass into orbit.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.100
So that's what SLS is
going to do with Orion.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.960
And we just launched Orion in
November on a first flight test

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.300
and it when exceedingly well.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.180
And so that program is
actually looking pretty good.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:20.340
And the SLS is a really
reconfigurable capable rocket

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.760
so you can strap
on extra boosters

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.730
and put more mass in, or
take some boosters off

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:24.620
if you don't need it.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.450
So I really like where
that's going because I

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:28.900
want to go as far as we can.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.440
As a human being,
exploration is awesome,

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.632
and I want to do
as much as we can.

00:44:33.632 --> 00:44:35.340
But then when you look
at a SpaceX model,

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.800
they're really just trying
to get a little bit of mass

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.850
to the space station.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.720
And what's great
about them is they're

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.170
doing it super
efficient, super cheap,

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:47.050
and when you take away
all the layers of,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.262
I guess I could say
bureaucracy, they

00:44:49.262 --> 00:44:50.970
can strip it right
down to the bare bones

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:52.560
like you guys do here every day.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.060
And you can innovate,
configure, test.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.710
Didn't work-- change.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.780
Fly another one, test,
change, and the way

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.030
that they've eased
into this is launching

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.120
cargo for a few years.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.590
They've learned a ton,
and now their design

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.130
for launching humans has
evolved a lot from all of that.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.474
And so hopefully
2017, 2018-- I think

00:45:09.474 --> 00:45:11.890
it'll be more like 2018-- we'll
be putting humans on that.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.250
And then we also have Boeing.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.640
Boeing is building a
capsule, so we have

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.131
a parallel path which I love.

00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:18.630
So if somebody
encounters a problem,

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.757
we can always work around.

00:45:19.757 --> 00:45:22.090
Having a couple options, I
mean, that's the American way

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.414
and that's great.

00:45:23.414 --> 00:45:25.330
And then, we're waiting
for the Google design,

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:26.942
but I don't know if it's coming.

00:45:26.942 --> 00:45:29.150
MALE SPEAKER: (Jokingly)
That's obviously classified.

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.468
We're not going to
talk about that today.

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:39.000
AUDIENCE: So are we
ready to send people

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.640
to Mars, and if not,
what's standing in our way?

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.140
REID WISEMAN: It's
a great question,

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.540
and it's one that I can only
talk very high level too.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.450
I'd say radiation is
standing in our way.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.850
I'd say supplies is
standing in our way.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.302
When I looked at my food
and the amount of waste--

00:45:52.302 --> 00:45:54.510
not food waste but packaging
waste because everything

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.660
has to be in a plastic
bag for rehydratables,

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.910
and then there's gotta be a
little radiation shielding

00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:59.710
around that.

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:01.800
And if I just thought of
all the food-- I mean,

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.020
I would look at all this
mass and packaging of food.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:09.300
So just the sustainability of us
has to get a little bit better.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.346
From the oxygen, water,
CO2, scrubbing bathroom side

00:46:14.346 --> 00:46:15.720
I think we've got
a great system,

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.430
and if you have
enough spare parts

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:18.960
you're going to
be in good shape.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.070
3D printing is going to
really be a fantastic thing

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.080
for us to be able to just print
spare parts, spare tools-- that

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.330
really will be a game changer.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.504
And we had a 3D printer up
there right when I left.

00:46:28.504 --> 00:46:30.920
Unfortunately, I didn't get
it hooked up in time to print,

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.040
but they've been printing up
there on a first generation,

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.700
and then they're going to
have second generation soon.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.800
So that one's going to be great.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.800
And then the other one
that's the unknown factor

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.000
is radiation.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.790
And when you get outside of the
protective layers of the Earth,

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:44.200
and you spend 500
days outside of that,

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.150
radiation is going to
be kind of a big deal.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.257
But MSL just went out, it
had radiation detectors

00:46:48.257 --> 00:46:49.840
all over it, and
actually, the picture

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.423
looks a little better
than we thought.

00:46:51.423 --> 00:46:55.647
And so, I think it seems
like it's a pipe dream,

00:46:55.647 --> 00:46:57.605
but if somebody just
says, we're going to do it

00:46:57.605 --> 00:47:00.552
and we're going to do it by
now, I think we could do it.

00:47:00.552 --> 00:47:02.510
I was just reading about
Mars One this morning,

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.710
and they only need
a couple billion,

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.720
and they're going to try it.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.150
The technology is-- it's
not there yet right now,

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.909
but all the underlying
levels are there,

00:47:11.909 --> 00:47:14.450
and all we need is that driving
force to just say, all right,

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:15.280
we're going to go do it.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.420
Let's just stop messing around.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.270
Let's just go do it.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.120
So I think it's
definitely possible.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.320
I think we should see it
in our lifetimes hopefully.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.510
It'd be great.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:28.210
MALE SPEAKER: How does 3D
printing differ in Zero-G?

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.466
REID WISEMAN: I talked
to the guys a little bit

00:47:30.466 --> 00:47:32.590
and they said it really
doesn't differ a whole lot.

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:36.539
The machine is pretty much
just like printing at home.

00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:37.955
I don't know the
technicals of it.

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.180
It was made in space.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:44.030
It made the 3D printer, so
look them up and buy them.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.290
AUDIENCE: We saw
the fluid dynamics,

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:52.170
and you mentioned how you had
a lot of blood drawn from you.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.890
How does the body
react to trauma?

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:57.290
And say there is
arterial bleeding,

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:02.340
or do the platelets reactant
and clot at the same rate?

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:07.444
How, like a physical trauma, a
bruise, does it heal quickly?

00:48:07.444 --> 00:48:08.860
REID WISEMAN: The
only side that I

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.930
could talk to that from
because I'm not a doctor

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.240
and I just don't know enough of
the details of what's going on

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.350
inside me, but I can talk from
what happened to me while I

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.400
was up there and what I saw.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.180
And so we'd get nicks
and cuts all the time,

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.440
and it seemed like the healing
rate was just like on earth.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.606
It seem like your bleed
rate was just like on earth,

00:48:22.606 --> 00:48:24.940
so your clotting functions
appear to be totally normal.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.447
Your blood volume does change
because your body recognizes

00:48:27.447 --> 00:48:29.280
that your blood is not
pooling in your legs,

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.140
so it just starts to shut off
a little bit of your blood

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:32.640
volume.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.840
So when we come back to
Earth, just standing up

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.256
at the end of the
mission can lead

00:48:36.256 --> 00:48:39.220
to passing out until you get
your blood volume back up.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.200
But aside from
that, it appeared as

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.254
though our body, which
shouldn't operate in Zero G,

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:45.920
works really well
from that perspective.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.200
And so we had one guy
get a small water burn,

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.150
and that healed up,
actually, pretty quick.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:52.150
I was surprised.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.861
So if you think in space,
like if you grab a hot pan

00:48:55.861 --> 00:48:58.360
or you put your hand under hot
water, the first thing you do

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.360
is back away.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.110
Well, I'd never thought
about this before,

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.440
but he got hit in
the back of his head

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.090
with a little bit of hot
liquid that had come out

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.389
of the water dispenser,
and the first thing he did

00:49:06.389 --> 00:49:06.930
was smack it.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:08.822
And now he's got
two places of burns,

00:49:08.822 --> 00:49:10.530
and there's no way to
get it off until he

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.190
got clothing, and
towels, and stuff

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.273
like that to get this off.

00:49:13.273 --> 00:49:16.250
And so he had some
blistering, and it scared me.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.310
It was a moment where I had
never thought of hot water

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:20.820
as such a dangerous
thing, and then

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.111
in space, yeah, you could
really hurt yourself on that.

00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:26.340
But we appeared
to heal just fine.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.198
Good question.

00:49:27.198 --> 00:49:29.690
MALE SPEAKER: Could you
hurt yourself with hot air?

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:32.070
I mean, you could make
a bubble of water,

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.290
you could make a bubble
of really hot air.

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:35.290
REID WISEMAN: You could.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:36.942
Yeah, you definitely good.

00:49:36.942 --> 00:49:38.525
Overall our ventilation
system thought

00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:41.622
was kind of shedding that stuff,
but there's a lot of great ways

00:49:41.622 --> 00:49:42.330
to hurt yourself.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.164
I mean, I came very close
to breaking a finger.

00:49:46.164 --> 00:49:48.830
You get stuff in your eyes, like
floating particulate every once

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.340
in a while, and so NASA's
really, really careful

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.020
about just any shard of metal.

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.780
I mean, now that's a very
scary thing when you're

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.040
out there floating around.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.140
MALE SPEAKER: I remember
somebody was telling me

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:03.280
when he was on a
space walk, they

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.610
had a problem in their eyes
when the eyes started tearing,

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:10.555
and that those tears
became a blob over his eye

00:50:10.555 --> 00:50:12.862
and he could barely see stuff.

00:50:12.862 --> 00:50:14.820
REID WISEMAN: One of the
first things I noticed

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.412
was just when you
laugh so hard you cry,

00:50:17.412 --> 00:50:18.870
then that's just
stuck in your eye,

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.661
and it just forms this
bubble in your eyes.

00:50:20.661 --> 00:50:22.300
It's a very weird
feeling at first,

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.937
and so you're dabbing your
tears out of your eyes,

00:50:24.937 --> 00:50:26.770
and I experienced that
quite a bit up there.

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:28.029
So yeah, for sure.

00:50:28.029 --> 00:50:29.820
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned some experiments

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.220
from Procter &amp; Gamble.

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.576
Are they paying you guys
to do that, and if so,

00:50:34.576 --> 00:50:35.700
how do you feel about that?

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.390
REID WISEMAN: I can probably
defer to some of our NASA folks

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.880
here, but we have
this organization now

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.380
called CASIS, which
is really trying

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.640
to bring in outside research.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.800
And the space station, now that
we're extending out to 2024,

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.050
that's the pride and
joy of our operation,

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:52.340
is just getting these outside
people to fly their research.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.960
And so almost all of it is going
to be some sort of joint work,

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.432
like working with NASA
to fly their research up

00:50:58.432 --> 00:50:59.390
onto the space station.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.630
But CASIS is really working on
turning around stuff extremely,

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.370
extremely quickly, which
NASA is not good at,

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.810
and getting this outside
thinking up there.

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.470
And the rodent
research that we're

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.360
doing right now with the mice
is one of the prime examples.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.910
That has just
exploded, and they're

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.240
talking about our
utilization, at least

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.910
for the next five years,
of just being hardcore

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.160
looking at these things.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.440
From a CASIS perspective,
looking at immune function,

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.970
looking at brain wasting--
all kinds of just crazy things

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:28.880
with the mice.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.110
And so they may even
fly them for 180 days

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:34.080
and go through a whole life
cycle of them in orbit.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.320
Really amazing to see.

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.960
And so I really
applaud the efforts

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.579
of trying to bring in
these outside people

00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:42.120
to make it-- I don't think you
could ever make it necessarily

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:46.230
profitable, but just to open
it up and get things in space

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:47.765
quickly with some
great imagination

00:51:47.765 --> 00:51:50.417
and see what happens.

00:51:50.417 --> 00:51:52.041
MALE SPEAKER: I have
one more question.

00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:54.260
So the space station
has been, what?

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.130
15 years now in orbit?

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.550
So that's a lot of
miles flown in orbit.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:03.240
Was there ever an event
of micrometeorites,

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.119
micrometeorites-- what
am I talking about?

00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:07.660
Micrometeors.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.279
REID WISEMAN: We call it MMOD.

00:52:09.279 --> 00:52:10.445
Damage from mircometeorites.

00:52:10.445 --> 00:52:12.361
MALE SPEAKER: Hitting
and puncturing anything,

00:52:12.361 --> 00:52:15.179
or like leaving a trace of
some sort on the space station.

00:52:15.179 --> 00:52:16.220
REID WISEMAN: Absolutely.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.210
We have holes all over it.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:18.710
Little ones.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.780
And the whole thing is
shielded in an MMOD shielding,

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:26.190
but the one example from my
flight are cupola windows.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:28.450
We were looking out the
front window, go to bed,

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:29.950
get up the next
morning, and there's

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:33.194
almost a dime sized chip in the
outer surface of the window.

00:52:33.194 --> 00:52:35.110
It's almost like you're
driving on the highway

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.570
and a rock hit you,
and you're like, hmm.

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:40.170
I mean, that was going 17,000
miles an hour plus, probably,

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:41.720
when it whacked us,
but those windows

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.549
are designed to take
it, and you just

00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:45.840
hope you don't get another
hit in that exact same spot.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.060
But the space station is very
well designed for all that.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:48.680
It's holding up well.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.054
When we were out
on a space walk,

00:52:50.054 --> 00:52:52.566
I mean, you could look all
over little dings, and chips,

00:52:52.566 --> 00:52:54.940
and nicks, and things like
that, but nothing like a hole.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.270
Nothing like a giant
hole in the side of it,

00:52:57.270 --> 00:53:00.180
so far we've been good on that.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.710
AUDIENCE: All right, so you
mentioned that now you're

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:08.540
feeling discomfort standing
up for a while even now.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.072
That's just after six
months of being up there.

00:53:11.072 --> 00:53:13.030
Are you going to get the
chance to go up again,

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:14.300
or is that a one done thing?

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:15.320
REID WISEMAN: No,
I should definitely

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.510
get the chance to go
up again, hopefully

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:17.360
within about five years.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.000
We'll see.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.860
AUDIENCE: So is it just kind
of a wait until everyone

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.060
everything grows back, and you
can stand and do everything

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.970
regularly?

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.330
And then, or--

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:28.580
REID WISEMAN: No, I mean,
right now I could fly again.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.955
I mean, when I talk about
discomfort it's extremely mild,

00:53:30.955 --> 00:53:32.670
but I can still feel
it a little bit,

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:34.550
so it just lets me
know that I'm not

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:36.620
fully there all the way around.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.457
I mean, the best
therapy for that right

00:53:38.457 --> 00:53:41.040
now would be going back up and
getting back in weightlessness,

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:41.800
and stretching back out.

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.425
I grow a little over
an inch and a half

00:53:43.425 --> 00:53:45.490
while I was up there, just
as my spine elongated.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:48.360
And I made it to about six
feet tall, which was good.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.275
And we have a growth
chart in node one

00:53:50.275 --> 00:53:52.900
with people that have put their
names on the wall as they grow,

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.066
so it's a lot like your
parent's old house up there.

00:53:55.066 --> 00:53:56.202
It's pretty cute.

00:53:56.202 --> 00:53:57.660
AUDIENCE: So what
you're saying is,

00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.390
if I want to grow I
should go up into space.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.960
REID WISEMAN: Yeah,
will definitely

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.430
get about an inch and a half
of vertical out of that.

00:54:05.702 --> 00:54:07.660
AUDIENCE:Yeah, so the
space station has been up

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.490
for a while-- 15 years.

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:12.240
Is living inside
the space station

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.970
still-- does it feel
like being inside

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:17.950
of a developmental aircraft
where you're still attaching

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:20.660
new things, and new
pumps are coming in,

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.930
and new procedures
to operate it?

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:24.830
Or is it pretty well
established on how

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:26.254
to use the space station?

00:54:26.254 --> 00:54:28.670
REID WISEMAN: You would think
it's completely established,

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.530
and in the end it's
not at all established.

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:32.489
Everything is changing.

00:54:32.489 --> 00:54:34.738
You guys would go up there
and laugh at the technology

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:36.720
because in order to get
stuff flown into space

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.190
the turnaround time
is pretty long,

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.800
and that's where CASIS
is trying to change that.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.970
I mean, our computers
were these extremely old--

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:45.980
I think they're like
T520s or something.

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.526
You just look at these
computers like, wow.

00:54:48.526 --> 00:54:49.900
But we just upgrade
to Windows 7,

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.108
which was pretty nice for us.

00:54:51.108 --> 00:54:53.390
That was a big upgrade
they did there.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.040
But no, everything is
changing, and we're learning.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.210
We used to just do these
hardcore procedures that

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.030
were written out, and
now we're realizing

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.059
that instead of
the written word,

00:55:02.059 --> 00:55:03.850
maybe we could just
put a five second video

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.802
clip in that just shows
you zooming into this panel

00:55:06.802 --> 00:55:08.760
and turning on the switch
that you need to find

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.843
in a really hard location.

00:55:09.843 --> 00:55:12.000
Instead of putting that
in 15 lines of procedures,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.500
you just put it in
one little video,

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.790
and then that's embedded
in what they send up to us.

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.520
And I know some guys were just
under the water at this thing

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.770
called Nemo, and they were
all wearing Google Glass,

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.160
and running their
procedures right on that.

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.760
And so I see the functionality
for all that would fantastic.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.680
And then the hardware
is all changing.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.870
We're swapping out
our CO2 scrubbers.

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:32.685
They were not
on-orbit cleanable,

00:55:32.685 --> 00:55:34.560
and so now we're changing
out all the filters

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.143
there to make them
on-orbit cleanable,

00:55:36.143 --> 00:55:37.730
and that changes the whole game.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:39.710
The CO2 we run a
bit higher up there

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:41.930
gives you a really bad
headache from time to time,

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:43.410
and that was one
thing that we learned.

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:45.310
Hey, the current design
just is not sufficient,

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:46.750
so now we're working
on this new design.

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:49.360
They're gonna fly it next year,
and they'll be vacuumable,

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.800
and it'll be much better.

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.660
We can run the CO2
down to a lower level.

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:55.794
So there is no way we
are like one and done.

00:55:55.794 --> 00:55:57.210
It's innovate,
innovate, innovate.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.580
Design changes, and try to
make it better, and keep going.

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.000
And so we are
using it absolutely

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.610
as a test bed for deep
space exploration.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:07.490
AUDIENCE: So ISS has
a limited lifetime.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.740
I understand 2024 at this point.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.320
What happens if they
don't extend it?

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.070
Are they designing
the new iteration

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.679
to fly it out and depress it.

00:56:15.679 --> 00:56:18.220
REID WISEMAN: The hope would be
that we can kind of turn over

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.400
to commercial entities and
let them run up in space.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:27.425
I know Bigelow out in Las Vegas,
they have inflatable hab units,

00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:29.300
kind of, and they're
going to actually attach

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.660
one of those to the outside of
the space station next year.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.451
And so if that works
out really well-- it's

00:56:33.451 --> 00:56:35.620
a great design-- then who knows?

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.700
Maybe Bigelow could be
operating a space station

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.330
with SpaceX rockets going up and
servicing it, and running all

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.750
these experiments for people.

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.390
Not just in the US, but all
the way around the world.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.270
And you could just buy a package
for like a one month research

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.130
package, and fly your
hardware up there.

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:51.027
And you as a scientist can
go up, and do your research,

00:56:51.027 --> 00:56:51.610
and come back.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:54.700
And so that's where, I think,
we would love to see it go.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.910
If there's a market to
drive it we'll wait and see,

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:59.642
but I think that there
could be if it's done well,

00:56:59.642 --> 00:57:01.350
and SpaceX has definitely
proven that you

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:04.020
can cut the cost considerably.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.430
All right, it's been a pleasure.

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:06.930
Thanks everybody
for your attention,

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:08.720
and thanks for
having me out here.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:12.070
[APPLAUSE]
