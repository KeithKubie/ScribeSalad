00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:04.381
The US National Deficit
is about $17 trillion.

00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:08.640
This is what $17 trillion looks like
with all the zeros written out.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.753
That's a lot of zeros.

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:12.964
Writing out all those zeros took,

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:16.550
writing out all those zeros
was kind of annoying.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.720
Luckily, we have something
called the scientific notation

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.350
to help us write really big or
really small numbers.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.970
Using scientific notation,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.020
we would write this number as
1.7 times ten to the tenth.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.900
Let's learn how to do that.
