1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:01,880
Okay.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,870
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:06,140
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,970
January 4th, 2016 a brand new year.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,250
Brand New Year. Brand new you.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,360
Are you going to make the changes
that you've always wanted to make?

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,950
Where are you going to get up?

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,060
Tell yourself you gotta change
and actually go out there. Change.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,330
I always love the pressure at the
beginning of the new year to be like, God,

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,790
you know there's that one great thing,
right? Like what? You're like guide,

11
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,820
shaken off the last year. You know, like,

12
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,280
I don't know who the
fuck that guy was. Right?

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,540
Like lie to yourself like you're not
the same person fucking one minute later

14
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,650
when it becomes a new year or you do
the real childish thing as you blame

15
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:50,310
everybody else for your own
fucking problems, you know? Okay,

16
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,540
wait for this year to be over, man. She
spent so much fucking bullshit to share,

17
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:58,170
to be like towards fucking you. I
can't wait for the next fucking year.

18
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:00,090
It's like, Dude, oh well are
you going to change anything?

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,740
You're going to break up with the person,

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,950
you're going to stop getting drunk and
being a Dick and picking fights in a bar,

21
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:09,360
right? All of that shit. Oh,

22
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,920
you just gonna think that magically,

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,040
because this is six there
now instead of a five,

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,690
that all of a sudden the world's gonna
Change. You don't have to adjust. Oh,

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,560
am I reprimanding somebody right
now? I think I am. I don't know why.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,480
I have no idea why I'm recording this.
Uh, at about eight 30 in the morning,

27
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,410
last time delays time, my wife's
still sleeping downstairs,

28
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:34,350
so I gotta I gotta try
to stay at medium energy,

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,160
medium energy here, um, for the
rest of this fucking podcast. Um,

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:41,680
okay.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,750
But whatever, I'm kind of,
I've gotta be honest with you.

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,330
I went to bed last night and I was sad.

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,680
I love the holidays and I'm sad that
they're fucking over. I had another great,

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:51,940
you know,

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,260
holiday break and to think that it's
all going to fucking start over again,

36
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,140
you know, here we go.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,270
Okay.

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,010
Now the fucking year or doing the road
right and shit and doing all this stuff

39
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:08,170
here we fucking go again. Yeah.
The whole thing just got, oh,

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,250
just totally overwhelming with me
and I was just fucking laying in bed.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,073
You know,

42
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,890
you know when you do fucking look too
far ahead into your fucking life, um,

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:21,850
okay.

44
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,620
You know, it just gets
too fucking overwhelming.

45
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,110
And then maybe you start
hearing the saint that,

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,120
you know what song I always hear in my
head, I always say that's that song.

47
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:31,160
Make the world Jolo way.

48
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,790
Sub Did sub dead Ed,
get it off my shoulders.

49
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,110
Um, that's what I feel like the most
pathetic emotion you could have.

50
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:45,540
Make the world go away. Can you just
get to go in there and just pout,

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,713
you know?

52
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,050
Okay.

53
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,760
I got to ask a question about depression.

54
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,290
Is it actually a chemical thing or is
that just an adult world word for like

55
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:59,830
somebody who's just kind of
sort of powering, you know,

56
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,100
I think a lot of times when people
go, I'm depressed, it's just you.

57
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,930
You're just kind of
feeling sorry for yourself.

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,610
And you know the ones that say it's like
a chemical imbalance. You just like,

59
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,560
you just shift your head really quickly.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,340
The chemicals go back to the other
way and you'll chair up, you know,

61
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,790
don't believe the
mainstream media, you know,

62
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,610
in all the pharmaceutical
companies with their drugs, man,

63
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,730
is there anything funnier they want
somebody who's not a fucking doctor,

64
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,640
you know, just starts going on and on
about you. Let me tell you something, man,

65
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,410
I'm telling you, all you gotta do is
just go up, walk up to an oak tree,

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,300
can't be a barge, can't be a maple.

67
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,980
Go Up to an oak tree and just bite on
the little sapling. You just not on it,

68
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,251
right?

69
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,070
You got a little piece of bark and you
stick it between you just like Choo.

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,790
You just stick it to you go and all of
that. And your depression will go away.

71
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,920
Yeah, it is true.

72
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,450
It is true that native Americans used
to do it and they were never depressed.

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,800
That's what they used to do until the
white man came and took their bark away.

74
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,140
Now look at them all grumpy. Just
like the white man cause they,

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,490
cause they couldn't get any more
saplings with the tree bark there. Um,

76
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,680
anyways, uh, for,

77
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,300
as he and his wife left yesterday
so the house is empty again.

78
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,510
It just stinks man. I was having
a great fucking time and join it.

79
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,880
Now it's gone. I, I'll
fucking starts over again.

80
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,830
I'm already starting the year
off. My office is a fucking mess.

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,400
You know, I'm, I'm the worst.

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,720
I can't find this sticker to put on my
fucking license plate. I know. I got it.

83
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,420
I don't know where the fuck it
is. It just, it all starts over.

84
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,010
They just fun times over. Fun
Time is over. You know what?

85
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:52,780
We still got the Christmas tree up because
Nia liked it extra a lot this year.

86
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:57,340
So I still have today. I still have to
go through that sad fucking operation,

87
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,250
upbringing, that goddamn thing outside.

88
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:02,830
And I told you I dispose that
thing like a fucking mob head.

89
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,640
You're never going to find the body by
fucking neighbor already threw his right

90
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,580
out on the street. Just
tosses it out there, right?

91
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,640
Some dead hooker, you know what I mean?

92
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,540
Cut The fucking thing up and you put
it in the barrel. That's what you do.

93
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,600
I get mine might the green barrel, right?

94
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,750
We got the green barrels out here and
that's just like grass clippings and all

95
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:23,440
that shit.

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,650
I have a whole fucking Christmas tree
and then the lid closes completely.

97
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,910
You'd have no fucking idea. I mean,
come on people. How difficult is it?

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,290
You cut all the branches off.

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,650
They need just left with the trunk
and then he just section it up.

100
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,550
It says drop the thing. Right. The
fuck in there. It's not a problem.

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,440
He wait. You safety goggles, you
know, so nobody can see you cry.

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,393
And as you're doing it,

103
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,520
I don't understand what the fucking
problem is that God damn it,

104
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:53,260
get out there and dispose of
the fucking tree. Correct. Um,

105
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,191
environmentally,

106
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:57,290
wouldn't it be more correct if you just
thought to spread it across your lawn?

107
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,190
The tree is just going to end up in a
landfill or even worse out in the ocean.

108
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,050
They don't, the lack of the Oh shit. Um,

109
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,280
I can't wait to get to this fucking
thing later on in this podcast with this

110
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,320
guy. He's trying to claim that the, uh,

111
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,860
the earth can sustain 100 billion
people. I really cannot see,

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,650
I cannot wait to, I just glanced at
it and looked at it and it's just,

113
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,030
I just, how the fuck you, you
will arrived at that number.

114
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
And I actually tried to find shit.

115
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:30,260
I started looking up how many fucking
people the Earth can sustain. And uh,

116
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,680
what I've immediately found was
that nobody could say for certain,

117
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,660
but the numbers estimated we're nowhere
near a hundred billion fucking people.

118
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,070
How to billion. Sorry.

119
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:45,071
So I cannot wait to read this guy somehow
claiming that there's enough farmland.

120
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,500
Okay.

121
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,240
To feed a hundred fucking

122
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,863
okay.

123
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,550
Billion people. Yeah. I don't know. Okay.

124
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,940
Did we stack each other on top
of one another? And even then,

125
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,250
do elephants get to roam free anymore?
Where all the fucking animals?

126
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,260
Um, if there was odd a
billion people on the planet,

127
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,850
I would think that cannibalism
would slowly start to become legal.

128
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,930
They would have a Beta of
farm people or stock people,

129
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:19,160
that's what they'd call them.
And they would be simply be, um,

130
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,230
used for food, you know?

131
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,560
Okay.

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,590
We just, you know, and of course
it would be, uh, you know,

133
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,180
the evil white man would decide who it
is that gets eaten first. You know, baby,

134
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,000
they'd start with like the pygmies or
something like that because it'd be like,

135
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,150
all right, well, you know, they're
a, they are of a particular race,

136
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:42,140
but they're not as tall as most
people in that race. So, you know,

137
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,620
there's sort of bite size, little like
sliders, right? Sliders. They like,

138
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,950
she would sliders, you know, get
a little honey bun, you know,

139
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:52,730
stick a fucking ankle between the
two. Right. Why would you do an ankle,

140
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,390
ankle meet? Um,

141
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,300
so anyways, I've, I still feel fucked
up from the rose bowl man. I still,

142
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,850
you know, I barely got any
sleep with Paul being out here.

143
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:10,050
And then we also performed New
Year's Eve, uh, down the Orpheum.

144
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,320
And I bought this suit
to wear New Year's Eve.

145
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:17,430
I found it like over the summertime
it was this all white suit.

146
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,650
Okay.

147
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,880
Jacket and pants. But you know, from,
from a distance it reads all white,

148
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:26,060
but when you come up to it, it
had these tiny black polka dots,

149
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,010
you know what I mean? Just tiny. And uh,

150
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,800
I walked into the store and it was on
like the fucking 70% off rack because it's

151
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,850
really one of those things like, where
the fuck are you ever gonna wear that?

152
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,820
And I saw, I was like, that's a
perfect suit for fucking new year's.

153
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:44,360
You put the black fucking
solid black shirt underneath.

154
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,170
They were little black pocket
square, right? And your walk out,

155
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,530
they're like John Travolta. But I bet book

156
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,640
[inaudible] you can tell by the way
I tell jokes, I'm a fucking act.

157
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,470
No time for originality. I'm sorry.

158
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,750
She fucking shit jokes. Fucking the
jokes. I don't like to use concepts.

159
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,300
I know. Anyways.

160
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,650
So that was once again me standing to
the side of the stage going like a,

161
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,470
I am either go that people either going
to like this suit or I'm going to get

162
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:19,050
heckled the entire time I'm
out here. But either way,

163
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,260
either way it's gonna add to
the fucking show. But, uh,

164
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,760
as I predicted it was new
year's, I addressed the suit.

165
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,570
I said this is the only night I could
wear it. And people left and it was a, uh,

166
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,780
it was a great fucking time.
Great old theater. And uh,

167
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:38,040
I had a bunch of people come out, um,

168
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,880
a bunch of friends, you know, people
I hadn't seen in a couple of years.

169
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,940
People that you know, kind of
in my life. It was awesome, man.

170
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,280
I love doing new year's
out here in La Cause uh,

171
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,550
I don't have to travel
or anything like that.

172
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,620
And I get to do the job
I love to do. However,

173
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:54,780
I think that's the last
New Year's Eve I'll do.

174
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,850
I think I'll do like the 30th next time
because I gotta tell ya the second show

175
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,290
ends right. By the way,

176
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:06,291
I had to do the countdown on like
two jokes before my closing joke.

177
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,970
I was like halfway through this one
pit that I'd been trying to work on.

178
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:13,290
I kept fucking up the ending and I was
going to try a new ending to it because

179
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:17,010
the ending was too sad for every fucking
city in this nation other than Dallas,

180
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,790
Texas, Dallas, Texas. Fucking enjoy
the shit out of the original ending.

181
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,190
Um, and I'm right in the middle of
that bit and I see that it's 1159.

182
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:30,630
So then I had to get out of the pit,
take a pause, and then do the countdown,

183
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,560
and then the streamers came out.
Right. Lovely. Nia came out on stage,

184
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:37,320
gave me a kiss. All the
guys came, you know,

185
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,740
we fucking waves and everything and then
everybody gets off the stage and then I

186
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:45,120
had to go back into my act,
which was uh, uh, I dunno,

187
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,160
it just ended up being funny because
it was really weird. So anyways,

188
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,600
um, we ended up doing the
show and then as we leave,

189
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,580
um, we're stuck in this brutal
traffic. I'm like, what the fuck?

190
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:02,010
There must've been some going
on cause we went downtown La,

191
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,440
that must have been
something going on, um,

192
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,160
down at like la live or some shit down
there that's right near the staples

193
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:08,551
center.

194
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:13,551
And then I fucking realized the next day
it was motley crew's final show ever at

195
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:19,620
the staple center. And
um, so I was like, ah,

196
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,230
fuck, that's the traffic we get stuck in.

197
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,210
And there's actually a clip up on
youtube of, you know, Tommy Lee,

198
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:28,170
the drummer does,

199
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,380
he has a whole fucking rollercoaster
attached to his drum kit where it turns

200
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:37,380
upside down and it goes out over the
crowd and then comes back and all that

201
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:41,390
shit. I mean the right
there alone. You know,

202
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,060
if you're the other members in
the band, you gotta be like, dude,

203
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:48,390
this better be fucking worth it because
the amount of money that's coming out of

204
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:52,590
our checks to fucking carry that
rig out on the fucking road.

205
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:55,860
You know what I mean? That's
one of those overhead costs.

206
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,910
So I don't know if you
guys have seen the video.

207
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:02,290
It's their last fucking show
ever and the thing gets stuck.

208
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It gets stuck and Tommy is upside down
on this thing in this roadie scamper and

209
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,391
up the side of it,

210
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:14,350
like the fucking apes and plan into the
apes when they were on the Golden Gate

211
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,101
Bridge right there.

212
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:19,720
Scampering up the side of this thing
and Tommy is just upside down like,

213
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,190
what the fuck man?

214
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,240
The fuck it digs busted.
He's like, hey la. He's like,

215
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,200
what? You look,

216
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,530
you look at it too soon when I'm hanging
upside down in Los Angeles and he's

217
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:35,000
just hanging upside down.

218
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,070
It's the most excrutiatingly
uncomfortable thing I've seen her perform.

219
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,790
I have to go through in a long time.
He did. What the fuck he could do.

220
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,830
I mean, once you just go, well,
fuck the role of coach to her man,

221
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,880
and you're still lagging upside
down. I mean, what do you do?

222
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,870
It's just fucking brutal in the fact
that it happened on the very last show.

223
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,720
You know, I don't want
to start any infighting.

224
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,000
I know the band doesn't exist anymore,
but I think Vince Neil did it.

225
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,360
I think the lead singer probably
all these years, you know,

226
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,090
he's used to being out front and all
the chicks digging them, you know,

227
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,220
walking around with his
Barbie hair and all that.

228
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,030
And then all the drama goes all the
way out over the crowd and everybody's

229
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,820
looking at him and maybe he got
sick of it after all these years.

230
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,720
The amount of money that was coming out
of his paycheck to bring that fucking

231
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,330
loopty loop roller coaster with
the fucking drum kit in it.

232
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,750
And he probably went, probably said,
hey, everybody look at that over there.

233
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:36,700
And then he just pulled a fuse.
Uh, that doesn't make any sense,

234
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,490
Bill. Then he sabotaging
his own show. Wow. You know,

235
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,400
I can have a fucking theory,

236
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,760
somebody could just email me with no
fucking links or anything whatsoever and

237
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,500
just tell me that the earth
can sustain 100 billion people

238
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,210
anyways. So we, uh, we're
stuck in that traffic.

239
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:01,211
I didn't get home until like a one 31 45,

240
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,470
fell asleep around two and then I had to
be up at 10 if 10 after five to then be

241
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,260
outside for the next 13 hours at the, uh,

242
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,400
at the rose bowl this year we
brought eight people and um,

243
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,573
okay.

244
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,160
One of my buddies who went there,

245
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:22,020
he just called it the goon parade
and I gotta be honest with you. Uh,

246
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,910
that's kind of what we were,

247
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,580
I don't remember so much of it.

248
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,390
I remember the whole game cause I just
stopped drinking cause I had to drive.

249
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:36,350
So I just remember walking to the stadium
and after that I remember the entire

250
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:40,820
fucking game. Um, so I'll take
you through what I remember.

251
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:45,050
So we fucking get there, right? First
time ever. We get this so fucking early.

252
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,090
They haven't even opened the gates
yet. So when we finally get in,

253
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,030
we're parked outside the VIP parking.

254
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:56,300
I mean we had like a five minute walk
to the stadium was fucking tremendous.

255
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,150
And uh, I remember Barton, nick
given me a Miller high life,

256
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,830
the big grin on his face,

257
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:07,640
cause we always had the Miller high
life to start the day law had got his

258
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,960
fucking law. I had made it by
the way he made it, you know,

259
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,710
I'll never smile again. Um,

260
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,960
he made it and uh,

261
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:21,920
he got all three of his fires going
and getting ready for the breakfast

262
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,700
sandwiches.

263
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,230
And I want to say that I waited
till after I had law heads.

264
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,780
Unbelievable breakfast sandwiches.

265
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,260
The best breakfast sandwich I have
every fucking year is that one.

266
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,430
And it was absolutely delicious. And my
favorite thing was looking over at firs,

267
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,800
he, after he was two bites in
and I was like, Hey Paul, I go,

268
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,650
how's that breakfast sandwich? And he
just fucking shot me. He look like,

269
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,790
are you fucking kidding me?

270
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,420
So I was already site and I knew he was
going to have a great time. And, um,

271
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,580
after that it was like, Hey, I'm like,
who wants a heater? Everybody's like,

272
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:56,330
yeah, right. So he poured like fucking
eight of them and I had these, these,

273
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,670
those big square ice cubes.

274
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,510
I had made those and brought him over
in a ziplock bag, like a fucking,

275
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,130
you know, kilo a coke.

276
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,120
So I drop him into everybody's
Plastic Cup in this so big,

277
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,030
they don't make it all the way
down to the bottom of the glass.

278
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,920
So the booze is actually below the ice
level and everybody's laughing. I'm like,

279
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,450
well, you just got to fucking,

280
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,730
he got to pull more bows in there and yet
he put your hand over the ice cube and

281
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,750
it'll melt down. And that
became the technique.

282
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,850
And then after that it just became
like a slide shelf just to stuff.

283
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:29,684
I remember,

284
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,980
I remember a partner does this thing every
year he gets off the dino gets out of

285
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:41,540
the truck and he just screams at the
top of his lungs. Ladies and gentlemen,

286
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,350
welcome to the grand daddy of a ball.

287
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,590
And everybody's always terrified,
sort of laughing, whatever.

288
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,240
So these Iowa fans, somebody just said,
oh, we do not need that voice here.

289
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,230
And immediately we're
not liking us. And uh,

290
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,350
I dunno. I think that for whatever
reason, they were really, they were like,

291
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,970
I want to say older than me, but I'm
pretty fucking old at this point.

292
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,030
I'm 47 I think they were in their 50s
and for whatever reason they were playing

293
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,250
Drake. All right.

294
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,210
And it was like fucking seven in the
morning and their fucking music was louder

295
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,880
than our music. So we're sitting there,

296
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:26,270
the sun hasn't even come
up yet and we'll listen to,

297
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,070
you used to call me on your cell
phone, you'll use to you. You too.

298
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,410
And it's just was fucking,
we're doing like, oh God.

299
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:37,820
I think me playing that fucking song,
like that song is like, that's like,

300
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,240
there's a few songs that get played so
much that you never need to hear them

301
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:41,690
again.

302
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,610
I think the original song
was in the mood binding.

303
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,470
Benny Goodman, who was
a Glenn Miller Dad at,

304
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:52,290
at dead dead dead [inaudible] too.

305
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,970
But I bet I never need to hear
that song ever again. Right.

306
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:01,971
I'd say book ending for way back in the
day to fucking right now it goes in the

307
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:07,540
mood. Glenn Miller and then a cell phone

308
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,700
by Drake. I know

309
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,960
it can only mean one thing. Oh, he's
such a bitch in that fucking song.

310
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,470
It's basically, hey, I used
to just fuck you. I use to,

311
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:27,210
I use you and any she moves away and then
he's upset that the woman got on with

312
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,133
the life.

313
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:29,920
Okay.

314
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,920
You know what a fucking he's is he one
of those possessive guys who wants,

315
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:38,680
he fucks something and he feels like
he owns it for the rest of his life.

316
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,320
Let it go dude. All you were
doing was fucking, or now what?

317
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,810
Now you want her because
she's not there anymore

318
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,270
to come over and lick your balls
and shape up your beard afterwards.

319
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,400
I mean fucking move on
with your life. Drake.

320
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,290
Yo Yo yo yo Yo yo shit. That's
fucking going on. And all I know.

321
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,770
And they were annoyed with
how loud Bart Nick yelled.

322
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,870
So I don't know what happens.

323
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:08,470
Somewhere between the beer that
shot and a breakfast sandwich.

324
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,950
I glance over and the older guy
is chirping and fucking Bart,

325
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,130
Nick's ear and Bart. Nick is
just staring straight ahead,

326
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,530
600 yard stare,

327
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:23,180
just standing there and I see the guy
talk and talk and talking and then I just

328
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,700
see Joe just shrug his shoulders
and be like, well, you know,

329
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,930
I don't like your music.

330
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,050
And I gotta be honest with you fucking,
I don't know what else he said.

331
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:43,220
But 10 minutes later those people were
just gone and we never saw them again.

332
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,300
I don't know if they had like
some VIP fucking, you know,

333
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,590
Iowa Hawkeye fucking barbecue thing,

334
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,810
that tent that they would
go into. I have no idea.

335
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,290
But we would die and laugh and
they had one conversation with Joe,

336
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,110
like the heck do you mind
keeping it down a little bit?

337
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,810
And Joe just gave him the
death fucking, you know,

338
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,760
the 600 yard stare and uh, that
was it. They just fucking left.

339
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,170
So that problem was solved.

340
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,150
And we would throw in the football around
[inaudible] I remembered everything

341
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:17,650
but forgot the bacon and
uh, what's his face like?

342
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,280
I was able to call an audible and he had
some bison meat or something like that

343
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,260
and Bacon Grease figure that one out.
I don't know how the fuck he did it,

344
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:25,700
but um,

345
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,370
okay.

346
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:27,581
Yeah.

347
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:31,240
And everything was going great and I was
throwing the football around and then

348
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:36,220
at some point I was just so
fucking hammered that I fell down

349
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,940
and I was one of those drunk falls where
it took me like 17 I started falling

350
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,430
and it took like 17 seconds for me to
fall. And the entire time I was saying,

351
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:53,380
I'm sorry, uh, it's now known yet
it's now known as the, I'm sorry,

352
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:54,214
fall.

353
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,230
And it took me so long to fall that just
about everybody at the tailgates site.

354
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,720
And uh, I think if what I
happened was I was standing,

355
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,310
well, I had had this tent, you know,
one of those four posted 10 things.

356
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,510
I was standing underneath it.

357
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,950
And unbeknownst to me was right behind
me was my cooler and all the other

358
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,760
coolers and all the bags of groceries
sort of sprinkled out. Right.

359
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,250
And I was talking and I did an about
face to start walking and immediately

360
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,370
tripped over the first cooler. All right.

361
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,730
And as I was trying to get my leg to an
open area without stepping on hamburger

362
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:36,130
buns, I just, you know,

363
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:39,790
there wasn't any space to put my
feet down and I was doing like,

364
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,690
it was almost like a wide receiver after
they catch a football and they tried to

365
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:47,020
stay in bounds a dance down the
sidelines. I was doing that,

366
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:51,940
but in between condiments and food
and shit like that. And I just,

367
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,620
I never regained my balance,
but I didn't go down full of,

368
00:21:56,621 --> 00:22:00,580
I swear to God, if it was probably real
time was probably like a 42nd fall,

369
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:05,020
but that's a long time, you know, if you
just fall, Bam, you're on the ground.

370
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,443
Yeah.

371
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,200
You know, in under a second. Right.
I would think depending less,

372
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:12,830
you're really short and you get there
a little quicker. So I just kept going.

373
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,420
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

374
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,260
And right is like my buddy Nate came
over to try and stop me from falling.

375
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:18,730
I just,

376
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,730
I fucking landed on my back and I
twisted my left knee and I hear the whole

377
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:27,320
place laughing and I was
laughing evidently my last step,

378
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,560
I stepped in some avocado and slipped on
that and I just fucking went down like

379
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,750
just thud right on my back.

380
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:38,750
I landed like a wrestler so it didn't
even hurt where it was just my entire

381
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,530
backside hit the ground
at the same time. And um,

382
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,290
I remember talking about it
later and I was like, yeah,

383
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,020
but I didn't spill my drink. I didn't
spill my drink. And everybody's like,

384
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:50,540
yeah, you did. You did. You spilled
it all with the front of your jacket.

385
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,040
So, um,

386
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,070
okay.

387
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,610
Then I remember getting up
the apple pies out. Why?

388
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,200
Remember the brisket and the ribs
being done and those were delicious.

389
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,710
Lai had killing it as
always. And then, um,

390
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,430
I think I smoked a cigar next. Yeah,

391
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:15,980
I smoked a cigar and then we had the
apple pies and everybody freaked out and

392
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,320
they loved them. And then I was, yeah.
Then I smoked a cigar and I was like,

393
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,430
all right, I gotta fucking sober up
here because, uh, it's six hours,

394
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:28,020
the game will be over and we'll be
done. And then I gotta drive. So, um,

395
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,120
oh fuck. Hang on a second. Hang on.

396
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:32,850
Okay.

397
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,260
All right. I'm back. Sorry about that.
Had blew my fucking nose. So anyway,

398
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:37,480
so let me get into the A,

399
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:42,481
we get into the game and I still don't
know his fucking name because I was

400
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,980
hammered. Um,

401
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,220
the Ronnie back for Stanford just
was right as we got to the stadium.

402
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,710
You already ran for a touchdown
and then it was just like,

403
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:55,730
it was like a fucking Hollywood
movie. They couldn't stop this kid.

404
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,850
The kid even had another one. He
ran like 70 yards for a touchdown.

405
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:03,080
They had to bring it back. They just
couldn't fucking get the kid down. Um,

406
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,740
and before you knew it, it was
like 28 to nothing, 28 to nothing.

407
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,410
Then it was 35 to nothing.
And W we still had like half,

408
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,170
half of the second quarter that
the fucking gay was just over.

409
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,100
It still was the worst rose bowl game as
far as being competitive that I'd been

410
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,970
to slash the greatest individual
performance I've ever seen.

411
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,050
We got to see that kid.

412
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:32,000
He set the record for the most all
purpose yards ever in a rose bowl.

413
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,420
Um, and this is the granddaddy of a malts.
The original roles, uh, the original,

414
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,760
uh, I guess bull game, um,
even though the Yale Bulls,

415
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:47,600
the original bull stadium
figured that one out anyways. Um,

416
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,550
so we got to see that.

417
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:53,960
And fortunately during halftime I
didn't have to watch the Stanford band.

418
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,150
Um, which by the way, it's
just, I mean, could you,

419
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:03,710
could they be more of a bunch of
hipsters? The whole their whole thing.

420
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,530
It's like they're mocking
the halftime show yet,

421
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,700
not showing how you could improve
it. So there's like no risk.

422
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:13,610
You just sort of mocking the whole
fucking thing. Like, which is to me,

423
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:16,230
classic hipster behavior. Uh,

424
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,460
to me that's the difference between
nerds and hipsters. You know what I mean?

425
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,140
It's like, alright, so you think what the,

426
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:26,870
the standard way that a halftime
show is done is too rigid.

427
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,040
So you guys are gonna be, I just
hate how the whole thing is done. Oh,

428
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,090
these guys are crazy. Oh,

429
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:36,290
look at the guy with the fucking
rainbow wig play in the drum. Oh,

430
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,750
what's he gonna do? I'll
think it's fucking dumb.

431
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,470
And then I just thought it was a badly
made California look bad when they made

432
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:47,390
fun of the Iowa people with the
whole, uh, you know, farmers only.

433
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,540
And once again, I don't know, I don't
know anybody in the Stanford band,

434
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:53,330
but it just seems like that
classic, I live near an ocean,

435
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:54,620
therefore I'm smarter than you.

436
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,830
There's something about people live
on the coast with their whole attitude

437
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:00,770
towards the middle of the country's,
the funniest fucking thing ever to me.

438
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:04,040
Like fly overstate and
Blahblahblahblahblah and all that.

439
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,610
It's like those fucking people that you
sit there and making fun of, you know,

440
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,730
like farmers old, hey, where'd you go
Dan? Go Fuck your sister. It's like,

441
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,160
you mean the people who grow the food
supply for this country? You fucking dope.

442
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:19,070
What are you doing that
with the flute? Oh,

443
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:22,250
look at the cool kid with
the clarinet. I Dunno.

444
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,670
I thought it was a hacky joke and um,

445
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,870
I dunno, you know what I mean?
Look, if you guys look, you know,

446
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:32,900
just decided to trash one
another, then it would be funny,

447
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,060
but it just kind of comes off like a,

448
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,480
it's like when Ricky Gervais' does
that shit at the golden clubs,

449
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,343
you know what I mean?

450
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,680
He hires his staff or writers to write
roast jokes aimed at people who showed up

451
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:47,820
with acceptance speeches and it's
just, Ah, gee, did you win that one?

452
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,730
What are you going to do next? Slap an
ice cream out of a five-year-old hand.

453
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,640
I just, I dunno. It's
the same thing with that.

454
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,850
I thought it was douchey behavior,
but fortunately I missed all of it,

455
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,750
you know? And yeah, he came out with
the paper, we shake cow, it'll be epic.

456
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,120
Ah, kill yourselves.

457
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,130
It'd be one thing if Stanford
Everly actually put on a
good halftime show, like,

458
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,080
wow, this band is next level.

459
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:15,380
I get why they're trying to break
the whole fucking format of it.

460
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,630
But if you actually watch a,

461
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,380
the competitions of the best
fucking college bands out there,

462
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,680
they're fucking drumlines alone

463
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,940
would destroy anyone in that
band. So, uh, you know, I dunno,

464
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,510
every once in awhile I'm
a fucking conservative and
I'm a conservative on that.

465
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:36,720
What do I just say? Yeah, you get kind
of fucking made an assay yourself.

466
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,100
But anyways, and I just hate the
deliberately bad dancing that they do.

467
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,580
I think if you gonna to mock dancing,
you should be able to dance wealth,

468
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,300
you know, to just suck at it and
then be like making fun of it.

469
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:52,650
Then you just fucking like, all right.
Yeah. Yeah. It just like we thought,

470
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:53,790
yeah, you don't have any talent.

471
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,553
Yeah.

472
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,220
Fuck the Stanford band. I love
the football program now. Anyways.

473
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,480
Uh, so while all of that
was going on, all that,

474
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,910
that fucking nauseated
hipster behavior, uh,

475
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
the looks on their faces, like
everyone in the crowd is like,

476
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:17,850
their mind is blown. Like,
oh my God, what's going on?

477
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,490
It's the fuck you're in the band.

478
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay.

479
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,480
You play in the fucking triangle
out there. You're not a rebel.

480
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,480
You're not freaking anybody out.

481
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,713
Uh,

482
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,530
so anyways, uh,

483
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,210
we actually went out to the
concession stand and, um,

484
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,140
you know, just standing the whole
fucking halftime. We're standing in this,

485
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,740
in this, in this line, and we actually
missed the first three minutes of the,

486
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,780
uh, the third quarter and
I'm standing in this line,

487
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,890
Comedian Sean Coyne from Philly.
He's fucking Hilarious, right?

488
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,270
So we get all the way up there and, uh,

489
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,020
I ordered a pretzel and a water and he
ordered a pretzel and something else.

490
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,180
And, uh, I'm fucking common around.
He's still drinking, you know,

491
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:06,050
he doesn't have to drive,

492
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:10,520
so he's still fucking drinking during the
game and they hand him the Pretzel and

493
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:14,060
he proceeds after we waited
a half an hour for a food,

494
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,560
she hands him the Pretzel.
They fucking just fumbled it.

495
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,070
It was like a bad exchange between
the quarterback and the running back.

496
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:25,310
You know, they like bump into each
other. The dude never quite has the ball.

497
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,520
He never quite had the pretzel and it
just goes end over end in like slow motion

498
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:35,360
and falls salts side down onto the
concrete where everybody's standing.

499
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,730
He immediately bends down and picks it up.

500
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,200
And I'm looking at him and he just
goes, he's, I, yeah, it's all right.

501
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:43,990
It's all right. I'm like, dude, you gotta
give that think back. And he's like,

502
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,510
not sorry. It's all right. He doesn't
give a fuck. So I'm dying laugh.

503
00:29:47,511 --> 00:29:48,850
Like this guy's a maniac.

504
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,750
He's like people walking in and out our
restrooms and then coming over to his

505
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,910
standard and there's food
money out of your fucking mind.

506
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,280
But I'm still kind of
drunk. So then I go over,

507
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:02,281
we were putting mustard on the pretzel
and then out of nowhere fucking lie ed

508
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,540
shows up. And he asked,

509
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,380
he had Sean for the piece of
his Pretzel and he gave it.

510
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,070
So I almost fucking
faked it. I was laughing.

511
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:15,100
So hard fuck thing was on the ground.

512
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,290
I was like, it was like
watching a poison of light.

513
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,780
I couldn't say anything. I was
laughing so fucking hard. So, uh,

514
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,920
don't we get, we finally
get back into the, uh,

515
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,250
finally get back into the, um,

516
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,070
the stadium and then just
the whole game just stopped.

517
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:40,990
I mean there was barely any scoring.
Iowa came back and scored a couple. Um,

518
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:45,910
I was psyched for Versie cause
he, uh, he went to Betsy,

519
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:46,930
but you bet Stanford.

520
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:50,080
And then in the next half a
bet the ovary won both of them.

521
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:53,080
So he picked up a buck 50 or
something like that. And um,

522
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,890
I dunno. Then we just ended up going back.

523
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:01,050
The game was over and
then we went back to, uh,

524
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,980
the truck. We were hanging
out, we got the bonfire going,

525
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:09,670
the sun was down and in the
middle of having a bonfire,

526
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:14,620
all of a sudden this kid comes
walking by with another friend,

527
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,390
this Iowa Kid. And he just goes,
he just goes, hey. He goes,

528
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:22,540
Hey ted. Bonfire's illegal. He
can't have it. It's illegal.

529
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,180
And right as he was by Raby
like go like, ha ha ha,

530
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,800
I'm just fucking around the Philly guy.

531
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:34,480
And he goes, Hey, shut the fuck up.
You fucking Blah, blah, blah. Right.

532
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,680
And then the kid fucking
puffs up his chest.

533
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:43,420
There's like 10 of us sitting here.
This kid was like, he was like five,

534
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:45,040
six, five, seven.

535
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,530
He comes running up talk and all this
shit and I'm just sitting there looking at

536
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:54,070
him like, it's fucking
10 of us here, you know,

537
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,390
do you have an oozy? Like what? What are
you doing? Right? So he gets into it,

538
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,220
there's back and forth
and next thing you know,

539
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:03,040
versus over there and it looks like furs.

540
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,360
He's about ready to square off with the
guy because the guy kept walking away

541
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,950
but like, all right, all right, whatever,
whatever. And He'd be like, Oh, fun,

542
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,720
fun, fun. Who Fuck you.

543
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,000
Because we'd always had the last
thing and then we'd be like, fuck you.

544
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:16,360
And it just kept going back and forth
and back and forth. Then finally,

545
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,190
the guy's like 30 yards away versus he's
talking to them and I thought like, oh,

546
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,580
this kid's going to soccer room. So I
got up over there and go, relax, relax,

547
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:28,330
relax. And then all of a
sudden I hear a bottle break

548
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,110
in this fucking maniac Philly
guy, right fucking place the ball.

549
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,920
That's the funniest thing ever. He
breaks the bottle on the pavement.

550
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,760
He fucking, he did it way too
hard. When he brought his hand up,

551
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,330
there was no bottle left. He
just chatted the fucking thing.

552
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,950
But then he like my him,

553
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,040
like he still had the bottle in
his end and this is the best part,

554
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,310
the Iowa kid talking shit, never fledged.

555
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,760
So now he's pretended he
had a bottle in his end.

556
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,640
I didn't even know what he was going
to do. It was like a fucking movie.

557
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,020
It's like, what the fuck? Right.

558
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,760
So the dude finally goes away as to
yell a few more fucking things and um,

559
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,020
it was so ridiculous.
Then we went back and we,

560
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,000
we was sitting around and all we did for
the rest of the time there was make fun

561
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:23,001
of Sean and how there was no bottle left
and he actually cut his hand and we all

562
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:25,990
just sit in, go and like, do, what
were you going to do? What? He's like,

563
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:28,950
I don't know. I don't know what I
always wanted to do that. It was just,

564
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,170
it's fucking ridiculous. So, um,

565
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,620
and by then, you know, actually as I
was coming out of the game, I, I was,

566
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,280
I was so sober, I had already
gotten into the fucking hangover.

567
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,670
So I just started drinking waters and um,

568
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,850
then had another two hot dogs and a
hamburger and I got to tell you dude,

569
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:53,590
my body was like, what the fuck?

570
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,580
And I just drove home like with
a splitting fucking headache,

571
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,880
stone sober, splitting,
fucking headache. And um,

572
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,480
and then by then my knee was killing me
and I was walking like I had just ridden

573
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:14,680
a horse from here to fucking
Massachusetts and I was,

574
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,880
I was shot. I came home
and I just fucking,

575
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:22,480
just pounded like three
waters. And that was,

576
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:25,570
it was during that time where I
was just thinking to myself like,

577
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:29,950
I'm never going to that game
again. I fucking, you know,

578
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,200
when you're out three to six
weeks with a fucking knee strain,

579
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:38,080
cause you went to a tailgate, you
really got to start like looking back,

580
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:40,660
going like, what the fuck? But it
happened to me again this year, you know,

581
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,010
every year I go, you know, I'm going
to go a little easy. Gonna go easy.

582
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:46,810
I want to remember as much
of this tailgate as I can.

583
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,020
Like I passed out for like
an hour of it and it popped.

584
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,260
Part of it was the alcohol,

585
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:54,460
but the other part was just like I had
only gotten three hours sleep. You know,

586
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,310
there's only so far you can go when
you start the day off with a male.

587
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,750
All right, let me, um, but it
was one of one of the best, uh,

588
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,680
one of the best fucking tailgates
and I loved hanging with fucking, uh,

589
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,200
all the new people that came along and
I am now of course obsessed with the

590
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:18,370
Philly accent. It's the funniest
fucking accent. You get a beard.

591
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:23,260
Big Easel. Everything's at John. Um,

592
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,130
alright. Hang on a
second. All right, cool.

593
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,330
Let me type in my password here so
I can do a couple of reads. Come on.

594
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,410
I love what they make. You pick such
a fucking difficult one that you know,

595
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,850
it takes me like three times to type name
because there's some capitals and then

596
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:42,210
there's some not capitals. Like
if someone broke into my computer,

597
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:47,130
I don't understand what they would be
getting. Um, all right. Okay. Oh Jesus.

598
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,290
I don't even know if I had the
fucking energy. It usually takes,

599
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,220
it takes me three days to get over the
fucking rose bowl. This is the third day.

600
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,450
All right. Uh Oh look, we start up

601
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,410
[inaudible] me on ds.
No more sweaty balls.

602
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,700
Buddha would do to me and
east Biondi get them off file.

603
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,190
Fall stick some leaves and your
tanks say your bothered sweaty.

604
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,780
Know they're Yay cause you
go NASSSA solved fucking
balls even in 2016. Oh yeah.

605

Even get 'em for your
check. Right me undies.

606
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,000
What's the secret to New
Year's resolutions? Make
the first step really easy.

607
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,050

put on underwear and this year our,

you'll make had to me.

be delivered right to your door.

613
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:49,020
Do you know what's fucking hilarious
about this is I never throw out my

614
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:49,411
underwear.

615
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:52,200
I don't throw my underwear until there's
actual holes in them and it takes a

616
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:55,350
long fucking time. You know

617
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,760
I have underwear that's still
from when I was in my thirties

618
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,370
I know I do. Me and undies is the
next level of underwear. Every pair,

619

to do here for the fucking week. Um,

680
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,010
all right. And with that,
let's get to uh, oh.

681
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,680
Can we talk a little f NFL
football for us and what dad? Dad,

682
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,430
dad [inaudible] booted.

683
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,800
I would say the Patriots in
Seattle entered the playoffs
the exact opposite way.

684
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,180
I'm going to go out on a limb.

685
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,890
A the patriots just could not get
anything going offensively. Um,

686
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,240
our offensive line is
just, uh, it's, it's,

687
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:09,830
it's fucking shattered, dude.

688
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,780
We got nobody left and every
time Brady went to pass,

689
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:17,300
there was someone in the back field.
Um, a defense did great though.

690
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:20,210
I mean it was holding him to like 10
points for most of the fucking game,

691
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,480
but um, hopefully we can
get healthy or I don't,

692
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,090
I don't see us going too deep
into the playoffs this year.

693
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,230
Seattle on the other 10. Huh.

694
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,320
Now, this is the wildcard
t nobody wants to play.

695
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,890
Put your got ask yourself are they
peaking to early Seattle look like world

696
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:43,700
beaters and the way that they handled
the fucking cardinals yesterday they made

697
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,860
them, I mean I don't know if the
cardinal started to come back or not.

698
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:49,940
I mean I watched the first fucking half
and it looked like an NFL team playing a

699
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,660
CFL team. Let me check out
the final score here. Um,

700
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:00,070
I mean I think it's just another
phenomenal coaching job by Pete Carroll.

701
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,740
Um, and he's got like,

702
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,860
he's got him right about 36 to six. Yeah.

703
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:11,300
They just destroyed them scoring
it. We'll do an evidence,

704
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,120
whatever the fuck they wanted. You know,

705
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,520
Arizona special teams
would look at like shit,

706
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:19,040
that field goal kicker and
MacTech couple of extra points.

707
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:21,290
I don't know what the fuck was going
on with them and they couldn't tackle

708
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,030
anybody on punch or kickoffs.

709
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,440
The only question mark I saw with Seattle
was there a kicker missed another one

710
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,130
and Richard Sherman's hair.
That's the only thing I've found.

711
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,080
That's the second time this year. Sherman
has been brought down by his hair. Um,

712
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,360
to the point they actually
thought it was a facemask.

713
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,800
He went down so fucking his head
went down. Uh, but other than that,

714
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,140
uh, I was, I was the guy, you know, a
couple of weeks ago I was thinking like,

715
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:51,470
you know,

716
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,470
Arizona and a Carolina now I think it's a,

717
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:02,290
a Carolina is would play Seattle
at home, but I got to tell you,

718
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:08,940
Seattle doesn't give a fuck. They've been
there the last two years in a row. Um,

719
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,010
if they wouldn't again this year, a
lot of people are going to be like, oh,

720
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,910
they do one play away for
winning it three times in a row.

721
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:20,890
That's absolute bullshit. That's absolute
bullshit. Um, you went to in a row,

722
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:25,150
if you win the fucking thing, it
changes. It changes your vibe,

723
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,740
you know, defending versus
bad tastes in your mouth.

724
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,940
You know what I mean? Yeah.

725
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,190
How long do you think Pete Carol's was
able to actually get eight hours sleep

726
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:37,240
after that super bowl?

727
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,860
Like the drive that he's had to get back
because that they fucked that thing up.

728
00:43:41,861 --> 00:43:45,820
Slash Malcolm Butler may one of the
greatest defensive plays of all time,

729
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,530
like battle. You know, there's a reason
why nobody's ever won three in a row.

730
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,970
It's, you know, it's hard to
stay that fucking motivated,

731
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,770
I think anyways. Um,

732
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,040
and I know watching the Patriots when
the defending Super Bowl champions,

733
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,250
for instance, just being the
Patriots, which is bad enough,

734
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:04,570
people want to beat you bad enough,

735
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:06,970
but when you're the
defending Superbowl champion,

736
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:11,290
even that shit teams try hard
against you. Um, but anyways,

737
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:15,090
having said all that, um, you know,

738
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,550
the way Seattle's played over
the last month in that last game,

739
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:22,050
like they look like
fucking world beaters. Um,

740
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,390
so, and us,

741
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:27,390
I dunno if we could beat the Broncos at
this point with how fucking injured we

742
00:44:27,391 --> 00:44:31,830
are, even with their,
uh, their quarterback.

743
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,620
I though it was hard to see
Peyton manning be a backup man,

744
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:39,210
but he took it like a gentleman. Um,
I wonder if that was his last game.

745
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,380
I wonder. I wonder. I wonder.
All right, let's get to, uh,

746
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,040
let's get to the fucking questions here
for this week. Right. And by the way,

747
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,810
um, for all the Canadian fans,

748
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,750
I'm not ducking the fact that you
guys destroyed us in that game.

749
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,860
I just haven't seen it yet.

750
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,720
I started to watch it yesterday and after
all the Hoopla and all of that shit,

751
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,050
I got like a minute and a half in
the game and they already scored.

752
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,520
I was just like, oh man. I
think the final was five to one.

753
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,840
So congratulations to Yukon. But um, oh,

754
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:14,040
I gotta fix my cooler to my cooler.
It took a beating. Both hinges. What?

755
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:17,700
Broken as the interior
strap. Thank thankfully. Uh,

756
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,390
Igloo makes a repair kit night. You
know, it's obviously an easy repair.

757
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:24,820
I gotta get that fucking taken
care of this week, uh, that,

758
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:29,310
that fucking coolest bend
to every Rosebowl. I got to
fix it up here. Who knows?

759
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:32,220
Maybe when I fell on the one that
knocked the fucking lid off the thing.

760
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:37,410
All right, breakfast. Here we go.
There's no way I did 45 minutes.

761
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:40,380
Jesus Christ. It's flame. I
all right. Breakfast bill.

762
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I'm a father of two young children and
I hold a nine to five corporate job.

763
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,810
Don't feel bad for me though.
I love my job. That's awesome.

764
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,660
I want you to love your job. And he goes,

765
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:55,440
and I don't bitch about how hard
it is to be a parent. Uh, he goes,

766
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:58,200
I maintain a decent diet.
I was a college athlete,

767
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:00,510
so I have a basic understanding
of the human body.

768
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,030
Granted you and I spend
our mornings differently.

769
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,600
I freeze my ass off every morning
for five to six months of the year.

770
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,030
Uh, I was wondering what you
do for breakfast every morning?

771
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,230
I don't know. What do you mean you
freeze your ass off? What do you do? Oh,

772
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,840
UK guys. I'm wondering what you do
for breakfast setting every morning.

773
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,160
And then he goes on to say,

774
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,500
I'm always on the go and I'm not
hungry right when I leave for work, uh,

775
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,840
which leads me in the car and at the
office for the rest of the morning.

776
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,970
Not a lot of options. Uh,
beyond a banana and a coffee.

777
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,440
It's too cold for smoothies. What's Amanda
do? What's your morning food routine?

778
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,450
Well when I'm being smart,

779
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,260
I have two eggs over easy and I
have some oatmeal with a, a banana,

780
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:44,400
maybe some blueberries.

781
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,500
I don't have any a bread
or any of that stuff.

782
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,950
And then between breakfast
and lunch I have an apple.

783
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,640
And then for lunch I have Turkey
slices with the side salad.

784
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,560
And then at four o'clock I have a meat
with a protein in six o'clock meet with

785
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:07,610
the protein and a meet with the protein
of a protein with vegetables to fuck my

786
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:15,270
brain is shot here. I have, yeah, I
have a protein with some vegetables.

787
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,160
They meet with the protein and then
I have a bread with some carbs.

788
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:24,390
Um, that's what I ended
up doing. And then I just,

789
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,350
I stopped beating around six, five,
six is when I had my last meal.

790
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:30,970
And then I just drink waters after
that. If I get really hungry,

791
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:34,540
I just have celery with peanut butter and
I got to get back to that diet because

792
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,740
I've been cooking up a fucking storm,
bacon and all that type of stuff. Um,

793
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,180
and I have three goals this
month. I'm gonna make a quiche.

794
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,860
I'm gonna make a fucking Lasagna and
I'm going to make this hunter's chicken.

795
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:52,390
The last two are Mario Batali
recipes and a Dodgers chicken.

796
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,910
Isn't that bad? The fucking, um,

797
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,150
the LASAGNA is pretty bad, but
there's veal in it and I just can't,

798
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,900
I can't get myself to eat
lobster or veal. I just,

799
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,070
just what the fuck they
go through. I mean,

800
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:08,680
I know the chickens and cows already
have a bad enough thing, but like,

801
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,530
it just seems extra fucking cruel.

802
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,600
Boiling something alive and
having something just sit
in a fucking cage forever

803
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,170
so it's softer and tastes better when
you eat. It's just, it's fucking brutal.

804
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:22,663
Um,

805
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,120
anyways. All right, so what's
my morning routine? Yeah, well,

806
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:29,220
if I was you and I had tea,
I would eat, I would get up,

807
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:33,120
I wouldn't make the time and I would
at least just have some oatmeal.

808
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,393
Um,

809
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,370
Amanda, but I don't have kids. I mean,

810
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:41,930
I just hear you guys talking about having
kids. Makes me glad I don't have any.

811
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:43,250
I mean, it just seems so fucking right.

812
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:45,993
Um,

813
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:50,240
just never ending. Never ending. Um,

814
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,740
I dunno. So I will, I will. What
do you do for breakfast? All right.

815
00:48:55,741 --> 00:48:56,910
I told you I did the whole day.

816
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,650
Um, [inaudible]

817
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,450
yeah, if I was you, I would,
you have to make the time.

818
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,350
I would definitely say that you
got to make the time and uh,

819
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,500
I think the best thing for working out
is you do it in the morning and you just

820
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:13,790
get it out of the way and then you have
a healthy breakfast and that gets you on

821
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:17,060
the right track to start the
day to start off the day.

822
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:19,070
If you're eating bad and then try
to be like, well, don't worry,

823
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:20,330
I'm going to go to the gym later.

824
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,830
The problem is with bad
food is it chemically fucks
your body and it makes you

825
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:28,850
just want to lay down and do
nothing. So if you start today,

826
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,710
I dunno, just do that.
That the tense about,

827
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,220
I was telling you guys about the tents

828
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,980
start off as like a 10 jumping
jacks, 10 burpees, 10 pushups,

829
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,510
10 alternating lunges, 10 sit
ups. I forget the fucking order.

830
00:49:45,511 --> 00:49:47,100
I haven't done it, but you can,

831
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,850
you can look it up on the
Internet and find it and uh,

832
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,780
and you go from 10 and then you do
nine jumping jacks, nine burpees,

833
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:58,320
nine pushups, nine setups,
nine alternate leg jumps,

834
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,880
nine squat jumps.

835
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,550
And then you do eight and you go all
the way down to one and then you're,

836
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:03,660
you know, you pretty much winded.

837
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,690
And then if you want to add a
little more cardio to it, skip,

838
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:10,650
skip rope for around a two or three
or whatever you want to fucking do. A,

839
00:50:10,651 --> 00:50:13,890
I could do that workout
in like a hotel room. Um,

840
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,930
but that's what I would do.

841
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,210
I would do something like that
and that would just make sure,

842
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,340
you know also if you really
don't have time to work out,

843
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,870
but it really help you during the day is
to bring an apple and to pack a healthy

844
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:27,060
lunch also saves you money.

845
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,750
Also gives you more of a lunch hour
cause you're not driving to and from

846
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:32,210
wherever the fuck you go. And you
go right down to the cafeteria,

847
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,780
you knock it out, you chill
the fuck out, you know,

848
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:37,770
okay.

849
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,130
You have something healthy
in your afternoon break.

850
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,020
And that's the biggest thing, dude.

851
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,020
If you're not putting mistakes
into your fucking mouth,

852
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,780
you're going to get more results
from your workout and you, you know,

853
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:49,370
you've closed and start fitting better.

854
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,510
And the same way you get addicted to
eating bad salt, sugar, salt, sugar,

855
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:55,720
you can get addicted to eating well. Uh,

856
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,590
which where is not where I'm at right
now. Um, all right, one trick pony.

857
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:06,830
Uh, hey Billy balls.
Uh, my wife loves you.

858
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:11,030
Pie crust video. Oh, by the way,
you know, I tried a lot in my, um,

859
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:15,110
for my cross for the first time
and it was a total game changer.

860
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,120
The best crus I ever made.

861
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,290
It did feel weird to smell bacon
as I was making the pie crust.

862
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,700
But um,

863
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:23,763
okay.

864
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,770
Um, uh, thank you to everybody that
suggested that who, you know, the, your,

865
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,310
your critique really helped my pie crust.
Thank you. Um, all right. So anyways,

866
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:37,890
this person says she's a fan of yours
as well. He loved the pie crust video.

867
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:41,090
She's a fan of you as well and it's
been exposed to hours of your podcast.

868
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,350
She likes you, Bill.
Let me lead with that.

869
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,900
Well here comes to big
fucking slap in the face,

870
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,930
but of course like all great women,

871
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:52,920
she still has a capacity to chop a man
down at the knees. After the video,

872
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,590
I casually said, can't
wait for the next one.

873
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,960
She responded in an Oh
sweetie tone with ha ha. Well,

874
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,170
how many of these tricks do
you think he has up his sleeve?

875
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:08,760
This resulted in a long discussion where
I defended your potential skills and

876
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:11,040
she went with the, I love bill burr.

877
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,040
I'm just assuming he doesn't have
much more to rival this pie crust.

878
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,060
Uh, whether you can make a full
series out of these videos or not,

879
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:24,480
can you please explain to my wife
that you're not a one trick pony?

880
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,490
And even if you are a one trick pony,

881
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,060
it's bullshit and unfair to
assume this much. Ah, thanks.

882
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:34,940
Come back to Wisconsin. Home of
corruption as seen in documentaries.

883
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:40,260
Um, well, you know something.
As you get older, prism, man,

884
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,300
you understand where that's coming
from. Why your wife, as you said,

885
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:48,720
like all great women always have to
take you out of the knees what it is.

886
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:52,470
As much as you gotta stop internalizing
that and taking it personally,

887
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,220
what it is is that's,

888
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,690
it's almost like a subconscious fear thing
that they have. You know what I mean?

889
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,380
Like when they don't know you
and they see you doing something,

890
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:09,240
they have a positive reaction to a
co, oh look, he can make a pie cross.

891
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,500
I bet he's going to be a great dad.
Right? They think shit like that.

892
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,660
But after they get with you and then
they love you and they don't want to lose

893
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:23,150
you when they see you continuing
to grow as a person, they,

894
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:27,480
it's, I can't even, this is a
female thing. This is like a, uh,

895
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,130
thing in general that people
do in relationships is
you actually hold back the

896
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:36,060
person you love because you see them
expanding on who they are and because it's

897
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:38,760
something new and different and
moves in a different direction,

898
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:43,750
I think subconsciously a certain type
of person feels insecure so then they,

899
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:46,860
they have to tether it to
the ground with fucking, uh,

900
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,400
criticism rather than
encouraging the person.

901
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,610
So I think that that's where
it's coming from. But um,

902
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,000
as far as addressing it,

903
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:02,760
like I will just say this as
far as my cooking and baking,

904
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:07,790
like you don't just know how to make
corn flakes and you can also make a pie

905
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,180
crust, you know what I mean?

906
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,710
Knowing how to make a pie crust takes
all of your shit to the next level.

907
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:19,200
Okay. Like, no, like, no this because
I can do that. Like back in the day,

908
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:22,230
I used to look at like making like a
quiche or something like that going,

909
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:23,580
oh my God, that's fucking impossible.

910
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,380
The cross the loan or making a Turkey pot
pie or anything that involves having a

911
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:30,660
crust. Um,

912
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,110
you can add that I recently have
learned how to smoke meat. You know,

913
00:54:34,111 --> 00:54:37,320
I smoked ribs. Uh,

914
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,540
I can make all of my, my, my mother
before we, when we all moved out,

915
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,310
she wrote out all of her recipes,

916
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,100
hand wrote them all out on cards and we
have all of them and we can all cook the

917
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:52,290
meals that she made when
we were growing up. Like,

918
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:57,291
I can make you a Hungarian Goulash and
you know what else I can make the fucking

919
00:54:57,301 --> 00:55:01,560
noodles from scratch. I took a
pasta making class, you know,

920
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:05,970
as you suspected, sir, your wife has no
idea what the fuck she's talking about.

921
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,990
What it really was. It was coming from
a place of insecurity and jealousy.

922
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:13,080
And right now she's going to roll
her eyes and be like, oh my God,

923
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:16,530
the Blah Blah Blah. It's
fucking true. You know?

924
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:20,820
Cause that's really just like
a, just like to have like that,

925
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:25,410
that Oh sweetie tone, you know,
they do that shit. You know,

926
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:30,090
you go out, you start looking a little
too good, you get a new new suit,

927
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:32,340
right. You look in a little bit.
They got a fucking, they got,

928
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:36,810
they got to make a comment. They fucking
do it with each other. It's hilarious.

929
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:40,710
I think that's one of the main reasons
that's fucking them up by the way.

930
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:43,050
You know? And they always talk
about the wage gap and all that.

931
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,080
One of the biggest problems
with the wage gap is not men.

932
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,800
It's the fact that women don't get
together and create businesses enough.

933
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,950
They just don't do it cause they're
too busy going look at this bitch and

934
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:56,430
fucking look at her. She's too fucking
skinny. She needs the eat something.

935
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,300
She's got on too much fuck out. She
knows what she's doing. You know,

936
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:04,110
they don't work well together. I don't
know why, but that's not our fault.

937
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,480
I'm sure it is though.
If you watch the video,

938
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,620
I'm sure they could spin it
around to us. So, um, yes sir.

939
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:15,390
I actually absolutely love cooking and um,

940
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,100
it isn't the only trick
I have up my sleeve. Um,

941
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:25,030
I could obviously make more of
those. But the thing about it was,

942
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:28,810
was that was the specific
skill it was for the holidays.

943
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,000
And people have suggested, well,

944
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:35,140
why don't you do one on how to smoke
meat or why don't you do one about making

945
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,700
positive from scratch? My thing is because
you could watch Mario Batali do it,

946
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,460
you can watch champion smokers do it.

947
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,320
So I guess what makes mine
different is that I make it funny.

948
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:48,910
You know,

949
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,360
I just looked at it as a one fucking
random thing that I was going to do,

950
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:54,990
but you know, now that she's been
a douche about it, you know what,

951
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,250
I'll make another one at some
point I guess. Um, I'll, let's see.

952
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:00,330
What the fuck will I do?

953
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,790
The Turkey pot pie on the
big green egg. I mean,

954
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,770
I've watched you two
videos of all of those.

955
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:12,120
I just did a really saw somebody do
like, is there a pie cross video?

956
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,670
I don't know. I just thought it'd be fun.

957
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,290
I literally feel like I'm in a
relationship or right now I have,

958
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,900
I'm sorry that that video annoying. Okay.

959
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,300
Oh God, that's so fucking
moody. Uh, yeah, I will,

960
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:29,770
I will figure out something
else. Um, to make one of those.

961
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:33,750
I'll do like one a year. Well,

962
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,760
it's actually given me some
ideas like maybe I'll do one. Oh,

963
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,260
the summer's coming. All right.

964
00:57:37,261 --> 00:57:40,260
You're going to show up to 4th of July
as a quick fucking thing you can make.

965
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,630
You know what? Maybe I'll
do it. Maybe I'll do it.

966
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:46,350
I just don't like committing to shit
like that. I love not having a job,

967
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,860
which is why I'm a fucking comedian.
I've really enjoyed this whole,

968
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,970
I work when I want to rather than it
being okay, we need 20 episodes of this.

969
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,650
All right. Thursday afternoon podcast
got me laid bill. Oh, something positive.

970
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,800
Oh John, do you really think he could
get somebody else laid fucking disease?

971
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,070
Um,

972
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:09,150
it's probably why we die eight years
earlier just because they just won't give

973
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:09,480
it up.

974
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,060
But if you get yourself out in front of
it next time you wife does that to you,

975
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,790
sir. Next time she takes
you out at the knees,

976
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,710
just come up to her and stroke the
side of her face. You know when you,

977
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,770
when you go out and get a new
car and you say, oh honey,

978
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:26,750
don't you think you're a little
bit old for that car? You know,

979
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,940
does one of those things
makes you feel stupid? Right?

980
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,120
Just walk up stroke the side of
her face if has golf, sweetie,

981
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,360
don't worry. I'm not going
to leave you. It's okay.

982
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,270
Nah, it's okay. Okay. I know I
look it in the car. I'm sorry.

983
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,590
Something like that. Some creepy. All
right bill, last week on New Year's Eve,

984
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,980
my wife and I listened to your
podcast after we put the kids to bed,

985
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,800
we drank wine and laughed
our asses off. That's great.

986
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,570
This woke us up energized us. Just
as the throwback clip came on,

987
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:02,800
it appeared that we may have
sex during in the new year.

988
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:06,880
Well Boyle boy, not more than a
few notes into the outro song.

989
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:07,870
We were going at it.

990
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,910
It was all over just moments
after the song ended,

991
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,920
so maybe four minutes or
so of ball dropping bliss.

992
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,980
My Dick. Thanks you for the
laughs and the soundtrack.

993
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:25,370
Did you guys fuck to the me on the song?
I don't think I needed to know that.

994
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:31,070
Um, all right. Oh, here
it is. There it is.

995
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:34,290
This is the one I wanted to read. This is,

996
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,880
this is amazing overpopulation myth bill,

997
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:42,881
how you're doing and I'm just checking
in on you a to inform you that if you go

998
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:48,761
online and see for yourself
how much arable Ara,

999
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:53,390
B, l, e Farm Land and resources
there actually is in the world.

1000
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:58,391
You'll see that there is enough to feed
and home at least 100 billion people for

1001
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,033
approvable fact.

1002
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,463
Okay.

1003
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,040
I Dunno what that sentence
didn't make sense.

1004
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,060
Did you like voice Texas
or did you actually,

1005
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:13,090
this is how you actually type
out sentences. Person goes.

1006
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:17,440
So anytime you hear anyone say that
7 billion people is too many people,

1007
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,750
I'm there.

1008
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,250
Okay.

1009
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,120
T H, e I.

1010
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:27,121
R either seriously misinformed and or
too lazy to do some research or flat out

1011
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:33,430
lying through their teeth, like are
so-called leaders in scientists must be,

1012
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,190
oh yeah, they gotta be
lying because you're not,

1013
01:00:36,191 --> 01:00:37,660
you can't even spell their right

1014
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,370
because within one to
do two days of research,

1015
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:45,500
you can find studies
that prove what I say.

1016
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,700
It's going to take me one to two
days to find it on the Internet.

1017
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,790
This is fucking hilarious. Why don't
your days to one to two days to research.

1018
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:59,300
You can find studies that prove
what I say is true. Parentheses,

1019
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:03,170
at least 100 billion. Now I
know you're in the business.

1020
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,793
Oh,

1021
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:10,420
waking the masses up just like the lake
group. Great. Bill Hicks. No, I'm not.

1022
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,430
But do you realize how serious the
situation is regarding the distraction and

1023
01:01:15,431 --> 01:01:20,431
brainwashing as organized by big business
and they're controlling family owners.

1024
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:25,140
So as great as, I think you and your
comedy are mentioning, overpopulation,

1025
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:28,620
which is a complete myth,
is doing them parentheses,

1026
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,550
big corporations and
the [inaudible] on them,

1027
01:01:30,551 --> 01:01:33,970
a big service and adding to
the brainwashing. Anyway, Bill,

1028
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:36,840
I know you're a great man because of
the subject you talk about during these

1029
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:37,210
shows,

1030
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:42,210
but please look for yourself and how much
admirable arable farm land there is a,

1031
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,730
and consider the fact that all
food grows completely for free.

1032
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,870
Um,

1033
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:55,350
wow. All right, well, I'll tell
you this buddy. I know I'm a moron,

1034
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:58,610
so I just looked up. I looked at how
many people can the earth sustain.

1035
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:01,910
Um,

1036
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:05,540
and it says a hundred people
can. The earth support.

1037
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:10,430
So 10 billion people is the utmost
population limit where food is concerned.

1038
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,870
That's the first one.

1039
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:17,500
The next one says more than 7 billion
people currently on the planet compared to

1040
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:21,750
3 billion in 1967. Then what does it say?

1041
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:23,640
Okay.

1042
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,760
Oh, I'll just go on. It's a
video. I don't want to watch that.

1043
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,270
Okay.

1044
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:33,250
Current population is three times
this sustainable level. That's a,

1045
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:36,490
the next article. Um,

1046
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,970
how many people can the earth
sustain? I'll click on this one.

1047
01:02:39,971 --> 01:02:44,060
I'm trying to find anything that says
anything even remotely close to a hundred

1048
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,830
million. 100 billion. Here's a staggering
stat. According to the United Nations,

1049
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,690
the world's current population is 7.2
billion is now up to 7.8 is projected to

1050
01:02:52,691 --> 01:02:55,000
increase by 1 billion
over the next 12 years,

1051
01:02:55,001 --> 01:03:00,001
which would bring us to 9.6 billion by
2050 how can we sustain all these people

1052
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:04,360
on the planet or rather how many
people can this plan to sustain?

1053
01:03:04,361 --> 01:03:08,380
That is the question Alan Weisman explored
in his latest book countdown our last

1054
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:13,270
best hope for a future on earth.
Question Mark. Uh, Jesus Christ,

1055
01:03:13,271 --> 01:03:15,370
a bunch of conversations,

1056
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,360
bunch of words. [inaudible] number.

1057
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:23,830
Where's the fucking number?

1058
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,410
Okay.

1059
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,680
Alrighty. As the charter or
it's kind of the next 50 years,

1060
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:32,370
we will need to produce as much food as
it's ever been consumed for an entire

1061
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:35,190
human history. Well, that makes sense
because there'll be the most people,

1062
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,820
there'll be the most farts ever
in, in the history of human beings.

1063
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,660
Well, there's no fucking number
there, sir. All I can tell you is,

1064
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:49,690
is if you see the environmental
damage that 7.8 billion people did,

1065
01:03:50,871 --> 01:03:53,030
if you're going to have
100 billion people, like,

1066
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,203
yeah,

1067
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,670
I mean, at this point in Africa, there's
barely any land for, for wild animals.

1068
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:00,740
It's all,

1069
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:05,000
it's all like for the most part down
in the southern part of the country,

1070
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,940
uh, it's all like roped off.

1071
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,370
Yeah.

1072
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,250
It's finite. You know what I mean?
They're completely surrounded.

1073
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,940
I'd have to say that I disagree
and not just by your spelling,

1074
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,860
cause I couldn't read half
the fucking words you said,

1075
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:21,570
even when you spelled
them. Right. But yeah, no,

1076
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:23,430
there's no fucking way 100 billion people

1077
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:29,420
and there's any sort of animal life
left that isn't stuck in a cage.

1078
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,180
You know what I mean? Um,

1079
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:37,340
and also in this last year I traveled
to Singapore, Hong Kong in Mumbai,

1080
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:41,570
India. And I saw what that next
level of population look like too.

1081
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,580
And I was breathing that air
that's Singapore. Singapore was,

1082
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,420
was different. Um, but Hong
Kong and Mumbai, India,

1083
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,060
you could almost taste the
fucking air. And it was just, uh,

1084
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,940
it was just way too many
fucking people. I can,

1085
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,540
I can tell you that there's
no way 100 billion people. Um,

1086
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,180
yeah.

1087
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,220
And I don't understand why I need
to look it up for one to two days.

1088
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:09,570
Why could you just send me a link? I
would love for you to be right, but, uh,

1089
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,640
I'm going to go out on a
limb and say you're not,

1090
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,850
I'm going to go with the
scientists on this one. And also,

1091
01:05:14,851 --> 01:05:18,430
this also sounds like, you know,
when people denied global warming,

1092
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,070
not to get all political,

1093
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:26,071
but one political party adamantly
denied it for years and years and years,

1094
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:28,870
and now they've decades and
now they finally just go, yeah,

1095
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:32,140
we are causing climate change. But
you know what? It's too late now.

1096
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,730
So I imagine that that's what's
we're going to do out here.

1097
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:39,910
We have a fucking methane gas
leak that's been going on,

1098
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:40,744
and I guess that's probably,

1099
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,710
it's like 10 times worse than carbon
dioxide as far as getting put into the

1100
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:49,000
fucking, uh, atmosphere as far
as heating it up and all that.

1101
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:52,900
We're completely fucked. We're
fucked, we're absolutely fucked.

1102
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,960
Um, and selfishly I hope I, it doesn't
happen by the end of my own life,

1103
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:03,040
which is the exact sort of thought process
that got us into this mess to begin

1104
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:04,000
with. But sir, you're,

1105
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,910
you're correct in assuming that I'm a
fucking dope and I don't know what I'm

1106
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:07,870
talking about, but uh,

1107
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,430
yeah,

1108
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:13,480
I'm just kinda going with
having traveled extensively,

1109
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,100
you know,

1110
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:20,100
for the last 20 years on the road and
watching the population increase just in

1111
01:06:20,591 --> 01:06:22,870
this country. Um,

1112
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:24,350
okay.

1113
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:28,100
It's a weird thing when the population
keeps looking like it's sort of leveled

1114
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:32,970
off and I don't know if because
there's no factories anymore.

1115
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,420
All I know is like I've, I
used to be back in the day,

1116
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:39,150
if I jumped on the highway at
two in the afternoon, I was good.

1117
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:40,770
And now everywhere I go
there's like traffic.

1118
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:43,530
And I'm just looking at these people
going like, you guys all stand up comics.

1119
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:45,330
Does everybody work the third shift?

1120
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,220
How the fuck are all these
people out on the road?

1121
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:48,054
I didn't know what's going on.

1122
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:52,230
Do a lot of people work from home and
they're all driving out to get a sandwich

1123
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:55,410
at that time. I don't know.
You know what? Let me look up.

1124
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,800
I heard the u s population has kind
of leveled off, which excited me.

1125
01:06:58,801 --> 01:06:59,910
That's exciting to me. You know

1126
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,980
u s population.

1127
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,163
Okay.

1128
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,260
Oh Jesus Christ. Still can
you fucking population.

1129
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,413
Okay.

1130
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,650
By year, let's do this. All
right. Let's see what we got here.

1131
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,320
US population by year

1132
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,730
a right?

1133
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:25,360
Let's go back to 1997 there was

1134
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:32,550
2.726 5 million and now
there's 322.0 7 million.

1135
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,570
So it's gone up by like 50
million. Is that enough to notice?

1136
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:43,240
Well that's actually, you know, that's
significant, right? That's all I could,

1137
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:47,080
I could get 20% increase.
I think I make it a point.

1138
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,290
All right, let's move on here. All
right. A advice changing high schools.

1139
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:53,831
Dear Bill,

1140
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:56,860
I'm a freshman in high school and would
like to know your perspective on my

1141
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:57,694
situation.

1142
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:01,870
I currently attended a performing arts
high school and Major G in jazz studies.

1143
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:05,440
Oh, that's fucking cool. I
enjoy it. And all, but this, uh,

1144
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:07,000
the first semester has passed.

1145
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:11,740
I found out that jazz is something I
don't want to do in life rather than carry

1146
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:13,810
on for what the next
three years of this major.

1147
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:18,500
I'd rather change and majored in something
that would benefit me in the long

1148
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:22,760
run, especially if I want to
attend big schools like Harvard.

1149
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:26,720
A well, let's go ahead man. You tried
something you've realized early on,

1150
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:30,180
you know, like it and he got enough
strength to be like, I communicate.

1151
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:34,330
I don't want to do this. Anyone need
something else? It's all good so far. Uh,

1152
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,890
the problem is that in
leaving my current school,

1153
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:41,300
I could possibly devastate
the bands I'm in.

1154
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:46,340
Ah, Jesus there came in an ego out of
nowhere and also hurt some friends.

1155
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:50,270
My director has placed me in some good
bands and I even get paid money for

1156
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:52,970
playing gay. I'll see you crushing it out.

1157
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:58,450
Phil Chow wrote to leave my director as
he has put me in a position that many

1158
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:02,420
others would gladly take this question.
It's been tearing me apart for a while.

1159
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:05,240
What do you think, Bill? Should
I stay or should I go? Also,

1160
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,260
if I do decide to leave,

1161
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:08,760
do you think I should tell my
friends and directors that I,

1162
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:13,190
that I am or should I just go out
quietly? I'm told you have to do in life.

1163
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,310
If what makes you happy. If you
try to make other people happy,

1164
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,860
that's all you're gonna do when you're
not going to be happy and then you're

1165
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:20,180
going to be miserable to be around.

1166
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:23,060
You're going to turn into a bitter person
who didn't do what they wanted to do

1167
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:25,670
in life and no one wants to
be around that guy. All right?

1168
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,950
So as much as it's gonna hurt them, uh,

1169
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:32,900
you gotta leave and you gotta tell them
and you have to tell them why you're

1170
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:35,390
going to leave and just say, listen,
I'm just not happy doing this.

1171
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,980
I understand that I'm lucky.

1172
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,560
And then a lot of people would
kill to be in my position.

1173
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:44,740
So I feel that someone should at
least be happy and be excited.

1174
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:46,880
You know,

1175
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,390
if we'll be people desire to be in my
position and I'm occupying that position

1176
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:54,590
and I'm not happy, I'm doing an
injustice to myself and one of you guys.

1177
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:59,080
All right, I apologize. I'm sorry.
And then that's it. And you know,

1178
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,370
and it's a great life
lessons sometimes. You know,

1179
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:05,150
when you ask for what you want,
people get hurt and uh, you know,

1180
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,740
I don't mean you physically
have to hurt them,

1181
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:11,210
you know that bottom lip quivers a
little bit. That's all I'm saying. Um,

1182
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:14,030
that's it. But don't go out quietly.
Don't sneak out the back door.

1183
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:18,260
Be a man or woman about
it and fucking, you know,

1184
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,840
be an adult. All right. That's it.

1185
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,950
And you should be commended
for understanding that you
don't like something and,

1186
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,610
and not just staying in it. All right.
Book recommendations. All right.

1187
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:33,200
Hey Bill, I'm not to start off
by blowing smoke up your ass,

1188
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:38,201
but f f F is for family is a phenomenal
show as me cracking up nonstop.

1189
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:40,530
But I'd aggressed well,
thank you. I appreciate that.

1190
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,580
It gives me a chance to promote the
show. If you haven't watched it yet,

1191
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:45,080
please check out. F is for family.

1192
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,770
Evidently we're doing great
on the all Netflix. Uh,

1193
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,850
this person says, I remember
you mentioned you read

1194
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:57,230
open o that you read
opened by Andre Augusti.

1195
01:10:57,231 --> 01:10:58,880
So I picked it up and started reading it.

1196
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:03,740
It truly is one of the books that's
tough to put down was wondering if he had

1197
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:06,680
any other recommendations that
you've read of late. Thanks.

1198
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:10,060
And Go fuck yourself. A that
comedian book that I mentioned. Um,

1199
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,370
I have it downstairs. Uh, it's like
the history of a standup comedy.

1200
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:19,260
Let me look it up here. Uh, which
has taken me forever to get through,

1201
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:21,900
cause every time they bring up a name
I'm like, who the fuck is that guy?

1202
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,870
And then I look them up and then I'm
on the Internet. But it's been a,

1203
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,850
it's been a joy,

1204
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,900
the history of stand up comedy book.

1205
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:38,940
There it is. All right. This
is what I've been reading.

1206
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,290
It's called the Comedians, uh, drunks,

1207
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:46,890
thieves scoundrels in the history
of American comedy. Jesus Christ,

1208
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,750
Hubbub Brilliance. Do you
know any geniuses in there?
No. No, no. Nod to Pryor,

1209
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:57,120
Lenny Bruce, none of that. All
right. Um, yeah, so I would,

1210
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:00,930
that's what I've been
reading and uh, I don't know.

1211
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,000
I'm in another one of those modes where
I'm just playing a lot of drums and I'm,

1212
01:12:04,001 --> 01:12:06,180
I'm cooking in that type of stuff. And uh,

1213
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:10,320
also feeling the pressure to put out
another cooking video to shut up somebody

1214
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:13,710
that I'd never met before. How
fucking ridiculous is that? Um,

1215
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:17,880
I should just let it go. You know I
should, but you know what? I'm not gonna.

1216
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,790
You know what? Maybe I'll make a
fuck. I'll make a breakfast one.

1217
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:23,850
I made a pie one. I'll make a
breakfast one, I'll make a lunch one.

1218
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,120
I'll make a demo or a supper one.

1219
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,170
I'll do it all throughout
the fucking years. All right.

1220
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,970
That'll be all basic cooking
by a basic cunt. All right,

1221
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:38,490
that's the podcast for this
week. Go fuck yourselves.

1222
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:43,290
I'll check in on you on
Thursday. I'm to brand new year.

1223
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:48,150
I have like two standup gigs booked
because I'm trying to figure out what the

1224
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:51,210
fuck is going to go on with this show
for going to get a second season.

1225
01:12:51,211 --> 01:12:55,650
I need to know, but a, I think I'm
just going to start booking shit. Um,

1226
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:00,300
cause that's how this business
works. You know, if you, uh,

1227
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,030
if you book a bunch of
Shit then they just go,

1228
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:05,610
oh well let's fucking give you something
right in the middle of all that other

1229
01:13:05,611 --> 01:13:07,800
shit that you booked. If
you don't book anything,

1230
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,770
then you're just going to be staring at
your phone and it's never going to ring.

1231
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,570
What do you fucking which billion
to sue unit's superstitious stuff?

1232
01:13:15,571 --> 01:13:17,190
Well maybe I am, I have no idea.

1233
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:22,191
But a Paul Versey is going to try to
not drink starting today until the

1234
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:24,571
beginning of April.

1235
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:28,080
And I told him that I w I've sorta half
ass committed that I would do it with

1236
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:30,420
them. Um,

1237
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:35,100
so I'm sort of on the wagon right
now. I didn't drink last night.

1238
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,510
I don't really have any desire to
do it today. I'm fucking wiped out.

1239
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:42,960
So we'll see. I'm going to try and
see. I'll try and go as long as I can.

1240
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:46,290
I'm all right. That's it. Go Fuck
Yourself. So I'll talk to you on Thursday.
