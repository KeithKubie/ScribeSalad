00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:02.252
What I want to do in this video is

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:06.510
explore the idea of a unit vector.

00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:09.413
A unit vector is just
a vector that goes in a

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:16.454
particular direction that
has a magnitude of one.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.345
Let's take an example.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.536
Let's say that I have the
vector, let's say the vector A,

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:28.066
and in the horizontal
direction for every three that

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.897
it moves in the vertical
direction it moves up four.

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:35.835
What else do we know about this?

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.726
We could figure out A's magnitude,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:39.417
we can denote it like this.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:42.157
The magnitude of vector A,

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:44.488
well this would just be the length of it.

00:00:44.758 --> 00:00:46.258
Let's try to visualize A.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.959
For every three that we go
in the horizontal direction

00:00:50.297 --> 00:00:52.699
we're going to go four in
the vertical direction.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:59.650
Vector A would look something like this.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.101
It would look like that.

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.602
That is vector A.

00:01:09.148 --> 00:01:10.422
What's its magnitude?

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:12.013
The magnitude is just the length of this

00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:13.820
vector right over here and we can use the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.523
Pythagorean theorem to figure this out.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.004
This length is going to
be the square root of

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.254
the sum of the squares
of the other two sides.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:25.445
This is just the hypotenuse
of this right triangle.

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:29.647
This is going to be three
squared plus four squared

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:37.558
or this is going to be the
square root of nine plus 16,

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:39.428
square root of 25,

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:43.399
or it's going to be equal to five.

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.477
You might have just recognized that this

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:46.648
would be a three, four,
five right triangle.

00:01:47.058 --> 00:01:49.839
The length of this side
right over here is five

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:54.320
so I could say the magnitude
of A is equal to five.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.980
This is clearly not a unit
vector. It has a length,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.041
it has a magnitude of
something other than one.

00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:07.038
Let's say we wanted to
construct a unit vector that has

00:02:07.038 --> 00:02:11.492
the same direction as A but
has a length of only one.

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:13.102
Another way of thinking about it,

00:02:13.102 --> 00:02:16.383
let's say we wanted to figure out a

00:02:16.383 --> 00:02:19.323
vector that goes in the
exact same direction

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:21.274
but it has one fifth the magnitude,

00:02:21.494 --> 00:02:23.274
it only has a magnitude of one.

00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:24.862
What could we do?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.055
If we scale everything down by a fifth,

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.826
if we were to multiply each
of these components of our

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:35.157
vector A by a fifth, or another
way of thinking about it,

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:38.198
if we divide each of these
by the magnitude of A

00:02:38.198 --> 00:02:40.539
then we can construct this unit vector.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.619
I'm going to call that unit
vector, I'll call it A but

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.460
instead of putting an arrow
on top I'm going to put --

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.281
Actually just to not confuse ourselves

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:52.671
let's call it U for a unit vector.

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:55.322
To also make it clear it's
a unit vector and not just

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:57.713
a normal vector I'm going
to put this little hat.

00:02:58.023 --> 00:03:00.214
Instead of this little
arrow when you put this hat

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.544
this denotes that you're
dealing with a unit vector,

00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:05.384
a vector with magnitude of one.

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:08.735
The unit vector, we could write it down.

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:12.796
It's going to be equal to
each of these components,

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:17.556
for A we just divide
by the magnitude of A.

00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:24.367
It's three in the horizontal direction,

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:26.527
four in the vertical direction.

00:03:26.527 --> 00:03:28.698
Once again we just
divide by the magnitude,

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:31.698
magnitude of our vector.

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:35.219
This is going to be equal
to, the magnitude we

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.869
already figured out is five so it's going

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:41.751
to be three fifths in
the horizontal direction

00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:46.353
and four fifths in the vertical direction.

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:50.547
You can verify. This is
going to have, one way to

00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:52.207
think about it the ratio between these two

00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:54.138
numbers is the exact
same thing as the ratio

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:56.559
up here so we're going
in the same direction but

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:00.260
the magnitude here is now
going to be equal to one.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.710
You can verify that, let's do that.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.681
What's the magnitude
now of our unit vector?

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:07.512
Let me write that hat a little bit,

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:08.742
that hat got a little crooked.

00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:11.013
What's the magnitude of unit vector U?

00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:14.024
It's going to be the square root of the

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.136
sum of the squares of
these two components.

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:18.507
It's going to be the,

00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:21.749
the square of three fifths is nine over 25

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:29.901
plus the square of four
fifths is 16 over 25.

00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:33.321
What's that going to be?

00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:36.312
Well nine plus 16 is 25 so it's

00:04:36.312 --> 00:04:39.923
going to be the square root of 25.

00:04:40.203 --> 00:04:42.433
That plus that is 25.

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:46.994
25 over 25 which is just
going to be equal to

00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:49.466
the square root, or I guess
we're doing the principal root,

00:04:49.466 --> 00:04:51.744
the positive square root of one,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.244
which is just equal to one,
which is exactly what we wanted.

00:04:55.524 --> 00:04:59.304
It goes in the same direction
but magnitude is one,

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:01.224
that's why it's a unit vector.
