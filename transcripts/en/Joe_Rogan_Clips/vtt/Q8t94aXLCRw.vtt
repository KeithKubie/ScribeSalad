1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.680
The Joe Rogan experience and I don't know what I'm fighting again.
So,

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.720
but now I'm ready to be active.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.740
That was a big part of my decision to go there too.
Uh,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.360
and stay there a year is I want to be active this year to two fights.
But

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.550
training,
where do they have you rank now?
I don't think I am.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.290
You don't think you ranked even Tom 15?
No,
definitely not.
Hmm.

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.720
What do you think you should do in terms of the next level of fighter you face?

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.100
Like what kind of guy would you like to fight?

9
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.370
Huh?
Man,

10
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.590
that's crazy.
I don't even ask myself those questions.

11
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.070
What do you do you just wait for the call?
Yeah,
I usually just,

12
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.940
I await for the call and whoever they,

13
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.920
they usually offer to,
they had like two options.
Really?

14
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.730
Yeah.
Like how do you choose?
Uh,

15
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.530
usually they offer like,
like the last time it was okay,

16
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:06.520
there's air candor's or there's a guy like,
I didn't even know his name.

17
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.300
Like this guy is going to be new coming into the UFC and Eric Anders is like

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.660
coming off a loss,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I'm like,
okay,
well sucks.
I know Eric,

19
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:17.171
all this stuff,

20
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:21.340
but I'd rather fight Eric because I've already lost three times to guys who are

21
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.940
making their UFC debuts and it's just not good for me.
But you know what I mean?

22
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:29.740
Like obviously they're tough,
they're hungry,
they're trying to get into the UFC.

23
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.080
It's going to be a really tough fight.
Um,

24
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.130
and so that's kind of how I made the decision.
The last one I was like,

25
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:40.630
I don't want to take the risk of losing another fight to a guy who is making his

26
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:45.580
debut because three times is enough for me.
That's refreshingly honest.
Yeah,

27
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.750
that's what,
yeah,
I mean it's like we were talking about earlier about boxers,

28
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:53.890
having managers that have a strategy to keep them undefeated as long as
possible,

29
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:58.150
give them tests,
have them decide like when's the right time to take this fight?

30
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.990
Once you know what's,
what's the right thing to do.
And as a professional,

31
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:05.740
how much of an advantage is it to know what a guy does?
Know who he is.

32
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:10.330
I've seen him fight a bunch of times.
Been around them.
Uh,
it's,

33
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.960
I just like just for instance,
um,

34
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.950
like I fought go con Saki and then they offered me Johnny Walker.

35
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.820
And so like Johnny Walker was coming off contenders series,

36
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:26.410
but still nobody knew.
Like not even,
we knew we saw his highlights,

37
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:30.240
but we're like,
oh well,
like
this,

38
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.710
look at the competition that he's faced.
Right.
You know,

39
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:36.270
so we didn't really get to see much of what he was capable of.
So I'm like,
uh,

40
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.820
okay.
If that's all you got,
then I'll take the fight by then.

41
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.660
Here comes Johnny Walker,
this like raging beast,
you know,

42
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.150
it'd be like the guy's huge.
So,
um,

43
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.780
yeah,
it was just,
it was weird.
Like,

44
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.420
so I went from beating go con Saki to losing Johnnie Walker.

45
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.610
Thank God Johnny Walker has been as good as,

46
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:59.460
he hasn't has made a name for himself but still like,
yeah,

47
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.990
I just didn't want to be like a,

48
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.590
I guess like a a foot in or what do they call it?

49
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.530
Like a a journeyman.
Yeah.
Not a journeyman,

50
00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:12.150
but like when they say like you're trying to get like your foot in the door or

51
00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:16.770
something like that,
like put the door guy.
Someone said it on Instagram.

52
00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:19.290
I saw it like a few times,
but um,
yeah,

53
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:23.580
I just didn't want to like just be another guy that,

54
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.280
you know,
could possibly give somebody their shot into the UFC.
I was like,

55
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.780
don't let me fight a guy that's,
that's in the UFC this time.
Will,

56
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:33.450
so now that you did and you had the fight with Eric Anderson,

57
00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:38.280
you have the spectacular result and now you know,
people recognizing that you,

58
00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:42.870
you,
you've made some big improvement.
Like what caliber fighter,
like who,
who,

59
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.680
who do you think would propel your career?
Like what would be the best next step?

60
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.133
<v 2>Uh,</v>

61
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.280
<v 0>I mean definitely I think it's time for me to break somewhere into the top 15,</v>

62
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.620
you know,
for sure net nowhere in the guys that are at the very top because

63
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.720
they're all kind of tied up.
They're all pretty tied up,
you know?

64
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:07.230
And I definitely think it'll be a while before I can actually fight Jones

65
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.460
because just like how things are,
how things are laid out.

66
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:15.810
Like I know for sure Johnny walkers ranked and he's already kind of like in

67
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:17.670
talks like he's the guy to beat Jon Jones,

68
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:20.550
so sure they're going to try to set that up right.

69
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:24.450
And then there's like kind of the set of guys in the middle.
Um,

70
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.380
did Johnnie Walker fucking shoulder open news doing that worm thing?
Supposedly.

71
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.360
Supposedly.
But I think he's fine.

72
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.720
I think he's fine because I've had people call me in like,
Hey,

73
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:36.990
I just see this Johnny Walker guy down,
done like on the street every day.

74
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:38.170
I guess he's back in Thailand now.

75
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.510
So he did that flop around thing and then he could,

76
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.800
when he got up he couldn't move.

77
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.640
His shoulder dislocate is located or something like that.

78
00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:50.610
I think that's what happened.
That's so insane.
Did you,
were you calm after,
right?

79
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:55.470
Yeah.
I think you call it out like most like what's going on,
man?
Yeah.
He's um,

80
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.990
I hope he doesn't,
didn't permanently injured his shoulder.
Nah,

81
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:01.290
I think he might be fine.
I hope so.
Yeah.

82
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.450
He's not walking around in a slug or anything right now,

83
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.450
but he could have a little,
but yeah,
after your fight with him,

84
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:08.010
he's made quite an account of himself.

85
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.670
That last fight without flying knee was insane.
Yeah.
So I'm sure,

86
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.150
I'm sure before I get to the top,
I'd have to fight every game.
Right.
What's up,

87
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:15.630
Jim?
Yeah,

88
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.320
I would imagine that he is currently recuperating from his shoulder surgery

89
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:23.580
after dislocated shoulder surgery.
Dude.
Ah,

90
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.290
shoulder surgery,
that's never,
you're fucked up.

91
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.150
I've never known anybody to have shoulder surgery and come back with a full,

92
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.850
fully warranted Danage reward.

93
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:37.620
Had shoulder surgery and came back better than ever.

94
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.370
But he's also got the best doctors.
Sure.
Took a long time.

95
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.150
Two months from a comeback is what he says.
He goes to fight the winter months.

96
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.310
Anthony's Talman Smith,
he better take his time.

97
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.440
He doesn't want have a fuck a shoulder up forever,
you know,
if it rips again,

98
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.860
that's a great fight.
Anthony Smith and Gustafson,
that's a great fight.

99
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.300
And you know,
Anthony Smith Account,
he

100
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 3>really held his own,
like he made a good account of himself in that fight.</v>

101
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:06.050
He didn't win the fight,
but you know,
he showed everybody how he is,

102
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.230
especially in that first round.
Yeah,
for sure.
Real good and sharp.

103
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.530
John's just pattern is just,
John's just better,
you know.

104
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.990
I mean for now he just has his number.

105
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.800
I mean in the John Jones that you're seeing now is a Jon Jones had sort of,

106
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:22.280
has like a real goal in mind.
Yeah.

107
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.250
He's had it taken away from them and it gave,

108
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.230
they gave it back to him and now he knows he has it and he's capitalizing

109
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.320
<v 0>it seems like it,
it's like he knows what it's like to be,
to be the best,</v>

110
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:35.140
but not be able to,
to really like do anything about it.
Right.

111
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.620
For a long amount of time.
Yeah.
So I think it's,

112
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:41.230
I think it's pretty cool to be able to see this version of him and,

113
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.650
and to be active around this time.
Maybe,
you know,

114
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.500
maybe I'll get a shot or maybe he'll still be around at the top.

115
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.020
Like whenever I get my shot.
[inaudible] how it goes.

116
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.470
If you had a timeline in your head of when you think you'd be ready to challenge

117
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:57.370
for a title,
when do you think it would be?
Uh,
oh,

118
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.140
I can give it
another year.
Yeah.

119
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.900
I think I can get one,
one more year,

120
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.901
a year and a half of good solid flights in to really solidify myself in just in

121
00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:19.000
the UFC and uh,

122
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.700
and just put in the work and everything that,
that it,

123
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.880
that it takes to really embody what I think it would be like what I think it

124
00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:31.770
would take to be a champion as successful champion.

125
00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:35.100
Not just like get the belt and lose it,
you know,
like get the bell and then,

126
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.590
and then,
uh,
just be a champion for,
you know,
a couple months.

127
00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:44.520
Like now to actually be a champion and,
and,
and hold it down.

128
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.043
I think

129
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.903
<v 3>little over a year,</v>

130
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.950
but it's an unbelievably talent rich wig class.
Right?

131
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:56.570
Cause de Cormier is still kind of in it.
[inaudible] Jon Jones is the champion.

132
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.360
You know,
he just got off the Anthony Smith Phi Anthony Smith,

133
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:01.250
Gustafson Gustafson still beast,

134
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.730
but no one is like really standing out as being like this person that everybody

135
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:10.220
wants to see challenge for the title.
You've got worthy challengers,

136
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.120
they're good fights,

137
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.190
but there's no one that you're seeing them except cornea was the only one we

138
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:19.310
seen him versus John.
You're like,
Whoa,
what the fuck is going to happen here?

139
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.150
What's going to happen here?
And that's what the division needs I think.
Yeah,
no,

140
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.150
definitely.
And that's something that

141
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.360
<v 0>that I can also see and that's something that I also want to do for myself.</v>

142
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:34.321
I just,

143
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:38.280
I want to be the best version and I'm starting to find out what that's like.

144
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.910
Especially like the happy,
like being able to do what I,

145
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.280
what I want to do and strike high.
I want to strike and stuff.

146
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.270
So now like let's get some,
some fights in there to mix it up.
Yeah.

147
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.490
Really like test that like test if it works,
test,

148
00:08:50.491 --> 00:08:54.460
if that's really going to be able to,
to sustain and,

149
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.880
and what takes to get to get there.
You know what I mean?

150
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.500
Like I'm willing to test it.
Like if they want to put me up against the,

151
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.800
the best grappler in the world and thinks that I'll have no chance on the
ground.

152
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.070
Okay,
cool.
Or if they want to put me against,
well they already did.

153
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:13.130
They thought I wouldn't stand a chance against go on Saki and like I was very

154
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.570
happy for that because I go,
I'm like,
okay cool.

155
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:20.100
I get to test the best of my abilities.
Like that's like again,
so legend.
Yeah.

156
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.150
I didn't like,
I knew that I had everything it took to beat him but I,

157
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.210
I didn't think like Ah,
he's going to destroy me.
No,
never.

158
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.810
Like so I'm wanting to continue to be tested.

159
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.580
<v 3>It's interesting your approach cause I wonder if the fact that you were such a</v>

160
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:37.770
non confrontational guy and you are really easy

161
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.790
<v 0>going helps you and that you have like less conflict in your head.</v>

162
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.070
<v 3>I almost,</v>

163
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.430
I almost wonder because even the way you approach like these different match ups

164
00:09:48.431 --> 00:09:51.640
and everything you like,
you kind of put your ego aside,

165
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.010
you're looking into like what is the smart thing to do here?

166
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.560
The smart thing to do is not take this fight against this newcomer guy.

167
00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.610
I've already lost the newcomer guys.
The smart thing is,
okay,
we,

168
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.320
we realized that Thailand was extremely beneficial.

169
00:10:02.321 --> 00:10:06.040
Let's fucking move to Thailand.
Yeah.
So you're doing all these like really,

170
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.610
really smart moves where you know,
you're,

171
00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:14.160
you're looking at it very logically,
but you have confidence in yourself,

172
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.780
but you're not,
you don't really know like a braggy guy,
you know,

173
00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:19.240
you're getting everything done with your work,
you know,

174
00:10:19.241 --> 00:10:21.580
you're getting everything done with your results.
It's uh,

175
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.660
it's interesting to see me because you want to see as many different kinds of

176
00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:27.770
fighters as possible and you're like a new

177
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.490
<v 0>kind of thing.
That's the most important thing though,
man.
Like I,
I don't,</v>

178
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.970
I don't really tune in too much UFC and like what's going on because of that

179
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:42.060
reason.
Right.
I don't care about what people have to say in this.

180
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.960
I don't watch fighting to hear what people have to say.
You know?
Like,

181
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:49.590
I didn't fight.
Like,
it's not about talking,
it's about fighting.
Right.

182
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.400
And the only thing that I can prove and have to prove is what I can do with my

183
00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:57.780
skills.
That's it.
You know?
So like if they put me like

184
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.190
they put me against any type of other fighter,
like,

185
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.620
let's go back to the roots of mixed martial arts.

186
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.540
Let's go back to the roots of UFC.

187
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.930
Like when guys weren't even the same size and they were just matching up

188
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.680
different martial arts,
I'd be down for that.
I mean,

189
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.990
I'd consider it,
and if it,
if it had to happen now,
like,
yeah,

190
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.080
I definitely think about it and I'd probably lean more towards doing it and

191
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:22.560
saying,
no.
