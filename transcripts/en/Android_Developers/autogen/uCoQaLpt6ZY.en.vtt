mean the the the thing that you need for
this and this is what we use in

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969
this and this is what we use in
 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:09.240
this and this is what we use in
Broadcasting's we use in musics what

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250
Broadcasting's we use in musics what
 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.070
Broadcasting's we use in musics what
programs use is something called a

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080
programs use is something called a
 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.920
programs use is something called a
compressor limiter it's a very very easy

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930
compressor limiter it's a very very easy
 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.439
compressor limiter it's a very very easy
thing to make mathematically I actually

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.449
thing to make mathematically I actually
 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.300
thing to make mathematically I actually
wrote an article in game programming

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310
wrote an article in game programming
 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.429
wrote an article in game programming
gems eight I think on the compressor

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:23.439
gems eight I think on the compressor
 

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.679
gems eight I think on the compressor
limiter that I wrote for for Halo 3

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:25.689
limiter that I wrote for for Halo 3
 

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:28.559
limiter that I wrote for for Halo 3
we actually cranked that thing and used

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:28.569
we actually cranked that thing and used
 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.159
we actually cranked that thing and used
it for a radio effect but what you want

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169
it for a radio effect but what you want
 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:38.159
it for a radio effect but what you want
to do is get it so the the high parts of

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:38.169
to do is get it so the the high parts of
 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:40.920
to do is get it so the the high parts of
the sound just kind of roll off mmm so

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930
the sound just kind of roll off mmm so
 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.050
the sound just kind of roll off mmm so
that you don't ever blow your your

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.060
that you don't ever blow your your
 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.420
that you don't ever blow your your
eardrums out or in this case below this

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430
eardrums out or in this case below this
 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.040
eardrums out or in this case below this
the speaker's because you're clipping so

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.050
the speaker's because you're clipping so
 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.439
the speaker's because you're clipping so
hard yeah and I think I think it's uh

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:49.449
hard yeah and I think I think it's uh
 

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.119
hard yeah and I think I think it's uh
you know you can control attenuation in

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:51.129
you know you can control attenuation in
 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:52.769
you know you can control attenuation in
sound pool so that's that's you know

00:07:52.769 --> 00:07:52.779
sound pool so that's that's you know
 

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:53.879
sound pool so that's that's you know
then that's the other way to do it is

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:53.889
then that's the other way to do it is
 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:55.079
then that's the other way to do it is
you can you know given the fact that you

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:55.089
you can you know given the fact that you
 

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:57.059
you can you know given the fact that you
have a you know a maximum of sounds

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:57.069
have a you know a maximum of sounds
 

00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:58.409
have a you know a maximum of sounds
you're gonna be playing it one time it's

00:07:58.409 --> 00:07:58.419
you're gonna be playing it one time it's
 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:07:59.670
you're gonna be playing it one time it's
a little tricky because sound pool

00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680
a little tricky because sound pool
 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.740
a little tricky because sound pool
actually doesn't give you any knowledge

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:01.750
actually doesn't give you any knowledge
 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.040
actually doesn't give you any knowledge
that your sound is really playing and

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.050
that your sound is really playing and
 

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.139
that your sound is really playing and
necessarily it so you do eat it it is a

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:07.149
necessarily it so you do eat it it is a
 

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:08.490
necessarily it so you do eat it it is a
little bit tricky but I think I think

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:08.500
little bit tricky but I think I think
 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.079
little bit tricky but I think I think
that the easier thing to do is to is to

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:10.089
that the easier thing to do is to is to
 

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:11.429
that the easier thing to do is to is to
try to lower the sound volume a little

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:11.439
try to lower the sound volume a little
 

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:14.429
try to lower the sound volume a little
and or you know you could go the extra

00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:14.439
and or you know you could go the extra
 

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:16.200
and or you know you could go the extra
mile and actually write your own mixer

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.210
mile and actually write your own mixer
 

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.269
mile and actually write your own mixer
with effects processor yeah but at the

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:18.279
with effects processor yeah but at the
 

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:19.889
with effects processor yeah but at the
very least you know do what we used to

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:19.899
very least you know do what we used to
 

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.839
very least you know do what we used to
do when we didn't have good computers to

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:21.849
do when we didn't have good computers to
 

00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:24.689
do when we didn't have good computers to
play games on and write yourself a fake

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:24.699
play games on and write yourself a fake
 

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:26.010
play games on and write yourself a fake
compressor so basically what you're

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.020
compressor so basically what you're
 

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.769
compressor so basically what you're
trying to do is based on how many sounds

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:28.779
trying to do is based on how many sounds
 

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:31.260
trying to do is based on how many sounds
you've played and within a certain

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:31.270
you've played and within a certain
 

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.079
you've played and within a certain
period of time just drop the volume down

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:34.089
period of time just drop the volume down
 

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:35.939
period of time just drop the volume down
you drop it down a certain amount for

00:08:35.939 --> 00:08:35.949
you drop it down a certain amount for
 

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.529
you drop it down a certain amount for
each sound and then you let it come back

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:37.539
each sound and then you let it come back
 

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.740
each sound and then you let it come back
up slowly you know just right

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:40.750
up slowly you know just right
 

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.340
up slowly you know just right
a little you know windowed average

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:44.350
a little you know windowed average
 

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.000
a little you know windowed average
engine to do that so but the main thing

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.010
engine to do that so but the main thing
 

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.290
engine to do that so but the main thing
is you know make sure especially if

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:49.300
is you know make sure especially if
 

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.420
is you know make sure especially if
you're going to be playing a lot of

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.430
you're going to be playing a lot of
 

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.740
you're going to be playing a lot of
sounds you know this would have been

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:52.750
sounds you know this would have been
 

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.960
sounds you know this would have been
very easy to test and it's surprising to

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:54.970
very easy to test and it's surprising to
 

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.400
very easy to test and it's surprising to
me that the developer let it ship in

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.410
me that the developer let it ship in
 

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.230
me that the developer let it ship in
this day well you know again this site

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240
this day well you know again this site
 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.900
this day well you know again this site
this this is a this game is really cool

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:00.910
this this is a this game is really cool
 

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.370
this this is a this game is really cool
it's clearly one guy and clearly you

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:02.380
it's clearly one guy and clearly you
 

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.170
it's clearly one guy and clearly you
know that was not his priority was sound

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.180
know that was not his priority was sound
 

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.870
know that was not his priority was sound
effects I mean that's true but the game

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880
effects I mean that's true but the game
 

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.520
effects I mean that's true but the game
is really fun and you know again there's

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:08.530
is really fun and you know again there's
 

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.190
is really fun and you know again there's
just a lot of UI stuff here you know

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200
just a lot of UI stuff here you know
 

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.240
just a lot of UI stuff here you know
it's hard to tell how much this is

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.250
it's hard to tell how much this is
 

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.740
it's hard to tell how much this is
tablet-specific since i only have to

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:13.750
tablet-specific since i only have to
 

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.990
tablet-specific since i only have to
play this on this tablet you wanted

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000
play this on this tablet you wanted
 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.520
play this on this tablet you wanted
things that's interesting is there's

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.530
things that's interesting is there's
 

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.580
things that's interesting is there's
actually sort of a wizard that that goes

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:20.590
actually sort of a wizard that that goes
 

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.500
actually sort of a wizard that that goes
on as you're going through the levels

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:22.510
on as you're going through the levels
 

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.040
on as you're going through the levels
and it is a little bit jarring given

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.050
and it is a little bit jarring given
 

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.810
and it is a little bit jarring given
given the kind of composition of

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:27.820
given the kind of composition of
 

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.100
given the kind of composition of
different elements that we see here on

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.110
different elements that we see here on
 

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.050
different elements that we see here on
the screen at once we have like some

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.060
the screen at once we have like some
 

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.300
the screen at once we have like some
Android elements some bitmaps some sort

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.310
Android elements some bitmaps some sort
 

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.310
Android elements some bitmaps some sort
of bitmap creations of similar Android

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320
of bitmap creations of similar Android
 

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.010
of bitmap creations of similar Android
elements and you know it does feel like

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:38.020
elements and you know it does feel like
 

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.750
elements and you know it does feel like
there's there's at this point it would

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760
there's there's at this point it would
 

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.400
there's there's at this point it would
make sense to actually bring in a

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:41.410
make sense to actually bring in a
 

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.440
make sense to actually bring in a
designer and have them take a look at

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.450
designer and have them take a look at
 

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.880
designer and have them take a look at
all of these intro screens because the

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:44.890
all of these intro screens because the
 

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.770
all of these intro screens because the
game itself is really really fun and you

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:46.780
game itself is really really fun and you
 

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.230
game itself is really really fun and you
don't want someone to go through at the

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240
don't want someone to go through at the
 

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.790
don't want someone to go through at the
first screen of the game and be wow this

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800
first screen of the game and be wow this
 

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.440
first screen of the game and be wow this
feels really amateurish we should you

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:52.450
feels really amateurish we should you
 

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.240
feels really amateurish we should you
know I'm not interested well you just

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.250
know I'm not interested well you just
 

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.280
know I'm not interested well you just
have to ask your question are you

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:56.290
have to ask your question are you
 

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.230
have to ask your question are you
selling to the public or are you selling

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240
selling to the public or are you selling
 

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.180
selling to the public or are you selling
to like your friends and family cuz your

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.190
to like your friends and family cuz your
 

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.670
to like your friends and family cuz your
mom doesn't really care right but anyone

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680
mom doesn't really care right but anyone
 

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.400
mom doesn't really care right but anyone
who doesn't know you that well yeah your

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:05.410
who doesn't know you that well yeah your
 

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.329
who doesn't know you that well yeah your
mom sure but we all know yeah the the

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:09.339
mom sure but we all know yeah the the
 

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:11.160
mom sure but we all know yeah the the
problem is anyone that just downloads

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.170
problem is anyone that just downloads
 

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.470
problem is anyone that just downloads
this game and remember they probably

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480
this game and remember they probably
 

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.780
this game and remember they probably
downloaded several games they're

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:15.790
downloaded several games they're
 

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.820
downloaded several games they're
probably looking for a good game they're

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:17.830
probably looking for a good game they're
 

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.740
probably looking for a good game they're
probably going to give you a few seconds

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:19.750
probably going to give you a few seconds
 

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.290
probably going to give you a few seconds

mechanics I don't know why there aren't

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:19.529
mechanics I don't know why there aren't
 

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:20.960
mechanics I don't know why there aren't
more games like this is a lot of fun

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:20.970
more games like this is a lot of fun
 

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.259
more games like this is a lot of fun
yeah alright let's go ahead and move on

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:24.269
yeah alright let's go ahead and move on
 

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:26.809
yeah alright let's go ahead and move on
Oh YouTube would like to know what you

guys thought of the music for that day

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.300
guys thought of the music for that day
 

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.179
guys thought of the music for that day
well the truth is that we played it with

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:32.189
well the truth is that we played it with
 

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:36.920
well the truth is that we played it with
sound off except for the the wait no

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:36.930
sound off except for the the wait no
 

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.119
sound off except for the the wait no
that makes no sense we didn't play with

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:38.129
that makes no sense we didn't play with
 

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:39.980

on here on this it is pretty good yeah
it's it's a nice game um I don't know

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:29.310
it's it's a nice game um I don't know
 

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.190
it's it's a nice game um I don't know
this is one of those games that I think

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200
this is one of those games that I think
 

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.540
this is one of those games that I think
of as being kind of the adobe

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:32.550
of as being kind of the adobe
 

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.380
of as being kind of the adobe
illustrator game where the the graphics

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:36.390
illustrator game where the the graphics
 

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.810
illustrator game where the the graphics
it's like obviously somebody made the

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820
it's like obviously somebody made the
 

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.970
it's like obviously somebody made the
graphics that has real talent you know

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980
graphics that has real talent you know
 

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.019
graphics that has real talent you know
the got a graphic designer

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:42.029
the got a graphic designer
 

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:45.769
the got a graphic designer
but then they made like one frame yes

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779
but then they made like one frame yes
 

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:47.570
but then they made like one frame yes
there's no actual animation there's just

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:47.580
there's no actual animation there's just
 

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.280
there's no actual animation there's just
a bunch of affine transformations yes

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.290
a bunch of affine transformations yes
 

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.380
a bunch of affine transformations yes
yeah whether you know their clothes and

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:51.390
yeah whether you know their clothes and
 

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.060
yeah whether you know their clothes and
this is again this is this is a

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.070
this is again this is this is a
 

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.910
this is again this is this is a
certainly if you have the choice between

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920
certainly if you have the choice between
 

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.010
certainly if you have the choice between
having really really awesome you know a

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.020
having really really awesome you know a
 

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.750
having really really awesome you know a
single really awesome frame and none of

00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760
single really awesome frame and none of
 

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.490
single really awesome frame and none of
it this is the way to go absolutely

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500
it this is the way to go absolutely
 

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.570
it this is the way to go absolutely
that's true but it is what

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:02.580
that's true but it is what
 

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.160
that's true but it is what
differentiates it from some of the other

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.170
differentiates it from some of the other
 

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.870
differentiates it from some of the other
physics physics games out there that

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880
physics physics games out there that
 

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.220
physics physics games out there that
have been really really successful right

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:07.230
have been really really successful right
 

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.840
have been really really successful right
I'm like you know right now the bar is

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:08.850
I'm like you know right now the bar is
 

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.250
I'm like you know right now the bar is
pretty high in physics games people a

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260
pretty high in physics games people a
 

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.720
pretty high in physics games people a
lot of choices there's been a lot of

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:11.730
lot of choices there's been a lot of
 

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.970
lot of choices there's been a lot of
really successful games and so you know

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980
really successful games and so you know
 

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.710
really successful games and so you know
again great presentation but you know

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720
again great presentation but you know
 

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.420
again great presentation but you know
the kind of the bar has to be up here

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:17.430
the kind of the bar has to be up here
 

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.710
the kind of the bar has to be up here
yeah and as far as upping the bar I i

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720
yeah and as far as upping the bar I i
 

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.970
yeah and as far as upping the bar I i
well you can see what the gameplay I I

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980
well you can see what the gameplay I I
 

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.610
well you can see what the gameplay I I
didn't feel like it had a significant

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620
didn't feel like it had a significant
 

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.020
didn't feel like it had a significant
amount to offer I mean I feel this is

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.030
amount to offer I mean I feel this is
 

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:33.230
amount to offer I mean I feel this is
exactly like heaven in hell Wow really

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240
exactly like heaven in hell Wow really
 

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.230
exactly like heaven in hell Wow really
but yeah yeah so basically the idea is

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240
but yeah yeah so basically the idea is
 

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.690
but yeah yeah so basically the idea is
you're gonna slice through one or more

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700
you're gonna slice through one or more
 

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.180
you're gonna slice through one or more
pieces of I don't know wood I guess um

know monetization with characters and
part of the reason that they monetize

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.170

strangely enough even what you're doing
is fleeing those characters into a brick

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:50.670
is fleeing those characters into a brick

you're still somehow identifying those

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860
you're still somehow identifying those
 

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.590
you're still somehow identifying those
characters and yeah absolutely

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600
characters and yeah absolutely
 

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.519
characters and yeah absolutely
and so you know that's that's always

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:55.529
and so you know that's that's always
 

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:57.470
and so you know that's that's always
nice too and yeah I think that that that

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480
nice too and yeah I think that that that
 

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.699
nice too and yeah I think that that that
is kind of what the game is missing is

00:14:58.699 --> 00:14:58.709
is kind of what the game is missing is
 

00:14:58.709 --> 00:14:59.929
is kind of what the game is missing is
animation but because the game is

00:14:59.929 --> 00:14:59.939
animation but because the game is
 

00:14:59.939 --> 00:15:00.980

actually you know in this case be a

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120
actually you know in this case be a
 

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.819

themed dialogue it makes sense to have

00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:10.829
themed dialogue it makes sense to have
 

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:12.470
themed dialogue it makes sense to have
these things kind of themed around the

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480
these things kind of themed around the

in the app review that there are some

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500
in the app review that there are some
 

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.610
in the app review that there are some
apps where you can tell that they had a

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620
apps where you can tell that they had a
 

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.259
apps where you can tell that they had a
great designer and then you can also

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:24.269
great designer and then you can also
 

00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:25.639
great designer and then you can also
tell that they ran out of time before

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:25.649
tell that they ran out of time before
 

00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:28.129
tell that they ran out of time before
they shipped and you can just map out

00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139
they shipped and you can just map out
 

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:30.860
they shipped and you can just map out
exactly where they ran out of time now

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:30.870
exactly where they ran out of time now
 

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.150
exactly where they ran out of time now

00:19:55.049 --> 00:19:57.409
said the title screen is great I I can't
say enough about this you know you can

00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419
say enough about this you know you can
 

00:19:57.419 --> 00:20:01.519
say enough about this you know you can
see that someone took a long time just

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:01.529
see that someone took a long time just
 

00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:04.129
see that someone took a long time just
thinking what is fun about this game

00:20:04.129 --> 00:20:04.139
thinking what is fun about this game
 

00:20:04.139 --> 00:20:07.310
thinking what is fun about this game
what is what is the experience that I

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320
what is what is the experience that I
 

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.470
what is what is the experience that I
want people to think they're having with

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480
want people to think they're having with
 

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.389
want people to think they're having with
this game what and you know actually the

00:20:11.389 --> 00:20:11.399
this game what and you know actually the
 

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:13.190
this game what and you know actually the
one thing I really love the trail that's

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200
one thing I really love the trail that's
 

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.840
one thing I really love the trail that's
actually shown behind the car and I kind

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:14.850
actually shown behind the car and I kind
 

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.159
actually shown behind the car and I kind
of wish that was a game element

00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:16.169
of wish that was a game element
 

00:20:16.169 --> 00:20:17.930
of wish that was a game element
yeah I'm started going fast if you could

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940
yeah I'm started going fast if you could
 

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.460
yeah I'm started going fast if you could
see like a little trail shootout behind

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:19.470
see like a little trail shootout behind
 

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.080
see like a little trail shootout behind
the car though well you kind of do I

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.090
the car though well you kind of do I
 

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:21.490
the car though well you kind of do I
mean there

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:21.500
mean there
 

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.080
mean there
a little particle system variance it's

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.090
a little particle system variance it's
 

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.500
a little particle system variance it's
not whoa

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:25.510
not whoa
 

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.060
not whoa
do it sorry I better I think I I may be

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.070
do it sorry I better I think I I may be
 

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.340

tell you this in will squash because you

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:39.650
tell you this in will squash because you
 

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.680
tell you this in will squash because you
give the beginning of the whole but I I

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:41.690
give the beginning of the whole but I I
 

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.480

saw the thing that said tap to go fast

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:43.490
saw the thing that said tap to go fast
 

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:44.980

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:44.990
and skip right past it
 

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.100
and skip right past it
mmm always a danger yeah it actually

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.110
mmm always a danger yeah it actually
 

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.600
mmm always a danger yeah it actually
took me three or four tries on the

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:49.610
took me three or four tries on the
 

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:50.680
took me three or four tries on the
second level to figure out why I

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:50.690
second level to figure out why I
 

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.170
second level to figure out why I
couldn't execute the loop perfectly

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:53.180
couldn't execute the loop perfectly
 

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.370
couldn't execute the loop perfectly
mm-hmm

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:54.380
mm-hmm
 

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.810
mm-hmm
because I was pressing down when it was

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:55.820
because I was pressing down when it was
 

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.970
because I was pressing down when it was
going up and then the car just flop over

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:57.980
going up and then the car just flop over
 

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.190
going up and then the car just flop over
yep that's exactly - does my still ran

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200
yep that's exactly - does my still ran
 

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.290
yep that's exactly - does my still ran
out of time the game is you know you've

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:02.300
out of time the game is you know you've
 

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.820
out of time the game is you know you've
got a pretty good level of challenge to

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:03.830
got a pretty good level of challenge to
 

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.640
got a pretty good level of challenge to
it and and you know I think the

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:06.650
it and and you know I think the
 

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.170
it and and you know I think the
presentation is good I mean this is

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.180
presentation is good I mean this is
 

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.780
presentation is good I mean this is
actually an example of really doing a

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:10.790
actually an example of really doing a
 

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.340
actually an example of really doing a
lot of things right it does play audio

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:12.350
lot of things right it does play audio
 

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.140
lot of things right it does play audio
on the lockscreen which is a little

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:14.150
on the lockscreen which is a little
 

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.530
on the lockscreen which is a little
unfortunate and it's a dumb thing that's

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:17.540
unfortunate and it's a dumb thing that's
 

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.520
unfortunate and it's a dumb thing that's
definitely something to look at that's

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:18.530
definitely something to look at that's
 

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.410
definitely something to look at that's
really really easy to fix by looking at

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:20.420
really really easy to fix by looking at
 

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.300
really really easy to fix by looking at
whether or not your window is currently

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:22.310
whether or not your window is currently
 

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.850
whether or not your window is currently
active the other thing that I just want

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:24.860
active the other thing that I just want
 

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.700
active the other thing that I just want
to mention is when you're designing

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:27.710
to mention is when you're designing
 

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.770
to mention is when you're designing
games for a mobile environment you have

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:29.780
games for a mobile environment you have
 

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.920
games for a mobile environment you have
to remember that you'll very frequently

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:32.930
to remember that you'll very frequently
 

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.660
to remember that you'll very frequently
get played in environments that are not

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:34.670
get played in environments that are not
 

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:39.880
get played in environments that are not
at all optimal and this game in

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:39.890
at all optimal and this game in
 

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.340
at all optimal and this game in
particular suffers from that because

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:41.350
particular suffers from that because
 

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.830
particular suffers from that because
some of its screens have extremely low

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840
some of its screens have extremely low
 

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.290
some of its screens have extremely low
contrast you can see this on this screen

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:47.300
contrast you can see this on this screen
 

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.930
contrast you can see this on this screen
with all of the white lettering it's

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:49.940
with all of the white lettering it's
 

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.000
with all of the white lettering it's
very very difficult to read if you're at

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.010
very very difficult to read if you're at
 

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.790
very very difficult to read if you're at
all in sunlight or if you have poor

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:54.800
all in sunlight or if you have poor
 

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.380
all in sunlight or if you have poor
lighting conditions at all and maybe

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:56.390
lighting conditions at all and maybe
 

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.120
lighting conditions at all and maybe
think about doing a little bit more

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:58.130
think about doing a little bit more
 

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.490
think about doing a little bit more
contrast on those yeah if the drop

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:00.500
contrast on those yeah if the drop
 

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.080
contrast on those yeah if the drop
shadow is maybe a little bit stronger

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.090
shadow is maybe a little bit stronger
 

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.760
shadow is maybe a little bit stronger
it'd be a little easier to read um

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:03.770
it'd be a little easier to read um
 

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.200
it'd be a little easier to read um
there's also a little bit of resolution

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.210
there's also a little bit of resolution
 

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.970
there's also a little bit of resolution
going on here too at the screen it's

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:06.980
going on here too at the screen it's
 

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.550
going on here too at the screen it's
just a tiny bit too low for this device

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:09.560
just a tiny bit too low for this device
 

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.220
just a tiny bit too low for this device
and it's noticeable another thing that

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:12.230
and it's noticeable another thing that
 

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.750
and it's noticeable another thing that
we're seeing here which is also which is

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760
we're seeing here which is also which is
 

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.400
we're seeing here which is also which is
interesting is you know I don't know if

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.410
interesting is you know I don't know if
 

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:16.810
interesting is you know I don't know if
we unplug it whether we see that there

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:16.820
we unplug it whether we see that there
 

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:17.980
we unplug it whether we see that there
is actually letterboxing on the

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:17.990
is actually letterboxing on the
 

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.560
is actually letterboxing on the
right-hand side of the screen here which

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:20.570
right-hand side of the screen here which
 

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.730
right-hand side of the screen here which
is kind of unfortunate because I don't

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:21.740
is kind of unfortunate because I don't
 

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.500
is kind of unfortunate because I don't
really see any reason why there

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:23.510
really see any reason why there
 

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.539
really see any reason why there
no it's not the kind of game that needs

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:26.549
no it's not the kind of game that needs
 

00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:29.240
no it's not the kind of game that needs
to be letterboxed at all yeah I was

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.250
to be letterboxed at all yeah I was
 

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.340
to be letterboxed at all yeah I was
surprised let me unplug the HDMI so we

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:31.350
surprised let me unplug the HDMI so we
 

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.110
surprised let me unplug the HDMI so we
could just we're gonna lose the feed

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120
could just we're gonna lose the feed
 

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.760
could just we're gonna lose the feed
here I just want to see okay oh yeah

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:34.770
here I just want to see okay oh yeah
 

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.560
here I just want to see okay oh yeah
yeah yeah it's still somewhat letterbox

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:36.570
yeah yeah it's still somewhat letterbox
 

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.970
yeah yeah it's still somewhat letterbox
it's just yeah they're box yeah you

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980
it's just yeah they're box yeah you
 

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.010
it's just yeah they're box yeah you
don't get more letter wrong yeah um so

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020
don't get more letter wrong yeah um so
 

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.100
don't get more letter wrong yeah um so
you know it's what I thought so yeah

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:43.110
you know it's what I thought so yeah
 

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.480
you know it's what I thought so yeah
this is this is one of those things

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:44.490
this is this is one of those things
 

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.529
this is this is one of those things
that's really frustrating because when

00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539
that's really frustrating because when
 

00:22:45.539 --> 00:22:47.870
that's really frustrating because when
you see a game like this you know that

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880
you see a game like this you know that
 

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.370
you see a game like this you know that
what happens is they offered it some

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.380
what happens is they offered it some
 

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.649
what happens is they offered it some
random resolution that's probably you

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659
random resolution that's probably you
 

00:22:51.659 --> 00:22:53.539
random resolution that's probably you
know from a different platform known as

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:53.549
know from a different platform known as
 

00:22:53.549 --> 00:22:55.010
know from a different platform known as
well this is this was this was an end

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020
well this is this was this was an end
 

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.659
well this is this was this was an end
engine game some hand engine game yeah

00:22:56.659 --> 00:22:56.669
engine game some hand engine game yeah
 

00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:58.730
engine game some hand engine game yeah
yeah it's just it's just not well in

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740
yeah it's just it's just not well in
 

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.350
yeah it's just it's just not well in
that case there is no excuse whatsoever

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360
that case there is no excuse whatsoever
 

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.210
that case there is no excuse whatsoever
exactly the other now I want to talk

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220
exactly the other now I want to talk
 

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.860
exactly the other now I want to talk
about gameplay for just a second it's

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:06.870
about gameplay for just a second it's
 

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:07.940
about gameplay for just a second it's
sort of revisit what you were saying

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:07.950
sort of revisit what you were saying
 

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.789
sort of revisit what you were saying
about the trail right so I'm thinking to

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799
about the trail right so I'm thinking to
 

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:16.370
about the trail right so I'm thinking to
myself why is it that Alex Dan and I all

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380
myself why is it that Alex Dan and I all
 

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.799
myself why is it that Alex Dan and I all
had exactly the same experience which is

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:18.809
had exactly the same experience which is
 

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:20.450
had exactly the same experience which is
we were like pushing on that thing to

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460
we were like pushing on that thing to
 

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.649
we were like pushing on that thing to
try and get it up the hill

00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659
try and get it up the hill
 

00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:24.169
try and get it up the hill
mm-hm and I think a lot of it is because

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179
mm-hm and I think a lot of it is because
 

00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:28.399
mm-hm and I think a lot of it is because
all of the feedback is when you tap on

00:23:28.399 --> 00:23:28.409
all of the feedback is when you tap on
 

00:23:28.409 --> 00:23:30.049
all of the feedback is when you tap on
this thing sparks shoot it's out its

00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059
this thing sparks shoot it's out its
 

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:32.870
this thing sparks shoot it's out its
hind end and that's that to me that says

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880
hind end and that's that to me that says
 

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.289
hind end and that's that to me that says
go faster other games have dealt with

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299
go faster other games have dealt with
 

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:38.659
go faster other games have dealt with
this differently like you know we looked

00:23:38.659 --> 00:23:38.669
this differently like you know we looked
 

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:41.000
this differently like you know we looked
at the monster truck game last week and

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.010
at the monster truck game last week and
 

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.610
at the monster truck game last week and
it's controls were more centered around

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620
it's controls were more centered around
 

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.590
it's controls were more centered around
tilting forward and back and maybe

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600
tilting forward and back and maybe
 

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.779
tilting forward and back and maybe
having the car you know tilt forward and

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:47.789
having the car you know tilt forward and
 

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:49.399
having the car you know tilt forward and
back or something would would make more

00:23:49.399 --> 00:23:49.409
back or something would would make more
 

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:51.049
back or something would would make more
sense like oh oh if I'm tilting into the

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059
sense like oh oh if I'm tilting into the
 

00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:52.730
sense like oh oh if I'm tilting into the
hill it's gonna be slower I don't know I

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740
hill it's gonna be slower I don't know I
 

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.889
hill it's gonna be slower I don't know I
think we were all subscribing to the

00:23:54.889 --> 00:23:54.899
think we were all subscribing to the
 

00:23:54.899 --> 00:23:57.350
think we were all subscribing to the
mental model of pushing down and plies

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360
mental model of pushing down and plies
 

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.139
mental model of pushing down and plies
pushing down on gas right and what it

00:24:00.139 --> 00:24:00.149
pushing down on gas right and what it
 

00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:02.750
pushing down on gas right and what it
actually was was pushing down exerts

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760
actually was was pushing down exerts
 

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.610
actually was was pushing down exerts
some sort of force of gravity on the car

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620
some sort of force of gravity on the car
 

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.769
some sort of force of gravity on the car
you can especially tell if the cars in

00:24:06.769 --> 00:24:06.779
you can especially tell if the cars in
 

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:08.480
you can especially tell if the cars in
midair and he pushed down on the screen

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:08.490
midair and he pushed down on the screen
 

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.669
midair and he pushed down on the screen
and the cart like starts dropping even

00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679
and the cart like starts dropping even
 

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:12.919
and the cart like starts dropping even
though it's in midair so that's some

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:12.929
though it's in midair so that's some
 

00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:14.450
though it's in midair so that's some
sort of gravitational constant thing

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460
sort of gravitational constant thing
 

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.510
sort of gravitational constant thing
which is not especially intuitive right

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520
which is not especially intuitive right
 

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.310
which is not especially intuitive right
and it's for interesting gameplay

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320
and it's for interesting gameplay
 

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.930
and it's for interesting gameplay
mechanic once you understand it see

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940
mechanic once you understand it see
 

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.760
mechanic once you understand it see
that's the thing I think the mechanic is

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:22.770
that's the thing I think the mechanic is
 

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.370
that's the thing I think the mechanic is
fine I think the the issue is since it

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380
fine I think the the issue is since it
 

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.049
fine I think the the issue is since it
is non-intuitive

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059
is non-intuitive
 

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:30.350
is non-intuitive
you have to give your players a little

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360
you have to give your players a little
 

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.360
you have to give your players a little
bit more in in the way of hints or

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:34.370
bit more in in the way of hints or
 

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.950
bit more in in the way of hints or
explanations you know maybe if it's a

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960
explanations you know maybe if it's a
 

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.360
explanations you know maybe if it's a
gravitational constant why not put a

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.370
gravitational constant why not put a
 

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.430
gravitational constant why not put a
rocket on the car that pointing into the

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440
rocket on the car that pointing into the
 

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.989
rocket on the car that pointing into the
air and fire that thing every time you

00:24:41.989 --> 00:24:41.999
air and fire that thing every time you
 

00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:44.119
air and fire that thing every time you
push down I mean something that will

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:44.129
push down I mean something that will
 

00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:48.680
push down I mean something that will
make it obvious that I'm getting a you

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:48.690
make it obvious that I'm getting a you
 

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.259
make it obvious that I'm getting a you
know a g-force out of this thing rather

00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:51.269
know a g-force out of this thing rather
 

00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:54.080
know a g-force out of this thing rather
than a rotational force on the wheels

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.090
than a rotational force on the wheels
 

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.810
than a rotational force on the wheels
yeah I think I think even some indicator

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820
yeah I think I think even some indicator
 

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.519
yeah I think I think even some indicator
would be really useful to like you know

00:24:58.519 --> 00:24:58.529
would be really useful to like you know
 

00:24:58.529 --> 00:24:59.659
would be really useful to like you know
to kind of make it clear that what

00:24:59.659 --> 00:24:59.669
to kind of make it clear that what
 

00:24:59.669 --> 00:25:01.009
to kind of make it clear that what
you're doing is actually manipulating

00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:01.019
you're doing is actually manipulating
 

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:02.720
you're doing is actually manipulating
gravity because that is pretty close to

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:02.730
gravity because that is pretty close to
 

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.029
gravity because that is pretty close to
the closest thing I could see well

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039
the closest thing I could see well
 

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:05.960
the closest thing I could see well
especially when you think about other

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:05.970
especially when you think about other
 

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.369
especially when you think about other
games of this type you know for instance

00:25:07.369 --> 00:25:07.379
games of this type you know for instance
 

00:25:07.379 --> 00:25:08.810
games of this type you know for instance
one of the things that you want to do in

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820
one of the things that you want to do in
 

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.940
one of the things that you want to do in
a lot of games is let off the gas if

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:10.950
a lot of games is let off the gas if
 

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.820
a lot of games is let off the gas if
you're if you find yourself catching air

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:13.830
you're if you find yourself catching air
 

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.419
you're if you find yourself catching air
off a hill in this game it's exactly the

00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:17.429
off a hill in this game it's exactly the
 

00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:18.799
off a hill in this game it's exactly the
opposite if you're catching air off a

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:18.809
opposite if you're catching air off a
 

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:20.960
opposite if you're catching air off a
hill you want to tap so you can fall

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:20.970
hill you want to tap so you can fall
 

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.200
hill you want to tap so you can fall
back down to the to the hill I catch

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.210
back down to the to the hill I catch
 

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:28.159
back down to the to the hill I catch
those stars so it is a good mechanic hmm

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:28.169
those stars so it is a good mechanic hmm
 

00:25:28.169 --> 00:25:31.129
those stars so it is a good mechanic hmm
it is fun it's a fun game absolutely but

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:31.139
it is fun it's a fun game absolutely but
 

00:25:31.139 --> 00:25:33.830
it is fun it's a fun game absolutely but
it's frustrating to learn and I think it

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840
it's frustrating to learn and I think it
 

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.200
it's frustrating to learn and I think it
could be less frustrating if there were

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.210
could be less frustrating if there were
 

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.259
could be less frustrating if there were
a little bit more acknowledgment that

00:25:39.259 --> 00:25:39.269
a little bit more acknowledgment that
 

00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:41.539
a little bit more acknowledgment that
this is a non-intuitive mechanic it is

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:41.549
this is a non-intuitive mechanic it is
 

00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:43.399
this is a non-intuitive mechanic it is
yeah that's something in there to give

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:43.409
yeah that's something in there to give
 

00:25:43.409 --> 00:25:44.810
yeah that's something in there to give
you intuition about what's going on

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820
you intuition about what's going on
 

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.340
you intuition about what's going on
absolutely and the game is very hard I

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:46.350
absolutely and the game is very hard I
 

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.690
absolutely and the game is very hard I
will definitely say that you know like

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700
will definitely say that you know like
 

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.340
will definitely say that you know like
even just getting making progress to

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.350
even just getting making progress to
 

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.720
even just getting making progress to
levels is actually somewhat challenging

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:50.730
levels is actually somewhat challenging
 

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.960
levels is actually somewhat challenging
I would probably take a slight tone down

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:53.970
I would probably take a slight tone down
 

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.249
I would probably take a slight tone down
of the challenge to get through the

00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:55.259
of the challenge to get through the
 

00:25:55.259 --> 00:25:57.710
of the challenge to get through the
level and really focus people on getting

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720
level and really focus people on getting
 

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.409
level and really focus people on getting
all of the stars

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419
all of the stars
 

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:02.419
all of the stars
right because and getting the candies

00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:02.429
right because and getting the candies
 

00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:03.950
right because and getting the candies
because that that I think that's

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960
because that that I think that's
 

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.629
because that that I think that's
actually one of the secrets to Angry

00:26:05.629 --> 00:26:05.639
actually one of the secrets to Angry
 

00:26:05.639 --> 00:26:06.859
actually one of the secrets to Angry
Birds success is it's actually

00:26:06.859 --> 00:26:06.869
Birds success is it's actually
 

00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:08.419
Birds success is it's actually
relatively easy to make it through a lot

00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:08.429
relatively easy to make it through a lot
 

00:26:08.429 --> 00:26:10.310
relatively easy to make it through a lot
of the levels you don't get stuck very

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320
of the levels you don't get stuck very
 

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.989
of the levels you don't get stuck very
often but then you know then there is

00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:11.999
often but then you know then there is
 

00:26:11.999 --> 00:26:13.279
often but then you know then there is
that extra challenge for the more

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:13.289
that extra challenge for the more

hardcore gamer of actually going through
and trying to gold star really didn't

00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:17.879
and trying to gold star really didn't
 

00:26:17.879 --> 00:26:19.460
and trying to gold star really didn't
notice this the first time through but

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.470
notice this the first time through but
 

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.769
notice this the first time through but

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.380
games is it feels like a slots game will
 

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.800
games is it feels like a slots game will
build an engine and then just reskin it

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:18.810
build an engine and then just reskin it
 

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.530
build an engine and then just reskin it
over and over and over again

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:21.540
over and over and over again
 

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.670

whereas in a real casino of course you
get some of that certainly there's a ton

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:27.450
get some of that certainly there's a ton
 

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:28.760

and they do try to at least design
things differently if it's the exact

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:41.490
things differently if it's the exact
 

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.170

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.270
thinking
phones and this asics transformer prime

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:55.280
phones and this asics transformer prime
 

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.450
phones and this asics transformer prime
is now the low end of tablet resolution

00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:58.460
is now the low end of tablet resolution
 

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.250
is now the low end of tablet resolution
there's very few tablets that have a

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:00.260
there's very few tablets that have a
 

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.000
there's very few tablets that have a
lower resolution than this so if you

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.010
lower resolution than this so if you
 

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.990
lower resolution than this so if you
can't do a 720p set of artwork you may

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000
can't do a 720p set of artwork you may
 

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.700
can't do a 720p set of artwork you may
just want to skip Todd tablets all

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:09.710
just want to skip Todd tablets all
 

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.620
just want to skip Todd tablets all
together I mean I actually you know it's

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:11.630
together I mean I actually you know it's
 

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.610
together I mean I actually you know it's
funny because it depends on the game

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:12.620
funny because it depends on the game
 

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.289
funny because it depends on the game
like this game actually looks looks much

00:33:14.289 --> 00:33:14.299
like this game actually looks looks much
 

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:15.279
like this game actually looks looks much
better

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:15.289
better
 

00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:17.169
better
and again it's making use of more it's

00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:17.179
and again it's making use of more it's
 

00:33:17.179 --> 00:33:19.480
and again it's making use of more it's
making use of more fonts and let and it

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:19.490
making use of more fonts and let and it
 

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.950
making use of more fonts and let and it
doesn't have text that's we rendered

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960
doesn't have text that's we rendered
 

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.450
doesn't have text that's we rendered
outside of fonts other than I think this

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:22.460
outside of fonts other than I think this
 

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.700
outside of fonts other than I think this
gem bonus one over here and you know it

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:24.710
gem bonus one over here and you know it
 

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.899
gem bonus one over here and you know it
makes it makes it makes a really big

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:25.909
makes it makes it makes a really big
 

00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:28.240
makes it makes it makes a really big
difference you know the game feels much

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:28.250
difference you know the game feels much
 

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.279
difference you know the game feels much
more like it's actually designed for

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:30.289
more like it's actually designed for
 

00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:31.539
more like it's actually designed for
this resolution so you know whatever

00:33:31.539 --> 00:33:31.549
this resolution so you know whatever
 

00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:33.909
this resolution so you know whatever
whenever possible use outline font I

00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919
whenever possible use outline font I
 

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:36.180
whenever possible use outline font I
think that's just basically become the

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:36.190
think that's just basically become the
 

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.620
think that's just basically become the
that's basically become the this kind of

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:38.630
that's basically become the this kind of
 

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.990
that's basically become the this kind of
gold standard here so it looks like you

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000
gold standard here so it looks like you
 

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.340
gold standard here so it looks like you
know again what I'm excited which I

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:42.350
know again what I'm excited which I
 

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.080
know again what I'm excited which I
haven't gotten to in this in a lot of

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.090
haven't gotten to in this in a lot of
 

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.899
haven't gotten to in this in a lot of
these games is actually getting to the

00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:45.909
these games is actually getting to the
 

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:49.659
these games is actually getting to the
is getting to the bonus round you see I

00:33:49.659 --> 00:33:49.669
is getting to the bonus round you see I
 

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:51.370
is getting to the bonus round you see I
have to disagree really I think the

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:51.380
have to disagree really I think the
 

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.799
have to disagree really I think the
those outline fonts over the top of

00:33:53.799 --> 00:33:53.809
those outline fonts over the top of
 

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:56.380
those outline fonts over the top of
those oysters look terrible I think that

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:56.390
those oysters look terrible I think that
 

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:59.529
those oysters look terrible I think that
I mean they're they're legible for some

00:33:59.529 --> 00:33:59.539
I mean they're they're legible for some
 

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:01.210
I mean they're they're legible for some
definition of legible but they just look

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:01.220
definition of legible but they just look
 

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.590
definition of legible but they just look
pasted on I mean they don't look like

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600
pasted on I mean they don't look like
 

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.940
pasted on I mean they don't look like
they're part of the art oh no I know

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:03.950
they're part of the art oh no I know
 

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.560
they're part of the art oh no I know
that I didn't say the art design is

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:05.570
that I didn't say the art design is
 

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.750
that I didn't say the art design is
actually is actually good for that I

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760
actually is actually good for that I
 

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.040
actually is actually good for that I
mean that that's you still have to

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:09.050
mean that that's you still have to
 

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.419
mean that that's you still have to
design around the factory of outline

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:10.429
design around the factory of outline
 

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:12.250
design around the factory of outline
fonts there right you know I think

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:12.260
fonts there right you know I think
 

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.859
fonts there right you know I think
that's I would totally agree with you in

00:34:14.859 --> 00:34:14.869
that's I would totally agree with you in
 

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:16.330
that's I would totally agree with you in
you know in that sense but at least I'm

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:16.340
you know in that sense but at least I'm
 

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.250
you know in that sense but at least I'm
not like my I'm not squinting trying to

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:18.260
not like my I'm not squinting trying to
 

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.899
not like my I'm not squinting trying to
see them and my eyes are not drawn to

00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:19.909
see them and my eyes are not drawn to
 

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:21.490
see them and my eyes are not drawn to
them trying to focus on them which is so

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:21.500
them trying to focus on them which is so
 

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.220
them trying to focus on them which is so
key you know what what I've seen done

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:24.230
key you know what what I've seen done
 

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.810
key you know what what I've seen done
that would actually be really effective

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:25.820
that would actually be really effective
 

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.629
that would actually be really effective
in a game like this is do all of your

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639
in a game like this is do all of your
 

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.330
in a game like this is do all of your
graphics in something like SVG yeah

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:31.340
graphics in something like SVG yeah
 

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.340
graphics in something like SVG yeah
there's some good free FCT renders work

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:33.350
there's some good free FCT renders work
 

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.280
there's some good free FCT renders work
great on on Android you remember bouncy

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.290
great on on Android you remember bouncy
 

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.129
great on on Android you remember bouncy
Mouse did that absolutely well yeah and

00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:39.139
Mouse did that absolutely well yeah and
 

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.409
Mouse did that absolutely well yeah and
it's actually the code that was used in

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:41.419
it's actually the code that was used in
 

00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:43.240
it's actually the code that was used in
the side of Android affine actually

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:43.250
the side of Android affine actually
 

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.129
the side of Android affine actually
available and open source and it's it's

00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:45.139
available and open source and it's it's
 

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.070
available and open source and it's it's
a really nice SVG to Android canvas

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.080
a really nice SVG to Android canvas
 

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.169
a really nice SVG to Android canvas
renderer essentially yeah so you can

00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:50.179
renderer essentially yeah so you can
 

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.550
renderer essentially yeah so you can
take your illustrator files or whatever

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560
take your illustrator files or whatever
 

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.399
take your illustrator files or whatever
and import them instead of rasterizing

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:54.409
and import them instead of rasterizing
 

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:55.880
and import them instead of rasterizing
them and importing them as bitmap

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:55.890
them and importing them as bitmap
 

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:58.190
them and importing them as bitmap
you import them as SVG's which is

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200
you import them as SVG's which is
 

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.400
you import them as SVG's which is
usually a much smaller format and is

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:01.410
usually a much smaller format and is
 

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.260
usually a much smaller format and is
gonna render beautifully at almost any

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:03.270
gonna render beautifully at almost any
 

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.420
gonna render beautifully at almost any
resolution and especially as screens get

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:05.430
resolution and especially as screens get
 

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.790
resolution and especially as screens get
denser that becomes very very important

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800
denser that becomes very very important
 

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.200
denser that becomes very very important
yeah I know it's it gets a great way of

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.210
yeah I know it's it gets a great way of
 

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:10.670
yeah I know it's it gets a great way of
keeping the game size small you have to

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680
keeping the game size small you have to
 

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.020
keeping the game size small you have to
be careful obviously because it's very

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:12.030
be careful obviously because it's very
 

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.150
be careful obviously because it's very
very easy to create really really large

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160
very easy to create really really large
 

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.210
very easy to create really really large
SVG files to you know if you use certain

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220
SVG files to you know if you use certain
 

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.700
SVG files to you know if you use certain
effects like as you start using lots of

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:19.710
effects like as you start using lots of
 

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.350
effects like as you start using lots of
gradients you're like no don't you don't

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:21.360
gradients you're like no don't you don't
 

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.060
gradients you're like no don't you don't
put the gradients in your SVG files

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:23.070
put the gradients in your SVG files
 

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.530
put the gradients in your SVG files
actually render those separately because

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540
actually render those separately because
 

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.530
actually render those separately because
it's a lot of SVG exporters will just

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540
it's a lot of SVG exporters will just
 

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.990
it's a lot of SVG exporters will just
you know throwing tons and tons and tons

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000
you know throwing tons and tons and tons
 

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.820
you know throwing tons and tons and tons
of geometry into the SVG well like

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:31.830
of geometry into the SVG well like
 

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.410
of geometry into the SVG well like
everything else there's no magic bullet

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420
everything else there's no magic bullet
 

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.480
everything else there's no magic bullet
but I think this could really benefit

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.490
but I think this could really benefit
 

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.280
but I think this could really benefit
from being vector eyes especially since

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:37.290
from being vector eyes especially since
 

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.720
from being vector eyes especially since
you know it's the sort of thing you draw

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:38.730
you know it's the sort of thing you draw
 

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.670
you know it's the sort of thing you draw
it once and then you're done you know

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680
it once and then you're done you know
 

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.100
it once and then you're done you know
you can you could rasterize for this

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.110
you can you could rasterize for this
 

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.990
you can you could rasterize for this
particular resolution and then cache it

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000
particular resolution and then cache it
 

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.690
particular resolution and then cache it
if you wanted to so it's not like you're

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:46.700
if you wanted to so it's not like you're
 

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.940
if you wanted to so it's not like you're
spending a huge amount of cpu to make it

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:49.950
spending a huge amount of cpu to make it
 

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.400
spending a huge amount of cpu to make it
look nice now you know other things

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:52.410
look nice now you know other things
 

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.870
look nice now you know other things
interesting about this it actually has

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880
interesting about this it actually has
 

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.880
interesting about this it actually has
the swipe mechanic there which is kind

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:55.890
the swipe mechanic there which is kind
 

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.590
the swipe mechanic there which is kind
of nice very obvious yeah I like these

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:57.600
of nice very obvious yeah I like these
 

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.570
of nice very obvious yeah I like these
screens they look good they're you know

point is it has nothing to do with the
actual game which is more of a

so one thing you do have to hold it in

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:25.970
so one thing you do have to hold it in
 

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.790
so one thing you do have to hold it in
the correct orientation when you start

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800
the correct orientation when you start
 

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.990
the correct orientation when you start
because that's when it calibrates itself

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000
because that's when it calibrates itself
 

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.390
because that's when it calibrates itself
oh yeah if you don't get calibrated

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400
oh yeah if you don't get calibrated
 

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.220
oh yeah if you don't get calibrated
you're screwed yeah so that's why really

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:33.230
you're screwed yeah so that's why really
 

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.930
you're screwed yeah so that's why really
that's how you calibrated you like that

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:34.940
that's how you calibrated you like that
 

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.020
that's how you calibrated you like that
calibration I know I think actually it's

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:38.030
calibration I know I think actually it's
 

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.980
calibration I know I think actually it's
one of those things where it's probably

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:38.990
one of those things where it's probably
 

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:40.930
one of those things where it's probably
better to tell you that by the way

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:40.940
better to tell you that by the way
 

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.610
better to tell you that by the way
really make sure to hold it in the right

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:42.620
really make sure to hold it in the right
 

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.920
really make sure to hold it in the right
orientation now otherwise you are going

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:44.930
orientation now otherwise you are going
 

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:46.750
orientation now otherwise you are going
to find that it's not going to be

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760
to find that it's not going to be
 

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.460
to find that it's not going to be
calibrated this is one of those things

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:48.470
calibrated this is one of those things

where a little bit of AIA might go a
long way just trying to understand

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:52.850
long way just trying to understand
 

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:54.550

exactly what the players trying to do

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560
exactly what the players trying to do

exactly what the players trying to do
because you know in general the range of

00:41:59.350 --> 00:41:59.360
because you know in general the range of
 

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.510
because you know in general the range of
a tilt sensor for that's useful for game

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520
a tilt sensor for that's useful for game
 

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.220
a tilt sensor for that's useful for game
play is going to be much smaller than

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.230
play is going to be much smaller than
 

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.850
play is going to be much smaller than
the actual range of the sensor so if you

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:06.860
the actual range of the sensor so if you
 

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.640
the actual range of the sensor so if you
start seeing that the user is going off

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:09.650
start seeing that the user is going off
 

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.190
start seeing that the user is going off

game will do is to sort of adjust it so

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:15.020
game will do is to sort of adjust it so

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.590
and I think it's not real happy about
the kind of jerky resizing that happens

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:29.600
the kind of jerky resizing that happens
 

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.080
the kind of jerky resizing that happens
when you when you actually are have the

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:32.090
when you when you actually are have the
 

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.520
when you when you actually are have the
HD actually play then you're

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:33.530
HD actually play then you're
 

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.020
HD actually play then you're
accidentally taking it out do you want

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:35.030
accidentally taking it out do you want
 

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.780
accidentally taking it out do you want
to put it on my Nexus 7 and and but the

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:37.790
to put it on my Nexus 7 and and but the
 

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.850
to put it on my Nexus 7 and and but the
yeah we might get on camera let's let's

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:39.860
yeah we might get on camera let's let's
 

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.290
yeah we might get on camera let's let's
try this one more time to see if I can

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:41.300
try this one more time to see if I can
 

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.610
try this one more time to see if I can
actually get through so one thing that's

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:42.620
actually get through so one thing that's
 

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.900
actually get through so one thing that's
really great about this game is actually

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:43.910
really great about this game is actually
 

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.990
really great about this game is actually
the the accelerometer controls are

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000
the the accelerometer controls are
 

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.760
the the accelerometer controls are
really precise they do what you want it

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:48.770
really precise they do what you want it
 

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:53.380
really precise they do what you want it
to do like honestly it it actually feels

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:53.390
to do like honestly it it actually feels
 

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.060
to do like honestly it it actually feels
really really good and that's I think

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:55.070
really really good and that's I think
 

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.710
really really good and that's I think
the most important thing in this kind of

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720
the most important thing in this kind of
 

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.790
the most important thing in this kind of
a game is if you're going to use

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800
a game is if you're going to use
 

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.160
a game is if you're going to use
accelerometer controls and you know I am

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.170
accelerometer controls and you know I am
 

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.780
accelerometer controls and you know I am
not always a fan of accelerometer

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:01.790
not always a fan of accelerometer
 

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.340
not always a fan of accelerometer
controls

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:02.350
controls
 

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:03.840
controls
be the first one to say that it is

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:03.850
be the first one to say that it is
 

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:05.610
be the first one to say that it is
actually messed up quite a lot of really

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:05.620
actually messed up quite a lot of really
 

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.300
actually messed up quite a lot of really
good games but but in this game you know

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:09.310
good games but but in this game you know
 

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.710
good games but but in this game you know
the game is it's entirely designed

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720
the game is it's entirely designed
 

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.620
the game is it's entirely designed
around it which is why it works yeah if

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:13.630
around it which is why it works yeah if
 

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.900
around it which is why it works yeah if
you're using the new API is that we

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:15.910
you're using the new API is that we
 

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:19.140
you're using the new API is that we
shipped in what was it ICS then you can

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.150
shipped in what was it ICS then you can
 

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.630
shipped in what was it ICS then you can
get really really incredibly good

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640
get really really incredibly good
 

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.730
get really really incredibly good
accelerometer if you don't use the new

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:23.740
accelerometer if you don't use the new
 

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.710
accelerometer if you don't use the new
api's or if you're on an older device

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720
api's or if you're on an older device
 

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.900
api's or if you're on an older device
then the accelerometer is a little bit

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:27.910
then the accelerometer is a little bit
 

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.490
then the accelerometer is a little bit
flaky and one things I love about the

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:29.500
flaky and one things I love about the
 

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.630
flaky and one things I love about the
game playing this is that you actually

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640
game playing this is that you actually
 

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.660
game playing this is that you actually
have to as you see go and in order to

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:33.670
have to as you see go and in order to
 

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.310
have to as you see go and in order to
open doors you actually have to go over

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:35.320
open doors you actually have to go over
 

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.000
open doors you actually have to go over
certain areas and it gives you're you

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:39.010
certain areas and it gives you're you
 

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.520
certain areas and it gives you're you
know a character of this kind of red or

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:41.530
know a character of this kind of red or
 

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.590
know a character of this kind of red or
green a forcefield so I've got this red

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:43.600
green a forcefield so I've got this red
 

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.150
green a forcefield so I've got this red
force field another red force field

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160
force field another red force field
 

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.860
force field another red force field
allows me to get through that wall etc

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:46.870
allows me to get through that wall etc
 

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.190
allows me to get through that wall etc
and so forth so there's a lot of really

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200
and so forth so there's a lot of really
 

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.450
and so forth so there's a lot of really
good elements here in the gameplay that

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:51.460
good elements here in the gameplay that
 

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.200
good elements here in the gameplay that
you know I I really enjoyed yeah it is

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.210
you know I I really enjoyed yeah it is
 

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.850
you know I I really enjoyed yeah it is
cool I mean it can you fall off the edge

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:56.860
cool I mean it can you fall off the edge
 

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.980
cool I mean it can you fall off the edge
there by the way okay yeah so it's kind

00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:58.990
there by the way okay yeah so it's kind
 

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:00.960
there by the way okay yeah so it's kind
of got that that marble madness thing

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:00.970
of got that that marble madness thing
 

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.300
of got that that marble madness thing
going on yeah no no it's a really nice

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:03.310
going on yeah no no it's a really nice
 

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.040
going on yeah no no it's a really nice
design for an accelerometer based game

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:05.050
design for an accelerometer based game
 

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.570
design for an accelerometer based game
you know I love to see people who are

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:06.580
you know I love to see people who are
 

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.520
you know I love to see people who are
you're doing an accelerometer based game

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:08.530
you're doing an accelerometer based game
 

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:09.870
you're doing an accelerometer based game
actually going and saying no we're gonna

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880
actually going and saying no we're gonna
 

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.280
actually going and saying no we're gonna
design around this input method and

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:11.290
design around this input method and
 

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:13.320
design around this input method and
really try to do something cool that's

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:13.330
really try to do something cool that's
 

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.790
really try to do something cool that's
always you know that's always better

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800
always you know that's always better
 

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.870
always you know that's always better
than to kind of throw it into an

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880
than to kind of throw it into an
 

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.940
than to kind of throw it into an
existing game design and and so you know

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:20.950
existing game design and and so you know
 

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.190
existing game design and and so you know
I you know thumbs up to the designers oh

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200
I you know thumbs up to the designers oh
 

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.650
I you know thumbs up to the designers oh
yeah look at that I just died I filled

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:25.660
yeah look at that I just died I filled
 

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:30.120
yeah look at that I just died I filled
this down I'm about to die but you're

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:30.130
this down I'm about to die but you're
 

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.430
this down I'm about to die but you're
right it is a fun game there's a few a

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440
right it is a fun game there's a few a
 

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.060
right it is a fun game there's a few a
few of the sprites seem a little low res

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.070
few of the sprites seem a little low res
 

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.770
few of the sprites seem a little low res
but that could just be the angle and

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:37.780
but that could just be the angle and
 

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.300
but that could just be the angle and
holding no no it's definitely it's

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:39.310
holding no no it's definitely it's
 

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.490
holding no no it's definitely it's
definitely some some some some minor

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:41.500
definitely some some some some minor
 

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.260
definitely some some some some minor
resolution issues it's you know it looks

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:43.270
resolution issues it's you know it looks
 

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.900
resolution issues it's you know it looks
like it's one resolution step below we

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:45.910
like it's one resolution step below we
 

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:47.610
like it's one resolution step below we
have drone yeah and that's 2 7 or

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:47.620
have drone yeah and that's 2 7 or
 

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.350
have drone yeah and that's 2 7 or
transformer prime we have a youtube

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:49.360
transformer prime we have a youtube
 

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.890
transformer prime we have a youtube
question

you have been dedicated to reading
YouTube questions like a good producer

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:57.670
YouTube questions like a good producer
 

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.430
YouTube questions like a good producer
right Alex there haven't been any

00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440
right Alex there haven't been any
 

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.150
right Alex there haven't been any
comments in the past several minutes

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160
comments in the past several minutes
 

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.789
comments in the past several minutes
really but yeah I think our our time

00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:05.799
really but yeah I think our our time
 

00:45:05.799 --> 00:45:08.640
really but yeah I think our our time
switch has injured our viewership more

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:08.650
switch has injured our viewership more
 

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:10.529
switch has injured our viewership more
people are disquiet today it's possible

00:45:10.529 --> 00:45:10.539
people are disquiet today it's possible
 

00:45:10.539 --> 00:45:13.019
people are disquiet today it's possible
that the last actual question was about

00:45:13.019 --> 00:45:13.029
that the last actual question was about
 

00:45:13.029 --> 00:45:15.749
that the last actual question was about
the music from their agent shooter game

00:45:15.749 --> 00:45:15.759
the music from their agent shooter game
 

00:45:15.759 --> 00:45:21.180
the music from their agent shooter game
yeah Wow yeah like the only poem I have

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:21.190
yeah Wow yeah like the only poem I have
 

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.829
yeah Wow yeah like the only poem I have
with the UI for this game for the

00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839
with the UI for this game for the
 

00:45:22.839 --> 00:45:23.880
with the UI for this game for the
tilting thing I think in general

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:23.890
tilting thing I think in general
 

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.640
tilting thing I think in general
mechanic works really well the only

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:26.650
mechanic works really well the only
 

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.170
mechanic works really well the only
problem I have with it is you get to a

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:28.180
problem I have with it is you get to a
 

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.339
problem I have with it is you get to a
point where in order to go forward

00:45:29.339 --> 00:45:29.349
point where in order to go forward
 

00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:31.620
point where in order to go forward
you're tilting the screen away from you

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:31.630
you're tilting the screen away from you
 

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.599
you're tilting the screen away from you
and that makes actually seeing what

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:33.609
and that makes actually seeing what
 

00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:35.400
and that makes actually seeing what
you're doing difficult what you're doing

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:35.410
you're doing difficult what you're doing
 

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.170
you're doing difficult what you're doing
is like if it's like this you're not

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:37.180
is like if it's like this you're not
 

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.430
is like if it's like this you're not
going like this and you almost have to

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:38.440
going like this and you almost have to
 

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.789
going like this and you almost have to
sort of lean over and yeah I noticed

00:45:41.789 --> 00:45:41.799
sort of lean over and yeah I noticed
 

00:45:41.799 --> 00:45:43.019
sort of lean over and yeah I noticed
that and despite what Dan was saying

00:45:43.019 --> 00:45:43.029
that and despite what Dan was saying
 

00:45:43.029 --> 00:45:46.589
that and despite what Dan was saying
about calibration if I hold it like this

00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599
about calibration if I hold it like this
 

00:45:46.599 --> 00:45:48.630
about calibration if I hold it like this
while the levels starting it still wants

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640
while the levels starting it still wants
 

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.839
while the levels starting it still wants
to lie flat well I'm playing it that's

00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:51.849
to lie flat well I'm playing it that's
 

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:54.630
to lie flat well I'm playing it that's
not cool guys only not cool if there was

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640
not cool guys only not cool if there was
 

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.450
not cool guys only not cool if there was
just a way to or to have it calibrate

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:57.460
just a way to or to have it calibrate
 

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.549
just a way to or to have it calibrate
for holding it in front of you like a 45

00:45:59.549 --> 00:45:59.559
for holding it in front of you like a 45
 

00:45:59.559 --> 00:46:01.559
for holding it in front of you like a 45
degree angle or something like that so

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:01.569
degree angle or something like that so
 

00:46:01.569 --> 00:46:03.329
degree angle or something like that so
you tilt a little bit you can still see

00:46:03.329 --> 00:46:03.339
you tilt a little bit you can still see
 

00:46:03.339 --> 00:46:05.370
you tilt a little bit you can still see
perfectly what's going on or if I had a

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:05.380
perfectly what's going on or if I had a
 

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.769
perfectly what's going on or if I had a
specially built table with like Leonardo

00:46:07.769 --> 00:46:07.779
specially built table with like Leonardo
 

00:46:07.779 --> 00:46:10.170
specially built table with like Leonardo
da Vinci pulleys and stuff coming out

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:10.180
da Vinci pulleys and stuff coming out
 

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:14.700
da Vinci pulleys and stuff coming out
that I guess so yeah I want to say yeah

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:14.710
that I guess so yeah I want to say yeah
 

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.799
that I guess so yeah I want to say yeah
exactly Baron peripheral for this guy

00:46:16.799 --> 00:46:16.809
exactly Baron peripheral for this guy
 

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:21.450
exactly Baron peripheral for this guy
exactly right but as it stands yeah

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:21.460
exactly right but as it stands yeah
 

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.029
exactly right but as it stands yeah
control is good but could be a lot

00:46:24.029 --> 00:46:24.039
control is good but could be a lot
 

00:46:24.039 --> 00:46:27.539
control is good but could be a lot
better if you would just let it so

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:27.549
better if you would just let it so
 

00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:28.650
better if you would just let it so
here's how you actually do it that's a

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:28.660
here's how you actually do it that's a
 

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.269
here's how you actually do it that's a
game there's actually calibrate if you

00:46:30.269 --> 00:46:30.279
game there's actually calibrate if you
 

00:46:30.279 --> 00:46:33.089
game there's actually calibrate if you
can calibrate right in here oh you can

00:46:33.089 --> 00:46:33.099
can calibrate right in here oh you can
 

00:46:33.099 --> 00:46:34.259
can calibrate right in here oh you can
actually calibrate them during the games

00:46:34.259 --> 00:46:34.269
actually calibrate them during the games
 

00:46:34.269 --> 00:46:35.880
actually calibrate them during the games
this is my I hadn't noticed because it's

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:35.890
this is my I hadn't noticed because it's
 

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.440
this is my I hadn't noticed because it's
kind of hidden in it but if you actually

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:37.450
kind of hidden in it but if you actually
 

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:39.029
kind of hidden in it but if you actually
you can actually recalibrate game by

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:39.039
you can actually recalibrate game by
 

00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:40.979
you can actually recalibrate game by
pressing the screen with two fingers so

00:46:40.979 --> 00:46:40.989
pressing the screen with two fingers so
 

00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:42.269
pressing the screen with two fingers so
there we are oh it's calibrated here

00:46:42.269 --> 00:46:42.279
there we are oh it's calibrated here
 

00:46:42.279 --> 00:46:43.650
there we are oh it's calibrated here
let's see how much more playable it is

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:43.660
let's see how much more playable it is
 

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.839
let's see how much more playable it is
so you know again it may just be a

00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:45.849
so you know again it may just be a
 

00:46:45.849 --> 00:46:47.549
so you know again it may just be a
question of just being able to find this

00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559
question of just being able to find this
 

00:46:47.559 --> 00:46:48.900
question of just being able to find this
because obviously needed none of us

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:48.910
because obviously needed none of us
 

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.690
because obviously needed none of us
found it well that's interesting because

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:51.700
found it well that's interesting because
 

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.509
found it well that's interesting because
it does work a lot better but is also a

00:46:54.509 --> 00:46:54.519
it does work a lot better but is also a
 

00:46:54.519 --> 00:46:56.729
it does work a lot better but is also a
lot more jerky for some reason really

00:46:56.729 --> 00:46:56.739
lot more jerky for some reason really
 

00:46:56.739 --> 00:46:57.620
lot more jerky for some reason really
yeah

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:57.630
yeah
 

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:01.509
yeah
understand that hmm

00:47:01.509 --> 00:47:01.519
understand that hmm
 

00:47:01.519 --> 00:47:04.999
understand that hmm
yeah well okay it does help them it's

00:47:04.999 --> 00:47:05.009
yeah well okay it does help them it's
 

00:47:05.009 --> 00:47:06.410
yeah well okay it does help them it's
good that it's possible to recalibrate

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420
good that it's possible to recalibrate
 

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.620
good that it's possible to recalibrate
but I would seriously consider just

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:09.630
but I would seriously consider just
 

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.140
but I would seriously consider just
switching your default over to someone

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:12.150
switching your default over to someone
 

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.519
switching your default over to someone
holding it in front of you either

00:47:13.519 --> 00:47:13.529
holding it in front of you either
 

00:47:13.529 --> 00:47:17.809
holding it in front of you either
vertically or 45 degrees yeah well it is

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819
vertically or 45 degrees yeah well it is
 

00:47:17.819 --> 00:47:19.309
vertically or 45 degrees yeah well it is
tricky like you don't like honestly

00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319
tricky like you don't like honestly
 

00:47:19.319 --> 00:47:20.990
tricky like you don't like honestly
because of the design of the game of you

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000
because of the design of the game of you
 

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.509
because of the design of the game of you
you calibrate it too far up it also

00:47:23.509 --> 00:47:23.519
you calibrate it too far up it also
 

00:47:23.519 --> 00:47:26.170
you calibrate it too far up it also
becomes really hard to play well so

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:26.180
becomes really hard to play well so
 

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.339
becomes really hard to play well so
since it's obviously very quick to

00:47:28.339 --> 00:47:28.349
since it's obviously very quick to
 

00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:30.640
since it's obviously very quick to
calibrate it what I don't understand is

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:30.650
calibrate it what I don't understand is
 

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:35.930
calibrate it what I don't understand is
why why wouldn't I just calibrate it

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940
why why wouldn't I just calibrate it
 

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.450
why why wouldn't I just calibrate it
every time I every time I start

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460
every time I every time I start
 

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.819
every time I every time I start
alright so forgive it you know give it a

00:47:40.819 --> 00:47:40.829
alright so forgive it you know give it a
 

00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:42.380
alright so forgive it you know give it a
little countdown you know you got three

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:42.390
little countdown you know you got three
 

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.420
little countdown you know you got three
seconds and then you're gonna go and the

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:44.430
seconds and then you're gonna go and the
 

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.220
seconds and then you're gonna go and the
average player is gonna put it into the

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:46.230
average player is gonna put it into the
 

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.690
average player is gonna put it into the
position where they don't want it to

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700
position where they don't want it to
 

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.519
position where they don't want it to
move and the last thing you want to do

00:47:49.519 --> 00:47:49.529
move and the last thing you want to do
 

00:47:49.529 --> 00:47:51.289
move and the last thing you want to do
is have your ball start to move when you

00:47:51.289 --> 00:47:51.299
is have your ball start to move when you
 

00:47:51.299 --> 00:47:55.099
is have your ball start to move when you
start it so I don't know maybe that's

00:47:55.099 --> 00:47:55.109
start it so I don't know maybe that's
 

00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.730
start it so I don't know maybe that's
just me

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740
just me
 

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.039
just me
but yeah this this accelerometer is not

00:47:58.039 --> 00:47:58.049
but yeah this this accelerometer is not
 

00:47:58.049 --> 00:48:00.710
but yeah this this accelerometer is not
nearly as you know my goodness it's no

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720
nearly as you know my goodness it's no
 

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.690
nearly as you know my goodness it's no
it's it's almost unplayable when I

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700
it's it's almost unplayable when I
 

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.870
it's it's almost unplayable when I
calibrate it to a 45 degree angle yeah

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880
calibrate it to a 45 degree angle yeah
 

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.880
calibrate it to a 45 degree angle yeah
it is it really but I don't understand

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:07.890
it is it really but I don't understand
 

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.670
it is it really but I don't understand
why I'm not sure either yeah that would

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680
why I'm not sure either yeah that would
 

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.299
why I'm not sure either yeah that would
be really interesting to find out so any

00:48:14.299 --> 00:48:14.309
be really interesting to find out so any
 

00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:16.039
be really interesting to find out so any
case you know we really like Dark Nebula

00:48:16.039 --> 00:48:16.049
case you know we really like Dark Nebula
 

00:48:16.049 --> 00:48:18.069
case you know we really like Dark Nebula
I think it's you know it's a game that

00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079
I think it's you know it's a game that
 

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:21.170
I think it's you know it's a game that
that you know that we all enjoyed

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180
that you know that we all enjoyed
 

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.789
that you know that we all enjoyed
playing and you know I think it's a

00:48:22.789 --> 00:48:22.799
playing and you know I think it's a
 

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.109
playing and you know I think it's a
little hard to play when you have it

00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119
little hard to play when you have it
 

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:26.420
little hard to play when you have it
plugged in HD mine trying desperately to

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:26.430
plugged in HD mine trying desperately to
 

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.190
plugged in HD mine trying desperately to
keep the HDMI from from getting pulled

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200
keep the HDMI from from getting pulled
 

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.650
keep the HDMI from from getting pulled
out but right so if you have that

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660
out but right so if you have that
 

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.120
out but right so if you have that
problem you might want to steer clear

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:32.130
problem you might want to steer clear
 

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:35.690
problem you might want to steer clear
this one but other than that but you

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700
this one but other than that but you
 

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.740
this one but other than that but you
know it's certainly a really thoroughly

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:36.750
know it's certainly a really thoroughly
 

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.329
know it's certainly a really thoroughly
well-constructed game and I you know I

00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339
well-constructed game and I you know I
 

00:48:38.339 --> 00:48:39.740
well-constructed game and I you know I
honestly it is I'm looking forward to

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:39.750
honestly it is I'm looking forward to
 

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:40.849
honestly it is I'm looking forward to
going through and getting higher and

00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859
going through and getting higher and
 

00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:42.859
going through and getting higher and
higher in level in the game it is a

00:48:42.859 --> 00:48:42.869
higher in level in the game it is a
 

00:48:42.869 --> 00:48:44.720
higher in level in the game it is a
really fun game and love it well you

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:44.730
really fun game and love it well you
 

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:46.789
really fun game and love it well you

know I and this is this I bought this
game so I know personally so nice isn't

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920
game so I know personally so nice isn't
 

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.680
game so I know personally so nice isn't
that because we made you it's true but I

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:51.690
