phenomen actively working on the
 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.219
phenomen actively working on the
hydrogen bomb and then it was

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229

so science was incredibly relevant and
 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.740
so science was incredibly relevant and
in some sense know also at that time in

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
in some sense know also at that time in
 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.379

very beginning for Norman so many other
 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.079

so this was a very good sir post diction

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750
so this was a very good sir post diction
 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.129
so this was a very good sir post diction
the post diction but then there's this

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139
the post diction but then there's this
 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.990

discovery of the magnetic field and is
 

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:15.519
discovery of the magnetic field and is
beautiful because his whole work worlds

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:15.529
beautiful because his whole work worlds
 

00:16:15.529 --> 00:16:19.299
beautiful because his whole work worlds
and work is about fields etc but it's
