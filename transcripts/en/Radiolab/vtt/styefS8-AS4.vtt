1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.650
Hey, how are we? Are we rolling Jamie? We are rolling. Check.

2
00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:07.840
Can you say a how's your water? And my water is refreshing. It's

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.551
delicious.

4
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:14.390
We like to go a little bit heavy on the minerals here in public radio. Hey,

5
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.350
I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab and today you'll talk to him about

6
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.530
football. Yes sir. The second half. And uh,

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.900
you knew in the first half we talked about, um, where football came from.

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.760
Now we want to look at where it's going,

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.740
which seems to be the big conversation these days.

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.220
And as we were thinking about that, uh,

11
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.820
we ended up talking with one of our favorite sports writers. Uh,

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.180
Chuck Klosterman, I'm a writer and a journalist in Brooklyn.

13
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.880
You may know him from his emphasis column in the New York Times.

14
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:39.830
He also writes about sports for Grantland.

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.280
And he recently wrote an essay about football and it's inherent contradictions

16
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.940
and it,

17
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.940
we called for us this sort of Carlisle versus ivy free flow versus traditional

18
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:56.510
sort of thing, but in a newer sort of modern way. [inaudible] can I ask you,

19
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:58.820
so your a, I want you to explain this statement.

20
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:01.140
This is the thing I found most interesting about your essay. Um,

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.980
you say basically that by portraying itself as a super conservative,

22
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:10.760
traditional manly sport, but essentially operating is the opposite.

23
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.860
Like this really liberal wide open,

24
00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:17.300
anything goes kind of sport football became the most successful enterprise in

25
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.120
American sports history. So you have this,

26
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.620
the sense that it's pretending to be one thing but actually another,

27
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.070
what do you mean? Well,

28
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.021
<v 1>okay. It's,</v>

29
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:28.000
it's a unique thing in the sense that if you look in a sport like soccer or

30
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.860
baseball, there is a real uh,

31
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.720
sense from the people who sort of, you know, uh,

32
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.460
the institution of the sport to keep the sport the same,

33
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.950
that they want the sport to sort of almost transcend time.

34
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.880
It'd be the same game now as it always is. Uh, soccer particularly,

35
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.560
they hate any kind of attempt to change the rules in this. Um,

36
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.910
football works in the exact opposite way.

37
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.540
Football is constantly evolving and constantly adopting new ideas and new

38
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:59.971
technologies and is very willing to alter the game in order to make it,

39
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.850
uh, more free flowing or a more progressive game.

40
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.890
I mean football will add things like coaches can talk to the quarterback,

41
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:10.480
three radio in their helmet.

42
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.830
You know,

43
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.360
the idea of instant replay was added very early on compared to other sports.

44
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.180
The game itself from an offensive perspective

45
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.630
is constantly being reinvented.

46
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.381
<v 0>Chuck says,</v>

47
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.530
if you look at all the new formations that keep getting added and all the trick

48
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:34.730
plays that are tried out every year, it is quite clear that football as a game,

49
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.870
<v 1>it actually is the most liberal sport in terms of adopting ideas.</v>

50
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.560
But the,

51
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.840
the morality of the game in the center of it,

52
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.040
the thing that really draws people to love it is sort of,

53
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.070
it's almost most reactionary qualities that it's still sort of comes down to

54
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.830
the strongest, toughest when,

55
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.200
and this is why I feel like football has,

56
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.470
is both so build for American if the American way of thinking and also didn't

57
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.730
you so popular too.

58
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.960
It allows you to sort of think about the game in a very liberal,

59
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.510
progressive way in a Carlisle way,

60
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.100
but spiritually or like your heart of it can still be this kind of old

61
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.380
comfortable conservative mindset.

62
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.970
There's old ivy fundamentals of power and might and tradition.

63
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.060
I'm just kind of of the belief that that's really what most people want.

64
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.680
Most people want to think of themselves as progressive but feel conservative and

65
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.580
Chuck's whole argument is is that it is football is a unique ability to be both

66
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:44.581
at the same time reactionary and simultaneously wildly inventive so that you can

67
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.540
think about it one way and feel about it in another.

68
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.610
That is what makes football the the most popular part of our sporting culture,

69
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:54.400
which it is now right now by a factor of three.

70
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.480
What he means is that the NFL is three times as popular as the next most popular

71
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:59.530
sport in America.

72
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.920
And the question we got to just cause it's a question you can't really avoid

73
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.160
right now is is it going to stay that way?

74
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.090
Let's just say we're just a weird era for the sport.

75
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.330
Like this is it certainly in my lifetime, the strangest era,

76
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.490
like some weird things are happening.

77
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:17.370
One is that injuries after injury,

78
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.290
there seems to be no limit to the amount that we can discuss the problems with

79
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:24.780
the game. Concussions in football. If you're a coach,

80
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.320
how do you handle all this discussion about neurologist and head injuries going

81
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:32.520
forward? The idea that so many former NFL players are essentially, you know,

82
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:37.500
decrepit and a lot of had problems study their brains after they die and they

83
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:42.300
have the brains of people who should've been 180 years old and had Alzheimer's

84
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:43.080
or whatever. You know,

85
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.890
there was just a kid from Ohio state who shot himself in a dumpster.

86
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.160
He vanished. He sent a text to his mother saying,

87
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.970
I am sorry if I'm an embarrassment and basically in Texas mom and said,

88
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.520
it was like, I think it's concussions that are making me do this.

89
00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:01.521
These concussions have my head all aft and at the same time it is an American

90
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:05.220
pastime. There seems to be no limit to the popularity of the sport.

91
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.240
Sunday's game was the most watched event in American television history.

92
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.440
I think it's very plausible that the Superbowl this year will be the most

93
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.950
watched sporting event of all time in America. That is, and this is the,

94
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.150
don't you feel a small cold wind in the air?

95
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.790
Like I feel like the times of death, there's totally,

96
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.551
absolutely will.

97
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:31.551
This will then there's really never been a serious discussion about should we as

98
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:35.310
a culture be playing football since, since Roosevelt 1905 yes.

99
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.340
And yet no one seems to be stopping themselves from watching these games.

100
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.530
So it's almost like there are these two silos,

101
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.390
two separate streams in our collective unconscious that exists simultaneously in

102
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:52.790
are both like shooting skyward. Okay. So we've gotta be honest.

103
00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.270
Like when chuck was talking about the,

104
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.190
his whole idea of silos shooting a

105
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.121
<v 2>cool idea,</v>

106
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.620
but we weren't really sure what that meant exactly.

107
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.690
Hey Renee, it's a pleasure to meet you.

108
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.270
Thank you so much for letting me come down. Cool. There's so much more.

109
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.620
That is until our producer and wheeler met this woman, I'm Monet Bartow.

110
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.270
You could add something like if you want, I'm a neighbor. Tell I'm a Libra.

111
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.210
I enjoy long walks on the beach. I'm just joking.

112
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.120
So Monae is a partner at a media production company.

113
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.240
She lives with her husband and their four kids outside of Atlanta, Georgia.

114
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.650
But I actually went to talk to her about her son Parker because Monet says the

115
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:34.520
very moment he was born. So what do you thinking when, when Parker's born,

116
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.990
as soon as the doctor saw his third thumb,

117
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.980
like yeah, we're going to the NFL babies.

118
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.750
Yes. And then Parker is the 10,001 ounce. He's the biggest thing.

119
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.940
He walked out the world. I'm still going with third

120
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.580
best way. I hadn't heard that. Alright. Um,

121
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.130
so Parker comes out and he's the biggest thing I've ever seen. You know,

122
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.240
I've prepared for months and I have found the perfect outfit to take him home

123
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.240
from the hospital and, and this joker is too big for it,

124
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.570
so right then I'm like all my guy. Yes, yes.

125
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:19.010
Like he's a boy and he's going to play in the NFL. He's gonna play in the NFL.

126
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.380
A lot of families pass down quilts.

127
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.660
They pass down family businesses. Our family tradition was football,

128
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.510
it was football. My Dad played football.

129
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.640
The lion's lidding Roysher was Mel far for data's Malvar.

130
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.480
He was a running back for the Detroit lions.

131
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.980
Actually rookie of the year in 1967 his brother played football. Miller Afar.

132
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.390
Your uncle? My uncle,

133
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.360
her brother is Malvar junior and Michael far both played football.

134
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.350
My cousin Jerry Leviis, who they, and when we say played these guys,

135
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.270
everybody laid out in the NFL. Okay, I'm Jerry Ball A,

136
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:57.380
I can't even if I, I said I was gonna actually write them all down,

137
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.680
but it's something like 33 really family members have played in the NFL.

138
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.710
Oh my God. Coming from a sports family,

139
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.780
we had to play a sport so I can remember getting up in the mornings before

140
00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:15.990
school, six, seven o'clock in the morning and having agility drills.

141
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.640
We lived on a house with Justin at home, in your back yard in the backyard.

142
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.120
We lived on a hill and I didn't have it as bad as my brothers because I played

143
00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:30.120
tennis. I started playing tennis at three. Um,

144
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:35.150
but like in the winter time my dad would strap my brothers to the sled and my

145
00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:38.880
dad was sitting in a sled and they would have to run up the hill with my dad in

146
00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:43.740
the sled. Um, tire drills, everything. Do you have a sense of like,

147
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.820
why? I think for my dad,

148
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.880
sports opened up so many doors for him. My Dad's from Beaumont, Texas.

149
00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:57.300
He was in Texas at a, you know, during segregation.

150
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.570
So sports allowed him to get out.

151
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.230
It allowed him to provide an excellent lifestyle for his family and being

152
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:11.910
drafted to the Detroit lions and being a football player in the Motown error.

153
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.340
Weekends at my house consisted of

154
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.050
Marvin Gay and Blim Barney and Charlie Sanders, who are all in the hall of fame.

155
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:28.650
Now my father actually an Lynn Barney sang background on Marvin Gaye's.

156
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:33.190
What's going on? No. Yes, they all,

157
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.380
my dad has a gold record. Oh man, that's crazy.

158
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.900
And when he stopped playing football,

159
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.340
he opened up his first car dealership and then another and another.

160
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.360
And for a time,

161
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.500
the mill far auto group was actually the largest African American owned business

162
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:55.800
in the country. I mean that's what football did for him.

163
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.370
Football gave my dad a life.

164
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.280
So Parker, if they had a toddler league he'd had been in it.

165
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.180
So you start looking for leagues like literally we moved to Georgia when Parker

166
00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:12.650
was two and I found one that started at four and I'm like Ooh,

167
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:16.370
just two more years. It was like a countdown. Oh my gosh. One more year.

168
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.520
And when Parker turned four,

169
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.830
I mean I couldn't sleep the night before. I'm like yes, browse the day.

170
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.910
Parker has no idea what's going on. I go up there bright and early.

171
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.730
First person in line. Here's my check. Four years old,

172
00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:36.290
full on contact football at four helmets, helmets, pads,

173
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.640
spring training. Wow. Parker had spring training.

174
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.990
Okay. He's going through the tires. He's four.

175
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.590
Okay. We don't even have team colors yet,

176
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.580
but I'm there in what I feel like the team colors should be in there and

177
00:10:52.581 --> 00:10:56.480
Honolulu, blue and silver cause that's Detroit lives colors.

178
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.030
So this is just at the at spring training.

179
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.830
Then we get to the actual team practice. They immediately,

180
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.120
they named him the tank.

181
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.410
He was just plowing through people.

182
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.450
They were like tank top and coaches and the coaches at first practice.

183
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.260
I'm not thinking about the other parents in their little normal sized children

184
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.320
and the fact that by, you know, after the first day of practice,

185
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:26.060
three kids quit because Parker had just plowed them over. I'm like, yes,

186
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.590
my son is a beast

187
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:34.230
and then the season starts football in where we live is huge.

188
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.740
At four years old, they were tailgating. No,

189
00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:42.760
I'm serious. The coaches had matching outfit. Then head gear like,

190
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:46.510
are you kidding me? You guys are talking on a microphones. And I'm like, wow,

191
00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:48.610
this is, this is freaking serious.

192
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.760
And the coaches are cursing like you guys are playing like a bunch of em.

193
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.820
Like whoa, they're four. They only know what that is. Wow.

194
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.590
It's that serious.

195
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.680
Are you starting to think this is ridiculous at any point or it's just they were

196
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.740
like this? No. I'm like, this is ridiculous.

197
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.430
When he says she knew that that game of when parking steam would take the field

198
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.310
[inaudible] who go fight win didn't matter.

199
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.040
You know the proudest moment as a parent,

200
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.370
my son gets a personal file.

201
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.400
I know it's terrible.

202
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.800
I'm my son just tackles this guy in the coach,

203
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.550
you know, he would always do make the meat dirt. So after he tackled him,

204
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.540
my son took his head like eat dirt. I'm like,

205
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.560
I had to keep myself down cause the kid who was eating mom who,

206
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.450
sorry. So at that, that's what that evening is.

207
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:48.130
When I realize I'm like, Gosh,

208
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.180
if my son was just attacked by a 65 pound four year old,

209
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.230
I'd probably be a bit upset. So this is a progression. This is okay.

210
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:58.180
They've got the matching outfits. Okay,

211
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:01.660
the eat dirt and then you go home and you reflect on the day and I start to,

212
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.090
you know, I'm like, oh my gosh, what about this kid's mom?

213
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.830
But then we get to the super bowl. So I'm fanatic again. The soup,

214
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.120
the four or five year old Superbowl. Yes. Okay.

215
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.970
My son has a trophy that's it's probably three feet tall and crazy part is that

216
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:17.260
as all this is happening,

217
00:13:17.261 --> 00:13:20.620
as Parker's taking the field with this four and five year old teammates,

218
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.070
a family member had really, really started showing signs

219
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.290
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

220
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.880
<v 2>signs of like a CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy,</v>

221
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.160
which is the what comes from like concussion,

222
00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:37.190
concussion after concussion symptoms include memory loss,

223
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.630
sometimes bouts of anger.

224
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.840
In this case it was depression was suicidal thoughts.

225
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.110
It was everything. Was it other family members saying, Hey,

226
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:53.430
have you noticed this or was it he himself saying I've,

227
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.000
I don't feel right. It was everybody else seen

228
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.010
it was getting phone calls like, Hey,

229
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.690
I need you to come get him because he's having dangerous thoughts.

230
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.933
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

231
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.360
<v 2>And at that very time knowing that I went and signed my son up for football,</v>

232
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.690
what's going on there? Cause that's what we do.

233
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.780
It's almost like a split personality.

234
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:25.710
Registering him for football was just as natural as getting up every morning and

235
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:30.640
brushing my teeth. Then you have the other half as a mother,

236
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.073
daughter,

237
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.500
niece of NFL athletes who sees what happens.

238
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:41.980
On the flip side and while Parker was playing the part of her that did see what

239
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.030
happens on the flip side,

240
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:47.560
that that part would campaign to raise awareness of CTE with other parents.

241
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.890
I was on a mission. I had met with people,

242
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:55.640
I was doing health fairs, helping create a, this pamphlet that would go out.

243
00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.580
Meanwhile, since Parker was playing my dad now is affected really your dad too?

244
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.310
My Dad is now showing signs. Um, how old is he now?

245
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.480
My Dad just turned 70 and you know,

246
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.090
I'm seeing it now with his speech, with his thought pattern, you know,

247
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:17.270
running bags. What do you do man? You leave with the head. That was, you know,

248
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.930
but I can't stop myself from wanting my son to play football.

249
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.610
It's just the Cree. I can't, I can't even explain it. If he wanted to play,

250
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.110
I would be out there. He would be at practice. You know,

251
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.750
even who tosses the ball around with him in the yard,

252
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:39.350
hoping that he'll fall in love with football me and ask for Parker.

253
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.650
When I asked Parker how did he, like the season,

254
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:47.270
his favorite things were the trophy and the pizza party at the end.

255
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.920
He had no desire. You want to play again next season? No,

256
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.420
this past year or last year. Hey Parker, do you want to play this year? No,

257
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.800
I want to play soccer.

258
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.600
Would you bring up to like when would a next possible season be?

259
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.840
Well registration is in June.

260
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.863
<v 4>Um,</v>

261
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.690
<v 2>and this would be what kind of, he's eight. Yeah,</v>

262
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.660
<v 4>I W W</v>

263
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.600
<v 2>I don't want him to, if he decides to play the game,</v>

264
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.440
<v 4>cool. If not</v>

265
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.080
<v 2>be grudgingly. But that's okay too.</v>

266
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.100
I don't want to force him to play, especially this early.

267
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.660
So I stand firm on both sides of the debate.

268
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.820
I know that's what makes it ridiculous.

269
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.180
I stand firm that children should not play football.

270
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.880
I also stand firm that children should play football,

271
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.440
that it's a great sport and our current solution to this quandary,

272
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.700
he can be a kicker.

273
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.860
So now we're out there. We're,

274
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.890
I'm up this year we're dedicated to teaching them how to kick.

275
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.400
Maybe soccer's left such a bad, bad idea. Good practice for the Alamo.

276
00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:11.520
All the kickers came from soccer. I'm like, what? What the what?

277
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.760
There is no black kickers. There was no black punters.

278
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.370
Even the kicker gets hit every so often now, every so often.

279
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:20.850
But there is a stiff penalty for that. Lose 15 years. Um,

280
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.180
how about this point in the conversation?

281
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.460
Parker came home from school.

282
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.190
I'm not exactly sure how an eight year old should look, but um,

283
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.110
he's a pretty big kid. Come sit with me.

284
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.680
Sit on your lap. So do you know why I can't even talk to you then?

285
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.880
Why you don't know what? Oh, about football? Yeah.

286
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.560
Uh, I've played,

287
00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.120
I played for about six weeks I think.

288
00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.410
Was that great? Something like that. Cause you just weren't really that into it?

289
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.540
No, I just still, um,

290
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:09.840
the only reason I don't want to play it anymore is because I made someone

291
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.890
swallow dirt and like that stuff is kind of messing up my history and I don't

292
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.100
want to get anyone else hurt. Messing up your history. Yeah.

293
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:22.070
It's just missing up history in my life. Does. I mean you could. Well,

294
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.240
I don't know what that means. What does that mean? That's messing up.

295
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.070
It's like messing up. It's making me have bad memories.

296
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:34.040
I want to have good memories. Um, and I can animate someone. Swallow dirt.

297
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.530
I feel guilty. It was an accident.

298
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:42.540
I just tackled him and man, it happened.

299
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.440
Did you feel bad about it right away or you just feel bad about now when you

300
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:50.970
think back on it? I feel bad about it every time I think back. Really? Yes.

301
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.880
I thought I heard somebody crying or something.

302
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.910
I thought I heard tears or I saw him.

303
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.720
So you didn't like doing that? Yeah.

304
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.230
Do you like watching football? I'm, no,

305
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:10.680
I'm not that in the football like the rest of my family. Why not?

306
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.040
I usually think about just having fun and not winning.

307
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.150
Where'd you get that? Is that from your mom? No,

308
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:22.650
I just know that winning is just for people trying to be better than everyone in

309
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:27.090
bullying. Women is from winters. No, like mom.

310
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.190
That's what I mean. It's trying to have fun, not just to be rude to people.

311
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.953
When you,

312
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.230
when all you're going to do is like take a trophy and say you're better than

313
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:41.190
them. It's not fair to the others. Do like other sports,

314
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.830
uh, or I really care about that either.

315
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.070
I really want to do synchronized swimming.

316
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.640
Really. Is that true? Is that true?

317
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.960
[inaudible] why? I'm mostly because when I, um, saw something about it,

318
00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:03.020
it looked kind of cool. Like, um,

319
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.990
people are doing a lot of cool swimming tricks,

320
00:20:05.991 --> 00:20:10.580
so I kind of thought it was something for me. Yeah. He's the,

321
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.650
this you play in me synchronized swimming where you're like,

322
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.131
you're like,

323
00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:18.380
this guy's going to come talk to me about football and I'm going to tell him

324
00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:23.320
that I want to do think or nice way. Right. No, you like it. Yeah. Uh,

325
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.550
yeah. It sounds good to note. He likes to swim. So you said swimming,

326
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.480
but I guess we don't have to worry about that. That would be a team sport. Yeah.

327
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.550
So, wow. This kind of exhausting. Yeah.

328
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.130
It's all right. We can stop. We can stop. Thanks to my name.

329
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:43.900
Parker Bartell for letting, uh,

330
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.930
letting store an invade their home and exhaust them on short notice. And by the,

331
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.070
when Monet went back

332
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.880
<v 0>and counted all the relatives that had been in the NFL, it wasn't 33,</v>

333
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.180
it was 13, but that's still, it's a lot. Any case,

334
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.780
here's the logical question that we felt like we should ask at least somewhere

335
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.930
in this show. Give and takes experience. You know,

336
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:04.930
we're football was practically his birthright but he is opting out.

337
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.020
Are there a lot of tanks out there?

338
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.860
Like is football the sport tanking nationally?

339
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:16.330
Generally we asked Molly Webster to find out finding when one of my friends,

340
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:18.700
we call him tank, but that's cause he can drink a lot

341
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.600
and my dad can't remember his name and just goes, how's tank?

342
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:29.530
How's that tank fellow still drinking a lot. In any case,

343
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.060
I started making some calls. The high school coaches, Hey, can you hear me?

344
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.970
Winning teams? Losing teams. Yep. Oh sweet.

345
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.450
And to kind of get a handle on the bigger picture, I called this guy

346
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:46.220
<v 5>dry and Marcellus Wallison and I am a freelance sports reporter.</v>

347
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.180
Um, I don't know. Would you want to name the places where I,

348
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.040
<v 0>no, we'll keep it short.</v>

349
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.950
<v 5>Okay, so then, yeah, just the name and freelance sports rather.</v>

350
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.391
<v 0>Okay.</v>

351
00:21:55.391 --> 00:22:00.391
So in 2013 he was an intern at the Wall Street Journal's sports desk

352
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.280
<v 5>and my first week a article was published on ESPN that suggested based on solely</v>

353
00:22:07.491 --> 00:22:09.320
pop Warner youth football numbers.

354
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.140
<v 0>Hey, by the way, pop Warner is, is no longer the person pop Warner,</v>

355
00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:15.070
but he is a youth football league. Okay.

356
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.820
<v 5>John Solely pop one and youth football numbers.</v>

357
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.390
Youth football was declining pretty significantly.

358
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.950
<v 0>Oh, do you remember what the, what the drop was? Yeah,</v>

359
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.120
<v 5>around 5% a year between 2010 and 2012</v>

360
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.160
<v 0>when people saw these numbers, they were like, oh my God, why exactly.</v>

361
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.320
5% doesn't sound too bad. Well,

362
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:38.860
I mean if you assume that the 5% drop doesn't change,

363
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:40.360
that's what it drops by every year.

364
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:45.460
Then in 15 years you're in the neighborhood of like 50% less kids playing ball.

365
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.593
Wow.

366
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.890
<v 5>If this is true, it's spells the end of football.</v>

367
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.690
<v 0>The idea is you, if you don't have the kids getting trained in like pop Warner,</v>

368
00:22:53.691 --> 00:22:55.910
then they're not going to middle school football.

369
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.160
They're not going to high school football and they're not going to college

370
00:22:58.161 --> 00:23:01.250
football. So they're not going in the NFL. Right. Needless to say,

371
00:23:01.251 --> 00:23:02.450
everyone was like, oh my God,

372
00:23:02.451 --> 00:23:05.870
is this actually true or is there more to these numbers than meets the eye?

373
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.860
So Ryan starts digging into them. Yeah,

374
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.890
<v 5>sorry, I couldn't find a context to put them in</v>

375
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.180
<v 0>and he doesn't look just at pop Warner numbers.</v>

376
00:23:14.181 --> 00:23:16.310
He looks at all of the youth football leagues.

377
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:21.550
<v 5>And what I began to realize was that the drop wasn't as drastic,</v>

378
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.650
but that there was indeed a drop.

379
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.350
<v 0>But it's not as big as everyone was saying.</v>

380
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.250
<v 5>All right,</v>

381
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.830
<v 0>okay. Your relief will be short lived because,</v>

382
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.150
because there's a bigger story.

383
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.520
When Ryan looked at participation across all youth sports, not just football,

384
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:44.030
<v 5>I came back with noted drops in all of the biggest youth.</v>

385
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.840
<v 0>It's not just that football's, everything's decreasing.</v>

386
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.560
<v 5>So nothing was rising except for Lacrosse and for hockey.</v>

387
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.180
So we had our headlines. Kids aren't playing sports, you know,

388
00:23:56.181 --> 00:24:00.080
football gets all of the attention. Football gets all of the controversy.

389
00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:03.920
You don't really hear about basketball or soccer or baseball.

390
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.490
So you don't have any reason to think that those sports aren't still as healthy

391
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:10.640
as they've always been. But then when you go and look,

392
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.120
you see a drop that is comparable to the drop in the sport that's got

393
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:20.930
everybody's hair on fire and you just wonder why this has been going on.

394
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:21.764
So silently

395
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.390
<v 0>is this an extension of the whole concussion thing? Yes.</v>

396
00:24:24.391 --> 00:24:28.230
Concussions were definitely part of the conversation but so we're, you know,

397
00:24:28.231 --> 00:24:32.580
budget issues and kids specializing in sports and getting burnt out.

398
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.700
So basically everyone had their reasons and every school has their reasons.

399
00:24:35.701 --> 00:24:37.200
But the guys I talked to,

400
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.630
they just kept coming back to land on this point that had nothing to do with

401
00:24:42.631 --> 00:24:43.310
safety.

402
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.880
<v 5>Cause you know the bottom line, if today, if, if a kid doesn't like the score,</v>

403
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.560
he just hits restart.

404
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.830
He just starts the game over it cause they can get on a video game,

405
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.650
they can play, they start losing, they hit reset,

406
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:58.950
hit the button and lay another game. They just hit a button and start over.

407
00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:03.510
<v 0>That's JT Curtis, j j Woodward and George Salus. They're in Louisiana,</v>

408
00:25:03.511 --> 00:25:04.740
California and Kansas.

409
00:25:04.741 --> 00:25:08.340
And I heard this refrain not just from them but I heard this in Ohio.

410
00:25:08.341 --> 00:25:12.700
I heard this in Michigan and by this point I was like Jesus, that's the problem.

411
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.120
It's funny cause it says if I'm,

412
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:20.610
all the coaches all across the nation are reading the same book or going to the

413
00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:21.361
same bars.

414
00:25:21.361 --> 00:25:25.290
Something because literally everyone I've talked to has brought this up.

415
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.560
Is it just that everyone's said it to each other so much that it's,

416
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.380
<v 6>I keep telling you about United at all.</v>

417
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.080
It's because we all deal with the problem.

418
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.230
<v 0>So all these coaches I talked to were like, you can't go hit reset.</v>

419
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:40.220
You can't hit reset. You can't hit reset. Like these kids are used to like,

420
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.050
it's, I've keep, I sound so old.

421
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.610
They're basically saying that what they find is they feel like there's some some

422
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.970
commitment issue now I will only play if I win. I only want to win. Yeah,

423
00:25:50.971 --> 00:25:54.460
so the interesting thing was is the coaches I talked to at the powerhouse

424
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.880
schools were like, well,

425
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:58.730
we're not actually having trouble getting kids because we win,

426
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.240
but the other schools and their conference,

427
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:04.220
they know that coaches and athletic directors,

428
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:07.610
and then I talked to some schools that had four fitting teams that ended up

429
00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:09.350
forfeiting games. They said like,

430
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.280
you just don't get the kids that will work their asses off and ride the bench

431
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.450
where everybody wants to eat.

432
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.780
It's just somehow it feels like they expect to win or it isn't worth the effort

433
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.090
or it's just that there are so many options.

434
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:22.250
Like why would you choose the losing option?

435
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.040
<v 5>Tell you what. When I used to go home after school,</v>

436
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.910
I turned the TV on and there's three channels. It's all I had.

437
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.183
<v 0>They usually will show him</v>

438
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.540
<v 5>operas and so there was really no reason I w I had no reason to stay home.</v>

439
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:35.100
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

440
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.210
<v 5>now you go home, there's 150 stations you can find something</v>

441
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.950
<v 0>you want to watch or you get out again. All right,</v>

442
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:48.951
so whether you think it's video games or parenting or fear of concussions or

443
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:54.750
whatever reason you want to choose seems to be the largest thing that happens in

444
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:56.710
these conversations about sports like football is it,

445
00:26:56.711 --> 00:26:58.770
it doesn't actually seem to be about football.

446
00:26:58.771 --> 00:27:03.180
It's like some kind of negotiation between the generations because like back in

447
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:05.010
the 1870s the Harvard kids,

448
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.180
they were using football as a way to say back to the previous generation like

449
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:13.200
look how look how tough we are. Look how manly we are. Maybe this generation

450
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.240
is turning away from sports like football also to say something back to the

451
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:22.010
previous generation, something about the world they want to live in.

452
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.700
<v 1>Sports do suggest things about society and about reality that we are slowly</v>

453
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:37.080
trying to move removed from existence.

454
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.890
The idea that somehow physicality matters more than the mind and that people

455
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:47.660
really aren't equal and that if you yell at someone and challenge their manhood,

456
00:27:47.661 --> 00:27:48.494
that's awful.

457
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.490
<v 0>I mean overt masculinity of any kind.</v>

458
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.760
It's not something that we're in the mood to celebrate these days.

459
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.750
So it could be if you believe writer Chuck Klosterman and it could be that some

460
00:27:57.751 --> 00:28:02.370
kids are choosing away from sports like football because to play football things

461
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:03.000
that we want,

462
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
it means that on some level you have to support or at least entertain ideas that

463
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:10.410
you don't like, you know,

464
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.960
or at least so you don't want to admit that you like except he admits it.

465
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.990
<v 1>I do think there's something unconscious about me that is drawn to the problems</v>

466
00:28:20.531 --> 00:28:24.070
in the game. They are based around what it really is, which is a

467
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.430
<v 0>two dudes slamming it.</v>

468
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:29.150
<v 1>Yes. Because I, you know, I mean, okay, this is like I'm doing,</v>

469
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.820
I guess I'm doing pop psychology on myself,

470
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:36.560
but what you are fully entitled to because it's fascinating. But I,

471
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.040
I sometimes wonder if, if

472
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:46.750
somehow part of me misses that from my life that you know,

473
00:28:49.851 --> 00:28:54.851
that my life is built around sitting at a computer and avoiding conflict and

474
00:28:57.651 --> 00:29:01.370
basically thinking about things and going on the radio and talking about what

475
00:29:01.371 --> 00:29:04.160
they might mean, you know, and sort of like, what are they metaphors for?

476
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.040
What is this culture? What is it telling us, you know? And that, that,

477
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.230
that perhaps football allows me to sort of, even though I'm not playing it,

478
00:29:12.231 --> 00:29:14.720
I'm just watching it. But somehow by watching it,

479
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.730
it allows me to tap into something that is no longer part of my life because my

480
00:29:19.731 --> 00:29:21.740
mind has trained me not to want it.

481
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.900
My mind knows not to look for conflict, Eh,

482
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.210
now I do.

483
00:29:29.211 --> 00:29:34.211
I suspect that I was socialized to believe that that would be a positive,

484
00:29:35.181 --> 00:29:38.840
exciting thing. Absolutely. I mean, I, uh, you know,

485
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.900
I talked about sports with father more than we talked about every other thing we

486
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:49.060
ever talked about. I had a great relation with my dad. Uh, he passed away.

487
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.890
I loved him. We had a great relationship,

488
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:55.060
but we definitely spent more time discussing sports.

489
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.860
Then I would say every other thing that we discussed,

490
00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.860
even though he would always say like the most important thing he'd like,

491
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.800
I'd come home from whatever, you know. And he would be like,

492
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.830
so how was school today? And now I'd tell him, oh, school was briefly.

493
00:30:05.831 --> 00:30:07.300
And he would be like, uh, well, you know,

494
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:08.770
academics and the most important thing.

495
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.400
And then we would talk about football practice for an hour. Like you're like,

496
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:14.260
you know, it's like it would be, that would be,

497
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.810
so I realized that my relationship to football goes back to, you know, my,

498
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:21.340
I have two older brothers, man,

499
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:25.270
we spent so much time throwing the football around and, and,

500
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:26.380
and my brother,

501
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.320
one of both my brothers were very good football players and like one played at

502
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.810
the college level. And as a first grader I was so proud of that, you know,

503
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.010
I would tell Ya. So there's all of these things that are,

504
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.130
I'm sure are creating obstacles. For me, seeing this clearly,

505
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.510
and maybe the kind of person who sort of like this guy is crazy that he's not

506
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:50.680
seeing the obvious thing that he is actually saying that we need to somehow find

507
00:30:50.681 --> 00:30:55.000
a moral justification for a game that's probably killing dudes for money.

508
00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.890
I don't know. It's not my fault. That's how I feel. I can't get around you man.

509
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:00.724
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.383
Whoa. There you go.

511
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:13.140
<v 7>You have two new messages. Message one. Hi,</v>

512
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.800
this is Chuck Klosterman. This is Monet and Parker Bartelle. Hi,

513
00:31:16.801 --> 00:31:21.690
this is Kat Curtis calling. Have a bit of a cold, so I'm ready to.

514
00:31:21.691 --> 00:31:26.240
Lab is produced by Jen Abba, Matt. Ever Mirage.

515
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.870
Our staff includes Alan Horn, Soren wheeler, Howard [inaudible],

516
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.840
Molly Webster, Melissa Donald's feelings. Jamie Yorklyn,

517
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.500
Livy Lynn, Libby, Andy Mills, Kelsey Padgett.

518
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.680
In that IPI was how from Iron Lat gold winner,

519
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.540
the mind neo, Damion machete, Nasser Philly prime,

520
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.700
and Denny Lewis.

521
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.370
Radiolab involves many staff members with names that are hard to pronounce.

522
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.960
That's the thanks to Richard Chick from Benji. Robert Wheeler, definitely.

523
00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.320
But some. Debra creditee. Fred War Decker, Joel Flood,

524
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:07.190
Eric Anderson in the Cumberland County historical society by and this message.

525
00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.470
<v 1>Okay, I'm back. One last thing. One last thing. Okay.</v>

526
00:32:21.471 --> 00:32:24.200
If you grew up on inside the NFL as I did,

527
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:29.950
this is for you some voice using the Chicago players crowded along the sideline

528
00:32:30.801 --> 00:32:32.500
as a shield. Excellent.

529
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.050
Diane circled the bench and started running again

530
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.010
behind the line of scrimmage. How's your

531
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.220
<v 8>launch the ball 40 yards down.</v>

532
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:46.820
Field x and dine darted back onto the field. All the alone.

533
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.400
You're the Chicago goal for a moment.

534
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.790
It was a frozen scene in a stage drama.

535
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.130
The bowl hung in the year a tantalizing possibility,

536
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.030
good x and Diane Richard, would he catch it or drop it?

537
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.060
Defender's wheeled and stared downfield spectators watching from the stands

538
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.660
found that the breath had died in their collective throats.

539
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:17.180
The spiraling balls seem to defy physics. What made it stay up?

540
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.720
When would it come down in that long moment,

541
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:26.220
which 27,000 spectators mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms may

542
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:32.681
have felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new

543
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:36.440
emotion. They may have noticed something they never had before,

544
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.870
that Obole traveling through space traces a profoundly elegant path.

545
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.700
They may have realized something else that it was beautiful.

546
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.080
The ball struck it's human target x and died,

547
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:55.360
caught the pass all alone and trotted over the Chicago Gold Mine.

548
00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.460
The stadium exploded in sound and motion. I'm a Chicago sideline.

549
00:34:01.461 --> 00:34:04.910
Coaches and players screen without roads on the field.

550
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.900
The referee signaled the score, but in the stands,

551
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:10.460
the spectators marveled.

552
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:16.270
The crowd hilditch ref in amazement for a time and stifled this local pride and

553
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:20.180
turned loose its enthusiasm. And she ran for the Indians,

554
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.820
the Chicago Daily Tribune reporter. He was the game breaker.

555
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.670
The rest was just anticlimax.

556
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:32.090
The final score was 18 to four for Carlyle.

557
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.760
The long past had arrived in Chicago,

558
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.180
although by a circuitous and out of bounds route,

559
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:45.190
the Indians declared the Tribune had given such an exhibition of its

560
00:34:45.191 --> 00:34:50.191
possibilities as will not soon be forgotten in that vast wrong.

561
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.040
<v 9>That was Mr. Scott Graham Voice of inside the NFL. Thank you, Scott.</v>

562
00:34:58.041 --> 00:35:00.660
You are the awesome miss voice ever. And uh,

563
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.600
that was original music by Dylan Keefe. Bye.
