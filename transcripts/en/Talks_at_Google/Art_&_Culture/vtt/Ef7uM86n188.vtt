[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:09.810
JUNE WU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.150
Thank you so much
for being here today.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.450
My name is June,
and I am a Googler

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.379
on the global business
strategy team based

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.370
in 1098 in Mountain View.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.080
I'm super excited
to introduce you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.240
to the Dover
Quartet, who I'm very

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.310
lucky to call personal friends.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.815
I just saw them yesterday
perform at the Green Music

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.990
Center in Sonoma, and
they did a phenomenal job,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.031
and they'll be performing
some of the pieces they

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:34.790
played yesterday for you today.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.010
They are finishing
up their US tour.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.660
And basically right
after this concert,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.550
they're going to be
jetting off and going

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.542
to the next performance, and
eventually head into Germany.

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:46.250
I don't want to speak
too much, because I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.375
want them to introduce
themselves and tell you more

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:51.050
about themselves and the music.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.780
But I did want to
introduce the four of them.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.780
So we have Joel and
Bryan on violin,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.420
and then Camden on the
cello, and Milena--

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.730
Milena on the viola.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.610
The Dover Quartet was recently
named a quartet in residence

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
for the Kennedy Center in
DC, which is amazing news, so

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.080
congrats to them.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.674
And they're also
the official quartet

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:12.590
in residence at Northwestern
University, where

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.470
they currently teach.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.020
They also just performed
at Carnegie Hall

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.430
with superstar violinist Janine
Jansen and pianist Jean-Yves

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.940
Thibaudet.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.160
They came out with
two CDs last year

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.860
and they are available
on Google Play Music,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.110
so you should check them out.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.487
Search Dover Quartet,
and it should come up.

00:01:32.487 --> 00:01:34.070
Milena, I'm just
going to hand it over

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.444
to you so you can
talk a bit more

00:01:35.444 --> 00:01:36.920
about the quartet and the music.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.730
MILENA PAJARO-VAN
DE STADT: Yeah.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.110
We're so excited to be here.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.130
We're really happy that
so many of you came.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
We formed about nine years
ago while we were all

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.357
still in undergrad, which
is where most of us met,

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:49.940
although the two
violinists over there

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.860
have known one another since
they were 13 years old, which

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.480
is pretty cool.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.990
But yeah, we've basically
been married to one another

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.910
since those nine years ago.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.060
We were all at a
conservatory in Philadelphia

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.490
called the Curtis
Institute of Music.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.430
And the chamber music was a
big part of education there,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.330
so we were all playing in
multiple different groups

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.340
every year that we were there,
and we were all friends.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.300
We all admired and loved
one another's playing.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.174
And actually, Camden
and I from the outset

00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:21.590
when we entered
school, we started

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.560
playing with one another,
and just loved it.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.810
And basically, we
were in a group

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.210
together since that
first week of school.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.386
We never were not
in a group together,

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:33.010
so we've been together
for even longer.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.590
What's that, like 11 years?

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.072
And Joel and Bryan
as well, they were

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:39.530
in a quartet together
the year they

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.900
entered Curtis, which was
the year before Camden and I.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.570
So eventually one
day, the two halves

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.140
of us, a quote unquote
"bottomless quartet"

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.930
and a "topless quartet"
joined together

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.925
to form a full quartet.

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:53.300
We loved playing
with each other,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.670
and very quickly,
we had this thing

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.440
that we call the
relationship talk.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.170
Like, is this just for school?

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.930
Is it just a fling, or is
this for the long term?

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.460
And we were all
on the same page.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.110
And our first big
mark of commitment

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.780
was applying for a master's
degree together as a group.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.380
So we went to Rice
University in Houston

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.822
where they have a special
program for string quartets

00:03:14.822 --> 00:03:16.280
where they take
one group every two

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.300
years to do a masters degree
specializing in string quartet.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.314
So we went there.

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:22.980
And from there, we
moved back to Philly,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.694
which is where we're now based.

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:26.360
Even though we do
teach at Northwestern,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.040
we still call Philly home.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.570
And now, we just tour
full-time, teach at Northwestern

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.880
part-time, and this is our life.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.610
CAMDEN SHAW: Yeah, that's true.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.450
We give about 140 concerts
a year all over the world.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.790
And you can imagine all
the travel days that

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.195
go into something like that.

00:03:45.195 --> 00:03:47.570
But it's wonderful when you're
in a place like California

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.240
and you can go to beer tastings,
and wine tastings, and things

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.250
like that, so we
don't do too badly.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.220
And we also never get to perform
in a place with a projector.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.367
So since none of you
guys really know us,

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:00.950
we thought we'd show
you this trailer.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.100
We're actually embarking on
a really interesting journey.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.000
We have actually
completed the filming

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
for a documentary that will
be a full-length documentary

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.347
with a wonderful director,
who actually, he produced

00:04:14.347 --> 00:04:16.430
and directed this movie
called "Chops," if you get

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.279
a chance to watch it, which
is about young jazz musicians,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.769
and it was really
incredible, really inspiring.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.320
And so we approached him
about doing a documentary

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.250
about chamber music.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.220
The reason being, we're
traveling all the time,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.720
and people always
ask is what we do.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.700
And what we tell them
that we play Beethoven,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.390
for some reason,
they're really amazed.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.380
They're like, you guys don't
look like classical musicians.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.180
And it made us
wonder, like, what

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.505
is it that people think
classical musicians look like?

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:42.860
Like, they wear old powdery
wigs still, or something?

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.640
I don't know.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.230
So after a couple
of years of that,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.450
we actually just got
more and more passionate

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.360
about spreading
the reality of what

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.376
it's like to be a
classical musician in 2018.

00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:56.000
So we started filming
this documentary,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.540
and here's the trailer.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.206

- Tonight is the Dover's album
release event for their very

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.060
first album called "Tribute."

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.840
This is a recording of
"Repertoire" by Mozart

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.920
that is paying tribute to
their mentors, the Guarneri

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.410
Quartet, which is one
of the great quartets

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.290
of the 20th century that
Dover was lucky enough

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.290
to study with members
of the Guarneri Quartet.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.470
And this recording is
the same "Repertoire"

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.810
that the Guarneri recorded
on their debut disk,

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.971
and it's record exactly 50
years after that first album

00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:35.470
came out.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.110
Michael Tree and
Arnold Steinhardt,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.157
the founding violist
and first violinist

00:06:40.157 --> 00:06:42.240
of the Guarneri Quartet
will both be here tonight.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.565
[MUSIC - DOVER QUARTET,
 "REPERTOIRE"]

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.780
Next step for the
Dovers is for them

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.620
not to be somewhat of an
insider's secret in chair

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.930
music, and that is something
that's already changing.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.150
They are starting to
play more and more

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.100
at really prominent
venues and with

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.260
these prominent
collaborators attracting

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.642
attention of major media.

00:07:01.642 --> 00:07:04.100
I think they're going to become
a household name in the way

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.840
that not a lot of quartets have.

00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:27.708
- [INAUDIBLE] up.

00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:30.690

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.181

00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:33.175
All right.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.960
- So just listening to how
masterfully you played that,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.200
I think you really did succeed
and have this sense of ease

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.150
about your music-making.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.928
So you're doing it.

00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:28.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.250
- They have really become
the leading young string

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.690
quartet in the world.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.950
And they play 120
concerts a year,

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.309
which is a schedule that very,
very few quartets maintain.

MILENA PAJARO-VAN
DE STADT: All right.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.470
So actually, you see a little
Kickstarter thing there.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.710
We did launch a
successful Kickstarter,

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.147
and that's how we managed
to finish the filming

00:09:19.147 --> 00:09:19.980
for the documentary.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.700
And that trailer was
after one day of filming.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.124
That was November
2016, I believe.

00:09:27.124 --> 00:09:29.040
And now, we've done an
entire year of filming,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.470
including in China, in
Austria, all over the world,

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.360
all over the place.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.190
The types of things
that they were-- they

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.550
interviewed us,
and our colleagues,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.270
and our mentors, and
presenters, and we get

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.120
into really personal things.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.820
It's not just about
the job, I guess.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.000
It's not just about the
performing, and the practicing,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.490
and the rehearsing, but
also just the people

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.280
behind the music, and
our personal lives.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.890
And they even interviewed
my fiance for, like,

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.490
three hours about it.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:04.492 --> 00:10:06.700
CAMDEN SHAW: Yeah, it was
a very personal experience,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.180
and we're really
excited about it.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.707
We did start a
nonprofit entity which

00:10:11.707 --> 00:10:14.040

project, but in the future,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.604
for commissions of new
works and things like that.

00:10:16.604 --> 00:10:18.270
And if you're interested
in contributing

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.940
or being involved in some way,
don't hesitate to reach out.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.690
Our email is also
really easy to remember.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.320
It's just
Doverquartet@gmail.com.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.830
Super easy.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.130
So with that, let's
go to the Schumann,

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.850
this amazing, and just one
of the most successful piano

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.330
quintets ever written.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.700
It's so catchy.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.450
It's so joyful, and
exuberant, and very romantic.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.060
And one thing that's
really cool about Schumann

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.370
is he almost always
found a way to work

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.280
his wife's name into his music.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.120
So one theme that you'll
hear in this piece goes

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.341
[SINGING]

00:10:52.474 --> 00:10:54.140
And then there's an
answer in the viola,

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.320
and we trade back and forth.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.740
It's a very romantic duet,
but he gets the idea for the--

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.700
[SINGING]

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.060
From Clara, which he uses
in almost all of his pieces.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.320
It's really incredible.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.840
He was so in love with her.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.700
And actually, he wrote
only three string quartets,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.510
so the kind of things that we
could play without June's help.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.750
And he wrote them all at once,
and they were all a birthday

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.972
gift to Clara, and
were premiered actually

00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:24.180
at her birthday party in
their home in Leipzig, which

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.580
is very-- so he was a
very romantic person.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.160
Schumann had a
pretty tragic life

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.210
and had some severe mental
health issues that escalated.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.870
And eventually, he took his own
life, which is a great tragedy.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:43.320
His output of music went from
really long patches of nothing,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.071
no writing at all.

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.278
And then he would have the
year where he wrote, like,

00:11:46.278 --> 00:11:47.550
a hundred incredible pieces.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.220
This piece that we're about
to play the first moment of

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.720
was from one of
those great years.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.280
He was definitely
on a high and was

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.740
writing like it was just the
most beautiful, natural thing

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.290
in the world.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.770
So we're so excited to be
sharing the stage with June

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.180
and hope you enjoy this
great piece by Schumann.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.380
Thanks.

Let's give it up for June.

[CHEERING]

00:21:20.972 --> 00:21:22.466
Yeah, June, woo.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.160
So you might have noticed on
your programs if you have them,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.790
it says "boarding" on there.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.276
We were thinking
about it, and we

00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:38.900
thought it would be
a better experience

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.100
to play a full work for you.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.433
We had been toying with the
idea of only doing movements

00:21:42.433 --> 00:21:44.070
of pieces here and there.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.031
So we actually, instead
of doing the boarding,

00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:48.530
we're going to do the entire
Mendelssohn quartet there we're

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.613
going to play for you, and
it's the one you see up

00:21:50.613 --> 00:21:52.040
on the screen there.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.690
Unfortunately, we
only have four of us

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.054
here, so we can't do the octet.

00:21:56.054 --> 00:21:57.782
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.782 --> 00:22:01.490
But yes, we're going to be doing
the entire Mendelssohn Opus 80,

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.360
and this is one of the
staples of the string quartet

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.130
literature.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.190
It is a huge change of pace,
actually, from the Schumann

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.180
in terms of emotional
darkness and weight,

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.840
and it's actually the
last full major work

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.740
that Mendelssohn composed
two months before he died.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.310
And the entire thing, actually
when he was first writing it,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.250
I think at the top
somewhere, he had

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.140
written that it was
a requiem for Fanny,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.800
which was his sister
who had recently died.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.780
And that really tore him apart.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:41.180
And you'll see when you hear
how tortured this piece is

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.495
that it was incredibly
emotional for him.

00:22:44.495 --> 00:22:45.710
CAMDEN SHAW: It is.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.610
Mendelssohn was a very
joyful person overall,

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.930
and extremely talented, actually
even more so than Mozart,

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.750
exhibited tremendous musical
skills at a young age.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.570
Some of his most famous pieces
were composed in his teens,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.650
actually, including the octet
that we are not playing today.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.440
Really, really talented
person and very optimistic.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.390
He was also a great
artist, actually.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.110
In his home now-- you can still
visit it, and also in Leipzig,

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.067
actually--

00:23:13.067 --> 00:23:14.900
is covered in his own
paintings, and they're

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.430
absolutely beautiful.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.060
But this work is unusual
for him in that these themes

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.560
of darkness really pervade it.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.570
And actually, three out
of the four movements

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.300
are downright angry
most of the time, just

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.310
really, really full of rage.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.230
There are moments in all those
moments of respite from that,

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.790
but they're brief.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.620
So it's a very dark and
very, very angry expression,

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.120
with the exception of the slow
movement, the third movement.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.460
And it's almost as
if the entire piece

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.610
exists to set up this
experience of the slow movement.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:52.550
It's incredibly plaintive,
and intimate, and vulnerable,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.574
and it's really some of his
best writing that he ever did.

00:23:55.574 --> 00:23:56.990
And actually, I
was telling Milena

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.660
I kind of wanted to share with
you guys one thing to listen

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.310
for in this piece and
specifically in this movement.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.600
So one of the really cool things
about the music that we play

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.780
is the way that the
composers deliberately

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.760
change tiny little details for
a tremendous emotional meaning.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.622
So in the slow moment,
there's a recurring thing

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:17.330
that you'll hear.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.332
It's not a theme.

00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:20.540
It's more like a word that
you'll hear over and over,

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.748
and it always goes like this.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.895
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:34.981 --> 00:24:36.730
And I really want you
guys to memorize it,

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.550
because there's only one time
where he says it differently,

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.857
and it's really important.

00:24:40.857 --> 00:24:42.940
So can you guys all sing
along with me this thing?

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.710
So when he doesn't
do that, be amazed.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.700
It's amazing.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.581

incredible work by Mendelssohn.
