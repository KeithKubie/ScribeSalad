00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
&gt;&gt; Vic Gundotra: and the movie will go ahead
and start.

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.129
Matt, don't watch the movie. Let's come back.
Let me show you another ad format.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.850
This is also an expandable ad format, but in this case

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
this expandable ad format has -- 
I'm sorry, in this case -- I jumped ahead

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.840
of you. Let's go back to the other one.
In this case I am going to show you a very

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.070
popular ad format that has been testing incredibly
well. This is a click-to-call ad.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.390
In this case we are leveraging the fact that
the user has given us permission to use their

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.140
location. We know that they are in San Francisco,
and DirecTV would like to make a special offer

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.700
to customers in San Francisco and they have
a new click-to-call option. So simply clicking

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.440
on that button on that ad allows the customer
to make that phone call to DirecTV, and that's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.940
incredibly valuable.
Let me talk about another format. This is

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.829
an expandable format with a clever twist.
Matt, expand that one out. It includes a map

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.540
and directions and click-to-call. Isn't that
great? That's a new format that will become

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.560
shortly available as well.
Okay. Finally, let me show what you I meant

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.040
when I said open to innovation.
This is the weather.com application, and they

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.990
are using the industry standard DoubleClick
software to serve this ad from Google.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.670
The ad is at the bottom.
Now, when Matt clicks on that ad, you get

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.400
a full screen immersive ad, and it's a pretty
amazing ad. It's got trailers and TV spots

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.729
and galleries. Not only does it have a bunch
of media you can interact with, look at the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.400
bottom there. The bottom has the ability for
you to tap directly into fandango to purchase

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.369
movie tickets.
But do you know what the kicker is of what

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.080
you are seeing? It's not a Google ad. You
are seeing an immersive ad format delivered

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.070
by a great advertising company called MediaLabs.
But because the advertiser -- excuse me the,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.869
ISB, the developer used DoubleClick to serve
the ads, DoubleClick is open to have any ads

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.030
show up. And that's what it means to be open.
That we serve the most relevant ad to the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.810
user, sometimes from Google, sometimes not,
but you the developer and the publisher have

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.810
the choice.
If would you like to learn more about our

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.330

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.330

Apps, to everybody at the conference, all

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.590
5,000 of you.
And we're going to sweeten the deal a little

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.239
bit.
If you go sign up, we will give you $100 free

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.860
advertising credit to start learning the system
and advertise your apps in the Android Marketplace.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.069
So, please, go try that out.
[ Applause ]

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.069
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: One of the most powerful ways
to demonstrate what I talked about at the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.170
beginning, that innovation comes from all
levels of the stack, is to highlight one of

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.269
my favorite devices.
This is the device by HTC.

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.709
It's the EVO device.
Now, there are several things I love about

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.780
this device.
One thing I love about the device is, its

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.459
absolutely gorgeous 4.3-inch screen.
I also love how fast it is.

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.739
I love the great work HTC has done to add
value.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.690
I love the Sprint network.
It's a 4G network.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.010
You know what a 4G network can do?
It can give you a peak of 10 megabits per

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.690
second.
Imagine what you can watch on this device

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.959
at 10 megabits per second.
I love the fact that this device has a great

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.090
little stand.
You can set it on the desk, or if you're on

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.090
an airplane, just set it right there and watch
your content.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.659
It's got a great battery.
It's got HDMI output.

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:57.659
It's got a camera that's 8 megapixels and
that will do 720p HD video recording.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.440
And you know what I love most about this device?
Is that in partnership with Sprint and HTC,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.939
Google is going to make this device available
to every one of you today.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.939
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, for those of you who

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.050
are watching on YouTube, I'm sorry.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.669
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Remember to register next
year, quickly.

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.639
I think you're going to love that device.
We ask you to do two things.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.330
Number one, don't run out right now.
After the keynotes are over, we're going to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.289
make it available all day until 6:00 p.m.
So you'll have plenty of time to get this

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.589
device and really get to see the latest in
Android innovation.

00:04:55.589 --> 00:05:00.659
Number two thing we're going to ask.
Thank you for supporting Android.

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.759
Thank you for voting on the side of openness
and choice.

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:11.759
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Please keep building those

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.930
great apps.
Now, we're at the halfway point this morning.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.430
We're not done yet.
If you'd like to see the next step in the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.549
evolution of Android and where we're about
to go next, hang tight.
