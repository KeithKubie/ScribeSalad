WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.660
Are we about to do thoughts, right? Yes, we are. Okay. Three, two, one. Hey,

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.720
I'm Janet [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.460
And today we're talking about well change really, or what,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.890
what looks like change.

5
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:13.880
So you remember back to the baboons where we started this program? Yeah.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.680
The question we were asking them was, will those baboons,

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.250
if they do enough generations, will they create a new culture and let's stick.

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.320
Will it stick? Let's hope. Let's hope. But we don't know. No.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.050
And the town that chooses a mayor,

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.220
is that town expanding the sense of possibility or is this a little blip?

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.480
Exactly. But now let's get really serious.

12
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:37.481
There are indeed changes that do stick and we're going to examine or rather

13
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.800
start thing example of that right now. Yeah. Um, but to do that,

14
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:45.130
we need an evolutionary biologist and we found one at Duke University.

15
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:47.800
You guys talk to each other now? Yeah. Hello? Hello. Who's this?

16
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.570
That's Brian Hare. Fantastic.

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.480
And the first thing Brian here did was tell me about another guy,

18
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.710
Dimitri [inaudible].

19
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.720
Dimitri Dimitri [inaudible] was a very famous geneticist in Russia.

20
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.670
He was, uh, alive during World War II and doing a genetics work.

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.680
But after World War II, uh, he was a little spot of Trump. Wow.

22
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.441
What'd he do? Well,

23
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:13.310
because he was a real Darwinian and he believed in evolution and genetics.

24
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.060
But thinking about evolution, like a Darwinian evolution is,

25
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.390
does that was not popular in Stallings?

26
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.780
Russia is popular the word or was that it? Was that a death sentence?

27
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.700
It was a destiny.

28
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.140
So the writing was on the wall and he knew that he should probably take the

29
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:34.940
Trans Siberian railroad from Moscow quickly, uh, quickly.

30
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.070
And he went to Novas a beers. And the way that Dimitria bill,

31
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:44.360
I have decided to hide his continued interest in studying Darwinian evolution

32
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:49.040
was he would begin a Fox farm where he would make for coats.

33
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.290
So what is Mr Biala actually doing?

34
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:56.291
What Dr [inaudible] was actually interested in was to understand how does

35
00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:00.890
domestication happen? That's his question.

36
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:01.810
That's a dumb question. No,

37
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.760
it's not a dumb question at all because you bring that note.

38
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.830
You think about a wild animal. It is impulsive. It is aggressive.

39
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.140
It gravel. What is it? A Wolf you're playing there?

40
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.870
That's a wolf that I've got there in the backyard.

41
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.750
Now this is a domesticated version.

42
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.530
The nature of the animal has completely changed here.

43
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:26.930
And if you want to learn something about the nature of a creature,

44
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:30.620
how it can change. Domesticated animals are a wonderful place to start.

45
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.710
So belief he decided,

46
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.860
why don't I just experimentally domesticate some animals?

47
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.900
And his cover was that he was going to make better for coats. When was this,

48
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:43.690
by the way? 1959 okay,

49
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.270
so Sputnik was up Russians for feeling good and he was making for coats,

50
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.860
so to speak, so to speak. Began one of the most exciting experiments in biology.

51
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.720
So here's what Dimitri Herbalife does.

52
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:55.560
He goes to a bunch of fucks farmers and he said, look,

53
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:58.760
I want to buy a bunch of foxes. And he says, well,

54
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:03.340
all I do is take this group of foxes and break them into two groups and one

55
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:05.610
group. I'm not going to change them in any way. Okay?

56
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.920
So it's like a control line. So one group is just normal fox normal,

57
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
but the other line I'm going to decide who is going to be allowed to breed and

58
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:16.810
who is unfortunately going to be a fur coat.

59
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.410
So some of the faxes get to have puppy foxes of their own and some foxes become

60
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.160
news. So what he did in the test was marvelously simple. He would go,

61
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.300
or what if his assistants would approach in case where the Fox was kept a baby

62
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.450
fall, sort of a juvenile fox. The experimenter would stand,

63
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.420
say a foot away and would just try to touch the Fox.

64
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.330
I hated the Fox run fox run.

65
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:48.331
But if the Fox would make this kind of sound and sort of cower in the corner

66
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.090
like most foxes would do, what does that,

67
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.050
what's the sound that is the sound of Fox meets when it's frightening. Really?

68
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.800
Yes. Frightened flux. So what happens if it makes that sound? Well,

69
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.760
they did not breed that Fox in the next generation or to put it in another way,

70
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.860
they kill that pretty much. Yes, that's just wrong.

71
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.240
But now every so often, like maybe one out of every 20 foxes,

72
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.320
there would be a Fox that would not run back, would not,

73
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.270
so it wasn't afraid then.

74
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.330
Then they would choose that Fox to breed in the next generation and they did

75
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.910
this over and over again. Generation after generation,

76
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.890
they would breed the nice foxes together.

77
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.980
Get rid of the bad fox breed the next set.

78
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.260
Get rid of the bad foxes breed. The next set. Next set. Next set.

79
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.610
Next set. Next set guy. Right. What happened in the aunt will eventually eat.

80
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.630
They had foxes that were attracted to humans. Now Jed,

81
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:50.920
how long do you think it would take to get foxes from being wild,

82
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:55.600
ferocious animals to being animals who would lick your face after this?

83
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:58.530
Kind of like an exterminating reading. Yes,

84
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.810
I've taken breeding techniques a long, long time.

85
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.710
I mean now like how many years? You? Many years. How many years? Well,

86
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:09.170
it took the wolves like thousands of years to become dogs. I Dunno,

87
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.660
I mean long time. Well, here's this. Here's the thing. 10 years is the answer.

88
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.010
10 years now. 10 don't tell me to shut up.

89
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.450
I'm telling you it's 10 years. But now here's the crazy thing.

90
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.480
What was exciting and surprising was that these same foxes,

91
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.010
they actually show a whole suite of changes that he did not select for on

92
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:37.060
purpose. Like what do you mean physical changes? These foxes,

93
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.990
as they became more gentle for some accountable reason,

94
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.950
their ears instead of pointing straight up, flipped over. That's right.

95
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.610
It was a big accident that they now have floppy ears.

96
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.910
The tales on a Fox, which in a wild fucks, they're straight.

97
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.060
Now they have curly tails.

98
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.480
They have multicolored that are no longer just grade tips of their paws lose

99
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.204
color.

100
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.830
The teeth gets smaller and their bones became very thin.

101
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.780
Their bones got thinner. Yeah. Yes.

102
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.040
So what happens to the skull and the face is it actually becomes more feminine.

103
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.810
The whole animal becomes more delicate than we're puppy. Like wow,

104
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.340
<v 1>I did sir.</v>

105
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.080
<v 0>I don't know what to make of that yet. And it's not over.</v>

106
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.870
This experiment has been going on. It's now been 50 years,

107
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:31.530
45,000 foxes later, 5,000 and Brian, by the way,

108
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.370
he who has read about this is that I got to see this for myself.

109
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.540
So he went to the Novosibirsk just to check.

110
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.530
<v 2>I did. I took the Trans Siberian Railroad, which you know,</v>

111
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.270
two days of looking at green grass and there's like one species of tree and I

112
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:49.240
think there was a butterfly that was kind of pretty and was at birch trees.

113
00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:50.740
You're looking at British tree, then another birch tree,

114
00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:54.340
then another birch tree and pretty much by the book you got it. You got it.

115
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.320
You got it, you got it. So I show up and they had thousands of foxes,

116
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.360
giant buildings that are probably, you know,

117
00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:06.361
as long as a football field full of just rows and rows of foxes.

118
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.210
And when you see them, they actually wag their tail.

119
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.830
They whine like a puppy dog.

120
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.300
<v 1>Oh,</v>

121
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.910
<v 2>they're cute and cuddly and they love people and they don't bite.</v>

122
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.660
So it sounds perfect except for the one thing I forgot to tell you is that when

123
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:23.320
they're yapping and excited to see you, they cannot help but pee for sure.

124
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.050
<v 0>Joel, as I do when ever I see you.</v>

125
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.500
<v 2>What I don't understand though is it makes sense to me that they're getting</v>

126
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:31.790
nicer because they're breeding them to get a nicer,

127
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.590
but why is all this other stuff happening to their bodies? What's going on?

128
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.910
<v 0>Hi. Well, you know, yeah, this is the unsatisfactory answer to that problem.</v>

129
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.220
Nobody really knows why, but okay, I'm rolling on my end.

130
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.480
This is to come suffrage.

131
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.610
Here's a synchronize sync and evolutionary biologist at the University of St

132
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.200
Andrews in Scotland and he has a notion, my hypothesis for what's going on here,

133
00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:58.480
and this is just a hypothesis. Here's what he told me.

134
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.740
Did you guys go back to when a fox has a very, very little itty bitty thing,

135
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.310
an embryo inside its mother's womb, very, very, very early embryo,

136
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:09.940
like two months old to become a Fox that can survive in the world.

137
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:14.230
This little embryo needs to grow strong teeth. Yup. It has to grow for need.

138
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:17.260
The for cancer, having bone strong bone, the bone needs to grow,

139
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.730
blends and needs to grow hormones and all of these things that you need as an

140
00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:22.420
adult Fox,

141
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.860
all of them come from the same founder population of cells in an embryo. Wow,

142
00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:30.230
I didn't know that. Yeah. They called neural crest Xero.

143
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.570
When the Fox grows in these cells, they're doing these epic migrations.

144
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:36.310
These guys are like pioneers that are,

145
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.760
that are moving throughout the body and glazing these trails all over the place.

146
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.040
Some of them go out into the skin.

147
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.100
Some of them go up into the cartilage of the foxes ears.

148
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.670
Some of them go into the job and they form all these different tissues.

149
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.210
T tail, big parts of the nervous system,

150
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.880
major parts of the brain and the adrenal glands.

151
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.240
What's the adrenal gland? Well, that's the most important one for our purposes.

152
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.760
The adrenal gland pumps out when to be afraid.

153
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.490
Ah, your adrenal glands say, what am I running with?

154
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.770
[inaudible] that makes the fox go, whatever that sounds like.

155
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.190
It's the one that makes that sound.

156
00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:16.130
So when you're breeding fear out of an animal,

157
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.440
<v 3>maybe what you're doing is you're slowing down</v>

158
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.910
the migrations of these cells.

159
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.840
They don't deliver the fear and that they don't deliver all the other things

160
00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.940
that they usually do. What you're focusing on,

161
00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:34.190
what you as the experiment are doing is saying,

162
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.000
I want the guys whose adrenal glands don't mature quickly that might have the

163
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:40.190
function of making the animal more tame.

164
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.420
But what you're doing as a byproduct of that is selecting for guys who don't get

165
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:47.630
as many of those cells into their ears and don't get as many of those cells into

166
00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:51.440
their skin and don't get as many of those cells into their teeth.

167
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.950
<v 0>So if you get some of the cells you need to make your ears for in straight but</v>

168
00:09:57.621 --> 00:09:59.400
not quite enough, then your ear,

169
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.050
it'll go up to a certain point and since the cells aren't going to complete the

170
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:07.260
deal, the rest of your ear flops over. Really? Yeah.

171
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:12.240
You haven't come because dogs have little floppy yabbies because the cells have

172
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:15.180
been slowed down to the point where they don't finish the job.

173
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.810
<v 2>They were there. They are literally arrested. Bingo.</v>

174
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.570
The argument is that actually when you select against aggression in animals,

175
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.410
you're changing the timing and the rate of development such that the

176
00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:29.770
experimental foxes are actually frozen as juveniles.

177
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.700
They actually never really grow up

178
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:37.820
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

179
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.890
<v 3>So then to domesticate a file</v>

180
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.270
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

181
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.460
<v 0>just like to domesticate a wolf into a dog.</v>

182
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.720
What you're doing is you're making them permanent puppies.

183
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.440
It's a Peter pan kind of thing. They just [inaudible].

184
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:57.070
So if we wanted to apply this to to us and we want it to say breed a gentler,

185
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.660
sleeker human being, yeah, we should just kill the football players.

186
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.700
Is that the idea where he would kill the football?

187
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.010
You don't have something against football player? No, actually I like football.

188
00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:11.060
But I mean like with the foxes, you just eliminate the meanings. Oh the me, yes.

189
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.720
With the same thing happened to us. That's where it gets really interesting.

190
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.560
I remember the professor, we interviewed him a few hours back.

191
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.330
A Richard Wrangham vividly. Well, um, when we think about humans,

192
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.870
obviously we're getting, you know, just super speculative, but he says,

193
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.850
if you choose to go back, if we go back just 30,000, 50,000 years,

194
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.230
can you look at the collection of skulls or the early versions of us from way

195
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:40.790
back then? You see some interesting fucks like changes. Well,

196
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.910
if you look at a domesticated animals,

197
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.260
they have smaller teeth than the wild ancestors.

198
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.470
And in humans we've been getting smaller teeth over the last few tens of

199
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.160
thousands of years. Josh,

200
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.030
<v 4>like the Fox, we've been getting more grass aisle bones. That means to say that,</v>

201
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.620
um, for a particular length of limb bone, it becomes a little bit narrower.

202
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.940
So it is tempting to think that the same kind of processes been going on in

203
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:12.880
humans as has been going on in domesticated animals,

204
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:17.260
which is that there has been natural selection in favor of a kinder,

205
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.070
gentler human, always thickened endo. Who's doing the selecting?

206
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.900
In the case of the foxes,

207
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.000
Mr BLF shuck you if you were too aggressive.

208
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.360
Who's selecting the, who's domesticating the humans? Well,

209
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.870
one idea that has been specifically suggested is that a,

210
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:39.871
it was the growing tendency for our hunter gatherer ancestors to settle down in,

211
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.060
um, in stable

212
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.720
<v 0>camps. Do you mean like summer camps?</v>

213
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.370
Let's sing songs around the mile. I'm talking about communities. Look,

214
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:52.320
if you are in a very small family group,

215
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.200
well then it pays to be big and strong and mean.

216
00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:58.110
Because if you're the biggest guy and you meet a smaller guy and he's got some

217
00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.840
potatoes, you grab him, eat his potatoes,

218
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.410
beat him up and then move on to the next till you never have to see him again.

219
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.350
But let's say that as time passes,

220
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.430
human society grows a little bit. You form camps,

221
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.410
we might have 30 or 40 people.

222
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.760
That way you can build bigger fires and you can catch more bunnies and you can

223
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:22.500
defend against enemies. But in this world, if you beat everybody up,

224
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:27.660
you may not survive that one pitted against anybody else one-on-one.

225
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.940
The big strong mean guys turned on.

226
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.520
We gonna win when big strong mean doesn't win.

227
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.820
And we see this in some primates is when you can start to form coalitions.

228
00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:39.570
When you can start to have multiple individuals who say, hey mean guy, stop it.

229
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.190
Yeah, you're bigger than any one of us,

230
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.030
but you can't take on both of us or all three of us or our whole group.

231
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:45.401
<v 4>No,</v>

232
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:50.320
we've got other males in the community who aren't going to go away and they say,

233
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:51.790
okay, we're going to deal with this guy,

234
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.610
and then maybe they deal with him by shouting him down,

235
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.430
ostracizing him or even capital punishment

236
00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.840
<v 0>and Richard Wrangham.</v>

237
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.190
His theory is that if that happens enough times to enough bullies who then can't

238
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:05.870
have kids and spread their genes because they have the unfortunate condition of

239
00:14:05.871 --> 00:14:06.680
being dead,

240
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.680
then we've essentially bred out the more aggressive jeans or we have

241
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.570
domesticated ourselves.

242
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.820
We're really talking about groups versus individuals here and so in a sense I

243
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:25.420
think we're really talking about the beginning of society and a on a kind of

244
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:27.280
rule of law in the way that we think of it.

245
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:40.630
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

246
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.890
<v 0>and this pressure to be a little more gentle and to be a little bit more</v>

247
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:47.020
cooperative is hasn't gone away.

248
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.560
I think if anything were being selected to work together more.

249
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.800
<v 3>Okay tip to be able to tolerate being packed in even tighter.</v>

250
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.270
If you put 20 chimps on a jet plane and tried to send them across the Atlantic,

251
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.810
let me tell you that only one or two would walk off that plane alive.

252
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.100
We do this all the time.

253
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:08.510
We take it for granted as human beings that big groups of people can get along

254
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:09.344
with one another.

255
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.920
I do think that it's reasonable to imagine that humans have a future of

256
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.350
increasing self domestication.

257
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.490
What I sent you proposing is that as the earth gets more crowded,

258
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:23.690
all the creatures on earth,

259
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.600
or at least ascension creatures have to start learning to live with each other

260
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:28.670
to the mark because they keep bumping into each other.

261
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.330
The winners will be the domesticated ones.

262
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.460
Everyone will get more empathetic to each other because that's the only way you

263
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:39.350
survive. Let me get gentler and gentler and gentler to lambs.

264
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.760
Literally lie down with lions. You said it beautifully.

265
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.040
<v 0>Uh,</v>

266
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.010
<v 4>what do you do? You believe it? Well,</v>

267
00:15:51.011 --> 00:15:53.980
we may have to go through one or two ups and downs before we get the,

268
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.510
and of course there's something slightly alarming about the fact that, um,

269
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.890
one possible mechanism by which domestication has happened in humans is through

270
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.150
literally execution of the more aggressive types,

271
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.210
but in the long term. Sure.

272
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.380
Let's hope that all of us become more,

273
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.140
<v 0>most sloppy is exactly</v>

274
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.830
like patches on the ends of our tails.

275
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.490
Remember when the new police started working together? Now you have, oh my God,

276
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.760
we've investigated. Yes.

277
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.130
You have to have noticed your years have been looking at these different,

278
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.760
easily. Show me your teeth. Smile.

279
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.200
Anyhow, we should go to reg or not. Just go to the big break. Yeah.

280
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.090
Just the break that exists between us and everything else. Yes.

281
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.640
Let's listen to the way we ended all. Bye.
