00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:04.658
(digital tones beeping)

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:09.760
- Our next speaker,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.760
which I did introduce for our
mobile consult service panel,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.020
but I will briefly
introduce Dr. Ihle again.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.107
She is a psychiatrist
extraordinaire from UCSF

00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:25.833
and part of our Mobile
Service Consult Team.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.870
And Dr. Ihle, where are you
here, somewhere, here you are.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.920
Currently the Director of the
Community Consultation Program

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.540
in the Division of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry at UCSF

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.060
and the interim Medical
Director of the Division

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.870
of Infant, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.140
at San Francisco General Hospital.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.890
And today she is gonna talk
to us, it's a long title here,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.300
but it's Psychopharmacology for Anxiety

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.210
and Stress-Related
Behavioral Dysregulation

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.580
in Neurodevelopmental Disorders.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.338
Dr. Ihle, thank you.

00:01:02.338 --> 00:01:05.505
(audience applauding)

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.210
- Well thank you for having me again,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.520
and for that introduction.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.520
And yes, the title is
long because I wanted

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.920
to be sure that everyone
was clear about what it is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.520
that we're gonna be talking about.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.520
And that it is a mouthful but
it does kind of encapsulate

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.090
the extent to which these
disorders take up a lot

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.300
of time and space in terms of our patients

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.610
and our families and the
people who take care of them.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.350
Anxiety disorders are really important,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.910
especially when we include
stress-related disorders

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.100
and I'll go through how we're

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.660
distinguishing those momentarily.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.253
So I still don't have
anything to disclose.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.943
And so in terms of our overview,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.450
what's I think the most important piece

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.450
to this presentation might
be is that anxiety symptoms,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.133
as well as fear responses
often go unrecognized.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.140
These are internal states
and often when individuals

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.550
finally come to clinical attention,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.500
it's because these symptoms have gotten

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.380
to be quite severe.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.913
And when we talk about internal states,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.580
we use that term to
distinguish from externalizing

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.230
behaviors, so things that
we typically think about

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.660
when we are thinking about
outbursts or tantrums

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.930
or dysregulated behavior.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.930
And so the issues are
complicated in that again

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.340
these symptoms are internal.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.700
And so clinicians tend to be unaccustomed

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.620
to even considering these
symptoms in the setting

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680
of neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.160
Again they're not obvious and so they tend

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.190
to go unrecognized.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.500
And then when and if they are recognized,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.750
then we are also facing this issue

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.300
of diagnostic overshadowing
which means these symptoms

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.260
basically get attributed to the
neurodevelopmental disorder.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.810
They're not seen as something
different or separate

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.673
from the neurodevelopmental disorder.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.860
And then even more important I
think than this clarification

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.730
of the symptoms is the idea
that when these symptoms

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.730
go unrecognized, they cause
a great deal of suffering.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.900
And related to that suffering is morbidity

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.310
that is unnecessary because
these symptoms can be treated

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.750
and hence the third point.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.060
Effective treatment does exist.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.993
And so that will be the focus
of my presentation today.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.870
I wanted to highlight the
fact that even though my title

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.480
is focused on the
pharmacologic interventions,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.620
I also want to highlight the fact that

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.490
there are non-pharmacologic interventions

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.420
and I'll actually touch on a few of those

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.543
toward the end of my presentation.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.610
So the learning objectives
that I included here

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.420
are pretty concrete.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.683
I acknowledge that.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.530
So it's about numbers but
more importantly I think,

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.450
instead of focusing on the
concrete learning objectives,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.040
if we think about the more abstract idea

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.040
that in neurodevelopmental
disorders, there often is

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.440
a lot of anxiety.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.230
Some of our local experts
here at UCSF and Stanford

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.230
and Davis suggest that
anxiety is basically part

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.740
of the diaphysis of, at least in terms

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.740
of autism spectrum disorders
and that we might even think

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.530
about some of the symptoms
of autism as being

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.903
on the spectrum of anxiety disorders.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.710
Again, this is personal communication.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.070
This is their opinion,
but I thought it was

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.030
an interesting point that
I thought I should transmit

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.690
to this audience as well.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.620
So that's the more abstract objective

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.620
that anxiety disorders and
symptoms are quite prevalent

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.370
and it's really important
to be able to identify them

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.053
and then treat them.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.210
So I've been talking
around anxiety symptoms

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.210
and so here I am actually
going to go into more detail.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.110
So as I mentioned just
a moment ago, they are,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.190
they're considered prominent features

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.120
of autism spectrum disorders and likely

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.260
neurodevelopmental disorders
writ large as well.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.260
And many studies have suggested
that anxiety disorder,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.288
not just the symptoms but
a comorbid anxiety disorder

00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:42.270
is present in roughly 40% of individuals

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.480
with autism spectrum disorders.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.670
And we consider them
separate disorders because

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.480
the anxiety symptoms,
not the autism symptoms,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.810
but the anxiety symptoms
are the ones that interfere

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.310
with daily functioning and that cause

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.883
impairment or distress.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.490
And these symptoms, these
distressing or interfering

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.490
symptoms include a number
of items on this list.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.810
So the need for perfectionism,
for doing things

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.810
just so and not tolerating
things that are not perfect,

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.730
things that are not lined
up the way they have them

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.120
or things that are suddenly
in a different place

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.713
from where they were left.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.210
Additionally there's
the reassurance seeking.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.150
That's less distressing for the patient

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.750
or the subject and perhaps more an issue

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.305
for the person caring for the individual.

00:07:47.305 --> 00:07:51.470
Then there are issues around perseveration

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.000
as well as rumination.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.200
So perseveration is, we can think of it

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.930
as more of the behavioral issues,

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.400
doing things over and over again

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.610
or wanting to do things
over and over again.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.560
Rumination is more of the thinking version

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.250
of perseveration.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.920
And then resistance to change.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.252
So people think about resistance to change

00:08:12.252 --> 00:08:16.540
as something quintessentially autistic

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.850
but for kids who are
anxious, not having change

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.490
is actually very anxiety binding.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.590
It helps to mitigate anxiety symptoms.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.590
So that's why these
symptoms sound very similar.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.760
The idea of change is
very anxiety-provoking

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.440
for lots of kids, and then particularly

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.453
in the setting of autism
spectrum disorders.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.740
And I just wanted to
describe a representative

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.130
anxiety disorder.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.050
This is what comes to
clinical attention a lot

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.540
and those are specific phobias.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.700
So, and again, this is
just one of the many

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.810
anxiety disorders that exist, but it's one

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.810
that we often ask to intervene about.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.040
So the definition of a specific phobia

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.210
is a fear and sometimes an anxiety

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.010
that's triggered by a
singular event, a situation,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.530
an object, and it often develops
after a traumatic event.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.407
So kids who are afraid
of dogs have often had

00:09:35.407 --> 00:09:39.070
an encounter with a dog
that was very distressing

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.330
or frightening and that event
is not necessarily remembered

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.260
nor is it necessarily in
the caregiver's awareness.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.040
So the child may have had
an encounter with a dog

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.570
that the caregiver didn't know about.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.030
And so this dog phobia seems
to come out of nowhere.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:02.030
But in reality it could
represent a traumatic experience

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.573
with a dog that the
caregiver was not aware of.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.150
And there are thought to be
temperamental risk factors

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.863
associated with the
development of specific phobia.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.693
So kids who tend to be
more inhibited, more shy

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.543
seem to be at greater
risk for specific phobia.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.380
So again, this is just one representative

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.350
anxiety disorder.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.637
There are others such as
generalized anxiety disorder

00:10:32.637 --> 00:10:35.616
but I chose this one as the representative

00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:39.870
again because it presents so commonly

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.193
in our population.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.950
So then I also wanna focus a little bit

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.870
on trauma and stress-related disorders.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.620
I was glad that so many
of our speakers today

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.620
have emphasized trauma
because it is so important

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.720
in every kid that we
encounter, every individual

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.780
that we encounter, we
just don't think about it

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.753
often enough.

00:11:09.092 --> 00:11:12.817
And in my clinical
experience, we don't pay

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.880
enough attention to trauma.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.310
And again, not just the
trauma of a singular event,

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.560
a natural disaster or
the death of a parent,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.560
but those what we would
consider little traumas,

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.780
the adverse childhood experiences,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.780
those traumas that add up
and the cumulative effect

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.970
is very traumatic and they
have a significant impact

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:46.520
during development.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.210
And so I'm not talking necessarily about

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.900
what we classically would call PTSD

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.900
but I'm focusing more on
what child psychiatrists

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.210
tend to think about which
is the developmental

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.493
trauma disorder.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:06.730
And again in this
situation, in this disorder,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.420
we're talking about stressors or trauma

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.660
that can be of many forms
and I wanna highlight

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.010
that neglect is actually considered

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.240
the most traumatic trauma, at least

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.820
in terms of the experts in the field.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.820
And we today have spoken about
adverse childhood experiences

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:34.260
or ACEs and there are several.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.820
And one of these things is bad enough,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.020
one of the things listed
here like abuse of all sorts

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.313
and witnessing domestic
violence, incarceration,

00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:50.030
again the issue of neglect.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:55.030
But you have a series of these stressors

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.750
and they can add up to
significant impairment,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.173
not just psychologically
but physiologically as well.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.820
And they can lead to a number
of problematic consequences

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.080
that manifest in terms of
behaviors in our patients.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.180
So I just wanna take a
few minutes and talk about

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.380
the stress reaction again
because I would assert

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.570
to this audience that
we don't recognize this

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.570
often enough and that I think we need

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.560
to think about it more.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.160
So I wanted to take a few
minutes and highlight this

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.530
and talk about the stress reaction

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.130
and response to fear.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.840
And that humans have a stress reaction.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.140
When we tend to think
about fight or flight,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.230
this is what tends to come to mind.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.780
We recognize that this
is a stress reaction,

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.283
a stress response, a fear response.

00:14:01.283 --> 00:14:03.890
And so this we're able to recognize

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.210
but it's important to remember that humans

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.640
have a stress response too.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.810
It may not be as obvious and
sometimes actually it is.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.650
But humans will have dilated pupils.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.430
They'll have increased
heart rate, increased

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.150
respiration rate.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.963
They may not hiss, sometimes they do.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.563
I've had my share of kids
in my office hissing.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.190
And they're definitely
communicating loud and clear

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.110
that they are having a stress reaction.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.830
And just because I'm showing
pictures of critters,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.150
it is not meant at all to
minimize the significance

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.943
of a stress response in a human.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.590
I very much appreciate
that the stress response

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.300
is a very strong response,
just that we tend

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.020
not to think about it when we think

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.563
about our human patients.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.480
And I'd also like to point
out that there's a reason

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.470
that we have a stress response.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.140
It's actually adaptive to feal fear.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.660
Fear is a normal response to threat.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.130
It's what keeps us alive.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.400
This idea of fight or flight or freeze,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.600
we don't think about the freezing as much,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.100
it's supports our survival.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.700
There is a reason that this still exists,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.113
that we still have this instinct.

00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:31.680
So it's actually a good thing
to have a stress response

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.250
in terms of things that keep us alive.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.460
But there's also the
maladaptive consequences

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.700
of the stress response and
this is where I'm going

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.700
with this point, that even
though a stress response

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.230
can be healthy, there is a continuum.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:56.230
And on the other end of the continuum,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.550
we are talking about a pathologic state

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.550
and that the pathology can be manifest

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.880
in different ways and
whether there's an individual

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.503
with a neurodevelopmental
disability or not,

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.390
the distress that the
fear response generates

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.270
can have a significant
impact on functioning,

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.293
whether it's social functioning
or academic functioning,

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.540
there is distress and
a resulting impairment.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.890
And the significance of considering this

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.590
during development is
that this stress response,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.300
the pathologic stress response will have

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.363
an impact on development
on that it will prevent

00:16:42.363 --> 00:16:46.770
or limit appropriate adaptive behavior.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.870
And this is what we are conceptualizing

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.290
in this term toxic stress.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.020
Additional features are
the physiologic impact.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.580
I'm not gonna go into those today,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.320
but when you hear about toxic stress,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.463
this is what we're referring to.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.500
All right so with that
background about anxiety

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.500
and stress, I'll shift now
into what we can do about it.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.140
So not surprisingly, the
nature of the distress

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.650
or the dysfunction will
influence our treatment approach.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:28.470
And there are quite a
number of interventions.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:33.360
I talked about the pharmacologic
and non pharmacologic.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.410
Non pharmacologic interventions
include psychosocial support

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.050
somatic interventions like
neurofeedback or biofeedback

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.730
and psychotherapy as well, in addition

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.550
to behavioral therapy.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:52.550
And so I will talk briefly
about the latter two

00:17:53.116 --> 00:17:54.573
treatment approaches.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.630
So when we think about
pharmacotherapy, we can classify

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.000
our options into three major classes,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.570
the serotonergic agents, adrenergic agents

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.140
and neuroleptics.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:15.780
So serotonergic agents you're
probably most familiar with.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.800
These are things like
fluoxetine or Prozac,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.537
sertraline or Zoloft and
mirtazapine or Remeron

00:18:24.052 --> 00:18:26.600
and venlafaxine, which is Effexor.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.600
So these are the medications
that affect the levels

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.433
of serotonin in the synapse.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.860
Then there are specific adrenergic agents.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.320
I particularly like the adrenergic agents

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.090
because these are the things that actually

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.300
target the stress response proper.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.460
So the circuitry that underlies our

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.143
fight or flight reaction.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.881
And there are a number
of these agents as well

00:18:54.881 --> 00:18:58.200
and I'll talk about
clonidine and guanfacine.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.240
These are things that can be scheduled

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.520
on a daily basis.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.170
Propranolol is your basic beta blocker

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:11.170
and it can be actually a very
effective as needed medication

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.140
and it can also be scheduled as well.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.130
Prazosin we use when we
are concerned about kids

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.830
having nightmares.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.610
And then the neuroleptics,
they're otherwise knows

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:28.610
as the antipsychotic
agents and these are more

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.430
for behavioral management.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.170
So it doesn't specifically target anxiety

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.660
but it helps to manage
the behavioral outbursts

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.713
associated with a stress response.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.683
So we'll go into a little more detail.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.653
The SSRIs, so selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors

00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:54.740
do what the name suggests,
block the reuptake

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.590
of serotonin.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.990
So when serotonin is
released into the synapse,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.860
the way that you stop that signal is

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.650
to clear the synapse of serotonin.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.550
And you do that by
taking the serotonin back

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.470
into the presynaptic
terminal that released it

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.630
in the first place.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.260
These medications block that process.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.540
So the serotonin that was
released just hangs around longer

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:22.540
and so it can act on the
receptor on the receiving end

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.550
of the synapse.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:29.475
And these medications are
helpful when we treat anxiety

00:20:29.475 --> 00:20:33.820
in the setting of
polypharmacy, so when there

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.630
are other medications
onboard and individuals

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.729
with neurodevelopmental
disorders in our experience

00:20:41.729 --> 00:20:46.729
with CART and with (mumbles),
we often see individuals

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.930
who are on a slew of medications, whether

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.207
appropriately or not.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.480
That's the reality and
we need to think about

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.448
an intervention, a
pharmacologic intervention

00:20:59.448 --> 00:21:03.970
that doesn't have problematic
drug-drug interactions

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.970
and serotonin reuptake
inhibitors are such medications.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.510
And I'm talking about all polypharmacy.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.430
I'm not just talking about
psychotropic polypharmacy.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.900
I'm talking about lots of polypharmacy.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.670
So every medical disorder
that can be treated

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.913
with a pharmacologic agent,
we need to take into account.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.360
It's important to note
that all SSRIs are not

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.090
created equal.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.943
In fact there are generational
shifts with SSRIs.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:42.030
The older flavors, fluoxetine or Prozac,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:47.300
paroxetine or Paxil and
fluvoxamine or Luvox,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.660
they tend to have more side effects

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.970
and more drug-drug interactions
relatively speaking

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:57.220
compared to their newer generation.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:02.220
And so these, we use them more cautiously.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.270
They can be very
effective but we just need

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:12.270
to keep in mind that they may
have drug-drug interactions.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.470
I have to tell you that
as a child psychiatrist,

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.060
we do not prescribe paroxetine.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.963
We do not prescribe Paxil
for a lot of reasons.

00:22:22.003 --> 00:22:25.950
But again, it has a
lot to do with the fact

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.180
that it's this older generation drug

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.300
and it has way too many side effects

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.073
for us to be comfortable with.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.900
That being said, we can use side effects

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.290
to our patient's advantage.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.680
So side effects aren't always bad.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.610
And what that means is that
if there's a medication

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.260
that causes sedation, that's
not necessarily a bad thing

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.000
if anxiety is causing a person
to have difficulty sleeping.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.580
So we harness that side effect.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.670
We schedule the medication for bedtime

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.280
and we've managed to use that medication

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.430
even more effectively than otherwise.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.710
So side effects aren't
necessarily a bad thing.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.840
It's just important to know what they are

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.143
so that you can use
them to your advantage.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:18.030
It's also important to
recognize pharmacokinetics

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.970
and pharmacodynamics.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.320
That's the reason that we
have to learn these things.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.720
And some have shorter
half lives than others

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.700
which mean that we need to be
careful in terms of dosing.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.930
Some drugs just aren't
good for once daily dosing

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.230
and we need to think
about dosing twice a day.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.040
And we've talked around side effects.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:42.160
So I'll mention that the
most prominent side effects

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.710
with SSRIs are related to GI disturbance.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.690
So lots of tummy aches.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.970
Some people get constipated.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.220
Some people get diarrhea.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.880
Headaches are also a common complaint.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.880
And sexual dysfunction
is also very prominent.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:05.090
And it can be a reason that
people discontinue medication

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.250
so it's important to
think about that as well.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.523
We also get weird side effects
like increased sweating.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.240
Some people do become more agitated

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.240
and there is still the black
box warning on antidepressants.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:26.080
So there were some controversial findings

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.110
about antidepressants in general.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.300
It started out with just SSRIs and now

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.213
it's been broadened to include
every single antidepressant.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.110
There is a controversial
finding that these medications

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.930
were associated with
increased suicidal thinking,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:48.230
not increased suicidal
behavior or completed suicide,

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.533
suicidal thought.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.780
The studies were not done very well at all

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.800
but it did lead, the studies did lead

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.110
to a black box warning which means that

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.730
when we prescribe these
medications, we have

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.530
to monitor very closely and check in

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:10.330
on our patients weekly as
we're increasing the dose

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.883
or changing to a different medication.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.280
And this point about QTC.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.520
It's a detail that I don't need to go into

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.070
unless there are questions about it

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.480
and I'm happy to answer it.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.140
But in the interest of time, I'll move on.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.140
Other odd issues relate to
increased bleeding problems.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.330
So this is something that
we need to think about

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.050
for girls who are
prescribed this medication.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.710
So in case there's
already problematic issues

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.620
around having periods, then we need

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.810
to be prepared for the
possibility that these agents

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.960
will worsen flow and that is because

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.653
of the action on platelet function.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.230
So there are other serotonergic agents

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.470
that have dual activity.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:10.470
So the serotonergic noradrenergic
reuptake inhibitors,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.040
those are duloxetine or Cymbalta

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.880
and venlafaxine or Effexor.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.440
And these are really helpful
when we're treating anxiety

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.853
in the setting of pain.

00:26:23.864 --> 00:26:27.636
And the side effect profile is similar.

00:26:27.636 --> 00:26:30.433
Again, sweating, GI issues.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.540
Sometimes people can have
increases in their blood pressure,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.410
not too significant but if there is a bump

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.343
in the blood pressure, then
you need to track that.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.260
These medications are
more often associated

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.800
with what's called
discontinuation syndrome

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.060
which means that if
individuals skip a few doses

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.093
then they're not gonna feeling so good.

00:26:59.815 --> 00:27:03.707
And so it's really important
that the daily dosing

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.411
of these medications is consistent.

00:27:08.411 --> 00:27:12.950
They've also been associated with seizures

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.903
in high doses, so like in
the setting of overdose.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.240
Mirtazapine, the alphabet
soup here is a noradrenergic

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.320
specific serotonergic antidepressant.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.750
And that basically means that it acts

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:34.610
at a couple of different
receptors, adrenergic receptors

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.530
as well as serotonin receptors.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.640
So this doesn't increase
the amount of serotonin

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.473
in the synapse.

00:27:40.473 --> 00:27:44.513
This acts directly at serotonin receptors.

00:27:45.652 --> 00:27:49.620
The bottom line is that it takes effect

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.923
much more quickly.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:57.510
So I happen to like this
medication because its effects

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.150
are much more rapid in terms of onset

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.920
and it actually has a side effect profile

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.893
that is often relevant for my patients,

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.820
especially in terms of being sedating.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.320
Again, kids who have trouble sleeping

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.690
do really well on this medication.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.450
It does cause weight gain and it can cause

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:28.450
metabolic syndrome and
on very rare occasions

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.820
it cause a decrease in white blood cells.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.120
So this medication
actually requires lab work.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.500
So for individuals who
don't tolerate lab draws,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.013
blood draws, this probably
not a good option.

00:28:44.247 --> 00:28:46.553
So I just needed to point that out.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.290
So now we're shifting to
medications that treat

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.470
the stress response.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.910
The medications that we
were discussing focused

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.700
on treatment of anxiety.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.380
These sets of medications target the

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.410
stress response circuitry.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:06.410
So clonidine is an agent
that works directly

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.890
on the brain circuitry.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.830
It works centrally, so it
actually targets the circuits

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.133
that control the fight or flight response.

00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:20.220
And again, the alphabet soup just suggests

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.450
the designation of which
type of adrenergic receptors

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.333
are targeted.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.030
It comes in immediate release formulations

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.860
as well as extended release.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:35.160
And the immediate
release requires at least

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.150
three times a day dosing.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.500
And the reason for that
is that there's a risk

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.980
of rebound hypertension.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.120
So when we use this medication, it lowers

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.980
the blood pressure, which is appropriate

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.130
for addressing the stress response.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.730
But if you go too long
without your next dose,

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.270
then you can have a rebound, a spike

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.650
in your blood pressure again.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.320
So again, it's important
to keep steady level

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.153
in the bloodstream.

00:29:59.153 --> 00:30:02.410
So missing doses is
problematic which is why

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.630
I prefer the other medication that works

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.120
on the stress response circuitry

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.327
and that will be our next slide.

00:30:08.327 --> 00:30:12.582
Because it's now made in an
extended release formulation,

00:30:12.582 --> 00:30:15.530
that is my go to option for clonidine

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.560
if I want to use clonidine.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.510
I often don't want to use clonidine

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:23.720
just because its side effect
profile is more problematic

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.360
than its cousin, which is guanfacine.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.610
So guanfacine is basically
the next generation

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.220
of clonidine.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.180
It's more selective than
clonidine, which is good.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.690
It has a better side effect
profile, which is good

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.590
and it has a longer half
life, which is also good,

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.913
relative to clonidine.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.710
There is an extended release version.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:51.530
It is used to treat ADHD.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.040
This version of guanfacine
is known as Intuniv.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.220
But it is actually still effective in

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.040
treating the stress response.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.510
And the benefit of using extended release

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.510
versus immediate release are not great.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.550
It's convenient, once
daily dosing, but in terms

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.020
of efficacy it doesn't
really do much better

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.193
than using regular guanfacine twice a day.

00:31:17.607 --> 00:31:20.730
And it's also more expensive.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.280
So my tendency is to prescribe guanfacine

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.043
and use it twice a day.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.250
So guanfacine immediate
release, I should say.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.180
Oh, and it's important to educate patients

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.630
and caregivers about the
importance of staying hydrated

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.840
with these medications.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.462
Again, these are medications
that have been used

00:31:43.462 --> 00:31:48.406
to treat blood pressure,
to lower blood pressure.

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:50.720
You don't want the blood
pressure to go too low,

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.760
so it's really important to stay hydrated.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.760
So that helps with the
possible side effects

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.630
related to low blood
pressure and it also helps

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.640
with the side effects
that are a little odd

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.520
and that's an experience of dryness.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.070
So drying out the GI tract,
which causes constipation

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:13.870
and also drying out
eyes and mouth as well.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.840
Then there are these agents that have GABA

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.300
in their name, which is
why I have GABA-ergic

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.560
in quotation marks.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.490
They don't actually act
at the GABA receptor

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.563
and also in quotation marks is maybe.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.520
So these aren't our go-to
options for treating anxiety

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.060
but they can potentially be
useful as augmenting agents.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.500
So when a medication
has been started that is

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.570
somewhat effective but
it's not doing enough,

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:56.380
then we can think about
adding these medications,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.820
these GABA-ergic medications.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:03.470
They actually work at
voltage-gated calcium channels.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.653
So they act everywhere.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.440
So it's kind of shotgun
approach to modulating

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.723
neuronal function.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:18.250
So it has an impact on all
sorts of neurotransmitters,

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.390
glutamate, norepinephrine, substance P,

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.240
so peptides in the brain.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.240
But what's nice about
these medications is that

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.590
they are renally excreted.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.610
They're not metabolized by the liver

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.963
and so there's minimal
drug-drug interaction again.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:41.000
And they happen to be FDA
approved for young children,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
which is a big deal for child
psychiatrists in particular

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.070
because we have to do a lot
of off-label prescribing

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.860
which means that the FDA
has approved medications

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.010
for use in adults.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.490
They haven't bothered to
test these medications

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.323
in children.

00:34:00.323 --> 00:34:02.740
There just isn't a big enough
market to motivate them

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.680
to do that.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.150
So they don't bother to
test these drugs in kids

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.783
unless there's a market for it.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.670
So we have to presume
that being safe in adults

00:34:16.994 --> 00:34:19.560
means that there is a level of safety

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.030
for use in kids.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:24.000
And so we just do very close monitoring

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.700
of these medications that
are not FDA-approved in kids.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.090
Fortunately these GABA-ergics, gabapentin

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.563
and pregabalin are FDA
approved for use in kids.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.500
So even though there are a
few drug-drug interactions,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.800
there are some problematic side effects

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:51.250
and these include blurred
vision, edema or swelling

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:57.590
of the limbs, some potential
wobbliness or tremor.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.780
And again, this is related to the fact

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.140
that it's a shotgun approach.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.910
So every neuron in the
brain is gonna be affected

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.283
by these agents.

00:35:08.283 --> 00:35:11.430
So neurons, not just in the cortex, but

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.770
in the cerebellum, everywhere in the brain

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.560
is gonna be affected by these drugs.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.650
And so not surprisingly, we see symptoms

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.220
that are related to cerebral dysfunction,

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.733
cerebellar dysfunction, sorry.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:30.934
And then I've saved neuroleptics for last

00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:35.180
in part again because
they don't treat anxiety.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.210
They treat behavioral
dysregulation and mostly

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.520
in the setting of stress response.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.390
The FDA has approved two
medications for this purpose

00:35:47.574 --> 00:35:52.117
and especially in the setting
of agitation in autism.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.950
The two medications are
risperidone or Risperdal

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.593
and aripiprazole or Abilify.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:06.430
And Risperdal is associated
with significant weight gain.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.580
Aripiprazole not so
much, but both can cause

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.840
metabolic syndrome or
changes in blood sugar

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.663
and cholesterol levels.

00:36:17.784 --> 00:36:21.060
So some individuals can't
tolerate these medications.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.280
If that's the case, then
quetiapine or Seroquel

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.080
can be helpful.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.780
Not only does it treat
behavioral dysregulation,

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.130
it actually has anxiolytic properties

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.723
or anxiety-reducing properties.

00:36:37.299 --> 00:36:42.299
So it can be a backup agent if Risperdal

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.483
and Abilify are ineffective.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.560
Then we've talked about things to use.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.560
I want to highlight medications
that we should avoid using.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.200
Those are the benzodiazepines
and the antihistamines.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.230
I say that we shouldn't
use them because they

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.123
actually don't treat anything.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:11.970
They mask symptoms and
that approach bothers me.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.650
I don't wanna mask a situation.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.243
I wanna treat a situation.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.150
So philosophically it's problematic

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:25.100
to use these medications
but also functionally

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.220
it's problematic because these
medications are associated

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.150
with a higher risk of
delirium, disinhibition

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.300
and dependence, so the three Ds.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.200
Disinhibition basically
means that if you're trying

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.833
to treat agitation, you actually
can make agitation worse.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.520
So instead of using those medications,

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.480
these tend to be used
on an as-needed basis

00:37:53.205 --> 00:37:56.430
and as an alternative, again propranolol

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.743
and gabapentin are preferred.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.773
And I mentioned the
importance of monitoring.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.538
So when we use these
medications, it's important

00:38:11.538 --> 00:38:15.010
to check on how they're having an impact

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.900
on physiology.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.023
For some medications it's
more important than others.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.870
For the serotonergic agents, it's good

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:29.130
to check electrolytes at
least once a year if we can.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.930
If we can't, then there
are ways to monitor

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:38.363
electrolyte levels clinically
without having to poke.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:44.320
But if we are able to draw
labs then we should do so,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.523
at least once a year.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.450
As I mentioned, the SNRIs
can elevate blood pressure

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.050
and so it's good if we
can check blood pressure

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.683
at clinic visits.

00:38:57.015 --> 00:39:00.360
And one of the SNRIs,
duloxetine, can cause

00:39:02.274 --> 00:39:04.350
liver enzyme changes.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:09.350
And so it's helpful to
check liver function tests,

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:14.580
LFTs, liver function tests if
you've prescribed duloxetine.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.900
And then again I
mentioned that mirtazapine

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.631
can be very rarely
associated with these drops

00:39:21.631 --> 00:39:23.820
in white blood cells.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.330
So it's important to check the CBC

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.610
or the complete blood
cell count, as well as

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.483
glucose and cholesterol because
of the metabolic syndrome.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.910
So again, I mentioned that the focus was

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:44.770
on pharmacotherapy but
it's important to think

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.000
about pharmacotherapy
in the broader context

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
of intervention and I want
to emphasize the point

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.710
that when we're treating anxiety

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.000
or treating a stress
response, we shouldn't

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.713
just use medications.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:08.400
Medications should be used
if the other interventions

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.660
still have residual
symptoms, that they're not

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.170
taking care of every component
of the stress response

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.003
or anxiety symptoms.

00:40:19.432 --> 00:40:24.050
So it's important to have
these other interventions

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:28.180
occurring simultaneously or
to precede pharmacotherapy

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.013
I would say.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.760
And so I wanted to
focus on a specific type

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.653
of psychotherapy which is
actually behavioral therapy.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.150
It tends not to be seen as psychotherapy

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.430
but I will include it here.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:46.530
And the types of behavioral
therapy that we tend

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:51.090
to recommend are cognitive
behavior therapy or CBT,

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.660
exposure and response prevention or ERP

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.623
and then relaxation techniques.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.850
So CBT has the most
extensive evidence base

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.823
of these behavioral therapies.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.500
It tends to be problem
focused and goal oriented

00:41:09.616 --> 00:41:13.510
and addresses cognition, the C of CBT.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:18.510
And it tends to involve skill building.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:23.890
So it requires homework
and that the sessions

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:30.110
with the therapist are
basically training sessions

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.270
that include the expectation
that the individual

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.800
will work on the homework between sessions

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.310
and that the subsequent session reviews,

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:42.870
how that homework has
gone, and then adds on

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.750
a subsequent skill.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:49.277
So again, just in thinking
about how CBT works,

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.470
it's a very collaborative approach.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.863
It's educational and it's
meant to be empowering.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:02.810
And the target population, I
say here is in grade school.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.920
We need to think about what
that means developmentally.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.920
So what we're talking about is individuals

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.900
of a developmental age that is equivalent

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.030
to being in grade school.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.680
There are some CBT
protocols for younger kids

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.230
so the lower grades of elementary school.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:27.880
Coping Cat is one of the more common ones,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.754
a very popular one.

00:42:29.754 --> 00:42:34.754
And then Facing Your Fears
is a program developed

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.243
in Canada I believe that targets older,

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.130
developmentally older individuals.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.043
And CBT often involves ERP.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.420
They can go hand in hand,
especially for anxiety disorders

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.183
like specific phobias.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.300
So just to clarify what exposure
and response prevention is,

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.670
it's basically gradual desensitization.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.600
So again, hence the term.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.600
So you expose to something that
causes an aversive reaction

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.730
very gradually with the goal
of extinguishing the response.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.900
Most of the studies
that have looked at ERP

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.170
have been done on OCD
which back in the day

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.250
had been classified as
an anxiety disorder.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.920
It isn't anymore, but it used to be.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.080
And there are lots of
similarities to anxiety disorders

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.193
so this is why I'm including it here.

00:43:44.444 --> 00:43:46.293
And these studies have compared ERP

00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:51.350
to treatment as usual
for anxiety management

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.493
and have found that ERP is more effective.

00:43:56.828 --> 00:43:58.390
So I mentioned phobias.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:03.390
And the problem with ERP
is that when you start

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:10.040
engaging in this intervention,
you will likely elicit

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.380
an extinction burst.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:15.600
This is hard work so you
are likely going to have

00:44:18.087 --> 00:44:22.110
a greater reaction to the stimulus because

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:23.670
you're trying to change a behavior.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.870
So you kinda have to
batten down the hatches

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.430
with this one.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.410
But if you can get through
the extinction burst,

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.613
it's a very, very effective intervention.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.510
And then we talked about, or I mentioned

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:39.833
relaxation techniques as
a form of intervention.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:46.190
So things like MBSR,
mindfulness-based stress reduction,

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.400
guided imagery, biofeedback
and even progressive

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:54.300
muscle relaxation.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.863
These can be very helpful.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:02.150
Again this requires a level of calm

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:07.470
that if we're talking about
a fight or flight situation,

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.450
it's not the most effective intervention.

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:13.683
So, I'm picking up on social cues.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.700
So in summary, it says sum
up, I'm summing. (laughing)

00:45:22.421 --> 00:45:27.421
So in summary, anxiety
disorders are quite prevalent.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.770
There are a broad spectrum of symptoms.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.610
It's really, really important
to think about them early

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.661
so that we can intervene
early and treatment

00:45:37.661 --> 00:45:39.040
is quite broad.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.040
It does include pharmacology
as well as psychology.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.944
And thank you very much.

00:45:45.944 --> 00:45:49.111
(audience applauding)
