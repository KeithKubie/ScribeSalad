00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.180
Okay, so let's do this. We've taken a look

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.290
at our HTTP traffic from our client application. Let's go

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.720
back to the browser and see what it's doing differently.

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:12.502
We going to go look at the network request again and

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:14.940
if I scroll up, there's a cookie here, there's

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.260
some session data that is being maintained by the browser

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.660
and passed along. That's potentially at least part of the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.130
problem, so. What we can do then is actually maintain

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.070
session state in our code. So what I've done

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.920
here is modified what we looked at before. And in

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.200
this case, we're going to use a session object

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.280
instead of just a request object to do both our

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.020
get and our post. We'll be using the same

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.260
session object, so any session information that we get back

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.690
from this first request, will be maintained and passed

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.200
along when we make this request. Alright, let's run this.

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.250
Let me go back to the browser and see if we've

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.640
got a correct response or a response that gives us back

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.380
the data we're hoping to get. And now we could see

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.493
that the data we get, is actually what we were expecting. So,

00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:05.197
note that this is actually a local file and is in

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:09.344
fact the local file that we were writing out here. And

00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:11.774
we've got the right settings here, what we would have expected

00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:15.365
had we actually submitted this through the browser. And, we're pulling back

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:19.730
the data that we hoped to get. Still missing the CSS files, but we don't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.850
care all we care about is this data right here. Whoo hoo! We did it!
