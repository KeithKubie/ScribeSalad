00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.260
I want to make a
quick clarification

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.400
to the last video, and then
think about what's friction

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.070
up to when the block
is actually moving.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.570
So in the last
video, we started off

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.030
with the block being stationary.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.190
We knew that the
parallel component

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.030
of the force of
gravity on that block

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.734
was 49 newtons downwards,
down the slope.

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:21.150
And when the block
was stationary,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.952
we said there must be
an offsetting force.

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:24.660
And we said that's
the force of friction,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.600
and it must be 49
newtons upwards.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.010
And so they completely
net out in that direction.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.600
Now, what we said is we're going
to keep applying a little bit

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.740
more force until we
can budge this block

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.310
to start accelerating downwards.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.070
And I said I kept applying
a little bit more force,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340
a little bit more force,
until I get to 1 newton,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.569
and then the block
started to budge.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.360
So at that point, when
it started to budge,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.890
I'm applying this 1 newton
over here, right over here.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.860
There was already
49 newtons of force,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.750
or the component of
gravity, in this direction.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
So combined, we're
providing 50 newtons

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.070
to just start budging
it, to just overcome

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.240
the force of friction.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.740
The one thing I
want to clarify here

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.780
is this whole time
the force of friction

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.320
was not constant at 49 newtons.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.420
When I wasn't messing
with this block,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.390
and the parallel component of
the force was 49 newtons, then

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.670
the force of friction
was 49 newtons.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.640
When I started to press
on it a little bit,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.140
apply a little bit
of force, maybe I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.480
applied a tenth of a
newton on top of that,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.550
then the force of friction
was 49 and 1/10 newton,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.810
because it was still
providing enough force so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.690
that this block was not moving.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.930
Then maybe I applied
half a newton.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.060
And so the total force
in the downward direction

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.930
would have been 49
and 1/2 newtons.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.010
But if it still was not moving,
then the force of friction

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.469
was still completely
overcoming it.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.135
So the force of
friction, at that point,

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:48.990
must have been 49
and 1/2 newtons,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.370
all the way up to the combined
force in the downward direction

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.360
being 49.999999 newtons.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.160
And then the force of friction
was still 49.99999 newtons,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.740
all the way until I hit 50
newtons and then the block

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.600
started to budge, which tells us
that the force of friction now,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.310
all of a sudden, or at least
the force of static friction all

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.330
of a sudden now
couldn't keep up and it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.480
started to accelerate downwards.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.430
So in that static scenario,
the force of friction

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.680
changed as I applied
more or less force

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.684
in this downward direction.

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:22.350
Now with that out of
the way, let's take

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.570
a different scenario.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.600
Let me just redraw that same
block, just since all of this

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.930
is getting messy.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.140
So we have the same block, and
as we said in the last video,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.750
we're now assuming that
this is wood on wood.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.460
So this is the wedge.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.990
This is the block
right over here.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.980
We know that the component
of gravity that is parallel

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.460
to the plane right
there is 49 newtons.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.579
We know that this is 49 newtons.

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.120
We know the component
of gravity that

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.036
is perpendicular to the
plane-- we figured out

00:02:57.036 --> 00:03:00.755
this two videos ago-- is 49
square roots of 3 newtons.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.620
We know that this block
is not accelerating

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.440
in this normal
direction, so there

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.830
must be some force counteracting
gravity in that direction.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.740
And that's the normal force
of the wedge on the block.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.450
So that is going
in that direction

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.090
at 49 square roots of 3 newtons.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.330
And now instead of assuming
that this block is stationary,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.540
let's assume that it's moving
with a constant velocity.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.170
So now we're dealing
with-- let me

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.540
do that in a different color.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.640
So now we're dealing
with a scenario

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.500
where the block has
a constant velocity.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.920
And for the sake of
this video, we'll

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.100
assume that that constant
velocity is downward.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.390
And so the constant velocity,
v, is equal to-- I don't know.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.060
Let's say it is 5 meters
per second down the wedge,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.246
or down the ramp.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:01.620
Or I guess we could say in
the direction that is parallel

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.830
to the surface of the ramp.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.370
So it's in this direction
right over here.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.380
So that's the constant velocity.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.920
So what are all
the forces at play?

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.962
And be very careful here.

00:04:10.962 --> 00:04:13.045
There might be a temptation
that says, OK, there's

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:13.760
a net force here.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.320
We're moving.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.570
So maybe that's the net force
that's causing the move.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.730
But remember, this
is super important.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.370
This is Newton's first law.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.730
If you have a net force, if
you have an unbalanced force,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.230
it will cause it to accelerate.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.290
And we are not
accelerating here.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.630
We have a constant velocity.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.210
We are not accelerating here.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.760
So if you're not accelerating
in that direction,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.760
then that means that the
force in that direction

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.150
must be balanced.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.390
So there must be
some force acting

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.060
in the exactly
opposite direction that

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.450
keeps this thing from
accelerating downwards.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.110
And so it must be
exactly 49 newtons

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.160
in the opposite direction.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.740
And as you can imagine, this
is the force of friction.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.852
This right over here is
the force of friction.

00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:09.185
And the difference between
this video and the last video

00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:11.320
is last time
friction was static.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.930
Even at 49 newtons,
the box was stationary.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.140
You had to keep nudging
until you get to 50 newtons,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.330
and then it started moving.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.610
Here we're just jumping
into this picture

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.910
where we just see a
box that's moving down

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.324
the slope at 5
meters per second.

00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:24.740
So we don't know
how much force it

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.030
took to overcome
static friction.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.060
But we do know that there is
some force of friction that

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.740
is keeping this box from
accelerating, that's keeping it

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.960
at a constant velocity,
that is completely negating

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.560
the parallel component
of the force of gravity,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.130
parallel to the
surface of this plane.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.970
So given this, let's
calculate another coefficient

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.550
of friction.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.174
But this is going to
be the coefficient

00:05:47.174 --> 00:05:50.790
of kinetic friction, because now
we are moving down the block.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.130
And I'll do a video
on why sometimes

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.630
a coefficient of
static friction can

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.350
be different than
the coefficient

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.170
of kinetic friction.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.810
So the coefficient of kinetic
friction-- we'll write it.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.440
So this is the Greek letter
mu, and we put this k here

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.670
for kinetic, or we can kind
of say moving friction.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.870
It's going to be equal
to the force of friction,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.830
or I should say the magnitude
of the force of friction

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.450
over the normal force.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.610
I should say the magnitude
of the normal force.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.390
And you can derive
this experimentally.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.550
One, if you just observe
this whole thing going on

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.008
and you knew the
mass of the block,

00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:37.639
so you knew this
component of gravity

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.930
that's going in this direction.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.090
If you knew this
angle was 30 degrees

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.170
from the last situation,
you could figure out

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.360
this coefficient of
kinetic friction.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.000
And what's cool
about this is this

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.500
is in general going to be true
for any two materials that

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.350
are like this.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.215
So maybe this is a
certain type of wood

00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:55.590
on a certain type of wood, or
a certain type of sandpaper

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.630
on a certain type of sandpaper--
whatever you're talking about.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.030
And then you can use
that to make predictions

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.370
if the incline was different,
or if the mass was different,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.610
or even if you were
on a different planet,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.050
or if someone was pressing
down on this block.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.560
That would change
the normal force.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.200
So given this right
here, let's figure out--

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.430
for the sake of doing it-- the
coefficient of kinetic friction

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.580
here.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.790
The force of friction
here, completely offsetting

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.790
the parallel force of gravity
parallel to the surface,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.970
is 49 newtons.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.440
And the normal force
here, the force

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.290
of contact between these
two things, this block

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.760
and this wedge, is 49
square roots of 3 newtons.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.185
So we get 1 over the
square root of 3.

00:07:42.185 --> 00:07:43.560
And let me get
the calculator out

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.500
to get an actual number here.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.890
So we have 1 divided by
the square root of 3,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.560
which gives us 0.5--
I'll just round.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.470
0.58.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.437
It is equal to 0.58.

00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:57.770
And there's no units here,
because the units cancel out.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.920
It's a unit-less measurement.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.920
Now the interesting thing here
is that the way I've set up

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.000
this problem, the coefficient
of kinetic friction

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.170
is lower, if we assume
the same materials,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.420
than the coefficient
of static friction was.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.400
And for some materials, they
might not be that different.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.920
But for other materials,
the kinetic friction

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.470
can be lower than
static friction.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.894
You never see a situation
where the coefficient

00:08:22.894 --> 00:08:24.810
of static friction-- at
least that I know of--

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.101
is lower than kinetic friction.

00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:28.880
But you do see situations
where the coefficient

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.240
of kinetic friction is
lower than the coefficient

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.780
of static friction.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.860
Once something is
moving, for some reason--

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.650
and we'll theorize why
that might be-- friction

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.007
is a little less potent than
when something is stationary.

00:08:47.007 --> 00:08:49.090
So we can say this generally,
that the coefficient

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:54.890
of kinetic friction is less
than or equal to the coefficient

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.280
of static friction.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.260
It's a little bit easier, or
friction provides a little less

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.780
than or equal to the force
when something's moving

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.637
than when something
is stationary.

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:07.470
So I'll think about
that a little bit deeper

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.440
in the next video.
