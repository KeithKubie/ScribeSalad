00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.400
When was the last time that you thought about attraction?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.640
Was it an hour ago?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.840
5 minutes?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.049
10 seconds?

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.110
It's likely that other people are thinking
about it as much as you are.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.980
Here's seven psychological things we do
that make us less attractive.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.640
Number one; acting cool and distant.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.710
While procrastination might feel good, it
isn't attractive.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.300
In 1992, two psychologists named Marlon and
Beach were curious about the relationship

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.649
between how many times you see someone and
how attractive you find them.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.850
They had four women pretend to be students
in a large intro psych class.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.079
At the end of the semester, students in the
class were asked to rate how attractive they

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.359
found each of the women.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.519
What the researchers found, was that the fewer
classes a woman attended, the less attractive

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.480
they were rated by other students.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.499
The other students basically forgot about
her.

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:57.079
I'll try and remember this study the next
time I have to psych myself up to go to class.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.170
Number two; acting clingy.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.749
It's the classic young love phenomenon, constantly
hanging out together.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.810
Three social psychologists from the University
of California, San Diego, conducted a study

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.810
on the relationship between people's physical
proximity and how much they like each other.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.229
The researchers made a surprising discovery;
they asked students to name who they liked

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.340
and disliked.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.200
The researchers found that the students most
liked people were those who they frequently

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.439
met face to face.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.049
But the researchers also found that the studentâ€™s
least favorite people were those with whom

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.049
they were forced to spend time.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.260
In other words, watch out that spending time
with your crush doesn't end up with you getting

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.140
on their nerves.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.439
Number three; acting as if you don't like
your date all that much.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.179
When grandma told you "it always pays to smile",
where her words backed up by science?

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.770
Psychologist Curtis and Miller randomly paired
participants; one student in the pair was

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.440
led to believe that their partner either liked
or disliked them.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.890
Those who thought they were liked were nicer
and their partners ended up liking them more.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.219
The researchers concluded that so called reciprocal
liking is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.429
If your partner thinks you like them, they'll
be nicer to you, which in turn makes the whole

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.230
relationship better.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.599
And the opposite is also true; if they think
that you don't like them, they'll be meaner

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.120
and the whole relationship will suffer.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.330
Turns out that grandma was onto something.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.150
Number four; revealing too much too soon.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.129
In 2011, researchers told female undergrads
that their Facebook profiles had been viewed

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.840
by male students, and that they would now
be viewing the profiles of those guys.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.940
You can probably imagine that the women were
intrigued.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.019
The women were split into groups and were
told either that he liked their profile or

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.519
that the researchers didn't know whether he
liked their profile.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.049
The women were most attracted to the men who
didn't reveal whether they liked the women.

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.049
Why?

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.930
The researchers decided that the more the
women pondered the mysterious man, the more

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.159
he was on their mind, and the more intrigued
they became.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.129
Austin Powers nickname was actually pretty
honest.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.700
The magical man of mystery does get the dates.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.909
Number five; going on boring dates.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.569
Two psychologists in Vancouver, Canada, did
a study on misattribution of arousal, which

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.970
is when people make mistaken inferences about
what is causing them to feel the way they

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.970
do.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.519
They had an attractive female research assistant
give male participants a questionnaire.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.280
In the first group, she asked them the questions
while they were on a scary suspension bridge.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.209
In the second group, she asked them while
on a low, small bridge.

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.360
Those on the scary bridge were more excited
because of the bridge and were more attracted

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.950
to the research assistant and more likely
to call her later.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.140
On your next date, don't just get coffee,
that's boring.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.290
Instead, go see fireworks or ride go-karts.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.140
Number six; using cheesy pickup lines.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.690
Psychologists who study attraction have identified
three general strategies for pickup lines;

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.000
cute/flippant, for example "your place or
mine?", innocuous such as "what do you think

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.609
of the music?" and direct, as in, "can I buy
you lunch?".

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.230
A study asked men and women which pickup lines
they prefer to receive. Most strategies worked

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.260
for men being approached by women.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.540
However, women tend to prefer innocuous and
direct lines over cute/flippant ones.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.310
Bottom line; groaners aren't attractive.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.510
So now you know.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.720
Asking someone "did it hurt when you fell
from heaven?" is scientifically the lamest

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.880
possible thing to say.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.620
Number seven; not having a wingman or wingwomen.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.990
Some people treat dating like a competition,
but did you also know that there's lots of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.090
room for cooperation among friends.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.570
Having a third party make the introduction
may be the best strategy of all for guys trying

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.970
to pick up women.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.660
Especially in today's dating world where there's
more choice than ever, daters have to overcome

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.170
many hurdles in order to catch someone's interest.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.030
Having someone make the introduction for you
automatically moves you past the difficult

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.220
first stage and it makes it clear that you're
nice enough to have friends.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.690
Sorry James Bond, but in the real world, the
best romancers work in pairs.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.630
In today's fast-paced dating world, people
are quickly judged on first impressions.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.380
But don't worry, all you have to do is make
sure you never do any of these seven unattractive

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.400
things and you'll do fine.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.760
Although, bringing chocolates never hurts
either.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.880
