Let's go and find this out--we simply enter the bug number

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in the search field and get bug number 915.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So, when was it reported?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is one of the oldest bugs in Mozilla, and at this time in 2012

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it still hasn't been fixed.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That is after almost 14 years.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Still this bug has quite some history.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Hundreds and hundreds of people--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, let's make that dozens and dozens of people

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
have made hundreds and hundreds of comments over time.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This seems like a tough bug to fix.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So, the correct answer here is 1998.
