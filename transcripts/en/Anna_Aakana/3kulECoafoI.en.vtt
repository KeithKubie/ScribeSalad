00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Growing up, nothing was more

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.780
magical, or mysterious than the act of sex.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.960
You know, I used to think that if your nipples touched a guy's nipples you were insta-pregnant!

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.740
It was so confusing because there were so many different portrayals of sex, you know?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.780
Like on the one hand, there were my mom's romance novels that I'd steal and read in secret.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.120
He thrust his

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.340
And her lips parted and they made a sound!

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.380
Finger tips brushing!  Oh!

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.580
Dude!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.720
This is so dirty.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.060
Then on the other hand there was like the paired down biological scientific version

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.380
that you'd learn about in sex ed

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.180
All right class!  Genitals.  They go together.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.920
But not without a condom!  Ok?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.160
Now these puppies will to protect you from STDs

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.120
such as Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Herpes.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.200
There's quite a few more that I know, if you want--if you're interested--refer to your textbook ok?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.560
You just slide it on the banana and uh, this is a Magnum size

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.540
So it actually fits quite perfectly.  So I guess this is a Magnum banana.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.860
This is my lunch so I'm going to...

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.840
And of course there was the overexaggerated, kind of frightening version of sex

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.020
Porn.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.900
*sex noises*

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.280
I can't suspend my disbelief.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.580
She just met the guy!

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.820
Yea but he brought her pizza.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.660
But if she ordered and is paying for the pizza, then I don't understand how she can interpret his actions as being romantic!

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.420
True.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.420
*climax exclamations*

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.000
Woa.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.760
So dear clueless 15 year old me, your first time...probably not going to be that great.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.600
And it will hurt but it wont be that painful.  Or at least it shouldn't be.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.280
And if it is, for some reason.  Stop!

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.760
Doctors and I, we can't recommend lube enough!

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.720
And don't be afraid to figure out what works for you!

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.420
If you need a toy to reach orgasm.  Don't be ashamed of getting one, go get that toy!

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.380
Always be safe.  Know your contraceptives.  Condoms, birth control, IUDs.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.880
Whatever works for you.  Better safe than stuck with an STD you got from a liar

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.120
and or pregnant before you're ready to be a mom.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.080
Also having sex isn't going to change your life.  I used to think this but

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.640
sex is kind of overhyped.  I mean don't get me wrong.  It feels amazing

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.000
but it's not going to completely change you as a person like you may think that it will.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.680
Oh!  And always pee afterwards.  UTIs...they're not great.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.380
And if you do get one, go see a doctor and guzzle some cranberry juice.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.880
And finally, if a guy's boner isn't cooperating don't take it personally.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.760
He's probably just as nervous as you are.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.520
Alright, good luck.  Be safe.  And stay awesome Gotham.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.540
*whistling*

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.980
Is that how it sounds?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.800
*strong whistle*

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.400

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.640

English, German, Spanish, French, Irish.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.360
Wow!  You are not Asian enough!
