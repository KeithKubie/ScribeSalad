00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.180
What is the biggest worry that people normally

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.720
cite and say, this is scary. We need

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.460
to do something about this. This is a

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.520
moral imperative. What is, what is behind that?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.329
&gt;&gt; Aside from the movie Gattaca, which I think is

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.530
behind a lot of it. It's a very scary movie.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.880
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.580
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you've seen it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.190
lately. GINA was conceived of and passed because people,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.350
people are very concerned that opportunities will be forestalled,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.260
based on a possibility, of some genetic issue that could

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.280
befall them later on in life. That they're being you

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.740
know, pre-judged pre-penalized. Based on something that might not happen.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.910
&gt;&gt; So GINA, or the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.085
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.670
&gt;&gt; Was passed in 1995 and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.150
what did it do? What?

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.450
&gt;&gt; GINA was actually signed into law in 2008 it was a very long process.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.190
So it, the fight to create GINA first began in 1995. You

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.220
know, bunch of the bills that eventually

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.110
became GINA started circulating through the government

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.270
back in 95 and probably being talked of even earlier. GINA's general goal is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.200
to prevent discrimination by employers with 15 or more employees or by

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.280
insurers. Based on an individual's genetic information, or family medical

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.900
history. So they included family medical history, in part. Because, you know?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.240
Not everyone has had their genomes sequenced. But the idea is.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.380
There are a lot of. This breaks down

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.880
into a lot of different provisions, of course,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.430
a lot of different individual granular protections that

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.510
an insurer cannot raise premiums based on the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.970
fact that, say, my aunt had breast cancer. I may or may not carry one of

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.630
the BRCA gene variants that would increase my

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.940
likely risk of receiving breast cancer. I cannot

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.900
be charged under GINA a higher premium for that. Likewise, your

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.100
insurer or your employer cannot require that you undergo any type of genetic

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.960
testing to asses your risk for developing any condition. Your, it permits

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.120
of course in a health care provider to recommend genetic testing for various

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.280
purposes, but even then an insurer or an employer

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.680
can only collect the bare minimum of information that they

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.380
need to have for coverage decisions, basically they cannot collect and store

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.730
Additional information regarding your genetic makeup, predispositions.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.490
&gt;&gt; Do you feel the concern about genetic discrimination is valid?

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.875
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:07.240
mean, you can all too easily imagine an employer You know

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.750
saying, you know, let's not say breast cancer, let's say someone has a you know

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.300
they've had their genome they've had their genome coded, and they show a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.740
likelihood. It shows that you know

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.030
they will almost certainly develop Huntington's, say

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.280
and an employer who wants to make a long term investment in an employee, if they

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.990
have access to that information, they're allowed to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.180
make decisions based on it. Might say, you

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.180
know we'd really rather have someone who will

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.480
have a longer working life with us. Likewise

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.720
an insurer. I mean, insurers make their money.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.220
Based on having the maximum number of basically healthy

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.310
people, paying into the insurance pool. Which then

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.920
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.230
&gt;&gt; Goes to pay for

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.500
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.820
&gt;&gt; The less healthy people. it is in the insurer's best interest to keep as

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.430
many people who are going to develop

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.480
serious conditions out of that pool as possible.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.620
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So, yeah. I think that's a completely

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.220
rational concern that people have that led to GINA.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.790
I think it's one of the few occasions when,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.390
as you said, they've sort of, got out ahead

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.579
of the possibility of experiencing this type of discrimination.
