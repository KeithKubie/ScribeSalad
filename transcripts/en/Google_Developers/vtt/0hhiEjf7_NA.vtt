00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.410
Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.660
My name is Chris Broadfoot, and
I work on the Maps API and

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.030
Developer Relations team
at Google Sidney.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.230
Unfortunately, it doesn't snow
here, but I can live

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.500
vicariously through
this year's Easter

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.230
Egg on Google search.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.260
So this is just a quick
screencast to show you how to

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.390
use an awesome, powerful feature
called Styled Maps.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.660
We released Styled Maps at
Google I/O 2010, but I wish I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.610
saw it used more.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.620
It allows you to customize the
look of your map's API map to

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.810
brand your map, like on this
store locator, or to draw

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.100
attention to some data you've
put on top your map.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.850
Or it can be used to just
make your map a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.420
little bit more festive.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.410
To get started, I recommend
using the Styled Map wizard to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.460
generate the necessary code to
produce your styled map.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.490
The quickest way to get into
the wizard is to use your

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.620
preferred search engine.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.150
When you load it, you'll see
some instructions, but I'll

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.950
just show you some of the
basics of this tool.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.890
So first of all, let's navigate
to Sidney using the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.550
search bar on the top right.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.010
So styling uses two concepts
to apply color and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.150
changes to the map.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.680
The first is Map Features, and
you can see it represented at

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.190
the Feature Type panel
of the top.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.120
The second is stylers, which
are found below.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.180
These define color using a
combination of visibility,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.820
hue, saturation, lightness,
and gamma.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.650
So let's make this map a
little more festive.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.960
First, let's change
the water to red.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.870
I'm going to change the
hue, saturation,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.340
and drop the lightness.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.220
You can see these changes come
through straight away.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.210
The labels are distracting a
bit from this really pretty

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.460
map, so let's remove them
from all feature types.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240
When I press the Add button,
I can keep adding styles.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.180
Let's then make all of the
landscape green using similar

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.710
styles to water.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.920
And as you can see, it's
surprisingly easy to create

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.220
cartographically horrible,
or just plain ugly maps.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.500
Parks and roads are the main
thing left unstyled, so let's

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.930
make the parks green as well,
and let's change all the roads

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.060
to be white.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.640
Just bring the lightness up.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.360
So Styled Maps are available
both in the JavaScript API and

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.030
the Static Maps API.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.660
We can bring up a static map
by clicking the Static Map

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.530
button, and you get a URL down
at bottom that you can embed

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.910
straight into your
application.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.370
We can also press the Show
Adjacent button to get the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.960
styles in adjacent array, and
we can copy these into our

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.670
existing map.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.370
So I'm going to add an option
called Styles, and pasting the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.680
styles we generated using the
wizard, and you can see

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.260
instantly that these styles
have been applied.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.050
Styled Maps are really quick.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.600
They're just as fast as
a regular Google map.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.410
They're super simple, and
you should try it today.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.320
See the documentation for
more information.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.310
There's additional features like
custom map types, so you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.770
can enable your users to switch
between the default map

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.760
and other styles
you've created.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.100
Thanks for listening
and happy styling.
