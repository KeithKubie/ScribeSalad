[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.080
SPEAKER: Maz Jobrani
is arguably one

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.960
of the most well-known
and well-loved comedians

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.550
in the Iranian-American
community, both young and old.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.040
His family immigrated to
California from Tehran

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.350
when he was only six years old.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.960
And he draws a lot of his
comedy from his experience

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.440
growing up as an immigrant whose
parents tried their best to fit

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.720
into American
culture while still

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.840
retaining their Iranian roots.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.720
For example, he
makes fun of Iranians

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.400
for calling themselves
Persians, like the cat, meow,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.429
instead of Iranian to
avoid any bad connotations.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:45.970
Maybe the Iranian
Googler [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.720
should put some cat sign
on their t-shirt too.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.520
But just speaking
of Iranian Googlers,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.090
I hope folks that are watching
us live from Mountain View

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.130
are not snoring over there.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.030
We have weekly Persian lunch
on Fridays in Blake's Cafe.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.510
And they serve a variety of
Persian appetizer, entrees,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.980
desserts, and a
drink called doogh.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.470
What it does, it makes
the rest of your day

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.950
very productive by putting you
in a few hours of deeper sleep.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.440
Good for Fridays.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.010
And better than most comedies,
a sense of social justice.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.750
He first became
popular on YouTube

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.990
with jokes begging
the media to show

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.280
the Iranians on
TV making cookies

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.880
instead of threats of violence.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.200
He always has a way to turn
bad situations into jokes,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.640
like naming his comedy
group, the Axis of Evil,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.210
when George W. Bush named Iran
as a part of the axis of evil.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.540
He also knows when to take
his activism seriously,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.680
such as his refusal to play
any terrorist roles in films,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.830
and his recent involvement
in protests against the Trump

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.970
administration's travel ban.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.270
His recent achievements
include writing and starring

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.810
in "Jimmy Vestvood:
Amerikan Hero,"

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.420
a silly tour through the life
of an Iranian immigrant as he

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.510
navigates the crazy world of
Los Angeles's Iranian community,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.640
and his "LA Times" best-selling
memoir, "I'm Not a Terrorist,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.470
But I've Played One on TV,"
his new Netflix one-hour comedy

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.670
special, "Immigrant," and
one of the stars of the CBS

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.190
series, "Superior Donuts."

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.930
Season 2 premieres in October.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.590
It's hard to ever
overstate how much it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.230
means for
Iranian-American community

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.580
to have Maz represent us so
well, while standing up for us

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.490
and making fun of
us at the same time.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.940
He's an incredibly sweet guy,
with one Googler mentioning

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.210
to me that when he was
12, he would regularly

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.010
send Maz fan mail.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.820
And it meant the world to him
that his hero would actually

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.840
reply back and even sent him an
autograph, signed, of course,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.370
with meow.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.980
Ladies and gentlemen, give
it up for Maz Jobrani.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.438
MAZ JOBRANI: Hey.

00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:05.420
[CROWD CHEERS]

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.707
Hey!

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:07.206
Hey!

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.640
Hello.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.830
Hello, Google.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.310
You guys don't work, do you?

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.320
This is amazing.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.470
This is my first
time on this campus.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.180
I went to the Northern
California one as well.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.810
And yeah, you guys,
they feed you.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.300
And there's games,
and then seminar.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.710
You get a nap room.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.131
And wow, well, it's a good job.

00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:30.630
Great.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.754
AUDIENCE: There's massages.

00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:35.202
MAZ JOBRANI: There's literally
a table with money upstairs.

00:03:35.202 --> 00:03:36.030
Did you see that?

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.290
You can just take money.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.040
Fantastic.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.770
What did you say?

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.270
What?

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.810
Massage.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.310
Massage, wow.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.500
OK.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.020
How does anyone know how
much work you guys do?

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.850
Does anybody-- no, nobody knows.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.130
Yeah, all right.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.400
Well, this is cool to be here.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.010
I actually-- like,
I didn't really

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.540
know what this was
until Hadi got in touch

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.800
and said come give a talk.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.660
Who thought it was a
stand-up comedy show?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.510
Yeah, OK, no.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.794
It's not going to be.

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:05.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.060
It's a lecture on
the history of Iran.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.830
No, I'm kidding.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.540
No, Iranian Googlers,
I guess there's--

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.640
I'm proud of you guys.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.060
Iranian Googlers,
there's a handful of you.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.850
Fantastic.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.376
Like, four of you
wearing the t-shirts.

00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:22.690
The rest of you are like,
no, bro, just lay low.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.500
There's a travel ban, man.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.490
We're Greek Googlers!

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.384
You know what I mean?

00:04:27.384 --> 00:04:29.172
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:30.070
Yeah, man.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.490
Google, Iranian-- I mean,
I'm happy that there is--

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.100
I, as an Iranian, you
always get excited

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.100
when you see other
Iranians doing well.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.600
So to see you in
Google, it's great.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.347
And I think you can
start your own--

00:04:43.347 --> 00:04:45.180
you should have a better
name than Iranian--

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.180
like, you should be Googoosh,
who is, like, a Persian diva.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.177
You could do Googoosh or
Doodool, which means penis.

00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:51.677
Anyway--

00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:53.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.810
This is cool.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.310
No, so like I was
saying, I didn't really

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.030
know what this was.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.130
But I guess it's a talk.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.290
And I got invited.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.800
I get invited to
do a lot of stuff

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.140
by other Iranian-Americans,
because there

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.720
aren't that many
Iranian-American comedians.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.760
There's like three.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.700
It's like me, a guy named Max
Amini, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.270
That's all.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.837
So I get the invite.

00:05:22.837 --> 00:05:24.420
And Mahmoud's in
retirement right now.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.378
But he might come back.

00:05:25.378 --> 00:05:27.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:29.310
But no, it's actually
interesting to me.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.100
And I know there's
different ethnicities here.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.912
And we all have-- like, you
know, like, where's my Indians?

00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:36.120
Indians, where's the Indians?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.050
Yes, of course.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.370
Yeah, you've got to be here.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.160
Yeah, you guys have,
like, Russell Peters.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.370
Right?

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.270
You've got Russell Peters.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.530
Right?

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.059
And then are there
any Filipinos?

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.850
Any Filipinos here?

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.450
Any Filipinos?

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.410
Asians, any Asians?

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.970
Asians, Asians.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:48.530
No Asians?

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.196
We're at Google?

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:50.770
What's going on here?

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.270
There.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.067
What kind of Asian?

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:52.650
What kind of--

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.530
AUDIENCE: Vietnamese.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.420
MAZ JOBRANI: Vietnamese.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.461
You don't have-- there's
no Vietnamese comedians.

00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:58.597
OK, well, that's fine.

00:05:58.597 --> 00:06:00.180
There's actually a
guy named Dat Phan.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.860
There really is.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.401
It's just interesting,
because, like,

00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:05.550
I think people find the
comedian within their group,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.230
and they go to see
what he's got to say.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.438
And for me, it's interesting.

00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:11.200
Because being one of the only
Iranian-American comedians,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.960
I think some Iranians, they
treat me like a jukebox,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.976
meaning like, they make requests
on what I should talk about.

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.850
So like, I've been doing
a lot of Trump jokes

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.660
because he gives us a lot
of stuff to joke about.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.575
And as an Iranian-American, I
mean, it's like, Jesus Christ.

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:30.450
Let me just tell you.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.150
As a comedian in general,
Trump has been hard,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.711
because it's hard
to keep up with him.

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:36.210
No, really.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.862
Because as comedians, we need
time to develop our jokes.

00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:41.070
So we'll come up with a joke.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.570
And we'll be like,
OK, this is going

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.420
to take three months until I
refine it and get it right.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.360
But by the time you
do a joke about Trump,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.700
he's already on
to another thing.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.450
Like, it's crazy.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.949
It's hard.

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.799
It's impossible to
keep up with the guy.

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:54.840
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.180
So it's been really hard
to keep up with him.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.940
And so I would do jokes about
how some Iranians actually

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.750
voted for Trump.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.250
I know some Iranians,
some immigrants in general

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.592
that voted for Trump because
they want fewer taxes.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.050
They ended up with
fewer relatives.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.050
But these things happen.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.930
It happens, right?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.614
But no, so I'll
make fun of Trump.

00:07:13.614 --> 00:07:15.780
And then inevitably, at a
lot of these events that--

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.610
I've been at, like, fundraisers
for Iranian charities.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.070
And inevitably, there's
always some Iranian uncle

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.990
who will come up
offended afterwards.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.210
Like, Maz, why you
making fun of Trump?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.010
Why you not making fun of
Islamic Republic of Iran

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.400
and Hassan Mouhani
Houhani Souhani.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.760
And I'm like, nobody knows who
Hassan Houhani Houhani, like,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.450
whoever.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.132
Like, these people
are so upset at me.

00:07:38.132 --> 00:07:39.340
Like, why are you making fun?

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.830
And they use me
as a juke-- well,

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.170
you should make fun
of the parking space

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.940
on Westwood and Ohio,
always give me the ticket.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.720
You should make fun
of my mother-in-law.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.220
I hate her.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.970
She's a bitch.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.210
So I get requests.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.810
And I'm like, dude, just
if you're so pro-Trump,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.630
do your own material
and leave me alone.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.660
But Trump has been, as
an Iranian and as well

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.905
as any other immigrant, we
all know, it's been tough.

00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:07.530
Because a lot of
immigrants-- actually,

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.620
when I was in the elections,
when I was doing Trump jokes,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.990
I was in Houston one time.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.760
And I was saying, Trump
is anti-immigrant.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.810
And this one guy-- he
was a Lebanese guy.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.140
He raised his hand, and he goes,
he's anti-illegal immigrant.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.890
And I was like, oh,
so you're legal.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.610
And I go, great.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.664
I go, what's your name?

00:08:23.664 --> 00:08:24.830
And he's like, it's Hussein!

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.413
I was like, good
luck to you, Hussein.

00:08:26.413 --> 00:08:27.810
We'll see what happens.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.310
And we saw.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.659
He just did the
whole thing with now,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.940
they want to cut down
on legal immigration.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.539
Right?

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.052
And one of the things they said
was English, speaking English,

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:41.010
is going to be a big part
of legal immigration.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.468
And I'm married to
an Indian woman.

00:08:42.468 --> 00:08:45.680
So I know Indians are
very good with spelling.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.320
So if English is
part of-- there's

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.090
going to be a lot of
Indians coming in.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.590
At the border, they're going
to be like, spell "ubiquitous."

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.965
I would gladly
spell ubiquitous."

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.030
Meanwhile, Iranians, we
have a hard time with our Ws

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.640
and Vs. And Westwood
becomes Vestvood.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.070
No Iranians are going to get in.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.620
So it's been interesting.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.030
So now, and then they just
introduced travel ban 3.0.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.470
Right?

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.900
Because they wanted to
say, it's not a Muslim ban.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.420
So they added North Korea.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.200
I mean, really?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.510
I didn't know we had anyone
coming in from North Korea.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.810
But I guess the two guys that
were coming can no longer come.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.270
And it's diplomats
from Venezuela.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.740
So OK, it's not a Muslim ban.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.600
OK, sure.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.940
I actually was so upset with
the whole Muslim ban thing

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.230
that I actually
went to a protest.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.250
I do this in my stand-up.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.916
But it was true.

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:40.240
I actually went to LAX.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.487
Not this-- isn't this room
called LAX, by the way?

00:09:42.487 --> 00:09:43.070
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.278
MAZ JOBRANI: Very confusing,
because my manager said,

00:09:45.278 --> 00:09:46.910
the talk is in LAX.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.980
So I was like, that's a
weird place to do a talk.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.906
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:51.840
I was like, Google
has that much money?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.780
They bought LAX?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.450
Yeah, it's in Terminal 4.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.080
And we got here, and I was
like, the room is called LAX.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.850
Thank you for the confusion.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.700
But yeah, I went to
LAX for the protest.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.876
Did any of you guys go to
the protest that was in--

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:10.250
I think it was
February or March.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.550
Right?

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.600
You were there, right?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.170
It was great.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.980
And I got there.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.160
And I'm marching.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.060
And I'm feeling good.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.650
And I happened to be
at the woman's protest

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.632
the week before.

00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:21.590
I accidentally ended up
at the women's protest.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.709
I supported it.

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:24.500
But it was that my
daughter had a birthday.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.333
She's six years old.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.440
Her birthday was near
the women's protest.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.150
So we went.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.110
And we got there early.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.943
And I was there with
my daughter and my son.

00:10:31.943 --> 00:10:33.110
He's nine.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.240
And we said, hey, let's
go to the women's protest

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.520
so you guys can see
what's going on.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.190
People are marching
and protesting,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.770
and this is what
America's about.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.140
And it was actually
kind of interesting,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.020
because as we were walking
toward the women's protest--

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.340
we had an hour
before the birthday,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.570
so we walked towards there.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.153
And I asked my son,
the nine-year-old.

00:10:49.153 --> 00:10:51.800
I said, do you know why so
many people are protesting?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.050
And he goes, yeah, I
know, because women

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.870
are upset because Trump
called women a chick.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.680
Yeah, like chicks.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.930
Because my wife hates it
when somebody else calls

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.860
women chicks.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.750
And I was like, well, kind of.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.140
He said grab them by the--
we'll talk about it later, but--

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.670
So we went, and we
did that protest.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.044
And the next week,
I went to LAX.

00:11:15.044 --> 00:11:16.610
And I'm marching,
and I felt good.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.140
And this guy came up to me.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.475
He's like, bro, this is amazing.

00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:21.100
You know, this is
the most diverse city

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.950
I've ever seen in Los Angeles.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.565
And I was like, bro, that's
because we are at the airport.

00:11:25.565 --> 00:11:29.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.610
People are literally flying
in from around the world

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.470
as we speak.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.970
He's like, yeah,
but there's Asians.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.890
I go, that's because
AirAsia just landed.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.309
You think all these people show
up at a protest with luggage?

00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:43.600
One Korean guy, he was just
trying to cross the street.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.730
He ended up in the protest.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.920
He's like, Trump
must go, but so must

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.780
I. He was trying to
get out of the airport.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.040
And then I actually realized
something at the airport.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.650
I realized that white people
born in America protests

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.050
differently than people
of color and other people

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.250
not born in America.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.200
Because we were all marching,
and everything was going great.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.000
We're all marching, and
everything is feeling great.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.740
And then the riot
police came out.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.210
And I was like, oh, snap.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.180
I'm just going to go protest
over here for a second.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.176
But the white
dudes did not care.

00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:14.800
They just kept-- out
of my way, copper.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.409
Here I come.

00:12:15.409 --> 00:12:16.450
It's my right to protest.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.925
Here I come.

00:12:17.925 --> 00:12:20.050
It's my Third Amendment
right, my Ninth Amendment--

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.340
he knew the amendments.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.344
My 45th Amendment.

00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:24.010
I'm in the back.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.710
There's 45 amendments?

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.750
I actually saw a white
guy with his finger

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.970
in the face of the riot
police, going like this.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.187
And the riot cop was
ready to grab his baton.

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:35.020
And I'm in the back.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.540
I'm like, calm down, white guy.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.684
You're going to get
us all in trouble.

00:12:38.684 --> 00:12:40.350
The Mexican guy next
to me was like, oh,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.016
now's a good time to
go to the bathroom.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.560
But it keeps coming.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.300
It keeps coming.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.000
And my story, you know,
I think one of the things

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.100
that a lot of times
when I do these talks,

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.480
I talk about just--

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480
it's an immigrant story.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.700
I think a lot of us have it.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.560
And unfortunately,
a lot of people

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.380
that have never met
an immigrant think

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.910
that we're out to get them.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.350
But we aren't.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.000
We came to America
because we love America.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.300
I came to America late 1978.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.650
The Revolution was happening in
Iran, and we came to America.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.660
And I was six years
old at the time.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.150
And my father was a
successful businessman.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.700
So he was on
business in New York.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.910
He was staying at the
Plaza Hotel in New York.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.220
And a lot of Iranians have
a similar story, the ones

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.840
that came around that time.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.480
None of us thought that a
revolution was going to happen.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.070
So my father just sent
for my mom to bring me

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.550
and my sister to New York for
our winter break for two weeks.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.820
And I always say, we
came for two weeks.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.330
We packed for two weeks,
and we stayed for 40 years.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.410
So it was pretty crazy.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.584
And we were staying at the
Plaza Hotel in a suite.

00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:49.000
And it was right
across the street

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.085
from FAO Schwartz, which was the
biggest toy store in the world.

00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:53.960
And I remember as a
six-year-old, I was like,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.120
wow, this revolution is
really working out for me.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.076
You know?

00:13:57.076 --> 00:13:59.160
I'm going to a toy store.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.670
You know?

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.990
And it was interesting.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.080
You don't think about it.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.140
I've just started to
really reflect upon it.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.310
But it's interesting for--
as a kid, it was interesting.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.100
But also, you don't realize the
devastation that that causes.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.740
Because it's a big loss
to just leave your country

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.920
and come to America.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.960
But we came.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.990
And then we ended
up leaving New York

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.050
and settling in
Northern California.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.290
And again, at the time--

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.260
I know that a lot
of Iranians have

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.627
been coming over more recently.

00:14:30.627 --> 00:14:32.710
And unfortunately, with
all this travel ban stuff,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.751
I think that they're trying
to slow it down some.

00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:35.960
But we'll see what happens.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.780
But most of the Iranians
I meet are good people.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.696
Most of the immigrants
I meet are good people.

00:14:39.696 --> 00:14:44.050
And we ended up in Northern
California, where, at the time,

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.020
in the late '70s,
early '80s, there

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.190
weren't that many Iranians.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.230
There was, like, a
handful of Iranians.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.570
And again, I don't know how
it is for you as an Indian.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.720
But back then, for an
Iranian in Marin County that

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.900
was mostly white, like, if
you ran into an Iranian,

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.550
it was an event.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.420
It really was.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.120
So you'd show up-- like, I went
a couple of times to a deli.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.890
And the guy-- like
I'd order, and I

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.090
could recognize the accent.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.710
So I'd be like, yeah,
I'll have a sandwich.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.210
And the guy would
be like, would you

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.800
like anything else
with the sandwich?

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800
And then after a while,
in Persian, I'd be like,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.500
are you Iranian?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.650
And he'd go, yeah, are you?

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:16.540
I would say, yeah!

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.623
And like, we'd hug it out.

00:15:17.623 --> 00:15:19.900
And they'd always
throw in, like,

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.505
a free cookie or something.

00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:23.380
And I had an American
friend, this guy, Mark,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.089
who would come with
me a couple of times.

00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:27.546
And he's like, dude, you keep
getting free stuff everywhere

00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:28.190
we go.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.980
And I'm like, well, it's just--

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.030
it's part of the culture.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.590
So it was interesting,
because I grew up over there

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.020
and then ended up moving
down to LA after college.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.420
And Los Angeles is
the biggest population

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.690
of Iranians outside of Iran.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.750
So in LA, people are
used to seeing Iranians.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.066
And I got a job in Westwood.

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:51.190
I remember one of the first
times I saw an Iranian,

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:51.898
I was so excited.

00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:53.110
I was like, are you Iranian?

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.340
And the was like, yeah.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.985
So is everybody else.

00:15:57.985 --> 00:16:01.670
I was like, why are
you talking like that?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.460
But yeah.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.220
The other thing that
was interesting was--

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.511
and I think this has all been--

00:16:06.511 --> 00:16:10.000
for me, it's been an
exercise in identity.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.190
Because I grew up around--

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.630
like I said, it was a very
white, affluent county,

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.370
Marin County.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.270
And my father was this
larger-than-life Iranian man.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.560
So we show up.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.490
And the rich people
in Marin drive around

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:32.300
in Saabs and Volvos, very
subtle with their wealth.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.560
Here comes my dad.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.220
He buys a Rolls-Royce, like
around the hostage time,

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.330
like, hostage crisis.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.370
And I'm like, Dad,
what are you doing?

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.040
And he's like, I
wanted the Rolls-Royce.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.890
And I'm like, you're
going get my ass kicked.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.140
And we ended up--

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.640
it was right around then.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.970
I was in the fourth grade when
the hostage crisis happened.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.090
And this is again,
another reason

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.330
why I was just talking to
Masu here outside about--

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.660
I think one of the reasons why I
have such an emotional reaction

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.290
to Trump is because
I see him as a bully.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.869
And I when I was in
the fourth grade,

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.569
that's when the hostage
crisis happened.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:12.819
And we would get bullied.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.069
And I was in the fourth grade.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:15.694
And there was a sixth
grader back then.

00:17:15.694 --> 00:17:18.230
And back then, they used to
call you a fucking Iranian.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.750
That was the thing.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.300
And so we would get bullied.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.818
And so I feel like that's my
reaction now to these bullies.

00:17:25.818 --> 00:17:27.859
Because now what happens
is when somebody commits

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:34.100
an act of terrorism, they go
after all Muslims, Iranians,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.730
and Arabs.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.110
And even Indians, Indian
Sikhs, get a lot of it.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.780
So to me, it blows my
mind that these kids that

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.730
were picking on us
when we were kids

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.710
couldn't differentiate
that we had

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.640
left Iran to get away from the
people who took the hostages.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.100
And yet, they were
beating us up.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.850
So that was Marin
County back then.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.230
And then again, it becomes
this identity thing.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.500
And now, a lot of you guys,
obviously, that work here,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.550
you're engineers.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.990
And you're Iranian or immigrant
parents are proud of you

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.544
because you became an engineer.

00:18:10.544 --> 00:18:11.960
And that's what
my parents wanted.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.450
They wanted, like,
lawyer, doctor, engineer.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.529
And I became a comedian.

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:17.570
Because they didn't know.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.486
They didn't know that.

00:18:18.486 --> 00:18:20.220
They didn't know
that was an option.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:25.340
And so I was around, I'd
say, 10 or 11 years old.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.440
Eddie Murphy was big.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.420
And I became a big
fan of Eddie Murphy's.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.920
And then at 12, I
did a play in school.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.129
It was a musical.

00:18:34.129 --> 00:18:34.670
And I did it.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.503
And as soon as I got
on stage, I felt alive.

00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:37.790
I loved being on stage.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.490
And we would do our
plays for the school.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.975
And again, here comes
my immigrant family--

00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:45.350
immigrant families, by the
way, are an interesting thing.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.391
I realized this recently.

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:47.840
Because I have my young kids.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.469
I go to their school
events all the time.

00:18:50.469 --> 00:18:51.760
I was at a fundraiser recently.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.404
I realized, my parents never
came to any of my fundraisers.

00:18:54.404 --> 00:18:55.820
And then I realized,
I didn't want

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.200
them to come to my fundraisers.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.866
Because when you have
immigrant parents,

00:18:58.866 --> 00:19:01.220
when they come to your
fundraiser, they out you.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.690
Because they walk in like,
hello, we are immigrants!

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.190
You know?

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.560
You're like, Dad, shut up!

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.250
You know?

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.130
They thought I was one of them.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.210
In Iran, we also
had fundraisers.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.630
Dad, nobody likes Iran!

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:15.620
This was 40 years ago.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.730
Still, nobody likes Iran.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.961
Anyway-- We need
a new ad campaign.

00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:19.460
Right?

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.660
Iran, it's better.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:31.040
But I realized, like I said,
that it was always the identity

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.650
thing, trying to
Americanize, but having

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:34.640
this immigrant family.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.680
So I'd do these plays.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.160
And again, Marin County,
and everyone else's parents

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.620
would show up at
the play, dressed

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.200
maybe khaki pants and
a button-up shirt,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.400
looking pretty nice.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.390
Here come the
Iranians, fur coats

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.170
like they're at the
Metropolitan Opera or something.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.600
Fur coats, cravat,
the tie, they're all--

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.590
with Rolls-Royce.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.070
I'm like, oh, my god.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.540
Like, please, guys, can't
you just, like, come normal?

00:20:04.614 --> 00:20:05.780
And here's the thing though.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.320
I actually was pretty
good at acting.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.280
And then the director would
tell them afterwards--

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.860
I remember a few
times, after the show--

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.730
I played Little Abner
in eighth grade.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.063
And for those of you who don't
know who Little Abner is,

00:20:20.063 --> 00:20:21.980
he's like a country boy.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.330
Little Abner talks like this.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.910
And so I was this Iranian
guy playing a Little Abner.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.410
And I was like,
this is pretty cool.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.826
You can be anything,
until I came to Hollywood

00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:30.950
and played terrorist parts.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:31.610
But that's--

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.750
That's coming.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.250
No, but the thing
with the plays,

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.630
we would finish the plays.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.700
And I'd be backstage.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.510
And I was the lead.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.760
And the director--

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.410
I remember the director a couple
of times telling my parents,

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.160
yeah, your son is good at this.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.830
He could do this for a career.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.721
And my immigrant parents
might-- oh, thank you very much.

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:55.220
Thank you.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.090
OK, OK.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.840
We get in the car.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.870
And my dad would be like,
that bitch is crazy.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.350
You're going to be a lawyer,
or a doctor, or engineer maybe.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.622
They really were stuck on that.

00:21:05.622 --> 00:21:07.580
And I think it's because
they don't really know

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.200
that this could be a career.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.030
And also, I've tried to
encourage a lot of immigrants

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.160
to kind of lay off
their kids and let

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.010
them find what they love to do.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.600
Like, when I would
tell my mom, this

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.670
is what I love
doing, she'd be like,

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.860
well, I would love to do
a lot of other things too,

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.870
but you've got to pay the bills.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.900
So be a lawyer.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.130
And so I actually
went to UC Berkeley.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.311
I studied Poli Sci.

00:21:34.311 --> 00:21:35.560
And I thought I'd be a lawyer.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.430
And then my junior
year in college, I

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.141
went to Italy to study abroad.

00:21:42.141 --> 00:21:44.140
And while I was there,
there was this professor.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.390
And I loved what he was doing.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:50.370
His name was Enso
Pacci, Vincenzo Pacci.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.040
And And he had the
goatee and the blazer

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.100
with the elbow patch.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.400
And he actually
had a gold watch.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.960
You know the pocket watches?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.390
And he would rip it out before--

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.010
he'd pull it out
before the class.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.510
And he'd wait for
the time to start.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.290
And then he'd close it, and
be like, allora, let's start.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.670
And I was like,
wow, this is cool.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.350
So I was like, that's
what I want to do.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.420
So I came back to the US.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.850
And I told my mom, hey, I'm
going to be a professor.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.220
And my mom was freaking out.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.810
She was like, there's
no work for professors.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.250
You need to be a lawyer.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.750
And I was like, Mom, how do you
know about the professor job

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.250
market?

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.570
You don't know about academia.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.080
And she was just
really nervous for me.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.545
And then I dropped out
of the PhD program.

00:22:31.545 --> 00:22:32.920
I got into a PhD
program at UCLA.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.330
I dropped out of that.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.680
And then my mom was like--

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.050
because I dropped out
to pursue acting again.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.029
And she goes, you did
not become a lawyer.

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:41.320
You did not become a professor.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.139
She goes, at least
become a mechanic.

00:22:45.139 --> 00:22:46.180
I go, how'd you go from--

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.500
How'd you go from
lawyer to mechanic?

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.860
And she goes, people
need a mechanic.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.910
Nobody needs an actor.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.330
And I was like, you know what?

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.280
That's pretty wise.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.240
You're right.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.370
And I realized-- again,
listen, all of us

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.520
can reflect on our
relationship with our parents

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.390
or where we are in our lives.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.050
And looking back, you find
out why you do what you do.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.400
So my mom, I think, was
nervous about my future

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.030
because she'd come from a
world where her world was

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.350
turned upside down.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.420
The Revolution turned her
world upside down when

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.640
she was already a grown-up.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.960
And so in her mind, a revolution
might happen in America.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.540
And when it does, if
you're a mechanic,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.609
you can go to another country
and work as a mechanic.

00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:33.650
But if you're an actor,
what are you going to do?

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.160
Because we had a lot of
Iranian family friends

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.150
who were successful military
people or whatever, and they

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.490
were working at gas
stations in America.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.170
Like the movie "House
of Sand and Fog."

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:44.878
It was like that.

00:23:44.878 --> 00:23:47.170
So that's what
she wanted for me.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.160
So anyway, I dropped out.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.220
And again, I still
was trying to be

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.880
a good Iranian or immigrant son.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.200
I got a job in an office.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.570
I started working in
an advertising agency.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:05.290
And I was working the
ad agency and also doing

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.870
theater on the side.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.404
And I was in my mid-twenties.

00:24:09.404 --> 00:24:10.570
And that's when I realized--

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.970
I was talking to this older
gentleman at the ad agency.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.780
And he said, listen--

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.730
I told him that I
loved doing acting.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.980
And he'd seen me do something.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.850
And he goes, have
you ever thought

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.050
about doing this professionally?

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.130
And I said, you know what?

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.338
Throughout my life, I wanted
to do it professionally.

00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:25.589
But my parents kept pushing
me in another direction.

00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:27.130
I said, you know,
when I'm in my 30s,

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.690
I'm going to save up some
money and maybe pursue acting.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.662
And he goes, listen,
I'm in my 60s right now.

00:24:31.662 --> 00:24:34.120
There were some things I wanted
to do when I was in my 20s,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.579
and I never got
around to doing it.

00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:37.619
So if you really want to
do it, you should do it.

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:38.990
And it was a light bulb moment.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.980
And I went for it.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.520
So I started getting into
acting and stand-up classes.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.290
That was almost 20 years ago.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.480
And then I got into
Hollywood thinking, hey,

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.580
I played Little Abner.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.040
And also, in high
school, I played Batman.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.160
So I'm sure-- we did
a play, a musical.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.054
It was fun.

00:24:55.054 --> 00:24:57.599
Anyway, It was a
fun little thing.

00:24:57.599 --> 00:24:58.390
I got to be Batman.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.320
So I was like,
hey, this is cool.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.760
As an actor, I get
to be anything.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.762
And I came.

00:25:01.762 --> 00:25:02.970
I started going on auditions.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.550
And the first audition was
just a regular security guard

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.520
job, a part for a security guy.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.360
And then the second audition
was for a Chuck Norris thing.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.459
And then ended up a
little while later, I

00:25:16.459 --> 00:25:19.000
didn't end up doing though doing
the Chuck Norris thing then.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.520
But then a little while
later, I ended up getting

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.587
cast to be in a Chuck
Norris movie of the week

00:25:24.587 --> 00:25:26.920
where I played an Afghan
terrorist who was going to blow

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.950
up a building in America.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.900
And I was really
debating even back then.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.587
I still had my day job.

00:25:33.587 --> 00:25:35.170
But I was looking
for a job that would

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.630
help me get out of my day job.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.959
And this would have helped
me just financially.

00:25:39.959 --> 00:25:41.750
And even back then, I
was a little divided.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.416
I was like, do I
really want to do this?

00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:48.310
And this was 2001,
before September 11th.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.770
And I told myself,
you know what?

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:51.970
I will do the part.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:55.600
But what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show through my acting

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.360
why this guy is doing
what he's doing.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.020
Like, I was going to humanize
the terrorist in a Chuck Norris

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.800
movie somehow.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.610
I was such an
idiot, man, really.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.215
Because I showed up--

00:26:08.215 --> 00:26:11.770
because it was being
filmed in Dallas.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.969
And I went down to Dallas.

00:26:12.969 --> 00:26:14.260
I went to the wardrobe fitting.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.100
And they go, here's your shirt.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.000
Here's your pants.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.350
Here's your turban.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.470
And I go, oh.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.790
I go, I've been
studying this part.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:25.500
And you know, Afghans in
America don't wear turbans.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.980
I go, Indian Sikhs wear turbans.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.400
We should get this right.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.054
And the lady goes,
well, the producers

00:26:30.054 --> 00:26:31.220
want you to wear the turban.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.380
I go, yeah, I know.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.690
But you tell the producers this
actor has done his research.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:36.990
We should get it right.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.510
And then the next
day, I showed up.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.200
And there was the
pants, the shirt,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.910
and what looked like a scarf.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.200
And I was like, yeah,
I'll gladly wear a scarf.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.950
And they were like,
no, that's the turban.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.104
You just got to roll it back up.

00:26:50.104 --> 00:26:51.770
So I ended up wearing
the stupid turban.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:52.940
I feel like the biggest idiot.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.481
And I was on set, like, talking
to anybody that would listen.

00:26:55.481 --> 00:26:58.910
Because Chuck Norris's
son was the director.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.530
And his brother was
the executive producer.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.177
So I went to the
son, who was younger.

00:27:03.177 --> 00:27:05.510
And I go, listen, dude, I
shouldn't be wearing a turban.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:08.370
And he's like, bro, I don't want
you to wear a turban either.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.840
But my uncle, who is more
old school, wants the turban.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.300
Because I think to
the uncle, the turban

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.130
meant-- like, the
viewers can watch and be

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.620
like, oh, that's the bad guy.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.700
So I played in that.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.640
And I felt really bad.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.015
I felt horrible
coming out of it.

00:27:22.015 --> 00:27:24.090
I was like, I don't ever
want to do this again.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.020
I told my agent, I don't want
to play these parts again.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.540
And then the TV
show "24" called.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.190
And they said, it's
a terrorist part.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.360
I said, no, thank you.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.527
And they go, but he
changes his mind halfway

00:27:34.527 --> 00:27:35.360
through the mission.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.180
I go, oh, the ambivalent
terrorist, that's interesting.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.110
So I did that.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.840
And they killed me
in that as well.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.630
I kept dying, obviously.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.449
My mom was like, why
do you keep dying?

00:27:49.449 --> 00:27:50.990
I was like, that's
how they wrote it.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.614
Well, why don't you
kill them one time?

00:27:52.614 --> 00:27:54.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.030
So that was the last
terrorist part I played.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.772
And I said, no more
terrorist parts.

00:28:00.772 --> 00:28:02.480
And then meanwhile,
I was doing stand-up.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.854
Stand-up is great
because you get

00:28:03.854 --> 00:28:06.140
to express yourself
and present yourself

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:10.140
as who you are and your
ideas and your opinions.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.410
And so I was doing stand-up.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.830
And one thing happened that was
interesting to me that was--

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.650
The Comedy Store on
Sunset is like a mecca

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.400
of stand-up comedy.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.130
And it's a place
where all the biggest

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.430
names, from Jay
Leno to Jim Carrey

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.324
to Eddie Murphy to
Richard Pryor, Letterman,

00:28:28.324 --> 00:28:29.990
all those guys went
to The Comedy Store.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.910
And one of your
goals as a comedian

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.740
is to become a regular
at The Comedy Store.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.820
And what that means
is you do your act

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.530
in front of the
owner, Mitzi Shore,

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.150
who's Pauly Shore's mother.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.370
She would sit in the
back on a Sunday night,

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.140
and she would watch
you do three minutes.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.070
They'd have an audience there.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.780
But you'd be up
there at an open mic.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.160
You'd do your three minutes.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.260
If she liked you, she'd
say, come back next week

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.600
and do six minutes.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.520
If she liked you, come back
next week and do 10 minutes.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.300
So you just got to build it up.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.690
And so I kept going
further and further.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.850
This was in 2000, or '99 maybe.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.470
I forget exactly.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.860
But she watched me, watched me.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.510
Now, I'm doing my 10 minutes.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.260
And she would sit in
the back of the room.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.430
If any of you guys
have been there,

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.471
it's an interesting room.

00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:14.930
Because there's these
chairs in the back

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.389
right next to the exit.

00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:17.930
And she'd sit right
next to the exit.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.220
You had to pass her.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.230
And in passing her,
your whole hope

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.140
was that she would
reach out and grab you.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.960
Because if she did, that meant
she was about to tell you,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.800
you're a regular.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.140
And what a regular
means is now--

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:30.980
it's like the mafia.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.130
You've been made.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.950
You're a made man.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.010
So regular means you
get to come and perform

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.630
at the club on a regular basis.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.560
And you're in.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.694
This is the mecca of comedy.

00:29:41.694 --> 00:29:42.860
And you're now a part of it.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.300
But if she doesn't
grab your hand

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.370
and she lets you
walk past her right

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.560
through the exit, that
means you got to show up--

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.660
you know, go for six
months to a year.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.460
Work on your act.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.600
Come back.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.350
So I did my three.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.891
I did my six.

00:29:53.891 --> 00:29:55.220
I did my 10.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.215
And I finished.

00:29:56.215 --> 00:29:57.590
And at the time,
I would do jokes

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.034
about being Iranian in
America and all that.

00:30:00.034 --> 00:30:02.450
And at the time, she did not
have any other Middle Eastern

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.710
comedians at the club.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.210
There really wasn't
that many of us.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.400
There was, like, two other guys.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.450
So I finished my set.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.466
And I'm walking.

00:30:09.466 --> 00:30:10.840
And I'm walking
towards the door.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.440
And I'm like, please, grab me.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.809
And suddenly, I feel
her hand grab my arm.

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:16.850
And I'm like, oh, my god.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.500
And all these thoughts
go through your mind,

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.820
like I'm going to be a regular.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.300
This is great!

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.680
And in your mind, you're like,
I'm going to get a TV show.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.096
I'm going to get
an Academy Award.

00:30:24.096 --> 00:30:24.960
This is amazing.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.030
And she grabs my hand.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:26.990
And she pulls me down.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.420
And now, meanwhile-- you
know, she's kind of quiet.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.670
She was getting older as
well, but she's quiet anyway.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.720
And someone else was
already performing on stage.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.730
So she pulls me in.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.257
She goes, you're very funny .

00:30:36.257 --> 00:30:37.340
And that's how she talked.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.330
You're very funny.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.710
And I go, thank you, Mitzi.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.700
She goes, I'm going
to make you a regular.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.694
I go, thank you, Mitzi.

00:30:42.694 --> 00:30:44.360
And then she goes,
have you ever thought

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.130
about wearing the outfit?

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.620
And I go, uh, what outfit?

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.040
She goes, you know,
the hat and the gown?

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.230
I was like, the
hat and the gown?

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.394
She goes, yeah.

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:56.060
And I realized she
was asking me to wear

00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:00.180
a turban and a dishdasha
onstage, like as a character.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.470
And I was like, uh, sure, yeah.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.650
And because she's older,
I thought, you know what?

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.390
I'll just say yes for now.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:13.880
And by the time they get me
my first gig, she'll forget.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.420
Right?

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.550
So I walk down past her, and
I'm like, what did I just do?

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.840
I just said yes.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.260
But I'm not going to wear
the-- what am I talking about?

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:21.950
So I was like, you know what?

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:22.820
They'll forget.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.506
And then the next day,
the assistant that

00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:26.630
works for her called me up.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.309
She goes, hey, congratulations.

00:31:28.309 --> 00:31:29.350
I heard you're a regular.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.966
I go, yeah!

00:31:29.966 --> 00:31:32.340
As she goes, and I heard you're
going to wear the outfit.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.520
I was like, ah!

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.250
So now, they want me to dress
up as a mullah on stage.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.640
And I was like, how
do I get out of this?

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.929
And I was trying to find
a way to get out of it.

00:31:43.929 --> 00:31:45.220
And I was talking to relatives.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.640
I was like, I can't dress
as a mullah on stage.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.570
And back then, my father
had moved back to Iran

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.040
for business reasons.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.290
And so he was there.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.680
And there had also been
this one Iranian guy

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.395
who used to impersonate the
mullahs on Iranian television

00:32:07.395 --> 00:32:08.950
and make fun of them.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.760
And so I guess he'd been
at a rally in Westwood

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.950
where he was doing
the mullah character.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.620
And some supporters of the
Islamic Republic of Iran

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.280
had shown up and thrown
rocks at him and blinded him.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.521
So I'd heard about it.

00:32:22.521 --> 00:32:23.770
I didn't know who the guy was.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:25.900
I didn't know if
it was real or not.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.950
So I called up the club.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.480
I go, hey.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.060
I'm excited about the
turban and the thing.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.270
But let me just tell
you before I do it,

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.701
there was a guy who did it.

00:32:35.701 --> 00:32:37.450
And they showed up,
and they threw a rock.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.325
And they blinded him.

00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:41.040
And my dad's in Iran,
so if word gets back,

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.100
they could go after him.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.154
And they might come
after the club.

00:32:45.154 --> 00:32:46.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.355
Thinking.

00:32:50.355 --> 00:32:50.980
I swear to god.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.646
I'm not kidding.

00:32:51.646 --> 00:32:53.360
The booker, who was
Mitzi's assistant,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.870
she goes, oh, let
me call you back.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.427
I swear, five
minutes later, Maz,

00:32:59.427 --> 00:33:00.760
just wear something comfortable.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.330
You'll be fine.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.450
Don't worry about the turban.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:09.640
So I got away from wearing
the turban, and thank god.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.760
Because the thing about Mitzi,
this is the thing about Mitzi.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.880
She really was someone who
everyone's got stories about.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.500
Like, if you talk
to any comedian,

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.510
they'll tell you their
experiences with Mitzi.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.870
And Mitzi was really a
visionary in many ways.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:27.430
Like from what I've heard,
she helped Roseanne Barr

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.440
get her whole persona
together and get

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.640
the clothing and all that.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.990
And a lot of comedians
found their character there.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.842
So Mitzi had had
successes where she

00:33:36.842 --> 00:33:38.050
was like, you should do this.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.610
And they did it, and it worked.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.030
But she also had some
failures, in terms of like,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.530
there was a guy.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.860
His name was Jackie Bananas.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.112
And there's a picture
of him at The Comedy--

00:33:50.112 --> 00:33:52.570
If you to The Comedy Store,
everyone's headshots are there.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.195
And there's a guy
named Jackie Bananas.

00:33:54.195 --> 00:33:56.337
And it's a face
in a banana suit.

00:33:56.337 --> 00:33:57.920
And I was asking one
of the comedians.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.990
I go, who's that guy?

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.220
And they go, oh, that guy.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.390
They go, this poor guy.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.740
He used to do an act.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.580
And at one point in the act, he
used to put on the banana suit.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.050
And one night, Mitzi
was there seeing it.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.650
And she was like, you
should be Jackie Bananas.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.150
And the poor guy had to be a
banana the rest of his life.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.389
And he disappeared.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.219
Nobody wants to see a banana.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:22.000
So thank god I didn't
listen to Mitzi.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.560
But also, Mitzi then,
to give her credit,

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.500
she came around
in the year 2000.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.840
And she's Jewish.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.419
She was watching a lot of news.

00:34:30.419 --> 00:34:32.710
And there was the latest
uprising with the Palestinians

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:33.610
in Israel.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.570
And she felt like
there was going

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.403
to be a need for a
positive voice for Middle

00:34:36.403 --> 00:34:38.870
Easterners in America
in the very near future.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.449
This was before September 11th.

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:44.506
So she wanted to do a
Middle Eastern comedy night.

00:34:44.506 --> 00:34:46.630
And even though you're a
regular at the club, which

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.219
means you perform
throughout the week,

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:52.600
she used to do a show, like the
Black Night, and Asian Night,

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.072
and Latino Night, and whatever.

00:34:54.072 --> 00:34:55.780
So she wanted to do
Middle Eastern Night.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.700
So she got the few
Middle Easterners that

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.620
were doing comedy at the time--

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.890
me, this guy named Ahmed Ahmed,
who was Egyptian-American,

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.170
Aron Kader who's
Palestinian-American,

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.100
and anyone else who kind
of seemed Middle Eastern.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.710
There was an Indian guy, who
really wasn't Middle Eastern.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.912
But he was there.

00:35:12.912 --> 00:35:14.120
And it wasn't Russell Peters.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.120
There was this other guy.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.110
There was a guy who
was half Armenian.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.150
There was a girl who
did a belly dance,

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.210
but she was a white girl.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.561
It was weird.

00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:26.560
It was this weird thing.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.240
And she called it
the Arabian Nights.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.810
And what was interesting
was, we would do our shows.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.430
And then Iranians would come.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.289
And Iranians are really
proud of being Iranian.

00:35:37.289 --> 00:35:38.830
And so if someone
says, are you Arab?

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:39.871
They go, no, I'm Iranian.

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:40.509
I'm Persian!

00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:41.800
And people get really offended.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.850
I'm like, calm down.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:43.770
You know?

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.000
But Iranians would come
up after the shows.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.680
Maz, really enjoyed the show.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.469
But you know, we are not Arab.

00:35:49.469 --> 00:35:50.260
I was like, I know.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.968
It's called Arabian
Nights because that's

00:35:51.968 --> 00:35:53.110
what she named it.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.040
So relax.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.900
And it wasn't until 2005 when
me and a couple of the guys

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.420
broke off and we called it
the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.090
to make fun of
what Bush had named

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.850
Iran and those other countries--
and then we toured with that.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.930
And then, in all honesty, it was
actually YouTube that, I think,

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.990
helped all of us, really, at
the time become better known,

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.270
because I used to be
on these email lists.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.390
It was before Facebook
was really out.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.709
And I would get my
own clip, the meow

00:36:22.709 --> 00:36:24.250
clip that he was
talking about, where

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.440
I talk about Persians like
to say, we're Persian,

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.620
like they cat, meow.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.720
That kept circulating.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.470
And I was on these
email lists going, hey,

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.510
look at this Iranian comedian,
Iranian-American comedian.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.551
And so I kept getting it.

00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.980
I was like, oh, wow, people
are getting to know me.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.240
And so that was in 2007.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.450
And then been doing it
since, and put out a bunch

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.130
of my own comedy specials.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.890
And the latest one is
called "Immigrant."

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.120
And it's on Netflix.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.360
And I do a lot of
Trump material.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.852
He just keeps talking.

00:36:57.852 --> 00:37:00.270
God, I mean, the guy won't stop.

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.710
I mean, he offended the NFL.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.600
I mean, do you understand that?

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.990
I never thought he could offend
NFL owners, who donated money

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.710
to him.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.540
I used to say, I
go, listen, if you

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.190
think he's not going to offend
you, he's going to offend you.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.370
And he finds a way.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.380
He's amazing.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.600
Remember the chocolate cake.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.280
Remember he was talking about
the bombs he dropped on Syria?

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.290
And then he decided to
talk about his dessert?

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.490
You guys see that?

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.402
It's crazy.

00:37:21.402 --> 00:37:22.860
For those of you
who don't know it,

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.702
he was talking about the bombs
that he dropped on Syria when

00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:27.910
the-- first of all, there
was the video that came out

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:33.490
of the attack they did that
was the chemical weapon attack.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:35.640
And it was a horrible
video that was out.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.680
And Trump came out
and goes, oh, I never

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.960
knew that was what
was happening there.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.520
And I'm like, you're
the president.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.350
No one told you about Syria?

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:46.710
And then he decides
to bomb Syria.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.336
But then he's being interviewed
on some political show.

00:37:49.336 --> 00:37:51.210
And he goes, yeah, we
were dropping the bomb.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.510
And before we bombed Syria,
we had this chocolate cake.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.609
It was an amazing
chocolate cake.

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:58.400
And I was watching.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.290
I go, did his brain
tell his mouth--

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.310
like, was there a
message that was like,

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.840
tell her about the cake?

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.540
She's going to love
hearing about the cake?

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.180
I got kids.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.410
If they talked
about chocolate cake

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.743
in the middle of a serious
conversation, I'd smack them.

00:38:12.743 --> 00:38:14.250
Shut up!

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.010
But that's where we are, people.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.240
So yeah, man.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.610
So that's kind of
my life right now.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.610
And somebody was just asking
me about the representation

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:27.060
of Middle Easterners and Muslims
and Arabs and stuff in media.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.620
And I think we've
made some progress.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.160
I think you've got shows like
Aziz Ansari's "Master of None."

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.450
You've got Gaza guys like
Kumail Nanjiani and Hasan Minhaj

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.910
and Mindy Kaling and all these.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.460
I think that because
more and more--

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.499
Like I said, when
immigrants come,

00:38:43.499 --> 00:38:44.790
they don't know it's an option.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.670
But I think the next generation
realizes it's an option.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:52.320
And so we're starting
to show up and hopefully

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.850
show us in a different light.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.520
I'm currently on a show where
I play an Iraqi businessman

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.030
on a show called
"Superior Donuts."

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.030
It's a CBS show.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.350
And I still have an accent.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.520
Some people are like,
why do you still

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.400
have an accent on this show?

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.899
And I'm like, well,
eventually, I'll

00:39:04.899 --> 00:39:06.480
do a character
without an accent.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.040
But I actually think
it's important.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.274
Because the character
is a conserv--

00:39:10.274 --> 00:39:12.190
he's one of the guys who
would vote for Trump.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.245
But what's interesting is
every week that the show plays,

00:39:15.245 --> 00:39:16.620
on Twitter, I get
a lot of people

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.120
going like-- they
like the character

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.510
because he gets to say a
lot of inappropriate stuff,

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:22.500
and he's got an accent.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.083
And I think it's
good for people to be

00:39:24.083 --> 00:39:26.550
laughing at a character
that has the accent.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.830
Because I think it also
humanizes the character.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.440
Because they go, oh,
he makes me laugh.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.450
So we're in an
interesting era right now.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.610
But yeah, we're going
to keep pushing forward.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:42.857
And hopefully, we'll get there.

00:39:42.857 --> 00:39:43.440
And that's it.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.560
That's the talk.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.770
And I told Hadi, we
got a few minutes left,

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.110
that we could ask
some questions.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.410
You have a couple of questions.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.390
Is that right?

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.230
SPEAKER: We do.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.836
Thanks a lot for the show.

00:40:00.836 --> 00:40:02.710
Can we hear it one more
time for Maz Jobrani?

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:07.530
MAZ JOBRANI: There you go.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.990
Are those the questions?

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.060
SPEAKER: Yeah, we
have a system of where

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.730
people post online questions.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.480
But before that, I
have a question myself,

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.440
listening to your show.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.910
MAZ JOBRANI: Yes.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.930
SPEAKER: Do I look like
mullah in this t-shirt?

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:18.920
MAZ JOBRANI: You don't
look like a mullah.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.720
You should have worn the
outfit and the turban.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.280
SPEAKER: Oh, we gave you
a free t-shirt to wear.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.510
And then you said no.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.635
MAZ JOBRANI: You know what?

00:40:24.635 --> 00:40:28.490
Iranian Googler, I figured
I want to represent

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.360
in a nice expensive shirt.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.510
You know what I'm saying?

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.200
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.330
You don't have to.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:35.840
MAZ JOBRANI: You want
me to wear the shirt?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.240
Give me the shirt.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.115
I'll wear your shirt.

00:40:37.115 --> 00:40:38.657
Take it off.

00:40:38.657 --> 00:40:40.490
If you want me to wear
the shirt that badly,

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.210
take off your shirt.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.990
SPEAKER: Really, you wear that?

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.365
MAZ JOBRANI: Take
off your shirt.

00:40:43.365 --> 00:40:45.285
[CROWD TITTERS]

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.360
Take off the shirt!

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.610
You have a shirt
underneath the shirt!

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.000
There we go.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.790
Hadi, this smells
like [PERSIAN]..

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.174
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:05.174 --> 00:41:06.090
That's a Persian rice.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:06.880
This smells like cologne.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.570
We love cologne.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:08.620
Look at this, Iranian .

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:15.274
Googlers I'm telling
you, man, Googoosh.

00:41:15.274 --> 00:41:17.440
SPEAKER: I never thought I
would be on my underwear.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.025
MAZ JOBRANI: You look Italian.

00:41:18.025 --> 00:41:18.635
SPEAKER: Dude.

00:41:18.635 --> 00:41:19.885
MAZ JOBRANI: You look Italian.

00:41:19.885 --> 00:41:22.630
[LAUGHS]

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:25.840
If we throw a little
pasta sauce on that, hey!

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.510
It's Hadi.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.010
Ciao!

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.914
Hey, Hadi!

00:41:29.914 --> 00:41:33.922
SPEAKER: All right,
going forward.

00:41:33.922 --> 00:41:35.380
MAZ JOBRANI: What's
your last name?

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.062
SPEAKER: Zade.

00:41:36.062 --> 00:41:37.020
MAZ JOBRANI: Hadi Zade.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.270
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.228
MAZ JOBRANI: You could
do Hadi Zade, hey, ciao!

00:41:39.228 --> 00:41:41.186
I'm telling you, bro.

00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:42.310
You want me to go to there?

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.927
SPEAKER: Yeah, let's do it.

00:41:43.927 --> 00:41:44.760
You want to read it?

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:44.980
MAZ JOBRANI: Sure.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.600
"How do you deal
with the large number

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.240
of Trump-loving conservative
Iranians of Los Angeles?"

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.590
I ignore them.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.470
"The idea that they
exist just blows my mind.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.420
And I can't do anything
besides ignore them--

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.336
SPEAKER: There you go.

00:41:56.336 --> 00:41:59.530
MAZ JOBRANI: --"and/or get in
giant fights on Facebook about

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:03.784
how he/the travel ban are racist
towards them and their people."

00:42:03.784 --> 00:42:05.950
Well, you know, what's
interesting is, first of all,

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:09.580
arguing on Facebook is futile.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.150
Don't do it.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.750
It's why?

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.084
Why are you arguing on Facebook?

00:42:12.084 --> 00:42:13.541
You don't know who
the other guy is

00:42:13.541 --> 00:42:15.250
and how much time
he has on his hands?

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.380
And you're not going
to convince him.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.510
I stopped arguing
a long time ago.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.050
So my first advice would
be, don't argue on Facebook.

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.190
Give your opinion or
whatever, put it out there.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.690
Let it Go

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:25.600
You know how much--

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.850
I've had it before.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.330
As a comedian, I'll
post something.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.038
And this is one of my
biggest pet peeves.

00:42:30.038 --> 00:42:33.130
Someone will come back, if
I post a serious thing--

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:34.720
stick to comedy, bro.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.220
Stick to trying
to be funny, dude.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.980
And I want to be like,
stick to whatever

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.370
unemployment thing you've
got going on right now, bro.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:47.590
Because the truth is,
comedians, we are human beings.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:48.590
We have points of view.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.180
So I should be able to
express my point of view.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.013
And if you don't agree
with me, that's fine.

00:42:52.013 --> 00:42:55.360
But sometimes when I get
that, like someone tries

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.620
to insult me on social media,
I used to be like, oh, my god.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.837
I've got to come back
with a good comeback.

00:43:01.837 --> 00:43:02.920
What if I come back with--

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.270
OK, that's what I'm gonna-- and
meanwhile, my wife's like, hey,

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.740
come to dinner.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.890
I'll be right there, man.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.519
I'm like-- upsetting me.

00:43:09.519 --> 00:43:10.810
And my kids, I love you, Daddy.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:11.320
Shut up!

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.460
Give me a comeback!

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:16.330
It It took over my day.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.010
And then I was like,
what am I doing?

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.310
And then really, a lot of times,
if you click the person's name,

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.320
they got, like, one follower.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.120
And you're like,
who is this person?

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.940
And why am I arguing with them?

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.400
So yeah, right off the
bat, I ignore these people

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.220
that argue with me.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.200
And then secondly, the
thing about Iranians

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.894
that are conservative, I
think a lot of immigrants,

00:43:37.894 --> 00:43:40.060
a lot of people-- what this
election made me realize

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.760
is there's more
conservative-minded people

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.530
in the world than
progressive-minded people.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.160
So one of the things
I heard on NPR,

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.840
was a Colombian guy, who
was Colombian immigrant,

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.727
and with an accent.

00:43:52.727 --> 00:43:54.560
He was talking about
how he voted for Trump.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.200
And he said, I voted for Trump
because I am anti-abortion,

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.700
I am pro-marriage being
between a man and a woman.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.730
You know, all the conservative
things that he supported,

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.060
he was able to hold his nose and
be like, I'm voting for Trump.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.710
Because if remember,
in the debate,

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.100
Trump was next to Hillary.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.070
He goes, if you
vote for her, she's

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.910
going to be pulling babies
out in the ninth month,

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:19.960
just pulling babies out.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.630
And Hillary was
like, no, I'm not.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.252
But people that are supportive
of that were like, well, then,

00:44:25.252 --> 00:44:26.210
we got to vote for him.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:28.040
So I think there's a lot of
people that are conservative.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.980
A lot of the Iranians
that support Trump--

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.870
I know there's Iranian Jewish
people that support Trump

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.090
because they're pro-Israel.

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.256
I know that there's other
Iranians who support Trump

00:44:36.256 --> 00:44:39.381
because they feel that Trump
will get rid of this government

00:44:39.381 --> 00:44:39.880
somehow.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.129
Because a lot of Iranians
are against this government.

00:44:42.129 --> 00:44:45.070
I personally don't support
the Islamic Republic of Iran.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.960
I'm opposed to the
government and the lack

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.642
of freedoms and the
human rights violations.

00:44:50.642 --> 00:44:51.850
By the way, I just said that.

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:55.000
I guess I won't be performing
in Iran anytime soon.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.820
But I'm against it.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.850
But I also don't think that
we should go to war with Iran.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:59.920
But a lot of supporters
of Trump feel that, oh,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.750
he's going to just
get rid of those guys.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.875
Because if you go to war
with Iran, it'll be messy.

00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:05.390
A lot of innocent
Iranians will die.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:08.760
So that's my
response to that one.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.260
"How can we win over the older
generation, second generation

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.760
Iranians in LA and Orange County
to vote for representatives

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.000
in 2018 who support us,
are against the travel ban,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.166
against the wall, et cetera?

00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:19.500
The representative of Orange
County is very pro-Trump.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.670
But an Iranian-American
is running next time.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:22.300
Can you help?"

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.300
Yeah, actually, I know
that guy that's running--

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.600
Kia.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.590
Is it Hamadanchy?

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.690
Kia, I forget his
last name right now.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:29.890
Yeah, Hamadanchy.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:30.850
He's a young guy.

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:36.674
He's running on the platform
of against the travel ban.

00:45:36.674 --> 00:45:38.590
Yeah, Orange County is
also very conservative.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.982
I mean, I guess, the main thing
too is immigrants in general--

00:45:41.982 --> 00:45:43.690
I don't know how the
Indian community is.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.600
But I know that
a lot of Iranians

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.810
don't get too involved
with politics because we

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.950
had a bad experience.

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.060
So they'll be like,
don't register.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.600
They're going to come get you.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.720
And we're like no, man.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720
You got to get involved.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.240
So it's just about getting--

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.990
you've got to convince
people that they should

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.040
get politically involved.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.540
Otherwise, we end
up-- if you really

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.600
don't like what's going
on, then get involved.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.710
So that's really the hope.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:15.200
"Do you have writers for
stand-ups, or it's only you?"

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.600
Hadi actually helps me
write a lot of my jokes.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:21.062
The t-shirt bit was
rehearsed earlier.

00:46:21.062 --> 00:46:22.520
I think that was
a pretty good one.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.930
I think we got something.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:27.230
No, as a stand-up comedian,
I write all my stuff.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.110
A lot of people also will
come see you do stand-up.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.890
And then they'll see
you six months later,

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:35.324
three months later, and you have
some jokes that you did before.

00:46:35.324 --> 00:46:36.740
And, why don't you
have new stuff?

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.260
Because they're used to
seeing the late night

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.390
show hosts do new
material every night.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:43.940
But those guys have
a team of writers.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.310
And they've got visuals
and all that stuff.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.560
As a stand-up
comedian, even the guys

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.870
that are the most prolific,
a guy like Louis CK,

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.970
it takes you like a
year or so, at least,

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:55.730
a year to two years, to
write a whole new hour.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.930
You put that hour out.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.430
And then you work
on the next hour.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.470
So yeah, I write
all my own stuff.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:04.250
Once in a while, another
comedian might be at my show.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.900
And we do this,
all of us together.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.774
If I might be watching
another comedian,

00:47:07.774 --> 00:47:09.190
and I might go up
and go, hey, you

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.810
know that bit you do about
the whatever whatever?

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.430
You should tag it with this.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.290
And we give each
other these ideas.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:16.660
So that's that.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.920
"Do you have thoughts
on Asif's sunset show?"

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.312
You know, so I'm not a big
fan of reality television,

00:47:23.312 --> 00:47:25.520
whether it's "Shahs of
Sunset" or Kardashians, or any

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.103
of that stuff.

00:47:26.103 --> 00:47:28.097
It's like fingernails
on a chalkboard to me.

00:47:28.097 --> 00:47:30.680
But when "Shahs of Sunset" came
out, I actually did defend it.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.160
Because again, a
lot of Iranians--

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.180
and I don't know how the other
immigrant communities are.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.510
But we like to complain.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:41.190
But we don't ever do
anything proactive.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.690
It's like.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.856
If you're going to complain.

00:47:42.856 --> 00:47:44.310
Then do something.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.044
So this came out.

00:47:45.044 --> 00:47:46.460
And they are like,
this not right.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.425
They are showing-- we
are lawyers and doctors.

00:47:48.425 --> 00:47:51.450
They should do a show
about lawyers and doctors.

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.270
Who's going to watch that?

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.519
"LA Law," I mean, whatever.

00:47:54.519 --> 00:47:55.560
You know what I'm saying.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.239
Not "LA Law," "Law and Order."

00:47:58.239 --> 00:47:59.780
No, but who's going
to watch a show--

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.280
Like, people would
be like, you should

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.196
do a show about the
Iranian history, you know,

00:48:03.196 --> 00:48:05.520
history of Iran,
and the Persepolis.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.040
I'm like, you know what?

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.590
OK, you make it and
make an entertaining.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.390
And maybe somebody
will watch it.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.280
But this, to me, was
actually interesting.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.910
Because I was saying, like,
before "Shahs of Sunset,"

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.160
we were known as terrorists.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.710
But in "Shahs of Sunset,"
they were partying and getting

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:22.460
drunk.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.680
So I was like, that's a
step in the right direction.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.750
You know what I'm saying?

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:28.250
Seriously.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:31.020
At least, if someone in middle
America sees as, they're like,

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.085
they like to get
drunk just like us!

00:48:33.085 --> 00:48:33.585
You know?

00:48:33.585 --> 00:48:34.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:34.395 --> 00:48:36.660
This is great!

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.500
So I thought it was progress.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.630
Yeah, but I don't watch it.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.667
Any other questions?

00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:44.250
SPEAKER: You know
what I was thinking?

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:44.540
MAZ JOBRANI: Yes.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.570
SPEAKER: You will
leave here soon,

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:47.486
but I have to work with
them on a daily basis.

00:48:47.486 --> 00:48:48.674
So--

00:48:48.674 --> 00:48:50.360
MAZ JOBRANI: That's
all right, man.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.230
You look good, baby.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.000
SPEAKER: Yeah, thanks.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.100
Do we have any live
questions from our audience?

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.950
MAZ JOBRANI: Any live
questions, questions

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.990
from the live audience?

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.830
You heard it all.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.520
You want to go back to the
cafeteria, eat some more?

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.652
Does that thing go all day?

00:49:04.652 --> 00:49:06.110
What time does the
cafeteria close?

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.820
AUDIENCE: They're
closed already.

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.540
MAZ JOBRANI: 1:30 PM.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.780
Oh, it's closed now.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.900
And dinner?

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.645
Afternoon snacks?

00:49:12.645 --> 00:49:13.270
AUDIENCE: 6:00.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.020
MAZ JOBRANI: 6:00.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.010
Oh, see?

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:18.170
I thought it was open all day.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:20.420
OK, so you're not
as spoiled as--

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.190
OK.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.400
All right.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.380
But you have the nap room now.

00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.399
That's open all day, massage.

00:49:26.399 --> 00:49:28.940
So what happens if you're here
at, like, 2:00 in the morning?

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:29.510
I have questions.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:30.140
You don't have questions?

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.605
I've got questions for you.

00:49:31.605 --> 00:49:33.937
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:36.020
What happens if you're
here at 2:00 in the morning

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:36.650
and you want to eat?

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:37.159
Is there--

00:49:37.159 --> 00:49:38.450
AUDIENCE: There's a snack room.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:39.020
MAZ JOBRANI: Snack room.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.103
OK, but there's not a guy
in the restaurant going,

00:49:41.103 --> 00:49:42.799
like, oh, Jesus,
Hadi's back again.

00:49:42.799 --> 00:49:43.340
AUDIENCE: No.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.180
MAZ JOBRANI: No.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.700
OK, all right, OK.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.260
Well, thank you
guys for having me.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:48.920
No questions?

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.640
Nothing?

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.710
OK, oh, one question.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:52.957
One question.

00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:55.760
AUDIENCE: Speaking about Trump,
how do you handle Trump jokes?

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.180
MAZ JOBRANI: He's got the--

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.590
AUDIENCE: Sorry, speaking
about Trump, in your stand-up,

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.870
how do you handle Trump jokes?

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:05.540
Because he's so polarizing.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.940
I mean, obviously, yeah,
he's an easy target.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:09.790
But it can completely
divide your audience.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:10.790
MAZ JOBRANI: Absolutely.

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.560
Yeah, I've actually had people
that get upset, like I said.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.090
People get upset even online.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:15.965
Why are you making fun
of him, this and that.

00:50:15.965 --> 00:50:17.510
And ultimately,
listen, as a comedian

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:22.070
or as anybody who's creating
any kind of comedy or music

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.870
or movie, whatever
you do, you really

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.730
got to talk about
your point of view.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:26.490
This is who I am.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.740
I'm very liberal.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.210
You know, I'm pro-gay marriage.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:30.530
I'm pro-abortion.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.930
I'm anti-gun.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.040
I'm pro-gun control,
all that stuff.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.300
So that's just who I am.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.870
And so if it bothers
somebody that much,

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.850
then I go, listen, I'm
sorry, but that's what it is.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:46.120
And Trump, a lot of times, the
jokes that I do come from--

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.390
I'm not making stuff up.

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.536
It's stuff that he said.

00:50:48.536 --> 00:50:49.910
So that's what
I've said as well.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:51.074
You know, I liked Obama.

00:50:51.074 --> 00:50:52.490
But if you did a
joke about Obama,

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:54.915
I personally wouldn't
be like, how dare you?

00:50:54.915 --> 00:50:57.290
If it were based in truth,
I'd be like, oh, that's funny.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:59.760
So the key is, if you're
not willing to have

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.680
a sense of humor
about your guy, even

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.399
though your guy is basically--

00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:07.440
you know what I'm saying?

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.430
He's very make-fun-of-able.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:12.930
You know what I'm saying?

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:14.865
I mean, he's bringing
it on himself.

00:51:14.865 --> 00:51:17.240
So if you're not willing to--
then I've often said, well,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.906
then maybe you should
go see a therapist

00:51:18.906 --> 00:51:21.180
and discuss your
issues to open up

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.850
about why it is that
you're not willing--

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.830
why do you love
this guy so much?

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:25.950
You know what I'm saying?

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:27.150
Because people have
come up to me before

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.350
and said, like,
you know, I think

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:29.080
you offended a few people.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.996
I go, well, I think those
people should really

00:51:30.996 --> 00:51:32.070
loosen up a little bit.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.990
It's a comedy show.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:36.090
And some people go,
well, I don't want to--

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.010
you shouldn't mix
comedy with politics.

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.939
My favorite comedy
mixes politics.

00:51:39.939 --> 00:51:41.730
So if they're upset,
then I go, OK, there's

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:42.964
nothing I can do for you.

00:51:42.964 --> 00:51:44.130
But that's my point of view.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.400
You know what I'm saying?

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.840
Oh, he has a question.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.340
AUDIENCE: Talking
about Trump again,

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.710
you said the last 40
years haven't really

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.870
changed the impression
about Iranians too much.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.421
It's still similar.

00:51:55.421 --> 00:51:56.170
MAZ JOBRANI: Yeah.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.820
AUDIENCE: With Trump, I
think there's definitely

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.507
something really, really adverse
that has probably not been

00:52:02.507 --> 00:52:03.590
seen in the last 40 years.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:07.207
Do you think the next 40
will be different or worse?

00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:08.540
MAZ JOBRANI: Gosh, I don't know.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.070
My only hope I have--

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:14.180
he was saying about a guy
said how the image of Iranians

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.820
hasn't changed much since
I was a five-year-old,

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.220
and now I'm 45.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.840
My only hope is--

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.350
I'm Iranian.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:22.190
My wife is Indian.

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.420
Our kids are mixed.

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.610
Our neighbor's husband is black.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:26.780
The wife is white.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.960
Their kids are mixed.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.590
And the more mixed I see,
the more of that stuff

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:31.940
I see, it gives me some hope.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.910
Because I go, oh, we're starting
to understand each other.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:37.660
And I even say it.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:42.350
The people that are so afraid
of Muslims coming and bringing

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:44.930
Sharia law, I go, have
you ever met a Muslim?

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.710
Have you ever gone to a
Lebanese or Persian restaurant?

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.810
Go eat at one of the
restaurants and see

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:52.790
how nice these people
are, and how they're just

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.300
trying to live their lives.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.260
And I guarantee you that it
would help win people over.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.570
But I think a lot of people
believe in that fear.

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.653
When I watched the Republican
National Convention,

00:53:01.653 --> 00:53:03.320
it was, like, just
fear mongering.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:07.771
And even now, it's like a lot
of people that have anti-Islamic

00:53:07.771 --> 00:53:08.270
ideas--

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:09.672
I'm not even that religious.

00:53:09.672 --> 00:53:11.630
But a lot of people that
have anti-Muslim ideas

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:13.310
are people that
think that Muslims

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.010
are going to bring Sharia
law and somehow implement

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:17.670
it, and then take over.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:20.020
I don't even know
how this would work.

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.190
I have no idea how one
would implement this thing.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:24.500
But there's people
that are freaked out.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:28.490
So I'm hoping that there's
more mixing, you know,

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:31.070
and people realizing
we're just all in it

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:32.870
with the same
problems and issues.

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:33.830
Yes.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:37.284
AUDIENCE: Why do you think there
aren't more Iranian comedians?

00:53:37.284 --> 00:53:39.200
MAZ JOBRANI: There are
more Iranian comedians.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.550
They're all in prison in Iran.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.050
And--

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:43.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.450
No, I'll tell you.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:45.724
Actually, there are now.

00:53:45.724 --> 00:53:47.640
Again, it goes back to
the generational thing.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.480
I think that I was
one of the first ones

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.430
because I just
happened to be older.

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:54.260
I was in America.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.790
So there was me over here.

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:58.220
There's Omid Djalili,
who started in England.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.590
And now there's a good number.

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.040
There's Max Amini.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.310
There's Amir K, Tehran, K-von.

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:07.580
A lot of them have one name.

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.610
There is a guy named
Peter the Persian.

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:10.820
There's a handful of us.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:12.320
It's a generational
thing, I think.

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.870
So I think the
more we integrate,

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:18.620
the more we're going to have
people doing comedy, and also

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.020
realizing that we can,
and our parents realizing.

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:24.410
Now, contrary to what used
to happen, when I was first

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:26.600
starting out, people,
even my parents' friends,

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.460
would be like, why
are you doing this?

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.210
It's embarrassing.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:31.340
You should be a
banker, a doctor.

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.410
But now, I have people
come up-- listen, Max,

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:34.914
my son, very funny guy.

00:54:34.914 --> 00:54:36.080
You should put him on stage.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:40.580
He's five years old, man.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.010
Take it easy.

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.537
Who else?

00:54:43.537 --> 00:54:44.120
Somebody else?

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:44.620
Yes.

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.730
AUDIENCE: So actually, I
have a related question.

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.440
So what did it take
for your parents

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.725
to decide that your
career choice was OK?

00:54:50.725 --> 00:54:52.350
MAZ JOBRANI: [LAUGHS]
What did it take?

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:52.710
AUDIENCE: I was going to say--

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:53.080
I don't know.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.330
MAZ JOBRANI: Yeah, my parents.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.529
I encourage a lot
of young people

00:55:00.529 --> 00:55:02.320
that have immigrant
parents, or even if you

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:02.950
don't have immigrant parents--

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:04.000
I was talking to
a guy who wasn't

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.666
an immigrant who said
his parents wanted

00:55:05.666 --> 00:55:09.610
him to have a reputable job.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.800
I really feel like if
you find your passion

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.590
and you can really go for it,
your parents will come around.

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:18.490
So the first time I had
that battle with my parents

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:21.160
was when I went to Italy
for my junior year abroad.

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.400
My mom didn't want me to go.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.730
My dad had just
moved back to Iran.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.320
My mother and aunt
were pushing me.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.270
They were saying, you
should stay in America

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.330
to help support the
family if they need you.

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.080
And I was like, no, I
need to go to Italy.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.250
I've been studying for this.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:33.780
I'm going.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.800
And when I went, my
mom was upset at me.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.920
But a few months later, she
came around and embraced it.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.190
So the same thing
with the comedy.

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:44.710
When I did it, it wasn't like
I was asking her permission.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:46.210
I was like, I'm
going to do this.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.530
And I think for her--
again, she was nervous.

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:50.720
I think that they want
what's best for you.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.104
They want some kind
of job security.

00:55:53.104 --> 00:55:55.270
But I think it wasn't until
she started to see that,

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:58.234
oh, you're having success, oh,
and people coming up to her.

00:55:58.234 --> 00:55:59.150
Hey, your son's funny.

00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:00.550
And oh, wow, you know.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.500
So then she started
basking in it.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.405
Now, she'll deliver messages.

00:56:04.405 --> 00:56:06.610
She's like, I was
at the airport.

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:09.070
And I started
talking to a couple.

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:09.820
And that's my mom.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.960
That's how my mom talks.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.630
I start talking.

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:14.320
And they find out
I'm your mother.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.150
They say they like
your comedy, but you

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:17.305
need to write new material.

00:56:17.305 --> 00:56:19.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.040
I go, really?

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.340
They're bringing
messages through you?

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.000
So now, she's bringing messages.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.170
Yes.

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:29.436
AUDIENCE: So there are new
comedy shows like "Black-ish,"

00:56:29.436 --> 00:56:30.310
"Fresh Off the Boat."

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:32.690
Do you think there's
potential for an Iranian--

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:35.600
because they're normal, but they
have their own eccentricities.

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.210
MAZ JOBRANI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:36.700
No, I hear you.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.450
You know what's interesting?

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:38.290
You say that.

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:40.420
The clip that you guys
saw in the beginning

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.610
where I was bowling, and then
I was arguing with this lady.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.945
And I said, this is the
battle of the sexes.

00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:47.900
You're Billie Jean.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.570
I'm Bobby Ray.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:53.887
That was a TV show based on a
book called "Funny in Farsi."

00:56:53.887 --> 00:56:55.720
"Funny in Farsi" was a
book that was written

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.400
by a lady named Firoozeh Dumas.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.450
It's her biography.

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:00.160
It's really good.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.090
In 2009, we filmed that
as a pilot for ABC.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.537
And we got really close
to getting chosen.

00:57:06.537 --> 00:57:08.120
But they didn't
choose us at the time.

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.820
And I'm convinced that if that
show had been produced now,

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.890
with "Black-ish" and
"Fresh Off the Boat,"

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:17.680
I think they would have
at least given us a shot.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.060
So I think it's coming.

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:20.830
Aziz Ansari is doing
"Master of None,"

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:22.119
which is an Indian family.

00:57:22.119 --> 00:57:24.160
So I think it's a matter
of time before you start

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.020
seeing more of that stuff.

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.890
Anyone else?

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:28.390
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.890
No?

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:29.624
We're good?

00:57:29.624 --> 00:57:30.290
All right, guys.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:31.206
Thanks for coming out.

00:57:31.206 --> 00:57:34.020
[APPLAUSE]
