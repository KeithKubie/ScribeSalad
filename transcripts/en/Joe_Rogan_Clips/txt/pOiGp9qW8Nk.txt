Speaker 1:          00:00          If they've got their own guys that's, that's great. Jackson, they've got their own people. Um, but you know w w there's plenty of people on the roster that have an MMA coach and a grappling coach and that's it. So the performance institute, we, we feel we can help and support those guys as well. You can bridge the gap. Right. And we're not trying to displace the programs where athletes already have resources, but I don't know of another MMA gym globally that has the capacity around assessment that we do. So yeah, we have, we have some really great practitioners but Bose and of our strength coach and his team can not write programs for 570 athletes. Yup. It's not possible. But what we can do is assess those athletes, provide that feedback back to their strength coaches and have conversations about how those coaches can use that data to, to support the development of that athlete and that that goes across the board for all of our performance services. What's pretty amazing resource because if you're a young fighter and all you have is access to the people around you, you get, if you're fighting in the UFC, you get to have access like instantaneously to this gigantic group of people where it's like when forest, when you were coming up, you mean you are a real pioneer. I mean that was, that was not available to a guy. Like, you know, I mean

Speaker 2:          01:09          I tell the story all the time, but so I was actually a little bit ahead of my time. I had, you know, I had an actual strength coach that had letters behind his name and went to college to be a strength coach. Not there was like an ex bodybuilder. Uh, I had a, you know, a relatively good nutritionist who at least had a degree in chemical biology. Uh, I had a good physical therapist, but I didn't really have like I was my coach, you know, at the end of the day I was the head of performance. So I'd go do Jujitsu. Jujitsu coach wants you to go hard and then you go kickbox but you're going to go light. But it's kicked by it so you don't, and then you know, and now you know, nobody's the strength coach and nutritionist on different pages. So I think just understanding that everything has to work together, which I didn't really understand.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Well, the one I'm saying is that you kind of had to pave a path because when a guy like you was doing all that stuff with a real legitimate strength condition coach, real legitimate nutritionist, how many other people were doing that at your time? Not that many, but I, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:08          be around good people like Randy couture, chocolate down. Those were kind of guys I got to hang out with and say, well, he does this. He does a chuck actually what ended that much of this stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:16          But Randy was, Chuck's was right. I know what I'm doing. K. All right. Yes sir. Yeah, he'd just existed on pure savagery. Um, when you step back and look at your career, like how, how amazing is it to be able to step off from there and do something like you're doing now for the UFC performance institute was just very meaningful for young fighters. When you really do get a chance to give back with your experience and your understanding of the right way and the wrong way, the mistakes that you've made. I mean, it's huge. I mean, that's the whole,

Speaker 2:          02:47          I mean that's the whole genesis kind of from, from my involvement in the pie. Like, oh look, here's the 10,000 mistakes I made. Yeah, you're gonna make mistakes too. But he, these are the ones you don't need to make. You know, again, the sport's changed, man. It's 25 years old. Every other sports, so all been around so long. Our sport changes all the time. I forget who was talking about it, but you know, even the guys fighting 10 years ago probably couldn't compete with guests fighting today, you know?

Speaker 3:          03:13          But I mean what I would say as well and is not only for the fighters, Forrest is a huge results for us. The bet, the best piece of technology we have is that they'll handle it leads from my office to up to four Esophagus, right? Because ultimately he's a massive results for us that are not necessarily coming from an NMA background and are trying to support the MMA community to, to bounce ideas off to essentially Beta test things from a thought process perspective. And he's a huge part of the performance institute philosophy because we can use and call upon his ex.

Speaker 2:          03:43          Here's another funny thing. When we were putting together the, the uh, the team for the Pii, I kind of shied away from, people already do an MMA. I wanted combat sports. Everybody that's done it has done judo boxing on an Olympic level. They've done combat sports. But I wanted like a fresh set of eyes coming from a different, you know, than just ah, you know, cause I know really good MMA strength coaches. I know pretty good. Emma, you know, you, you know, good. But get, get that fresh set of eyes. You know, nutrition actually was a little different because the rest of the world does not understand awake cut for an MMA fight. It's not like a, you know, we go to Exos, you go to any high level facility and they, you say, I'm going to lose 8% of my body weight, and then competed on Saturday. They're like, no, don't just fight in highway class. I'm like, yeah, that actually isn't gonna work out for me. They, they just won't comprehend it though. No, no. You'll perform better. Like, no, no, no.
