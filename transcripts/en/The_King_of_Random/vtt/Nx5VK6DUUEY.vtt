00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.800
Hey what's up guys! Welcome back.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.580
So I went down to the dollar store the other day and I found one of these 12-packs of party poppers

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.500
for a dollar each. These things are kinda cool, when you pull the string they pop out a little bit of confetti. No big deal

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.920
But for this project, I thought it would be fun to take this idea and supersize it by making party poppers that are a lot more powerful.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.100
Now if you ever wondered why a party popper pops when you pull the string, you are in luck because we are

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.980
going to cut these things open and show you the mechanism that sets these things off.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.500
*party popper blast*

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.420
Now if you slowly and carefully use something like a pair of scissors to cut around the base of the plastic,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.520
you can remove the top. You'll be left with the string and what looks like a little rolled up piece of paper on the end.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.180
If we take that little rolled up piece of paper and just very slowly and carefully unroll it (I gotta do this without

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.360
blowing my fingertips off) eventually we are going to get to the center and if you look closely, you are going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.300
to see there's a little red patch of powder right in the center of the string.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.200
This little red dot may look small and harmless but this is Armstrong's mixture, which is a high explosive so

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.280
sensitive it can get set off by friction.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.620
So as you pull the string through, the friction sets off the powder and causes the explosion.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.220
*party popper bang*

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.980
So here's the basic idea: let's bring back the hydrogen generator we made in a previous video, pack one of

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.700
these water bottles full of confetti and use one of these small party poppers as the ignitor to set the whole thing off.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.780
We're also going to want our party poppers to be a little more powerful

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.520
than one of these lame little explosions.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.260
So for that I went down to the local Supercenter

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.220
and picked up some of these multi-colored pieces of construction paper

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.700
as well as a roll of fire-resistant party streamers.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.140
Now I had kind of a hard time finding actual confetti at the store,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.280
but if take a bunch of construction paper like this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.600
and use a multi-hole punch like this,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.180
we can make our own colored dots in just a few seconds.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.860
So a couple of minutes later, we have ourselves

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.900
handfuls upon handfuls of these little, colored dots.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.400
This is gonna be fun.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.620
Now over here, we need to turn our water bottles into something I like to call confetti cartridges

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.440
and that's easily done by taking a few handfuls of these colored dots,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.140
shoving them down into the bottom of our bottle, and then covering everything

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200
with a couple of layers of our fire-resistant party streamers

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.000
to hold everything in place

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.260
...and make a really big mess as I do.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.880
Wow, I'm terrible.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.740
The idea being, if we did it right,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.120
we should be able to turn this thing upside down and our colored dots will stay in place.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.400
Now to make these things pull-string poppers,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.420
we need to just slightly modify our water bottle lids

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.940
and for that, I'm using a toothpick.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.040
All you need to do is poke a small hole through the center of the cap

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.260
then bite one end off the toothpick and use the blunt surface

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.040
to push the string from your party popper down through the inside of the cap.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.240
Now hydrogen is an extremely light gas

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.960
and even that small hole at the top will be enough

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.260
to let that gas rise up and escape over time.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.120
So let's just use a little bit of this tacky clay to plug that hole,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.700
which will give us slightly longer a shelf life for using our hydrogen bottles.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.920
So let's talk about the hydrogen generator for a second.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.640
This thing actually splits water into two molecules:

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.620
hydrogen and oxygen, and both of those gases combine

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.700
to make a highly explosive mixture.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.080
All we have to do is fill this thing up with distilled water,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.340
add a little potassium hydroxide as an electrolyte,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.320
and then hook it up to a car battery to get cranking out our gas.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.660
*sings* Two scoops of potassium hydroxide

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.500
and we're cool to run our generator.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.740
Cool. That starts bubbling immediately.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.740
*ignites*

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.500
So right now these bubbles are kind of weak,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.020
and that's because the system is pushing out all of the air that's trapped inside,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.480
but as all the air is pushed out of the system and the hydroxy gas replaces it,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.220
these bubbles will snap with a bang loud enough to hurt your ears

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.460
and that's when they're ready.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.480
*ignites*

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.480
Alright, I think our system's good.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.480
Now charging our confetti cartridges with hydroxy gas

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.180
is actually a lot easier than you might think.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.600
Just take the output end of your hydroxy generator,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.940
stick it inside the bottle, and hold it upside down for about one minute.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.820
As the hydrogen and oxygen rise, they're going to displace all the air out of the bottle

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.900
until only the hydroxy gas is left.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.380
At that point, just screw the lid back on and your confetti cartridge is ready for action.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.480
Update, guys! I've got my wife with me

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.100
to test out our very first cartridge here.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.260
And these things are a lot louder than you might think,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.480
so I brought a couple of earplugs for her to put in

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.140
and I'm going to give you a thick glove,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.400
because as you pull the string I don't want any shrapnel coming back into your hand either.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.000
These things are powerful, guys.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.400
Now this thing should be just about ready, so let's go ahead and screw the cap back on

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.500
Now all you're going to do is hold this in one hand

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.780
and when you're ready, pull the string and let's see what happens.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.480
*bangs*

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.400
*laughter*

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.620
It worked!

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.180
It worked!

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.480
[Janae: Oh wow!]

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.100
So check out this damage, guys

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.380
we've got a little bit of a exit wound near the neck of the bottle

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.780
but look at the top!

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.460
I mean, it just shredded that completely.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.440
That worked perfectly, and we got confetti all over the room,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.500
that was awesome.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.620
Apparently we have some spider webs in the basement here, because you can actually see

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.540
confetti stuck to the spider webs!

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.360
[Oh, apparently, uh, that wasn't clean!]

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.800
Hey did you guys see that when it exploded there was

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.380
actually like a huge fireball I saw blast at my face

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.460
and then all the confetti went this way?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.460
It smells kind of like sulfur, it smells kind of like gunpowder just went off.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.700
I think that was just from the actual pull string

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.360
party popper itself, the hydrogen doesn't make that smell.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.920
But you can see how much more powerful these things are now

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.400
with the hydroxy gas in the bottles, right?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.980
[Oh yeah, that's gonna make for a really amazing party favor right there!]

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.080
Oh, and, uh, how was it having the earplugs in?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.800
How much of a difference do you think that made to the effect?

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.540
[It was still extremely loud.]

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.180
Yeah, I had my ears plugged and I could still hear quite a bit as well.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.700
If you don't have your ears plugged, your ears will sting,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.380
they will ring. It hurts quite a bit.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.520
[Yeah, if I didn't have those earplugs in, they would be ringing now for sure.]

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.620
You wanna try another one?

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.480
[No!] *laughs*

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.280
Okay, how about I do it this time? [Okay, I'll watch.]

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.160
Okay, so I'll do it this time.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.260
Alright, so our second bottle is charged,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.060
and this time I'm gonna set it off.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.640
Gloves on for safety.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.660
And I think I'm just going to shoot it straight up at the ceiling this time

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.860
just to see if we can see the confetti go up and rain back down.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.100
So, I'm gonna get a little bit risky and stand a little bit closer than I should

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.620
and if all goes well...

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.760
(Why don't you get a little bit closer, you ready?)

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.280
Here we go, moment of truth.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.140
*bangs* [Woo!]

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.260
Wow!

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.560
Dang!

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.200
Check this out, it exploded right in my hand, like right in the neck of the bottle,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.820
my fingers are tingling from the shock wave.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.020
It's a really good thing I was wearing gloves there.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.820
And look at that, it just burst out the side.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.580
Amazingly, like none of the confetti came out.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.280
[We can reuse all that confetti.]

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.320
There's like this little hole in the top. I think we're going to have to do that again.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.080
[I think the baby can hear those explosions.]

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.200
Oh really? *laughs* [Yeah!] You think he jumped?

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.360
Now how did you get your bottle to explode, but mine busted at the neck?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.480
[I think I was holding it at an angle.]

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.620
You think the angle makes a difference?

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.480
[For whatever reason, I think that that helped the blast go up and out rather than straight up...]

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.080
Okay. So let's go ahead and screw on our last blast cap here.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.620
*bangs*

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.780
Dang! It was amazing!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.900
I, like, felt the kick-back on my hand

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.260
and then it just all went out the top.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.940
Woah, come look at this, come look at this!

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.820
It all blasted out the top, like it just shredded it

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.120
and pushed everything out. That was perfect.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.520
There's no damage down here by the neck, but I actually felt that kick back and hit my fingers.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.840
Even with this big thick glove on, it hit my fingers to the point where

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.980
they're a little bit numb. They're stinging.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.280
But that blast couldn't have worked out more perfectly. That was AMAZING!

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.860
King of Random party poppers, guys. How about that?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.200
So, cool. So, yeah.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.440
Thoughts on that, Janae?

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.440
[I think that was awesome.]

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.640
So there you have it, guys! That's how to turn your ordinary dollar store party poppers

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.160
into party poppers, King of Random style.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.240
They pack a little bit more of a punch, and are quite a bit louder as well.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.480
