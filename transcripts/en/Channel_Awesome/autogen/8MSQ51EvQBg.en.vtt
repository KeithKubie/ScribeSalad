of an introductory I guess I got this at

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
of an introductory I guess I got this at
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.080
of an introductory I guess I got this at
a goodwill for about 3 bucks and I think

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
a goodwill for about 3 bucks and I think
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299
a goodwill for about 3 bucks and I think
it's probably it's battery operator

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
it's probably it's battery operator
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.330
it's probably it's battery operator
something so I probably doesn't work

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340
something so I probably doesn't work
 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.049

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320
paint it using some krylon colormaster
 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.660
paint it using some krylon colormaster
so I'm going to just spray paint we're

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

anything like that and like I said we
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010
anything like that and like I said we
might add a few elements to it they kind

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
might add a few elements to it they kind
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.300

and stuff like that I would recommend it
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.289
and stuff like that I would recommend it
you can also put like a plate or

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
you can also put like a plate or
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910
you can also put like a plate or
something like that over it to hide it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
something like that over it to hide it
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830
something like that over it to hide it
if you don't feel like standing the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
if you don't feel like standing the
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870
if you don't feel like standing the
whole thing down but if you do sand it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
whole thing down but if you do sand it
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.059
whole thing down but if you do sand it
down it actually helps the paint stick

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
down it actually helps the paint stick
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.669
down it actually helps the paint stick
to it a lot better so that's what I'm

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
to it a lot better so that's what I'm
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.540
to it a lot better so that's what I'm
going to be doing I'm just going to be

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
going to be doing I'm just going to be
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.760
going to be doing I'm just going to be
sanding it down real quick

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
sanding it down real quick
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.470
sanding it down real quick
my palm sander and then we're going to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
my palm sander and then we're going to
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.170
my palm sander and then we're going to
mask off some of the areas that we want

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
mask off some of the areas that we want
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.060
mask off some of the areas that we want
so the gray areas the thing I'm going to

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070
so the gray areas the thing I'm going to
 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.450
so the gray areas the thing I'm going to
keep gray and then I'm going to mask off

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460
keep gray and then I'm going to mask off
 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.190
keep gray and then I'm going to mask off
those areas paint the rest of it lie

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200
those areas paint the rest of it lie
 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.100
those areas paint the rest of it lie
flat black and then mask off some other

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110
flat black and then mask off some other
 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.870
flat black and then mask off some other
parts and I think we'll go with some

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880
parts and I think we'll go with some
 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.880
parts and I think we'll go with some
kind of a dark green or something for

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
kind of a dark green or something for
 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.170
kind of a dark green or something for
some of the other elements to make it

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
some of the other elements to make it
 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.150
some of the other elements to make it
look kind of military and then we're

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160
look kind of military and then we're
 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.350
look kind of military and then we're
weather it a bit using some cheap kind

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360
weather it a bit using some cheap kind
 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:04:09.780
weather it a bit using some cheap kind
of technique so let's get started

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790
 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:20.270
zero

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280
 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.370
all right so we got our base coat on it

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380
all right so we got our base coat on it
 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.920
all right so we got our base coat on it
and it's looking pretty good if you

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930
and it's looking pretty good if you
 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.570
and it's looking pretty good if you
wanted to you could probably step right

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580
wanted to you could probably step right
 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.330
wanted to you could probably step right
here and just do some highlights and

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340
here and just do some highlights and
 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.060
here and just do some highlights and
stuff like that on it to kind of weather

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070
stuff like that on it to kind of weather
 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.370
stuff like that on it to kind of weather
it a little bit but I want to add a

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380
it a little bit but I want to add a
 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.830
it a little bit but I want to add a
little bit of color to it just so it's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840
little bit of color to it just so it's
 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.310
little bit of color to it just so it's
not all black so I'm going to mask off

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320
not all black so I'm going to mask off
 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.230
not all black so I'm going to mask off
some of the other elements of it and

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240
some of the other elements of it and
 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.550
some of the other elements of it and
then hit it with a I think like an olive

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560
then hit it with a I think like an olive
 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.950
then hit it with a I think like an olive
green or dark green kind of give it sort

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960
green or dark green kind of give it sort
 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.159
green or dark green kind of give it sort
of a military look I guess I also think

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
of a military look I guess I also think
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.600
of a military look I guess I also think
I want to add something to the end of it

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610
I want to add something to the end of it
 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.010
I want to add something to the end of it
the barrel to make it look a little bit

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020
the barrel to make it look a little bit
 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.210
the barrel to make it look a little bit
different I've got this barrel from

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220
different I've got this barrel from
 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.460
different I've got this barrel from
another cheap gun that I got at a

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470
another cheap gun that I got at a
 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.150
