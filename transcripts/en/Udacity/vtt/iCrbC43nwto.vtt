00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.029
Now the C allele would be dominant because

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.530
you only need one copy to see an effect.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.260
And it's a loss of function allele because the

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.410
rate of metabolism is reduced. Remember, dominant alleles show

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.500
up when there's only one copy. And we would

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.890
definitely see a backup of Warfarin, leading to increased

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.200
Warfarin toxicity. And it's a loss of function well,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.761
because we've reduced our normal function by about 40%.
