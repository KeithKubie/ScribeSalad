00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.820
*intro music*

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.100
Fall is here.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.160
This time of the year is my favorite-

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.040
a period of transformation and exciting changes.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.100
It provides many opportunities for healing,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.520
but just like everything in life, you can't have the good without the bad.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.860
Jumping into piles of leaves and baking apple pies are fun,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.120
but Seasonal Affective Disorder totally isn't.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.680
Think you might have it?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.400
Here are 6 signs you may have Seasonal Affective Disorder.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.620
One: You're either sleeping too much or too little.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.760
When we change our clocks back one hour for daylight savings,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.780
it saves us an extra hour of sleep, but sometimes that's not always the case.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.100
Seasonal Affective Disorder is caused by the changes in our circadian rhythms, melatonin, and serotonin.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.400
The faster it gets dark outside, the more it can disrupt our internal clock,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.700
which can cause our body to produce too much melatonin

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.520
leaving us to feel drowsy, or lowering our serotonin, which can take away from our sleep.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.680
Both melatonin and serotonin govern our sleep and wake cycle,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.940
so when the levels alternate, it could make a good night's sleep nearly impossible.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.740
We recommend taking a nice, warm bath before you get into bed,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.220
or curling up with a cup of hot tea.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.600
It doesn't hurt to also light up some lavender candles to help your mind and body calm down after a long day.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.120
The more relaxed you feel, the faster you'll fall asleep.

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:28.195
I personally also really love ASMR.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.440
Two: you're experiencing appetite and weight changes.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.560
Are you experiencing food cravings for sweets or salty snacks?

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.560
With the cold weather, it's tempting to binge on junk food in front of the TV, but that's how SAD gets you.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.920
We don't want to sound like your mom, but it's important to eat your fruits and veggies.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.320
If you have a craving for carbs, we suggest you eat some whole grain and add some bananas to your oatmeal.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.060
This will boost your serotonin levels.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.880
Foods high in Omega 3 fats will also help you combat depression, such as fish, walnuts, and soybeans

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.720
because they will improve your mood.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.320
Three: you don't enjoy your usual hobbies.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.580
We get it. Some days you just don't want to do anything after you get home from school or work,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.100
but if it starts to become consistent, it might be SAD kicking in.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.060
Losing your energy or your drive to do your favorite activities is a dead giveaway to this condition.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.640
You might find that you also have trouble concentrating on tasks

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.860
We recommend that you go outside for some sunshine

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.080
Getting your Vitamin D is essential.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.880
Those who face a deficiency in it often experience tiredness and body aches.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.860
You'd be surprised just how much a 10 minute walk can do for you.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.655
If you can we suggest going out in the morning

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:44.875
That way it starts your day off right with a fresh air.

00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:47.645
Four: You have frequent mood swings.

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:50.205
This is something I struggle with a lot.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:54.400
The waterworks are no joke, and when they happen sometimes they come outta nowhere.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.160
It's okay to cry, but we hope if you're on the same boat please don't hesitate to reach out to loved ones

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.240
or to us.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.860
Which brings to point 5: you withdraw from others.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.320
It's natural to cancel plans when a snowstorm is coming

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.560
but if you're being a hermit 24/7 something's definitely up

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.040
Come out from those covers and call up your friends and family.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.220
They want to be there for you, and if you feel guilty for ditching them, don't let that consume you.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.760
They'll understand when you bring up SAD; it's a lot more common than you think.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.700
Six: you get suicidal thoughts.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.880
This is probably the worst symptom of all.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.100
It might feel like a dead end is approaching when winter doesn't learn to let go,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.740
but please remember that spring is right around the corner.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.880
If you need to talk to a professional, we've provided some suicide hotlines.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.100
We care about your well-being and wanted to remind you that you've got people like us to lean on to.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.700
Do you struggle with Seasonal Affective Disorder?

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.500
What are your biggest challenges?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.560
Please share your thoughts with us below.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.460
