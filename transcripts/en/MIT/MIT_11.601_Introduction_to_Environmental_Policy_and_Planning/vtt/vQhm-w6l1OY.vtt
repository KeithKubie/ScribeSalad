GUEST SPEAKER: Dear
secretary of the interior,

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.680
thank you for inviting
me to weigh in

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.600
on this very important
counter study

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.640
to and indefensible claim
by the heritage society.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.160
As you know, this
conservative organization

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.957
is pushing for free enterprise
in limited government.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.540
So they're merely
trying to deregulate

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.270
to support free enterprise
and to help their allies,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.630
including industry
to save some money.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.970
As you know, in 1970
the EPA was formed

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.230
to control the extreme
pollution of water and air

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.130
in this country.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.830
These conditions were causing
fish kills, bird [INAUDIBLE],,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.094
and having negative
effects on human health.

00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:44.510
[INAUDIBLE] control policy
suggests that clean [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.330
were established, also
in 1970, to regulate

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.700
the use of these pollutants.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.950
The goal was to protect the
ecosystem and human health

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.610
for future generations.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.090
And so far, it's been
effective from the point

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.330
of view of scientists and
environmental advocates.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.030
It's a success.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.730
Pollution has been
vastly reduced

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.188
to [INAUDIBLE]
[? implementation ?]

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:03.940
these policies and this is
a tremendous achievement,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.780
so why stop now is our argument.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.070
There are still extremely
endangered ecosystems

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.250
in the country and
industries are constantly

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.510
inventing new products that
have new negative effects

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.000
on the environment that
we're not yet aware of.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.240
So the study we conduct
to challenge the heritage

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.490
societies claims
will have four parts.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.780
First, we'll focus on
science benchmarks.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.080
We'll also focus
on topic opinion,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.820
propose an administrative
review of the EPA,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.100
and a review by the
Justice Department.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.410
So for our first pillar,
the scientific measurements

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.440
will hire an outside team
of environmental scientists

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.590
to evaluate air
and water quality

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.970
and how it has
improved since 1970.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.880
Scientists must also
prove that threats

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.260
to the health of
our environment,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.630
to our clean air and
water, still exists

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.520
and that regulation of anything
should be expanded and improved

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.800
and not reduced or terminated.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.760
We need to frame our study and
focus on scientific results

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.380
to counter the
heritage societies

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.480
focus on economic results.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.691
We will design a study based
on science and numbers,

00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.190
because that is how
you will measure

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.750
the efficacy of a program
like the clean air act.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.280
So focus on how you
improve vehicle emissions,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.150
how efficient bird
have bounced back.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.970
And this will help
legitimate our study

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.020
in the eyes of the
scientific community

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.580
and we'll also involve
the scientific community.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.780
We can also come at
this from an angle that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.730
will satisfy the business
community and congress.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.340
We can require companies to
maintain certain air quality

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.660
standards as a means
to spur innovation.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.770
We've been innovative
in this regard so far.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.665
We've invented cleaner
fuels, renewable energy

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.290
and we believe that the American
people can invent even better,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.600
cleaner technologies
and the regulation

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.340
will help inspire that.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.420
Our second component will
focus on the public stance

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.610
on the issue of
environmental protection.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.460
We're in an unprecedented era
in environmental awareness

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.650
and the public is
completely behind it.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.770
I'd like to bring your attention
to a very revealing ruling that

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.040
just came out in the last
few weeks in Massachusetts.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.700
Two men used their lobster
boat to block a coal shipment

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.470
from passing through
the channel on its way

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.570
to Brayton Point Power Plant.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.120
The men were on trial
for several counts

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.600
and faced several years
in jail and the judge

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.190
ruled that he approved
the use of necessity

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.140
as a defense for their actions.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.810
In order to use the
necessity defense,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.666
you have to prove that you were
in clear and imminent danger.

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.040
And in this
instance, the defense

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.050
argues the men in
their communities

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.510
were in clear and imminent
danger of climate change.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.700
So the judge decreed they
had no legal alternative

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.491
to protect themselves
and their communities

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:45.050
other than to try to
block the coal shipment.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.920
So the prosecutors subsequently
dropped the charges.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.030
So obviously this is a
totally unprecedented case.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.970
This is an exciting time for
environmental progressives.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.932
Judges are going
rouge on this issue

00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:58.640
and they're allowing
people a lot of room

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.338
to maneuver, to fight
environmental problems,

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:03.254
so we want to design a
policy [INAUDIBLE] that

00:04:03.254 --> 00:04:06.380
involves the public energy
as much as possible.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.300
So we're going to
educate the public,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.883
we're going to use
some of our funding

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:12.100
to organize conferences and
small community advisory

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.607
committees.

00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:15.190
These committees will call small
meetings in their communities

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.750
and discuss the EPA's
[INAUDIBLE] control policies

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.380
and they can weigh
in on whether or not

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.250
they think those policies
should continue at this time.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.000
This method will give
our study legitimacy

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.940
in the eyes of the
public and in the eyes

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.900
of congress, who depend
on the public for voting.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.830
I highly doubt a heritage
society did a public assessment

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.024
or reached out to the
public in their review,

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:38.440
so basically, we'll
get our study,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.500
that added legitimacy that we
involved the public opinion.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.420
And then, come election
time, the public

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.150
will play a role in the
political evaluation

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.040
of the heritage societies
policy suggestions.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.300
And we'll also ask the public
to consider who the heritage

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.620
society is serving
in trying to overturn

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.300
these important policies.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.270
The courts finally
ruled that the BP oil

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.430
spill was the result of gross
negligence and so we can ask,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.930
are these the types of behaviors
the heritage society thinks

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.691
we no longer need
to regulate against.

00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.190
OK.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.590
Third component, we're going
to play the business community

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.165
into the heritage
society by holding

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:19.020
an administrative
review of the EPA.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.550
They are arguing against the
efficiency of the program.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.130
The EPA has had some
organizational problems in

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.510
the last few decades, so we're
going to go ahead and help them

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.360
out with that and also better--

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.900
organize better [? about ?]
EPA is good for everybody.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.840
And that will satisfy the
business community, also,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.700
to have some of
that what they see

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.590
as wasteful practices reduced.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.173
Our fourth review
method, like I said,

00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:45.094
is to involve the
Justice Department

00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:47.760
and I'll remind you again of the
instance of the judge releasing

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.980
the environmental activists
who blocked the coal barge.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.720
So the Justice
Department, as a whole,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.075
we think should take a stand
on this issue of the right

00:05:55.075 --> 00:05:57.440
to clean air and water,
so we're requesting

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.200
a judicial review of the
constitutionality of removing

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.460
[INAUDIBLE] policies
designed to protect

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.274
the people and the environment.

00:06:04.274 --> 00:06:06.190
So in conclusion, I agree
with you, secretary,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.856
that the study by the
heritage society is bogus

00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:11.230
and we need to organize our
own review of command control

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.550
policies that
highlight their value.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.100
PROFESSOR: Thank you.
