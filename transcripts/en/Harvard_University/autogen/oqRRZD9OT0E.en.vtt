bone marrow actually bone marrow is the
 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.280
bone marrow actually bone marrow is the
closest this is beef

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290
closest this is beef
 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.430
closest this is beef
okay so so guess the food here's another

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440
okay so so guess the food here's another
 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.060
okay so so guess the food here's another
one it's a good game actually

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070
 
 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.020
 
does anybody yes say again vegetable oil

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030
does anybody yes say again vegetable oil
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.219
does anybody yes say again vegetable oil
that's very good it's olive oil okay

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
that's very good it's olive oil okay
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.289
that's very good it's olive oil okay
very good so I mean of course the way

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299
very good so I mean of course the way
 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.060
very good so I mean of course the way
that you play the game of guess the food

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
that you play the game of guess the food
 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.620
that you play the game of guess the food
is that you all know that there are

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630
is that you all know that there are
 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.139
is that you all know that there are
major molecules of food there are faster

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149
major molecules of food there are faster
 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.999
major molecules of food there are faster
there are carbohydrates there are

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009
there are carbohydrates there are
 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.590
there are carbohydrates there are
proteins there's water which is not

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600
proteins there's water which is not
 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.320
proteins there's water which is not
listed on the food label and if you look

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330
listed on the food label and if you look
 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.910
listed on the food label and if you look
at those and you look at the percentages

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920
at those and you look at the percentages
 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.020
at those and you look at the percentages
of the various things you can sort of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030
of the various things you can sort of
 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.969
of the various things you can sort of
guess the food so you guess the a lot of

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979
guess the food so you guess the a lot of
 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.410
guess the food so you guess the a lot of
the vegetable oil instead of olive oil

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
the vegetable oil instead of olive oil
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.580
the vegetable oil instead of olive oil
because was all fats or what do you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590
because was all fats or what do you
 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.109
because was all fats or what do you
think it is but you know the question

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119
think it is but you know the question
 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.940
think it is but you know the question
that I want to raise is what else is

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950
that I want to raise is what else is
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.180
that I want to raise is what else is
important for food that is what else is

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190
important for food that is what else is
 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.859
important for food that is what else is
important in a recipe other than this I

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869
important in a recipe other than this I
 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.020
important in a recipe other than this I
mean look if you have a if you have a

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030
mean look if you have a if you have a
 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.169
mean look if you have a if you have a
jar of water right the the number of

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
jar of water right the the number of
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.840
jar of water right the the number of
molecules per liter in that jar of water

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850
molecules per liter in that jar of water
 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.509
molecules per liter in that jar of water
is enormous there's no sort of you know

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519
is enormous there's no sort of you know
 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.820
is enormous there's no sort of you know
more than 10 to the 23 there's about 10

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830
more than 10 to the 23 there's about 10
 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.539
more than 10 to the 23 there's about 10
to the 25 molecules of water that's in a

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549
to the 25 molecules of water that's in a
 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.650
to the 25 molecules of water that's in a
liter of water it's a huge number but it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
liter of water it's a huge number but it
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.330
liter of water it's a huge number but it
turns out that and this is the main

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340
turns out that and this is the main
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.589
turns out that and this is the main
thing out the idea I want to leave you

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599
thing out the idea I want to leave you
 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.210
thing out the idea I want to leave you
with before I turn this over to Daniel

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220
with before I turn this over to Daniel
 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.090
with before I turn this over to Daniel
is that is that often times there are

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
is that is that often times there are
 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.520
is that is that often times there are
ingredients in a recipe which are at

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
ingredients in a recipe which are at
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.220
ingredients in a recipe which are at
very very low concentrations but yet are

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230
very very low concentrations but yet are
 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.160
very very low concentrations but yet are
extremely important for taste and just

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
extremely important for taste and just
 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.860
extremely important for taste and just
to demonstrate this here is a typical

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
to demonstrate this here is a typical
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.990
to demonstrate this here is a typical
recipe for a lemonade and the question

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000
recipe for a lemonade and the question
 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.080
recipe for a lemonade and the question
is is what makes it taste like lemonade

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090
is is what makes it taste like lemonade
 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.960
is is what makes it taste like lemonade
yes the acid very good that was in the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970
yes the acid very good that was in the
 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.430
yes the acid very good that was in the
title of the lectures and where is the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440
title of the lectures and where is the
 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.790
title of the lectures and where is the
acid

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
acid
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.760
acid
the acid is in the lemons okay very good

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
the acid is in the lemons okay very good
 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.950
the acid is in the lemons okay very good
so in fact the acid that's in the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960
so in fact the acid that's in the
 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.930
so in fact the acid that's in the
webbings is called citric acid here is a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
webbings is called citric acid here is a
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.240
webbings is called citric acid here is a
picture of it and the citric acid is

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
picture of it and the citric acid is
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.730
picture of it and the citric acid is
this complicated formula its chemical

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740
this complicated formula its chemical
 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.460
this complicated formula its chemical
formula and the main point of it is that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
formula and the main point of it is that
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.010
formula and the main point of it is that
an acid is something that more easily

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020
an acid is something that more easily
 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.560
an acid is something that more easily
loses protons to water so an acid

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570
loses protons to water so an acid
 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.980
loses protons to water so an acid
releases protons which are H pluses

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990
releases protons which are H pluses
 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.490
releases protons which are H pluses
which go into water so so even in water

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500
which go into water so so even in water
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.660
which go into water so so even in water
there are protons that are in water in

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670
there are protons that are in water in
 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.370
there are protons that are in water in
the form of hydronium ions and the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380
the form of hydronium ions and the
 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.400
the form of hydronium ions and the
concentration of them is one part in 10

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410
concentration of them is one part in 10
 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.170
concentration of them is one part in 10
to the 7 of the of the moles per liter

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180
to the 7 of the of the moles per liter
 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.050
to the 7 of the of the moles per liter
which is more than 110 million it's

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
which is more than 110 million it's
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.130
which is more than 110 million it's
actually more than that it's like one

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140
actually more than that it's like one
 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.020
actually more than that it's like one
over five hundred and fifty millionth of

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030
over five hundred and fifty millionth of
 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.720
over five hundred and fifty millionth of
the atoms that are of the molecules

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730
the atoms that are of the molecules
 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.450
the atoms that are of the molecules
there in water are these protons but yet

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460
there in water are these protons but yet
 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.460
there in water are these protons but yet
they're critically important for taste

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470
they're critically important for taste
 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.560
they're critically important for taste
this is what I want to tell you that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570
this is what I want to tell you that
 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.000
this is what I want to tell you that
even though there are so few of them

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010
even though there are so few of them
 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.920
even though there are so few of them
they're critically important for taste

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
they're critically important for taste
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.580
they're critically important for taste
and when you see chef Daniel do magical

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590
and when you see chef Daniel do magical
 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.400
and when you see chef Daniel do magical
things with acids then in fact he's

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410
things with acids then in fact he's
 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.120
things with acids then in fact he's
adding so few protons that if all of you

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130
adding so few protons that if all of you
 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.150
adding so few protons that if all of you
in this room were water molecules there

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160
in this room were water molecules there
 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
in this room were water molecules there
wouldn't be one of you who is a proton

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
wouldn't be one of you who is a proton
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.530
wouldn't be one of you who is a proton
in the dish that he makes they're just

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
in the dish that he makes they're just
 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.150
in the dish that he makes they're just
so few but yet they're critically

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.110
that avocado so it doesn't turn brown
the same thing can happen with mushrooms

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120
the same thing can happen with mushrooms
 

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:48.750
the same thing can happen with mushrooms
or when you peel artichokes here we have

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760
or when you peel artichokes here we have
 

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.920
or when you peel artichokes here we have
egg yolks I love eggs X is probably one

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:53.930
egg yolks I love eggs X is probably one
 

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.980
egg yolks I love eggs X is probably one
of the most versatile ingredients that

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:56.990
of the most versatile ingredients that
 

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.930
of the most versatile ingredients that
we work with and all the way on the left

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:01.940
we work with and all the way on the left
 

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.650
we work with and all the way on the left
side the top part is a raw egg yolk on

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:05.660
side the top part is a raw egg yolk on
 

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.010
side the top part is a raw egg yolk on
the bottom we open it up so we show you

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:09.020
the bottom we open it up so we show you
 

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.149
the bottom we open it up so we show you
the consistency egg yolks are extremely

00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159
the consistency egg yolks are extremely
 

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:16.810
the consistency egg yolks are extremely
creamy but we try to find a way how can

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:16.820
creamy but we try to find a way how can
 

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:21.340
creamy but we try to find a way how can
we make it even creamier in the middle

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:21.350
we make it even creamier in the middle
 

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.310
we make it even creamier in the middle
we took the egg yolk on the top and we

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320
we took the egg yolk on the top and we
 

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.980
we took the egg yolk on the top and we
marinated it in white balsamic vinegar

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:26.990
marinated it in white balsamic vinegar
 

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:31.570
marinated it in white balsamic vinegar
for two days on the bottom in the middle

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:31.580
for two days on the bottom in the middle
 

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.080
for two days on the bottom in the middle
we open it up to show you the change in

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.090
we open it up to show you the change in
 

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.520
we open it up to show you the change in
consistency that egg yolk got thicker

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:38.530
consistency that egg yolk got thicker
 

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.159
consistency that egg yolk got thicker
creamier and then we took it even

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:42.169
creamier and then we took it even
 

00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:44.649
creamier and then we took it even
further all the way on the right is an

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:44.659
further all the way on the right is an
 

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:46.690
further all the way on the right is an
egg yolk that's been sitting in white

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:46.700
egg yolk that's been sitting in white
 

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.379
egg yolk that's been sitting in white
balsamic vinegar for seven days and you

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:50.389
balsamic vinegar for seven days and you
 

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:52.629
balsamic vinegar for seven days and you
can see on the bottom picture all the

00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639
can see on the bottom picture all the
 

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.210
can see on the bottom picture all the
way on the right that now the egg yolk

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:55.220
way on the right that now the egg yolk
 

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.890
way on the right that now the egg yolk
is barely liquid anymore it's gotten a

00:34:59.890 --> 00:34:59.900
is barely liquid anymore it's gotten a
 

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:07.840
is barely liquid anymore it's gotten a
lot firmer and that's pretty cool here

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:07.850
lot firmer and that's pretty cool here
 

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.500
lot firmer and that's pretty cool here
this is an experiment that we did just

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:11.510
this is an experiment that we did just
 

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:18.400
this is an experiment that we did just
for today this is red cabbage and red

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.410
for today this is red cabbage and red
 

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.390
for today this is red cabbage and red
cabbage is functioning like a natural pH

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400
cabbage is functioning like a natural pH
 

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.370
cabbage is functioning like a natural pH
meter we added acids and we added

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:27.380
meter we added acids and we added
 

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.050
meter we added acids and we added
alkaline and just based on those colors

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.060
alkaline and just based on those colors
 

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:36.070
alkaline and just based on those colors
you can see the change in pH

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:36.080
you can see the change in pH
 

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.140
you can see the change in pH
all the way on the left we added white

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:41.150
all the way on the left we added white
 

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:44.800
all the way on the left we added white
wine vinegar the most acidic things we

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:44.810
wine vinegar the most acidic things we
 

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:48.730
wine vinegar the most acidic things we
added of all of them then we added white

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:48.740
added of all of them then we added white
 

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.240
added of all of them then we added white
wine the third one we actually just

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.250
wine the third one we actually just
 

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.720
wine the third one we actually just
added cabbage juice as being the neutral

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:55.730
added cabbage juice as being the neutral
 

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:00.510
added cabbage juice as being the neutral
one and then we're adding all Co lines

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520
one and then we're adding all Co lines
 

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.860
one and then we're adding all Co lines
which the blue one is baking soda then

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:05.870
which the blue one is baking soda then
 

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:13.220
which the blue one is baking soda then
we added lye and then we added bleach

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:13.230
 
 

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:17.760
 
obviously don't want to eat this but

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:17.770
obviously don't want to eat this but
 

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:18.930
obviously don't want to eat this but
this is really cool

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:18.940
this is really cool
 

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.740
this is really cool
just by the change of pH the color

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:22.750
just by the change of pH the color
 

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.100
just by the change of pH the color
changes and these are bright colors

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.110
changes and these are bright colors
 

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.560
changes and these are bright colors
dramatically this happens with other

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:28.570
dramatically this happens with other
 

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.130
dramatically this happens with other
things too for example a blueberry

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:32.140
things too for example a blueberry
 

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.700
things too for example a blueberry
muffin you've at all had blueberry

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:35.710
muffin you've at all had blueberry
 

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:39.300
muffin you've at all had blueberry
muffins when you look at a blueberry

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.310
muffins when you look at a blueberry
 

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:40.490
muffins when you look at a blueberry
muffin

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500
muffin
 

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.490
muffin
sometimes you see around the blueberry a

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:44.500
sometimes you see around the blueberry a
 

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.240
sometimes you see around the blueberry a
small circle of green the blueberry is

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:48.250
small circle of green the blueberry is
 

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.150
small circle of green the blueberry is
starting to turn green this happens

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160
starting to turn green this happens
 

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.780
starting to turn green this happens
because the baking soda is interacting

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:54.790
because the baking soda is interacting
 

00:36:54.790 --> 00:37:00.150
because the baking soda is interacting
with the acid in the blueberries when

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160
with the acid in the blueberries when
 

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.060
with the acid in the blueberries when
you see that it's usually not a good

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.070
you see that it's usually not a good
 

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.000
you see that it's usually not a good
sign it's usually it's not the best

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.010
sign it's usually it's not the best
 

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.100
sign it's usually it's not the best
blueberry muffin you ever had because it

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.110
blueberry muffin you ever had because it
 

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.470
blueberry muffin you ever had because it
means there's too much baking soda in it

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480
means there's too much baking soda in it
 

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.080
means there's too much baking soda in it
but that's what happens and the same

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.090
but that's what happens and the same
 

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.660
but that's what happens and the same
thing happens right now you walk outside

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:15.670
thing happens right now you walk outside
 

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.000
thing happens right now you walk outside
on the streets and you see all the

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.010
on the streets and you see all the
 

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.000
on the streets and you see all the
leaves changing on the trees there's

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.010
leaves changing on the trees there's
 

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.270
leaves changing on the trees there's
other things that go on there but one of

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.280
other things that go on there but one of
 

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.760
other things that go on there but one of
the biggest reasons that these leaves

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:26.770
the biggest reasons that these leaves
 

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.220
the biggest reasons that these leaves
are changing color is because the pH

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.230
are changing color is because the pH
 

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:37.400
are changing color is because the pH
level in these leaves is changing

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:37.410
 
 

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:43.080
 
preservation acid is involved in two

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:43.090
preservation acid is involved in two
 

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.900
preservation acid is involved in two
types of preservations on one side we

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:45.910
types of preservations on one side we
 

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.080
types of preservations on one side we
have pickling and on the other side we

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.090
have pickling and on the other side we
 

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.660
have pickling and on the other side we
have fermentation if you take this

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:54.670
have fermentation if you take this
 

00:37:54.670 --> 00:38:00.920
have fermentation if you take this
cucumber here if you just let it sit

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:00.930
cucumber here if you just let it sit
 

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:06.330
cucumber here if you just let it sit
that bacteria will grow and I know the

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:06.340
that bacteria will grow and I know the
 

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.950
that bacteria will grow and I know the
picture of these bacteria is kind of

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960
picture of these bacteria is kind of
 

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.240
picture of these bacteria is kind of
ridiculous but

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.250
ridiculous but
 

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:16.160
ridiculous but
somehow I wanted to make this point if

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.170
somehow I wanted to make this point if
 

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.520
somehow I wanted to make this point if
you let this cucumber sit these

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:19.530
you let this cucumber sit these
 

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.680
you let this cucumber sit these
bacterias will grow it will destroy the

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:21.690
bacterias will grow it will destroy the
 

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:29.390
bacterias will grow it will destroy the
cucumber or it will destroy you in the

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400
cucumber or it will destroy you in the
 

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:37.220
cucumber or it will destroy you in the
presence of acid bad bacteria dies come

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:37.230
presence of acid bad bacteria dies come
 

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:46.040
presence of acid bad bacteria dies come
on in pickling we simply add acid in

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.050
on in pickling we simply add acid in
 

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:52.070
on in pickling we simply add acid in
form of vinegar in fermentation acid is

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:52.080
form of vinegar in fermentation acid is
 

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.850
form of vinegar in fermentation acid is
naturally produced which will keep the

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:55.860
naturally produced which will keep the
 

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:01.070
naturally produced which will keep the
bad bacteria from growth we use this all

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:01.080
bad bacteria from growth we use this all
 

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.670
bad bacteria from growth we use this all
the time here on this picture we have

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680
the time here on this picture we have
 

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.700
the time here on this picture we have
pickled purple eggplants the one on the

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:07.710
pickled purple eggplants the one on the
 

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.940
pickled purple eggplants the one on the
right is just a raw slice the one on the

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:10.950
right is just a raw slice the one on the
 

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:14.120
right is just a raw slice the one on the
left is been pickled what's really cool

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:14.130
left is been pickled what's really cool
 

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:17.150
left is been pickled what's really cool
here too is because of the eggplants

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160
here too is because of the eggplants
 

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.480
here too is because of the eggplants
purple skin it penetrates that color

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:20.490
purple skin it penetrates that color
 

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:24.850
purple skin it penetrates that color
throughout and it looks really beautiful

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:24.860
throughout and it looks really beautiful
 

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.880
throughout and it looks really beautiful
here we have pickled plums sometimes we

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:28.890
here we have pickled plums sometimes we
 

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.740
here we have pickled plums sometimes we
use the sous-vide method for pickling

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:32.750
use the sous-vide method for pickling
 

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:36.200
use the sous-vide method for pickling
pickling under pressure speeds out the

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:36.210
pickling under pressure speeds out the
 

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.830
pickling under pressure speeds out the
process of pickling here we have

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:39.840
process of pickling here we have
 

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.000
process of pickling here we have

fermented mustard greens we simply let
these mustard greens ferment by adding

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:46.860
these mustard greens ferment by adding
 

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:52.640
these mustard greens ferment by adding
salt water onions and ginger and again

through the fermentation process acid is

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:56.610
through the fermentation process acid is
 

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.300
through the fermentation process acid is
produced and it will keep bad bacteria

00:39:59.300 --> 00:39:59.310
produced and it will keep bad bacteria

and they're a little hard to see and I

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240
and they're a little hard to see and I
 

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.640
and they're a little hard to see and I
think we could have picked maybe a

think we could have picked maybe a
 

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.130

they're out of season but in addition
 

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:02.520
they're out of season but in addition
also preservation is bringing acid to

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:02.530
also preservation is bringing acid to
 

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.430

entire class on fermentation let's get
 

00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:39.359
entire class on fermentation let's get
back to our original question where is

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:39.369
back to our original question where is
 

00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:43.970
back to our original question where is
the acid we use many different assets

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980
the acid we use many different assets
 

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.170

making our own vinegar we have a vinegar
 

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.880
making our own vinegar we have a vinegar
machine and then we age the vinegar in

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:26.890
machine and then we age the vinegar in
 

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:30.090
machine and then we age the vinegar in
barrels making our own vinegar allows us

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:30.100
barrels making our own vinegar allows us
 

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:35.340
barrels making our own vinegar allows us
to be very specific to our dishes

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:35.350
to be very specific to our dishes
 

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.720
to be very specific to our dishes
in our walk-in we have all the fresh

they give us acid we're using a pH meter

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:00.740
they give us acid we're using a pH meter
 

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.350
they give us acid we're using a pH meter
at the restaurant and we're using it as

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:04.360
at the restaurant and we're using it as
 

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.350
at the restaurant and we're using it as
a measure to give us more consistency

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:08.360
a measure to give us more consistency
 

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.610
a measure to give us more consistency
more accuracy we're using it in a way we

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:12.620
more accuracy we're using it in a way we
 

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.370
more accuracy we're using it in a way we
use a scale or in a way we measure

temperature I want to talk a little bit

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:20.450
temperature I want to talk a little bit
 

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:25.480
temperature I want to talk a little bit
about some of the pH levels that we

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:25.490
about some of the pH levels that we
 

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.410
about some of the pH levels that we
we've learned about and I want to start

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:28.420
we've learned about and I want to start
 

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:34.690
we've learned about and I want to start
with water and remember I'm sure you

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:34.700
with water and remember I'm sure you
 

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.250
with water and remember I'm sure you
probably all know this but I want to

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:36.260
probably all know this but I want to
 

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.190
probably all know this but I want to
remember you remind you that the lower

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200
remember you remind you that the lower
 

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.670
remember you remind you that the lower
the number in pH the higher the acidity

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680
the number in pH the higher the acidity
 

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.840
the number in pH the higher the acidity
so we took our still water and this is

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:46.850
so we took our still water and this is
 

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.650
so we took our still water and this is
the water we serve with our meal we took

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:50.660
the water we serve with our meal we took
 

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.200
the water we serve with our meal we took
still water and we measured it at seven

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:53.210
still water and we measured it at seven
 

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.280
still water and we measured it at seven
point five seven is neutral so it's very

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:57.290
point five seven is neutral so it's very
 

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.370
point five seven is neutral so it's very
close to neutral then we measured our

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:00.380
close to neutral then we measured our
 

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.980
close to neutral then we measured our
sparkling water and our sparkling water

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:02.990
sparkling water and our sparkling water
 

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:07.060
sparkling water and our sparkling water
is highly acidic and then we even asked

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.070
is highly acidic and then we even asked
 

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.060
is highly acidic and then we even asked
ourselves is it just the bubbles or when

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.070
ourselves is it just the bubbles or when
 

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.540
ourselves is it just the bubbles or when
it goes flat will the acidity remain and

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:12.550
it goes flat will the acidity remain and
 

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.110
it goes flat will the acidity remain and
it does what's cool about here is that

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:17.120
it does what's cool about here is that
 

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.300
it does what's cool about here is that
we actually learned that co2 is a source

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:22.310
we actually learned that co2 is a source
 

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:27.700
we actually learned that co2 is a source
of acid so we can add co2 to anything

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:27.710
of acid so we can add co2 to anything
 

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:33.000
of acid so we can add co2 to anything
and the acidity in that will increase

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.010
and the acidity in that will increase
 

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.070
and the acidity in that will increase
but then there's something else when you

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:36.080
but then there's something else when you
 

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.350
but then there's something else when you
go have dinner

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:37.360
go have dinner
 

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.810
go have dinner
the most simple question in the

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:40.820
the most simple question in the
 

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.080
the most simple question in the
beginning of your meal do you want still

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.090
beginning of your meal do you want still
 

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.310
beginning of your meal do you want still
or sparkling water

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:46.320
or sparkling water
 

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.750
or sparkling water
this question is not that simple anymore

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760
this question is not that simple anymore
 

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.610
this question is not that simple anymore
because it changes the experience of

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:52.620
because it changes the experience of
 

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:59.210
because it changes the experience of
your meal dramatically we also looked at

00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220
your meal dramatically we also looked at
 

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.610
your meal dramatically we also looked at
the manufactured foods that we talked

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:01.620
the manufactured foods that we talked
 

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:06.800
the manufactured foods that we talked
earlier and we measured those they're

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:06.810
earlier and we measured those they're
 

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:12.440
earlier and we measured those they're
highly acidic all of them but the most

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:12.450
highly acidic all of them but the most
 

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:17.630
highly acidic all of them but the most
surprising here was Coca Cola everyone

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640
surprising here was Coca Cola everyone
 

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.310
surprising here was Coca Cola everyone
in the world drinks Coca Cola

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:19.320
in the world drinks Coca Cola
 

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.940
in the world drinks Coca Cola
everyone loves coca-cola coca-cola is

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:22.950
everyone loves coca-cola coca-cola is
 

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.290
everyone loves coca-cola coca-cola is
more acidic than red wine vinegar just

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300
more acidic than red wine vinegar just
 

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.510
more acidic than red wine vinegar just
imagine that isn't that crazy you eat

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.460
imagine that isn't that crazy you eat
that with your meal it's more acidic

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:31.470
that with your meal it's more acidic
 

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.130
that with your meal it's more acidic
than red wine vinegar

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:33.140
than red wine vinegar
 

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.100
than red wine vinegar
that's unbelievable and when you drink

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:37.110
that's unbelievable and when you drink
 

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.760
that's unbelievable and when you drink
coca-cola you never think of it as being

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:40.770
coca-cola you never think of it as being
 

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:44.540
coca-cola you never think of it as being
acidic and that is why and that's

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:44.550
acidic and that is why and that's
 

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.840
acidic and that is why and that's
because there's so much sugar to balance

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:47.850
because there's so much sugar to balance
 

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:51.910
because there's so much sugar to balance
all that acid and makes it a beverage

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920
all that acid and makes it a beverage
 

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:57.110
all that acid and makes it a beverage
that everyone loves I talked about this

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:57.120
that everyone loves I talked about this
 

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.650
that everyone loves I talked about this
dish earlier our duck dish and I told

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660
dish earlier our duck dish and I told
 

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.400
dish earlier our duck dish and I told
you the sensation of sweet and sour and

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:04.410
you the sensation of sweet and sour and
 

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.870
you the sensation of sweet and sour and
how crucial the sauce is the perfect

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880
how crucial the sauce is the perfect
 

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:16.550
how crucial the sauce is the perfect
level in this sauce of pH is 4.6 so I

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560
level in this sauce of pH is 4.6 so I
 

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.050
level in this sauce of pH is 4.6 so I
wanted to see if we take our cooks or

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060
wanted to see if we take our cooks or
 

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.410
wanted to see if we take our cooks or
line cooks and we have them make the

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420
line cooks and we have them make the
 

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.380
line cooks and we have them make the
sauce over a period of three weeks make

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:27.390
sauce over a period of three weeks make
 

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.070
sauce over a period of three weeks make
it blindly without a pH meter just by

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:31.080
it blindly without a pH meter just by
 

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.750
it blindly without a pH meter just by
taste and this is what they came in in

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760
taste and this is what they came in in
 

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.900
taste and this is what they came in in
those ranges they came in between 4.3

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:38.910
those ranges they came in between 4.3
 

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:43.940
those ranges they came in between 4.3
and 4.9 it's pretty close don't you

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:43.950
and 4.9 it's pretty close don't you
 

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:49.580
and 4.9 it's pretty close don't you
think it's really close and it's just by

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:49.590
think it's really close and it's just by
 

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:53.360
think it's really close and it's just by
taste so then I wanted to see okay let's

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:53.370
taste so then I wanted to see okay let's
 

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.670
taste so then I wanted to see okay let's
take our more experienced cooks our sous

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680
take our more experienced cooks our sous
 

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.740
take our more experienced cooks our sous
chefs and let's have them do the same

00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:57.750
chefs and let's have them do the same
 

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.470
chefs and let's have them do the same
thing and see if they could get it

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480
thing and see if they could get it
 

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:11.480
thing and see if they could get it
closer and thankfully they did but hey

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:11.490
closer and thankfully they did but hey
 

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:24.630
closer and thankfully they did but hey
just to be clear when I make this sauce

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640
 
 

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.579
 
but so that's great we have pH levels

00:47:30.579 --> 00:47:30.589
but so that's great we have pH levels
 

00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:33.069
but so that's great we have pH levels
and it helps us to make it more accurate

00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079
and it helps us to make it more accurate
 

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:37.690
and it helps us to make it more accurate
and it's a great tool but even if that

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:37.700
and it's a great tool but even if that
 

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.569
and it's a great tool but even if that
sauce has the perfect pH level it

00:47:40.569 --> 00:47:40.579
sauce has the perfect pH level it
 

00:47:40.579 --> 00:47:42.819
sauce has the perfect pH level it
doesn't mean the sauce is delicious

00:47:42.819 --> 00:47:42.829
doesn't mean the sauce is delicious
 

00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:47.530
doesn't mean the sauce is delicious
it can taste totally off and I think

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:47.540
it can taste totally off and I think
 

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.950
it can taste totally off and I think
that is where the magic of cooking comes

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960
that is where the magic of cooking comes
 

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.650
that is where the magic of cooking comes

in we can have all these scientific
 

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.599
in we can have all these scientific
tools but it will never replace the

and we measured those and for our
 

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.860

need a wine that is just as acidic maybe
 

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.800
need a wine that is just as acidic maybe
even more acidic and what that does is

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:24.810
even more acidic and what that does is
 

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:29.400

a surprise to us because these wine

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:47.140
a surprise to us because these wine
 

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.100
a surprise to us because these wine
they're highly acidic when we drink

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:50.110
they're highly acidic when we drink

these wines we think of them as
extremely sweet very high in alcohol and

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420
extremely sweet very high in alcohol and
 

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:02.550
extremely sweet very high in alcohol and
very low in acidity so we were surprised

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:02.560
very low in acidity so we were surprised
 

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.600
very low in acidity so we were surprised
to see these numbers so again the pH

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:06.610
to see these numbers so again the pH
 

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:14.700
to see these numbers so again the pH
level is not you can't taste the pH in

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:14.710
level is not you can't taste the pH in
