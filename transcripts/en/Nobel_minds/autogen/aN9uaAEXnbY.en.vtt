tricky concept it seems to be true in

the sense that it matches the data that

the sense that it matches the data that

we have but is pretty hard to test

nevertheless there is a prediction which

nevertheless there is a prediction which
 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.870
nevertheless there is a prediction which
can be tested by studying the small

anisotropy probe the w map mission and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600
anisotropy probe the w map mission and

they say yes it matches the theoretical

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579
they say yes it matches the theoretical
 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.660
they say yes it matches the theoretical
prediction and the number that would be

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670
prediction and the number that would be
 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.709
prediction and the number that would be
maybe exactly one in an in basic theory

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719
maybe exactly one in an in basic theory

is actually 0 point nine seven and that

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939
is actually 0 point nine seven and that
 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.819
is actually 0 point nine seven and that
this number is what's predicted by some

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829
this number is what's predicted by some
 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.830

versions of inflation now point nine

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840
versions of inflation now point nine
 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.660
versions of inflation now point nine
seven is pretty close to one and so the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670
seven is pretty close to one and so the
 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.459
seven is pretty close to one and so the
difference isn't very large so it's

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469
difference isn't very large so it's
 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:46.929
difference isn't very large so it's
pretty important to go test it and

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939
pretty important to go test it and
 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.090
pretty important to go test it and
measure it again so the plonk mission

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100
measure it again so the plonk mission
 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.219
measure it again so the plonk mission
which does a similar job to what W map

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229
which does a similar job to what W map
 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.770
which does a similar job to what W map
does but hopefully even better will give

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
does but hopefully even better will give
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.590
does but hopefully even better will give
us a better test and will either confirm

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600
us a better test and will either confirm
 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.380
us a better test and will either confirm
or dispute the claim from the w map

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390
or dispute the claim from the w map
 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.260
or dispute the claim from the w map
results that the inflation really does

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270
results that the inflation really does

explain what the pattern of spots is on

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880
explain what the pattern of spots is on
 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.730
explain what the pattern of spots is on
the sky so we hope for the best thank

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740
the sky so we hope for the best thank
 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.859
the sky so we hope for the best thank
you
