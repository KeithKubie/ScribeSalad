00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.460
What I want to do in
this video is give you

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.420
at least a basic
overview of probability.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.410
Probability, a word that
you've probably heard a lot of,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.640
and you are probably a
little bit familiar with it.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.520
But hopefully,
this will give you

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.769
a little deeper understanding.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.719
Let's say that I have
a fair coin over here.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.260
And so when I talk
about a fair coin,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.290
I mean that it has
an equal chance

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.190
of landing on one
side or another.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.820
So you can maybe view it
as the sides are equal,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.370
their weight is the
same on either side.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.270
If I flip it in
the air, it's not

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.390
more likely to land on
one side or the other.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.110
It's equally likely.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.970
And so you have one
side of this coin.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.170
So this would be
the heads I guess.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.420
Try to draw George Washington.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.700
I'll assume it's a
quarter of some kind.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.210
And the other side, of
course, is the tails.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.810
So that is heads.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.490
The other side right
over there is tails.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.280
And so if I were
to ask you, what

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.710
is the probability-- I'm
going to flip a coin.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.350
And I want to know what is the
probability of getting heads.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.780
And I could write
that like this--

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.270
the probability
of getting heads.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.250
And you probably, just
based on that question,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.450
have a sense of what
probability is asking.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.300
It's asking for some
type of way of getting

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.320
your hands around an event
that's fundamentally random.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.640
We don't know whether
it's heads or tails,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.890
but we can start to
describe the chances of it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.060
being heads or tails.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.117
And we'll talk about different
ways of describing that.

00:01:30.117 --> 00:01:31.700
So one way to think
about it, and this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.240
is the way that
probability tends

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.130
to be introduced in textbooks,
is you say, well, look,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.110
how many different, equally
likely possibilities are there?

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800
So how many equally
likely possibilities.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.040
So number of equally--
let me write equally--

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.006
of equally likely possibilities.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.530
And of the number of
equally possibilities,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.630
I care about the number that
contain my event right here.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.200
So the number of possibilities
that meet my constraint,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.680
that meet my conditions.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.920
So in the case of the
probability of figuring out

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.970
heads, what is the number of
equally likely possibilities?

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.100
Well, there's only
two possibilities.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.420
We're assuming that the coin
can't land on its corner

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.545
and just stand straight up.

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:33.700
We're assuming
that it lands flat.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.490
So there's two
possibilities here,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.670
two equally likely
possibilities.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.457
You could either get heads,
or you could get tails.

00:02:40.457 --> 00:02:42.040
And what's the number
of possibilities

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.540
that meet my conditions?

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.600
Well, there's only one,
the condition of heads.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.280
So it'll be 1/2.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.730
So one way to think about it
is the probability of getting

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.730
heads is equal to 1/2.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.160
If I wanted to write
that as a percentage,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.590
we know that 1/2 is
the same thing as 50%.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.660
Now, another way to think about
or conceptualize probability

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.070
that will give you
this exact same answer

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.160
is to say, well, if I were to
run the experiment of flipping

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.369
a coin-- so this flip, you
view this as an experiment.

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.910
I know this isn't the kind of
experiment that you're used to.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.940
You know, you normally think an
experiment is doing something

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.200
in chemistry or physics
or all the rest.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.790
But an experiment
is every time you

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.390
do, you run this random event.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.950
So one way to think
about probability

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.910
is if I were to do this
experiment, an experiment

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.960
many, many, many times-- if
I were to do it 1,000 times

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.880
or a million times or a billion
times or a trillion times--

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.280
and the more the better--
what percentage of

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.600
those would give me
what I care about?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.260
What percentage of those
would give me heads?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.520
And so another way to think
about this 50% probability

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.020
of getting heads is if I
were to run this experiment

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.370
tons of times, if I were
to run this forever,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.850
an infinite number of times,
what percentage of those

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.810
would be heads?

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.075
You would get this 50%.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:04.750
And you can run that simulation.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.860
You can flip a coin.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.360
And it's actually
a fun thing to do.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.520
I encourage you to do it.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.230
If you take 100 or 200
quarters or pennies,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.640
stick them in a big
box, shake the box

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.170
so you're kind of simultaneously
flipping all of the coins,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.579
and then count how many of
those are going to be heads.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.302
And you're going to see that the
larger the number that you are

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:25.760
doing, the more
likely you're going

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.690
to get something
really close to 50%.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.210
And there's always some
chance-- even if you flipped

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.960
a coin a million times, there's
some super-duper small chance

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.210
that you would get all tails.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.740
But the more you
do, the more likely

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.860
that things are going to
trend towards 50% of them

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.510
are going to be heads.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.850
Now, let's just apply
these same ideas.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.790
And while we're starting with
probability, at least kind

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.130
of the basic, this is
probably an easier thing

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.030
to conceptualize.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.363
But a lot of times, this is
actually a helpful one, too,

00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:56.800
this idea that if you run the
experiment many, many, many,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.656
many times, what
percentage of those trials

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:01.530
are going to give you
what you're asking for.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.200
In this case, it was heads.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.546
Now, let's do another
very typical example

00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:06.920
when you first
learn probability.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.210
And this is the idea
of rolling a die.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.240
So here's my die
right over here.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.650
And of course, you have, you
know, the different sides

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.170
of the die.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.570
So that's the 1.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.560
That's the 2.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.682
And that's the 3.

00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:23.640
And what I want to do--
and we know, of course,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.010
that there are-- and I'm
assuming this is a fair die.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.070
And so there are six equally
likely possibilities.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.600
When you roll this, you could
get a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.120
or a 6.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.550
And they're all equally likely.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.340
So if I were to ask you,
what is the probability

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.390
given that I'm rolling a fair
die-- so the experiment is

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.860
rolling this fair die, what is
the probability of getting a 1?

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.430
Well, what are the number of
equally likely possibilities?

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.440
Well, I have six equally
likely possibilities.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.900
And how many of those
meet my conditions?

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.150
Well, only one of them meets
my condition, that right there.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.650
So there is a 1/6
probability of rolling a 1.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:16.890
What is the probability
of rolling a 1 or a 6?

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.190
Well, once again, there are six
equally likely possibilities

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.187
for what I can get.

00:06:24.187 --> 00:06:26.520
There are now two possibilities
that meet my conditions.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.620
I could roll a 1 or
I could roll a 6.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.220
So now there are
two possibilities

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.150
that meet my constraints,
my conditions.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.630
There is a 1/3 probability
of rolling a 1 or a 6.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.534
Now, what is the
probability-- and this

00:06:45.534 --> 00:06:47.700
might seem a little silly
to even ask this question,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.590
but I'll ask it just
to make it clear.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.430
What is the probability
of rolling a 2 and a 3?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.930
And I'm just talking
about one roll of the die.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.920
Well, in any roll of the die,
I can only get a 2 or a 3.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.890
I'm not talking about taking
two rolls of this die.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.040
So in this situation,
there's six possibilities,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.570
but none of these
possibilities are 2 and a 3.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.440
None of these are 2 and a 3.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.250
2 and a 3 cannot exist.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:23.390
On one trial, you cannot get a 2
and a 3 in the same experiment.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.470
Getting a 2 and a 3 are
mutually exclusive events.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.130
They cannot happen
at the same time.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.432
So the probability of
this is actually 0.

00:07:31.432 --> 00:07:33.890
There's no way to roll this
normal die and all of a sudden,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.098
you get a 2 and a 3, in fact.

00:07:35.098 --> 00:07:38.060
And I don't want to confuse
you with that, because it's

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.820
kind of abstract and impossible.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.130
So let's cross this
out right over here.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:50.160
Now, what is the probability
of getting an even number?

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.450
So once again, you have six
equally likely possibilities

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.980
when I roll that die.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.980
And which of these possibilities
meet my conditions,

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.450
the condition of being even?

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:06.110
Well, 2 is even, 4 is
even, and 6 is even.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.780
So 3 of the possibilities
meet my conditions,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.350
meet my constraints.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.600
So this is 1/2.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.310
If I roll a die, I
have a 1/2 chance

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.130
of getting an even number.
