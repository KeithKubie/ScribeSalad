00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.470
IDO GREEN: Hi.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.119
Welcome to our new
series of videos

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.240
that will bring you news and
best practices about Actions

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.340
on Google.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.590
I'm Ido Green, a developer
advocate for Actions on Google.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.420
I love to help
entrepreneurs and developers

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.890
to be more productive.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.750
In this video, I'm
going to show you

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.540
how to build an app for
the Google Assistant.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.740
Cool?

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.680
Apps for Google Assistants
are a gateway for your users

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520
to engage with your services
through Google Home, Android

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.770
phones, iPhones,
and in the future,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.440
through every experience
where the Google Assistant is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.600
available.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.390
It's a new, efficient way
to interact with your users.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.580
Google has been invested
heavily in the areas

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.730
of machine learning and speech
recognition and language

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.260
understanding.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.840
Google Assistant
brings it all together.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.690
It allows users to have a
conversation with Google

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.490
and be more productive.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.370
With Actions on Google, you
could use our investments

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.650
in this space, and
your users will

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.030
enjoy these new capabilities.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080
Now, let's build our first
app in less than 15 minutes.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.660
Ready?

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.140
The users need to invoke your
app with a phrase like, "OK,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.730
Google.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.500
Let's talk to AnimalJoker."

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.870
Now, Google knows
the name of the app

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.880
that users choose to use.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.700
The user is now
talking to your app.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.490
Your app generates
dialogue output, which

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.870
is then spoken to the user.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.130
The user then make
request, your app

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.720
process it, and replies back.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.650
The user has two-way dialogue
until the conversation finish.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.340
For our examples, we
are going to use API.AI.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.280
API.AI use the machine learning
to understand what the user is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.470
trying to tell our app.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.410
Believe me, they are
saving us a lot of work.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.690
You can then respond
to the user's request

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.650
from within API.AI, or send
information on the user's

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.380
intent to your own
servers to perform

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.110
any required action
for fulfillment

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.480
and respond to the user.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.580
After the log-in, you
can create your first app

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.100
for Google Assistant.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.600
You will need to
give your app a name.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.820
In our case, it
will be AnimalJoker.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.540
Please note that the app name
cannot contain any spaces

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.520
between the words.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.142
Click on Save.

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:20.280
It's the button on the top
right corner of the screen.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.122
What are entities?

00:02:22.122 --> 00:02:23.580
Entities are the
values that we are

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.160
trying to capture
from the user phrases,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.460
kind of like filling out
a form, requesting details

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.870
from the user.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.350
API.AI looks to
extract these out,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.840
and will do a follow-up
prompt until completed.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.470
This is how entities
look in API.AI.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.140
We will create an Animal entity.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.970
First step is to click
on Create Entity button.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.690
It's on the top right corner.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.750
Next, you should start
typing animal's name.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.000
The final results should
look similar to the image

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.780
on the right.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.320
Please remember, you
should help API.AI machine

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.130
learning algorithms train
self by providing synonyms.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.890
For example, a dog
could be also a puppy.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.860
In our case, you could give
it only two, three animals.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.810
That would be fine
for our prototype.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.270
In the real world, try
to give many examples,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.410
so it will cover more cases.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.600
What is an intent?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.290
An intent is triggered by a
series of user says phrases.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.620
This could be something like,
"Please tell me a tiger jokes."

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.570
You need to specify
enough sentences

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.624
to train API.AI machine
learning algorithms.

00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:36.040
Then, even if the
user doesn't say

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.980
exactly the words
you typed, API.AI

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.910
could still understand them.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.500
You should create
separate intents

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.780
for different types of action.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.900
Don't try to combine
them all together.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.200
In our example, we'll
create two intents--

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.660
Tell Joke intent, this
intent will handle

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.850
the jokes, and a Quit intent.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.890
This intent will handle
the part where the users

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.900
wishes to finish the action.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.700
Let's build the
Tell Joke intent.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.070
It's time to create the intent
that will tell us the jokes.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.020
First, click on the
Create Intent button.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.390
Second, start typing
a few sentences

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.180
that you will want
to use to get a joke.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.930
For example, "Please
tell me a joke on dogs."

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.300
Type a few sentences
so API.AI could

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.280
start training its algorithms.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.980
You could see that
while you type,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.710
API.AI automatically
recognize the phrases includes

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.500
one of the entities
and highlights it.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.360
See how it looks like.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.160
In the Actions
section, we'll need

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.450
to make sure that our
Animal entity is required,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.920
and in the Promote Input
line, we should type, "Please

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.500
tell me which animal you like."

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.070
This will cover the cases where
the user didn't name an animal.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.970
It will be clear to her
that we need this entity.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.590
Finally, in the Text
Response section,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.370
we will fill our
most amazing jokes.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.770
You could take few ideas
from the image below.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.250
Please note that we are
using the Animal value

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.960
in our response
in order to create

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.190
a joke that is based on the
animal that the users ask.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.650
After you fill
your amazing jokes,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.190
don't forget to click on Save.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.260
Let's build our Quit intent.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.810
A good design principle
is to allow our users

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.160
to end the conversation.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.050
You will need to have
it anyway in order

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.150
to pass the review process.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.520
You should click again
on Create Intent button,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.190
then start typing few sentences
that will end the conversation.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.630
For example, "Bye-bye,"
or "Bye, AnimalJoker."

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.310
On the right, you could see
how the intent look like.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.740
Last but not least, you need
to check the End Conversation

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.880
check box so that it
will know to really end

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.110
the conversation at this point.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.330
We are almost done.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.520
It's testing time.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.190
Click on the Integration
on the right-side menu.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.440
This will open the API.AI
agent page with all the options

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.370
to integrate it
with our services.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.910
You could see here the
many options that we have.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.830
Click on Action on
Google box under

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.140
the one-click integration.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.930
This will enable you to test
your work on Google Home,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.970
a phone, or our web simulator.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.700
Once you click on
Action on Google,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.830
you will see this dialogue.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.640
That was it.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.011
Congrats!

00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:24.510
You could read more details in
the link in the documentation

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.210
here.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.340
Thank you for watching
this introduction video.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.900
If you like, we also have
a blog post on this topic.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.620
Also, please make sure to
check out our other episodes.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.140

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.640
and leave us comments.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.760
Until next time, be strong
and create amazing actions.
