Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, so we were talking about green chemistry. Uh, today we'll talk about one aspect of Mitsui, Nobu reaction and then get on to acids and acid derivatives. And then, uh, we'll do that again next, uh, lecture more about acid derivatives, condensations and some stuff about carbohydrates. And then the last two lectures, uh, now I remember when we were talking about green chemistry, they were some new processes that were desired. There were old processes that that need improvement, a new process that processes that need to be developed according to these, uh, the wishes of the pharmaceutical industry. Uh, remember there were six votes for aromatic cross coupling I mentioned right at the end last time. That's how to put to benzene rings or other aromatic rings together without using Hallo aromatics. We haven't talked about those reactions, but uh, but that's their top desire then how to use aldehydes or ketones plus ammonia and reduction to give a chiral mean.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Now notice how many of these things have to do with getting a single lead antitumor because that's so important in drugs to have a single in antivirus. And this notice what they want here is to do what nature does. We've talked before about making glutamic acid by what's called reductive Amination, where you have a reducing agent, Nadh, you make the amine and then and then reduce it. So they would like to be four of the pharmaceutical six pharmaceutical companies said that was something they would really like to be able to do or asymmetric hydrogenation of Olefins and ina means or it means, and notice this is hydrogenation of an IA mean this very reaction here, but what they want is asymmetric. That his ability to make a single [inaudible] ante mercy. You don't have to throw half the stuff away and do a separation. Uh, four voted for a greener Fluor nation method.

Speaker 1:          01:58          A lot of drugs have fluorine in them. And the reagents that put those in are often pretty vigorous ones. Uh, nitrogen chemistry, avoiding a zip codes and three, avoiding hydrazine, which is very poisonous. Uh, asymmetric Hydra amination. Again, asymmetric, a greener electrophilic nitration we talked about a electrophilic aromatic substitution nitration uh, but what they want is a greener way to do it. And the final one is asymmetric addition of HCN. Notice incidentally, that four of these, uh, eight half of them have to do with asymmetric a synthesis, making chiral things. And notice that s a f, uh, six of them, six of the eight have to do with nitrogen. Okay. Now, uh, at the end last time we were talking about that the other table, the one of processes that need improving, and in particular something that seems surprising to many chemists is oh, activation for nuclear fillic substitution.

Speaker 1:          03:00          We've talked about that so long, getting, getting a halogen or a Tassel, eight that can, uh, that can be substituted. But this is, they want something that's better than that. And notice that three voted for a safer and more environmental Mitsui Nobu reaction. So let's see what the Mitsui Nobu reaction is, and you'll see that it is a type of height of, of that second case, a activation of, Ooh, for nuclear affiliate substitution. So there's a picture of a Mitsui, Nobu, and he, uh, in the 1960s, he invented this reaction with a great leaving group, uh, the o p plus fennel three leaving group. And so if you bring in a nucleophile Bingo, it, it's a very clean, a substitution reaction that is clean in the sense that it gives a high yield. Uh, so, and it's very general, the nucleophile, uh, any nucleophile we'll work, it seems if it has a PKA, if it's more acidic than 15, for example, a carb, oxalate can get an r put audit or the phosphoric acid or, or the, uh, emitted, or in three minus or most significantly active methylene compounds.

Speaker 1:          04:13          So let's see what that means. Active methylene compound. Okay. So here's a specific example taken from Mitson Ho Booze Paper in the journal synthesis to make s minus methyl succinic acid. So it's an asymmetric synthesis to make a, and it starts with a, with a chiral starting material, s minus ethyl lactate. So the idea is to make the Oah into a leaving group. So let's see. Let's read through his thing and see how he does it. He uses the reagents one and two. Now, one is try fennel phosphene. And two is a compound whose acronym is d a d. And we'll see later what it's die. Ethel, a Zodiac carb oxalate. So we'll see how that works. But at any rate, those two in the next slide, but, but uh, for now, let's just take that, that makes that leaving group the, uh, puts the foss try phosphorus on the oxygen and with a plus charge.

Speaker 1:          05:11          So now we got a good leaving group and we want a nucleophile to displace it. And the nucleophile they use in this example is Ethel Cyan. No acetate. Okay. So, uh, so it's, it's the ethyl Ester of a Siddique acid, but the carbon has a cyan on it and that makes it an active methylene compound. Okay. And the reason is it has a pka of 13. It's, it's pretty acidic for a ch bond. Now the reason of course is what you get is an email late because there's an Alpha carbon eel. It's Alpha to a carbon steel, but it's also alpha to the CN triple bond. So it's doubly, uh, activated by low lumos next door. So easily makes that an eye. So this, this then is can be a nucleophile that will displace on the carbon. So it's gonna come across and, and invert the carbon.

Speaker 1:          06:05          Okay. And make the new bond. And that's, that's uh, the first product they want Diane Ethel to Cyanna three methyls succinate. Now notice they say the yield is pretty good, 61% right. And notice especially that the conditions are very mild. These reactions are started at minus 20 degrees and then just warm to room temperature. It's not something that needs a lot of heating. On the other hand, they had to isolate it by preparative layer chromatography. So that's, that's not an easy way, an easy thing to do on a largish scale. So that's certainly a painful thing to do to try to get written what this, this is, it tends to be insoluble so you can filter it off. But to get the last bits of it out, you have to do this layer chromatography. So that's certainly not so great. Uh, uh, notice that it says ultimately the optical purity is greater than 99%.

Speaker 1:          07:04          Right now this reaction is indeed very, very clean in version. So that's one of the hallmarks of the Mitsui Nobu reaction. But in fact it's not proved by this, that 99% purity because you notice at the end it was really crystallized. The product has recrystallized. So even if there was a little bit of the wrong Ian antitumor in there, when you crystallize it, you'd get only the writing antitumor right in purifying it that way. So this doesn't prove it, but it's true that it gives very, very clean and version. And that's one of its main advantages. Okay. But notice incidentally that this, that this isn't the product they wanted. This is an intermediate, right? And notice that there would be, there's two, there are two chiral centers, this one which was 99% inverted and this one, uh, which came from the anti and that, that did the attacking the active methylene compound.

Speaker 1:          07:59          And there's no reason that that should be only one, right? It could have inverted at the stage of the [inaudible] that is the anti and would've been planar because of the conjugation with the, with the, uh, double bonds next door. So a, wouldn't that lower the yield? No, because of the product they're finally going to, and you'll see how that is. They hydrolyze this intermediate to s meinl methyl succinic acid, which you'll notice is what it is they're trying to make up at the top. So they were able to convert the ester to an acid, the other Esther to an acid by, that's a fee, the reverse of a Fischer esterification acid and water and the CN triple bond also hydrolyzes to an acid, although it takes more work, it was heated under reflux for 16 hours, but that converted that one to an acid. And now you notice this, this carbon isn't chiral anymore because it's got to acid groups.

Speaker 1:          08:59          And even more than that, it turns out that when you have a situation like that, it decarboxylates, it loses the Sio two. And the h comes on here. So again, it's not a chiral carbons. So this is the product and the ultimate yield was, was 29% overall. Right? So, uh, that's not a hundred percent reaction, but it's very, very clean in terms of the, of the product being stereo, chemically pure. Okay. And this, the purity, the stereo chemical purity version is sometimes used by synthetic chemist when they design a complicated synthesis and they make an alcohol, but it turns out not to be the one they want, right? It's the wrong iin. Antitumor so then they use a version of this reaction called the Mitsui, Nobu inversion. So for example, suppose they've made this s configured alcohol, but what they really wanted was the are, so what you need to do is make that Ooh into Alevi group and bring an oxygen in from the backside to make the other one.

Speaker 1:          10:04          So they can do this to correct the synthetic mistake by using these, uh, these reagents, a trifle, fos feed and dad, and a Siddique acid. So the acetic acid is something that's more acidic than, than a PKA, uh, uh, 13, 15. It's got PKA five. So it'll do the trick. So you mix these things together, do the reaction, and it makes the acetate in the back. And now that's the ester the alcohol you want. So all you have to do is treat it with acid and get the inverted alcohol. Now how does this activation work? How do you do this in order to get the great leaving group? Uh, well, you react, try fennel, phosphene with HR to do that, but they won't interact directly. That's notice minus three. And in the product it's minus one. So you're going to need an oxidizing agent in order to do their, and that oxidizing agent is this compound number one up here, Die Ethel.

Speaker 1:          11:06          So it's an ethyl ester on both ends. Notice it's symmetrical Aso, Die Carb, oxalate, d, e a. D. Now this is sort of a complicated, uh, scheme, uh, and it's, it's balanced just right. So the right, the correct nucleophile will attack at each step. There are three nuclear files that are involved. There's the, the phosphorus unshared pair. There's the, uh, unshared pair on an oxygen to the alcohol and there's x minus that was formed from the, from the acid that you put in, which is ultimately the thing that's going to do the displacing. That's the nucleophile that comes in. So you don't want the wrong nucleophile to be operating at any given time. Okay. So first the unshared pair on phosphorus attacks, the double bond on nitrogen, which we'll put a charge on this nitrogen here, that when these electrons go on there, what's good about having the charge on that nitrogen?

Speaker 2:          12:06          Why would that be better than an ad into any old, uh, and double bond? And it's got the,

Speaker 1:          12:18          the residents with the carbon eel. So it's gonna, it's gonna make this a little lake system here. Okay? So that, that, uh, that comes in and now this HX is one of these things that has a pka less than 15. So it's able then to, uh, to protonate this, this, this, uh, remember this is a fairly stable and iron, but it's not as stable as x minus. It doesn't have that lower PKA. So this one's able to protonate here. Now, uh, notice if x attacked people. If x attack x is a pretty good, is the anti and have a pretty good acid. You could imagine it attacking the phosphorus to make a fifth bond to phosphorus, right? Phosphorus has vacant d orbitals but if it did, it would come off again because it's a much better and I, and then the anti and for the Forbes, if you broke the phosphorous nitrogen bond, so this is the example of it being tuned just right. So it could, uh, if, if the x k Bonne it would just come off again. But if the double bond, if the, if the unshared pair of oxygen goes on, then you'd get, uh, the bond formed like this. Right? And now that would come off again, this, this is, uh, the protonated oxygen is a stronger acid than the, than this would be, but if it loses the proton,

Speaker 2:          13:51          right. Okay,

Speaker 1:          13:52          then this one is now a better leaving group, especially if it gets protonated. Right? So now we can, now we've made this thing here. Okay. The, the, the made the oxygen into a leaving group and now, and notice that the same time this, the nitrogen nitrogen, which originally was a double bond now has two hydrogens on it. So it got reduced, right? And that, and that is, it was the oxidizing agent that allowed this to happen. Okay. And now x minus is able to do the nuclear Phillips substitution and that's how the Mitson Obu react, activation happens. And notice that this, this last one here then is irreversible. Once you put the x on, this is not a good nucleophile, it's not going to come back on. So this is a high yield process when you do that one.

Speaker 2:          14:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:48          But the problem is that a complete required chromatography that was bad about it, then at least this aspect of it has been improved. And it's an interesting way in which it's been proved. Instead of using, try fennel phosphene the benzene rings of the trifle Phosphene, some of them are attached to a polymer, right? Like that. So that means if you have a polymer bead that holds this reagent, yeah. At the end, you don't have to do the chromatography in order to separate your product from the trifle phosphine oxide, you just have to filter it because it's attached to a solid polymer. Okay. But what, what disturbs the green chemists about this otherwise handy reaction is that your goal is to eliminate water between Hx and Roa H. Right? But, uh, but in order to do that, you generate byproducts that have a molecular way to 450. So this is what's called Adam inefficient.

Speaker 1:          15:52          You generate lots of waste for all, for the way to the molecule you generate. Now we're going to be talking about oxidation of aldehydes and alcohol's we have talked about some of them already, but it's nice to do those in a green way too. And in fact, we already talked about some, uh, such a reaction last semester. It was one of the first oxidations of, of, uh, of, uh, of an Aldehyde that was studied, which was the oil of bitter almonds. You remember what was special about this sample when you turned it over? It turned out that this Aldehyde was in fact mostly solid. It had converted spontaneously to, to, uh, to benzoic acid without adding any of, uh, chromium manganese or anything like that. You got benzoic acid just by reacting it with oxygen. So there could hardly be a cleaner, greener, uh, uh, process.

Speaker 1:          16:51          So the air oxidation of Benzaldehyde is a process that I think we mentioned before, but I'll talk about it again. So it's a free radical chain reaction. So you have some radical, which pulls the hydrogen away from the Aldehyde, which generates this ACL radical, but the ACO, radical canal attack, oxygen to form a new bond and a single bond to oxygen, which itself is now a radical, which is the X. Okay? So x comes back and takes a hydrogen from the other and the product then is not benzoic acid, but per Roxy benzoic acid. So that's what you would expect to get at first. All right. But, uh, in fact, it might be fun for you just to, to, uh, review, uh, free radical chain reactions by re, by writing this thing in one of those cyclic diagrams as to what comes in, where the radicals are, what comes out.

Speaker 1:          17:51          That would be a good exercise, right? So this is the initial product, but this itself is an oxidizing agent. It's got this week oxygen, oxygen bond, a low Lumo, which is, uh, uh, which is a little bit like using a halogen halogen bond. So it also is like an alcohol, so it can form a Hemi Ke Tau by attacking the carbon eel. So here's the group that attacked, here's the new bond and we have, Ooh, so it's like a heavy key towel, except it's per Roxy. And now notice it, it's converted, uh, the, uh, what would have been an Oah into an o with alleving group. Okay. If this had just been a regular old, uh, hydrate of the Aldehyde, there'd be Ooh, here. But now we have, oh, with the leaving group, so base can pull off the Proton electrons come in to make a double bond.

Speaker 1:          18:45          These leave, and now you have benzoic acid and eight, which is a base that can do that reaction next time. Right? So what could be a more efficient reaction? All you do is expose Benzaldehyde to oxygen and it becomes benzoic acid. So there is a very green oxidation reaction. Okay. You can see section 1812 which talks about this. Okay. But the last year when I was talking about this subject, we had a seminar from a professor at the Vitamin Institute, David Milstein, who talked about devising catalysts for greener operations. And I thought this one was a very interesting one. So this is a Ruthie medium catalyst and it has on carbon monoxide and hydrogen and then this funny league and that it's a peer, a dean of Benzine with the nitrogen in it with two groups, Cah do here ch two and it has a nitrogen, Diane ethyl amine on this end and dye tee butyl phosphene on the other end.

Speaker 1:          19:48          So it has three things with unshared, pairs, phosphorous, nitrogen and nitrogen that can mix with the orbitals of the ruthenium to make this complex. Now I've met, I've colored two of the hydrogens here, green because there they can come off, you can lose age to having lost those two hydrogens notice or you can add h two and come back again. Now how does that happen? Well notice that this, this stuff here with the nitrogen plus charge with an extra bond here going to this kind of a ring is a little bit reminiscent of what we saw before with Nad plus Nadh that this is a nuclear fillic aromatic substitution, the start of it. So the h minus ads here, these go onto the nitrogen. So you have a ring like that one and h attached, but the h minus can come off again and be given to something else.

Speaker 1:          20:49          So there are, this is closely balanced, right? This one has the advantage of being aromatic. This one has the advantage of having a new bond and not being charged, right? So being closely balanced, it can go back and forth. So the same way that Nadh in nature can function as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent going one way and another, you could imagine that a thing like this could go back and forth. So, uh, lose the h plus and go back as far as, as far as the stability of this part of it goes. But there's a problem. The h could be thought of as h minus because it's bonded to a metal, right? So the electrons are mostly on the more electronegativity negative hydrogen, but it can't reach to that position. So you can't do that kind of thing. But what it can reach is the hydrogen here.

Speaker 1:          21:40          If we change the confirmation of the thing a little bit, right? So you can imagine that these elect the hydride attacks this hydrogen, which loses these electrons to make that bond. And that's helped by the fact that these electrons that get stabilized by moving onto the positive nitrogen, right? So this is what a lot, this type of of effect is what allows us to go back and forth either direction, but we're most interested in the direction going up. So let's redraw that thing and, and look at what happens if there's an alcohol. So an alcohol comes in and it's unshared payer makes a bond to the ruthenium, right? And now it's all plus. Okay? Now, uh, we could have the hydride notice it's h uh, uh, wait a second. If I don't right through here, oh no. Uh, what we're doing is using the unshared pair of nitrogen. This is not like hydride I said the wrong thing. This is a proton. The electrons are going away from this hydrogen. So the Proton is able to go on here, right? Degenerate the end plus again.

Speaker 2:          22:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:52          And now notice that the same time that that, uh, alcohol that came on had an h had two H's that I drew explicitly. The one down here is the one I'm interested in because it's near the Ruthie Diem, right? And now we can, if this were oh minus and notice in a sense it is oh minus because it's bonded to a metal, right? Then the electrons of the old minus these electrons can make a double bond here giving hydride a hydride can attack the ruthenium

Speaker 2:          23:28          like that.

Speaker 1:          23:29          So notice what the product of this is that we're at the top. We get, we got a carbonyl group, right? And the thing we have at the bottom is this, right? Which can start the whole process over again by giving off h two. So what is this whole catalytic cycle accomplished? It you've brought in an alcohol and you removed from it. These two hydrogens as h two.

Speaker 2:          23:59          Okay?

Speaker 1:          24:00          So it's a way of, so it's an oxidation of the alcohol, not by bringing in oxygen and making water, but by giving off h two. Okay? So now you can do another, in this particular reaction, there's another, uh, oxidation. It re removing h two from a different alcohol. Notice the product is an Aldehyde, but in water it will form a dial. So it can be the alcohol that comes in and you remove another h two from it, which gives them, uh, uh, uh, uh, a carboxylic acid plus oxidizing another, uh, alcohol, uh, and have CEO coupling. And you get a, if I had done this right,

Speaker 1:          24:50          I think I counted wrong here. I think I wrote this wrong. Uh, I don't think you oxidize that alcohol, but at any rate at couples to give the Esther, I think that should be two a h two is there, I'll correct that. Okay. But this happens in the presence of this catalyst with no other op activation. So what comes in as the alcohol, what comes out as two moles of hydrogen and the Ester, right? A very clean process. Okay, so here's a table taken from Milstein stable from Milstein is paper and you can see with several different, uh, alcohols, he was able to get high conversions higher than 90 up to 99%. Very high yields of the Ester and only a little bit of the Aldehyde. Most of it got oxidized. Uh, let's look at the thermo chemistry of this. And again, I think that should be two h twos.

Speaker 1:          25:46          So if you look at the heat of formation of ethanol and the heat of formation of the Ester, that's the product from that. And hydrogen has a free energy of zero. So the two hydrogens don't count. But if we add it together, this reaction is endothermic by 17 kilocalories per mole. So it's way up hill. You'd think the equilibrium constant would be very unfavorable. What makes it possible for this to happen? Catalytically right? We're not putting in something that's a strong reagent that makes one of these very reactive and then it can react with the other things. We're just putting the alcohol in and to have the alcohol come in and Esther come out and everything stayed the same. Otherwise, with the catalyst right there, you have to go uphill and energy by 17 kilocalories per mole, which sounds very tough, but there are two things that make this uh, that make this good, right?

Speaker 1:          26:46          You form three, uh, but you form, uh, you start with two molecules and you form three molecules to h two and the Ester, again, I counted wrong here. Uh, so by making more molecules, you make more entropy available. And furthermore, this is especially helped because you make those two hydrogen gas molecules and you can remove those from the solution. So notice how this was done. It was done in one case under a flow of our gone to sweep the hydrogen gas out. And in the other case, the, the Taleo in solution was refluxed, which again, take the solvent, pushes the other gas out. So, uh, so at, at, at low pressure of hydrogen, it's possible to do this spontaneously. So these are, that's an, uh, an important type of analysis to do on a catalytic cycle as to whether that you've proposed as to whether in fact it could be thermodynamically allowed.

Speaker 1:          27:48          They also were able to make a means that way. Starting with alcohol's make an a mean by reacting with, with ammonia. So alcohol plus ammonia, it gives it a mean and also incidentally and m mean. So probably it's the same kind of thing before the alcohol gets oxidized to an Aldehyde, but in the presence of the nitrogen, it forms the amine, the CN double bond. And then that can get, uh, that gets reduced to give the by the hydrogen that's there in order to give, give the, uh, uh, mean, but again, these are very high yield, uh, reactions and notice that it says that they're there too. When you look at, uh, a synthetic paper and a table in it, it's important to look at two different kinds of yields. The yields, the normal yields given here are analyzed by gas chromatography to figure out how much was in there.

Speaker 1:          28:43          But what you're really interested in is what you can put in a bottle as a pure form, right? So the yields in parentheses are isolated products. So sometimes, sometimes they're very good compared to the, uh, to the uh, uh, gas chromatography yield. But in this particular case, it's hard to separate and you only get half as much out, uh, to sell to your neighbor as you had analyzed by GC. So you can also make it means and amids and so on with these catalysts. So that's an interesting development which seems to address if not to solve perhaps some of these problems that the pharmaceutical industry identified. Now we've been talking in these last examples of reading chemistry about acids and acid derivative. So let's talk about them a little more systematically. First, the acidity of our co two h have a carboxylic acid. You remember that the Ph of a normal, a carboxylic acid is between four and five. Like butyric acid is 4.8. Now let's look at the effect of putting a chlorine in there. So if you put the chlorine it on the terminal carbon, it hardly changes the PK at all just by 0.3 units. If you move it a little bit closer to the carboxylic acid, it's 4.1 and a few moves. Move it as close as possible to the carboxylic acid. Now it makes a real difference. 2.8 what is it that the, what is it that the chlorine is doing?

Speaker 1:          30:14          Hell, I like them. So it's electron withdrawing and how does that help?

Speaker 2:          30:19          It makes the age

Speaker 1:          30:21          and how does it make the age come off? Why does it reduce the line?

Speaker 2:          30:29          That's great.

Speaker 1:          30:32          You know, actually I bet that's not true. I bet it doesn't reduce the bond strength. The bond strength is the kind of thing that professor Alison talked about last time. Breaking a bond to give two free people laugh already. Just mentioned his name and they like, okay, you break the bottom and you get two free radicals. I don't know the results, but my strong suspicion is that chlorine hardly affects that at all. What are the effects is dissociation as an acid. So what is it? The chlorine is stabilizing.

Speaker 2:          31:09          It affects the

Speaker 1:          31:10          an ion, right? So the electron withdrawal by the chlorine makes the rest of the wall, the nearby region of the molecule, a better place to put more electrons as in the anti on rather than the neutral molecule. So this inductive effect of the chlorine works, but only in the vicinity of the chlorine at dies away as you get further and further from the chlorine. So this, this is so called inductive effect and it's not very big if you're far away, but if you get pretty close, it can be big. Okay. Now let's just see this inductive effect. If it's, if it could be quantitatively reasonable, right? If, if the, if the withdrawal by the chlorine stabilizes a negative charge by a certain amount of energy, then the process becomes, the equilibrium becomes easier by that about of energy, right? And the, uh, and the, that energy difference, right, would appear in the exponent of it for the equilibrium constant.

Speaker 1:          32:12          Remember, 10 to the two thirds Delta Age. So it would make an effect in the x, a certain energy effected the exponent. And if you put two of them in, you'd do make twice that change. And the exponent, if it were simple. Okay. And that means the results would be multiplicative because when you add things in an exponent, that means you multiply the numbers. Okay? Okay. So let's look a Siddique acid chloro a CD acid dye chloro and try chloro a CD Casad and see whether this inductive effect of the chlorine is additive in energy, therefore multiplicative in, in equilibrium, constant. Or if you do the log of the equilibrium constant, then it would be additive because it's up in the exponent. Okay? So notice here is 4.8 the same as here. Here it's 2.9 same as here. So it's the same kind of effect.

Speaker 1:          33:14          Okay? But when we put the second, but let's look at the values here. Not at the values themselves, but at the difference. How much difference did that first chlorine made? It made a difference of 1.9 PKA units. Now if the second one made this, had the same effect on the energy of an an ion, that would also be 1.9. It's actually 1.6 not quite as big. And, and the third one is hard, hardly makes any difference at all. It's only old 0.6. I mean, it's substantial, but it's, but, but it's, uh, but it's not anything like the first ones. And the reason is that once, once the anti and is already stabilized, it gets harder and harder to withdraw a subsequent electrons. One chlorine withdraws a certain much certain amount, the next Galore, he doesn't have as much to withdraw. So it can't do quite as good a job.

Speaker 1:          34:05          The third one does very much poorer job, right? But fluorine is better than chlorine and try flouro is CD acid is quite a strong acid. It's got a negative PKA. So that's the inductive effect. And now might, we might wonder, what is it that makes the carboxylic acid acidic altogether ignoring these additional inductive effects? So, uh, Paul Ravelin from, uh, from Swarthmore college published the paper in the Journal, the American Chemical Society in 2000 that had an interesting analysis of this. And I put it on because, uh, uh, because, uh, professor Ellison is such a big advocate of resonance structures as you saw last time rather than molecular orbital theory. So this is an interesting analysis in terms of resonance structures. Now what he did is do very good calculations, but calculations in the gas phase, right? Not in a solvent of what the equilibrium constant should be for what the energy involved should be in transferring a proton from an alcohol to a carboxylic acid, right?

Speaker 1:          35:18          So you get the anti into the alcohol and the protonated carboxylic acid, and now the carboxylic acids are caused called acids because they give their protons to basis. So this reaction lies to the left and to go to the right is uphill by almost 28 kilocalories per mole in the gas phase. Okay? Uh, now the difference in Pka, the PK of an alcohol is about 16. The PK of a carboxylic acid is about five. So the difference in PKA is about 11. Right? Therefore, you would expect the equilibrium constant at room temperature to be about four thirds of that. So it should be about 15 kilocalories per mole, right? But notice that pks are defined in water, right? So it must be that the solvent makes an enormous effect, right? Uh, it reduces this to about half of its value from near close to 30 to 15.

Speaker 1:          36:18          By making it easy, it makes it easier to go to the right only 15 kilocalories uphill instead of 30 kilocalories uphill. Why? It could be because this one has a much more concentrated negative charge. So it gets more effectively solve, aided by the water compared to this one, which helps drive the reaction to the left. But anyhow, that's a secondary, uh, consideration, uh, because we're just looking as rambling did at the molecules in the gas phase. Okay. So it's a 28 kilocalories uphill to do that. Now, what's the reason? Why does it want to go that way? Well, we're, we're tempted to say resonance. You have, uh, that's certainly what Ellison would have said, right? You have two resonance structures of this, an ion and only one resonance structure of that's reasonable for the on the right. Okay. Can you think of any other reason that it might be good to, to go to the left? Anything? Uh, anything else that makes that a better and I in compared to this anti on other than residents.

Speaker 2:          37:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:26          Had the ideas this, these are H's incidentally c h three y here's h, c o o minus. If residents weren't a factor, would you expect these to be the same? Would you expect to equilibrium constant to be one

Speaker 2:          37:46          maybe. Yeah. The Pi Star helping,

Speaker 1:          37:54          yeah. Is the molecular orbital way of saying there's residents, right? That's what, that's how they do it. So that, that in fact is the same thing. But is there anything else that would tend to make it go that way?

Speaker 2:          38:07          Pardon me? And what, how would the oxygen health, so it could be an inductive effect that notice this oxygen

Speaker 1:          38:16          closer than the chlorine that was making the difference before the chlorine was out on the next carbon. Okay. So you could also have an inductive effect due to the oxygen. Now notice that it's a double bond. So it's an interesting question whether you count the oxygen once or counted twice. Okay? So for purposes of this paper, uh, Ramblin hypothesize that you count the oxygen twice. Okay? So now we have residents and inductive effects and we can do some numerology about these, about how important resonance structures are. Okay? So notice that this 27.9 kilocalories is due to loss of resonance and to loss of two inductive effects for oxygen. If you're supposed to count it twice with a double bond. Now let's look at this one, where we've put where we, instead of using alcohol, we use a ketone and a protonated acid here. So instead of the ad, and it's protonated now and now we transfer the proton from here to the Ketone Aldehyde. Actually these are hydrogens, okay? So we make the protonated ketone and the carboxylic acid. Now here, the reaction lies to the right, okay? It's exothermic by 6.2 kilocalories from all the gas phase. Now which side would resonance favor?

Speaker 2:          39:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:49          Debbie, can you help us out? Can you draw, would you draw a resonance structures of this? You could, you could use the unshared pair on the Oah and it would be stabilized by the Pi Star, but that would require separation of charge. And Ellison told us we don't want to do that. Okay. How about on the left and he resonance structures there?

Speaker 2:          40:14          Yes.

Speaker 1:          40:19          Speak up positive now. Now you could draw a double bond deer in a single bond there and put the charge on the bottom and you're not separating charge. You just moving the charge. So here or you have good residents here. You don't have on the right, you don't have reasonable resonance. Okay? On this one you had residents on the left and not on the right. So now, uh, now the or don't park. In both cases we had residents on the left. Okay? So resonance is going to be, is going to favor the left and cause you to go uphill in either case. Okay. Now how about the inductive effect? How about the oxygen? We'll try somebody else here. Chris, which side is favored by the inductive effects? In the top, the inductive effects favorite, the left, because we had two bonds to oxygen withdrawing electrons stabilized in the anti right? Now how about in this case when we have two bonds here?

Speaker 2:          41:23          Okay,

Speaker 1:          41:26          that's good. If it stabilizes, the anti in the argument is it destabilizes the cat I and so it's the same deal except now the, the uh, we same residents that would cause it to go uphill to the right, but the oxygen now makes it go down to the left. Okay? Now how many, uh, how many oxygens did we air this time is just the difference between this. And this is just this bond, right? So it's not a question of counting one or two and there's only one bond there. So that's one inductive effect of oxygen. Now we have two equations in two unknowns. The effect we have the residents effect, which is the same direction in both cases and the, and the inductive effect, which is in opposite directions and twice as strong in one case, right? So if we take, if we take the difference of these two minus this one, right?

Speaker 1:          42:28          We get plus 34.1 is three of the oxygen inductive effects. So the opposite inductive effect is 11.4 kilocalories per mole. And once we have that, we can plug back in to see how big the uh, the resonance effect is. It's 4.8. Okay. And now if we use this from this point of view, if we look that in the top case of that 30 kilocalories per mole going uphill, only five of it was due to resonance by far and away the dominant effect is the inductive effect, right? Only 20% of the special acidity, the carboxylic acid is due to residents from this viewpoint, okay? Now you may buy this resonance argument and you may not, I'm personally skeptical, but, but one way or the other, it would be good to check it. So Ravelin checked it. So he did this one with carbonic acid, the anti enough of carbonic acid, and now that's plus 37.3. Now what does it involve? Here's the anti in which is stabilized by resonance as this one was, right? And there's no resonance involving this one because it has the hydrogen on it. Okay. And how about, so it has resonance the same as the others. How about inductive effect? How many ops compared to this? How many oxygens are stabilizing this? O minus that?

Speaker 1:          44:09          Count three. If you count double bond twice, which is the rules he set, then you have three. Okay, so that's Oh, inductive times three. Now let's put that together. So we have oh inductive times three, that's a 34.2 and the resonance is 4.8 is 39 not bad. Okay, so we can try another one. Okay. So here we do the, the, the analog of what we did here, put a proton on. And now, uh, we have, uh, no resonance on the right. We have residents on the left. How many resonance structures in addition to the original structure,

Speaker 2:          45:00          Chris,

Speaker 1:          45:05          you can draw the double bond here. That's what we did in that case, which could also draw the double bond over here, right? So there should be residents times two, right? And that should, that should favor the left, make it uphill. Right? But also you're going to have oxygen's destabilizing this cat I and two oxygens d stabilizing that cat island. Right? And if you put those together, it's minus 13.2 and observed as 11. So they thought that is so there are people who think this, right? Uh, I personally don't like this kind of argument so much because I don't think it comes down to really the physics of the thing. It comes to count whether you count a double bond to bonds and things like that, which uh, it works out. So there are people who talk about this thing and from that point of view, resonance isn't as important to making acids acidic as inductive effect is.

Speaker 1:          46:05          So the inductive effect is certainly important. Now making acids by oxidation and reduction. No, we've talked about these things. A oxidizing and alcohol with chromium oxidizing. And remember on the way you get an Aldehyde, so you can also oxidize aldehydes and you could do it with chromium. I put potassium purveying bag aid in here. We also talked about oxidized in double bonds with ozone and then hydrogen peroxide to get a carboxylic acids. There's one different type of oxidation that we haven't talked about yet, which is mentioned in the, in the Jones textbook here, uh, which is, uh, Al Keel groups attached to a benzene ring can be oxidized by permanganate at a hundred degrees to make carboxylic acids as well. Now you can also make a carboxylic acids by reduction. You start with, of course this, the carbon and a carboxylic acid is pretty much oxidized, right? But there are more oxidized things like CO2. So if you had CO2, what would you react that with in order to form a carbon carbon bond to make the carboxylic acid? What kind of reagents? What would attack the carbon of CO2? Hi. Hi Homo or low Lenovo.

Speaker 2:          47:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:33          What would make CO2 double bond? Double Bond. What would make it react? Suppose it were just a single double bond. What makes it react? The Pi Star, right? Alo Lumo so you want a high Hobo, just like the things we talked about with alcohols, right where you can, you can have a ketone reacted with r minus reacted with h minus to go on. And then in this case, that would be a reduction of the carb central carbon and would form a carboxylic acid. So you could do that kind of thing too. Oh, you can also react a carboxylic acids with al kill lithium or hydride cotton pounds. So for example, you can react a generic carboxylic acid here with Al Kewill lithium. What do you think the product is?

Speaker 2:          48:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          48:26          What would the AR, ar, ar Alfio lithium is like our minus, right? It's a high homo on the are the are lithium bond. So what will it attack

Speaker 2:          48:40          Mary,

Speaker 1:          48:44          in addition to what? Carbon to the carbon deal. Right? That's what, that's what I, that's what I was trying to trick you into. Say in fact it reacts in another way. Can you think of any other, what else can it, what else does a high homo do besides make something a nucleophile?

Speaker 2:          49:03          It makes it a base.

Speaker 1:          49:05          Here we have an asset. So in fact, the easy thing to react with is the proton. That's easier to access than the carbon eel. Whoops, I'm sorry. I've talked too long. Uh, thanks for your patience.
