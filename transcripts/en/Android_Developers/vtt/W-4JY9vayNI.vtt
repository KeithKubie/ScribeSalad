[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.270
JENI FISHER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.010
I'm Jeni.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.280
I'm from the Apps Partnerships
team here at Google Play.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.730
So on a daily basis, I
speak to app developers

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.280
about their challenges
and their goals.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.820
They tell me that they're trying
to get more users to subscribe.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.370
They're trying to get more
users to discover features

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.760
within their apps.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.210
The developers I talk
to, as well as everyone

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.700
else in this room,
you optimize products

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.190
in order to better influence
how your users behave.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.010
And so for me, it
really makes sense

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.430
that if you want to better
optimize for user behavior,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.880
we should understand a bit
more about behavioral insights.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.580
It just makes complete sense.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.690
So later on, you're
going to hear from Sami,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.150
who's the CEO of The Fabulous.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.760
And The Fabulous is an
app that helps people

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.490
build better daily habits.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.800
He'll share how they
saw remarkable growth

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.530
in user retention as
a result of applying

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.769
behavioral economic
principles to the app.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.260
So in my job as Apps
Business Development Manager,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.330
I've spent the last
year immersing myself

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.690
in the fields of behavioral
economics, gamification,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.190
and product psychology.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.280
And I'm sure people in this room
as well as on the live stream

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.760
recognize quite a few of the
books on this virtual bookshelf

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.390
here.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.420
So we have books like
"Nudge," "Hooked,"

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.060
"Predictably Irrational."

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.260
And there are so
many great principles

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.960
within all of these books
that app developers can be

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.030
applying to their apps today.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.820
And so you don't have to
be a behavioral scientist

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.800
to understand what
your users want.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.720
You just need to
get a feel for some

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.700
of the principles
in these books.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.590
Start experimenting, and
see what works for you.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.180
So today's session will
really act as a reminder,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.930
because I'm sure a lot
of you are applying

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.940
similar principles already.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.980
And what I'm going to
be sharing with you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.740
are ways that you can address
your users' needs better

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.440
in ways that save
yourselves time and money.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.070
So to make this session as
actionable as possible for you,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.550
what I want you to do is to keep
in mind one key user behavior

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.850
that you're trying to
optimize in your own app.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.520
This could be purchasing
a subscription,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.780
inviting a friend to the app,
or perhaps getting more people

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.170
to return to your app after
that initial onboarding phase.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.290
So hopefully everyone here
has that behavior in mind.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.830
So keep it in mind throughout
the rest of the session.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.800
So now, what I want
to do is introduce you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400
to three steps inspired
by behavioral insights

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.850
that you can follow to make
this particular desired action

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.500
a reality.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.410
Many companies tend to
focus on step three, which

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.250
is all about trying to boost
user motivation, when actually,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.950
I think time and money could
be better spent by focusing

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.840
on step one, which
is identifying

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.890
the barriers in the first place.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.740
And so when I talked
about step three then,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.760
it's about often developers
focus on costly reward schemes

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.110
and loyalty schemes.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.000
So instead, let's
start with step one,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.390
simplifying the behavior.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.660
So every decision we make
requires overcoming barriers

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.860
of some kind.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.110
Let's think about everyone
in this room today.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.930
The fact that you've
decided to attend I/O,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.632
perhaps you had to overcome
huge distances to get here.

00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:25.840
You had to debate over
whether the cost of the ticket

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.280
was worth the price.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.710
Maybe you had loads
of other commitments

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.590
that you had to also
think about committing to,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.450
but instead you are here today.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.270
So why haven't
more users carried

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.220
out that one specific
behavior that you've

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.500
identified a few moments ago?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.940
Again, let's think about it.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.370
It could be it takes
too much time for them

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.360
to complete that action.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.170
Perhaps the purchase
involved is too costly,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.660
or choosing to do it
among other choices

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.820
just requires too
much mental effort.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.580
And so we can simplify
this by identifying

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.830
these types of barriers to
behavior and removing them.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.390
So the food delivery
app, Just Eat,

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.390
knew that they would get more
successful repeat transactions

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.200
if their users save payment
details during the checkout

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.020
flow.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.040
Now, via Google Analytics, they
identified that many users just

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.970
weren't doing this.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.790
And while this data
tells us the what,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.890
it doesn't necessarily
tell you the why.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.260
It doesn't tell you why
users weren't doing this.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.620
So what they had
to do was actually

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.930
conduct usability tests.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.030
And by taking this
approach, they

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.090
found out that many users had
certain emotions that you just

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.130
can't identify in data.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.680
For example, some
users were concerned

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.170
about the security
of digital payments,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.910
while others simply
didn't want to take

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.830
that extra step of clicking
Save Payment Details.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.530
So after identifying
these barriers,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.620
Just Eat simplified the act
of saving the payment details

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.590
by firstly making
the last used card

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.930
the default payment option
for any future transaction.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.610
And this is really
important here,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.570
because defaults are
extremely powerful.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.650
We tend to follow the
path of least resistance.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.795
So when defaults
make sense, they're

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:14.890
a really great way of
overcoming that barrier to act.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.350
Secondly, Just Eat
prioritized partnerships

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.810
with trusted payment providers
to reduce security concerns

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.590
in those users.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.300
And again, even if
you're not currently

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.210
running usability
sessions, the Play console

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.850
offers some really great
tools to help you identify

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.440
your users' pain points.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.840
For example, you can
analyze real user reviews

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.090
with the topics and
benchmarks analysis features.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.560
So decision making is impacted
by the number of choices

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.790
offered, which is something Sami
will talk about a bit later on

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.040
and how they tackled
that in The Fabulous.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.680
But it's also impacted
by how those choices are

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.580
presented to the user.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.310
So now, I want you
just to take a look

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.770
and glance at this upsell flow
from the recipe app, Simple

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.590
Feast.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.700
So they're offering the users
three choices, the monthly,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.540
the yearly, and the forever.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.030
So I'd love to get a show
of hands here in this room.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.340
Who thinks they're
trying to get more people

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.850
to purchase the monthly plan?

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.960
No hands.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.990
What about the yearly plan?

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.070
It's pretty unanimous.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.622
And how about the forever plan?

00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:24.450
OK, there's a few hands there.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.850
So the answer is
the yearly plan,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.710
because this is
actually the best value

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.300
plan for their users.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.890
And what they did
was they applied

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.890
four different behavioral
concepts in order

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.070
to aid this decision making.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.860
So firstly, they
leveraged social proofing.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.680
This is seen across so
many different apps now.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.730
What's most popular?

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.220
What are most of the
other users doing?

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.580
And this type of information
is really great for users

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.800
when they're uncertain
in any way about what

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.490
they need to do next.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.050
Secondly, they've called
out the yearly plan

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.310
in a very different color.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.790
So really helping to
emphasize the annual plan

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.000
as their preferred choice.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.280
Thirdly, for the
yearly plan, they've

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.440
framed that price
at a monthly price.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.990
This is a more digestible
and easy way for us

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.570
to understand what
is the actual cost,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.880
and it helps minimize that
barrier of the perceived

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.970
cost to the user.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.730
And lastly, the introduction
of the forever plan--

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.580
while some users may be
straight away willing to pay

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.100
that much money, it's
actually strategically

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.300
added there to help make
the yearly plan seem

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.240
more reasonably priced.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.790
This is often known
as the decoy effect.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.790
And so overall, these four
different techniques really

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.370
help to simplify that
decision for the user,

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.620
and make sure that it's more
likely that they're going

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.060
to choose the yearly plan.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.360
And that's actually what
the Simple Feast app saw.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.660
So we've covered some tactics
to simplify the behavior.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.976
You've identified the barriers.

00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:55.350
And so what we're
going to do now

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.540
is to move on to step
two or three, which

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.400
is all about triggers.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.400
So it's important to place
powerful and actionable

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.700
triggers at relevant moments
in front of engaged users.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.910
These triggers could be in-app
messages, email campaigns,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.280
or, of course, the hugely
popular push notification.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.670
And I'm sure everyone
here would love

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.780
to achieve a 300% uplift in
push notification open rates.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.650
So let's find out now how the
language learning app busuu

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.260
achieved this.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.360
busuu applied the
behavioral designer,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.910
Nir Eyal's "Hooked" model
to their push reengagement

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.140
campaigns.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.840
The first step in the
model is this trigger.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.330
And if you take a look,
the push notification

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.300
serves as the external trigger--

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.049
something that's
prompted by the developer

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.250
to get the attention
of the user.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.390
Now, what's important here
is that this external trigger

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.710
aligns with the user's
internal trigger of curiosity.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.640
It's messaged as a question.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.140
It gets them
thinking about a word

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.030
that they've already
learned, and as well

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.700
as this, an important
tactic that busuu uses,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.790
is they never send the
same messaging twice.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.800
And I'm sure many
of you here tend

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.912
to get the same daily
reminders, the same prompts,

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:06.620
every single day.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.161
And you get bored
of it, and you tend

00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:10.570
to swipe it away without
actually reading it.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.490
So the importance of variable
messaging is crucial.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.430
So step two-- the
user takes action,

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.770
and then clicks through
to complete the quiz.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.590
And hopefully, they answer
the question correctly.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.600
If they do, the third
step is the reward.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.520
And so they receive
a well-done message--

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.200
a simple reward for improving
their language learning skills.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.700
And so all of these
different steps

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.530
together lead to
that investment,

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:42.860
because this model helps them
increase their memory strength.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.730
And this further aligns the
app to their core goal as well.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.370
Even better, this investment
increases the chances

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.970
of the user engaging with the
app of their own prerogative

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.640
without needing that developer
trigger to remind them

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.750
to reengage with the busuu app.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.530
So for more best practices
on push notifications

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.030
and other tools for success,
don't miss this upcoming talk

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.400
by my colleagues Niko and Jeena
on this stage at 1:30 PM today.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.730
So, where appropriate,
another strategy

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.730
to ensure your triggers are as
powerful as they can possibly

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.680
be is scarcity.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.450
Now, when something is available
in limited time or limited

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.400
quantities, we're
prone to value it

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.400
more because we have a
fear of missing out on it.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.810
And so go back that behavior
you identified earlier.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.410
What can be made scarce that can
make more users likely to take

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.210
that decision to act?

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.700
So I'm going to show you an
example now of how the health

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.550
and lifestyle app Lifesum
wanted to increase

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.470
the number of subscriptions
that users purchased on day one

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.020
throughout the onboarding flow.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.420
So what they did was they
offered a starter kit that

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.850
was messaged as "today only."

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.960
Now, this was available.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.790
It was an exclusive
starter kit, and it

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.080
was only available to people
who subscribed at that moment.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.020
And this add-on increased
subscription conversion by 15%.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.230
So it's a hugely
powerful way of helping

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.640
to make people act sooner.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.710
So we've thought about how we
can simplify the behavior, how

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.410
we can make sure our triggers
are in the right places

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.840
and are as powerful and
persuasive as they can possibly

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.690
be.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.190
So our final step is to
ensure that our users

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.250
are motivated and really want
to take the desired action.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.270
This is one of the hardest
elements to influence,

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.450
and I would encourage focusing
on boosting motivation

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.620
for behaviors where users maybe
aren't already sufficiently

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.360
engaged with the app.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.061
So before we dig deeper
into motivation, let's

00:11:49.061 --> 00:11:50.560
just discuss the
fact that there are

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.680
two broad types of motivation
that we should think about.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.960
So there's intrinsic
motivation, where

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.210
the act of doing something
itself is the reward.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.280
And then there's
extrinsic motivation.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.550
So you can think about this
in terms of maybe offering

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.750
incentives.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.400
If someone's doing
something just

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.350
to get the resulting
benefit out of the outcome,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.930
that is something that
extrinsically motivates us.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.340
So games are in many ways the
ultimate motivational product.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.440
After all, many people here--
and I'm sure on the live stream

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.970
as well-- you've all spent
hours of your lives playing

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.220
with these games, especially
when they're successfully

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.300
engaging you.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.510
So I'm sure many people
here today as well

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.460
understand that there's
a lot of research

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.040
out there about why
games are so powerful.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.260
And it goes back to
this idea that it's

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.570
creating this genuine
level of engagement

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.170
when it taps into our
intrinsic motivations.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:51.270
So again, the act of playing
the game is the reward itself.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.690
So what I'm going to do
now is share with you

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.850
a four-step framework
for intrinsic motivation.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.610
It's essentially
a summary of two

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.659
different motivational
theories, and this was created--

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:06.950
it's called the RAMP framework.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.410
It was created by
Andrzej Marczewski.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.330
And this will really
help any app developers

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.460
who are thinking about
different techniques that

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.300
can help foster intrinsic
motivation within their app.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.230
So relatedness is the first
step of the RAMP framework.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.320
Relatedness is all about
building social connections,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.130
feeling part of a community,
and belonging to a community

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.640
as well.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.670
An example in a game
would be collaborating

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:36.300
with real and virtual friends
to complete a mission.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.540
The second step in the
RAMP framework is autonomy.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.480
So this is all about making
sure your users have the freedom

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.810
to make their own
choices and decisions,

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.880
and not feel like someone else
is controlling them in any way.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.420
An example in a game would be
exploring a virtual universe

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.995
or customizing an avatar
to your exact liking.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.140
The third step is mastery.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.250
So mastery is this driver in
everyone, all of us, to keep

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.980
progressing, keep
improving our skills.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.050
And a gamer might
spend hours perfecting

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.690
their particular skills in
order to level up or complete

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.410
a mission.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.930
And the last step in
ramping up your users

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.780
to be motivated to act
is this idea of purpose.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.590
So this is the drive
to add value to a cause

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.310
larger than ourselves.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.340
So when in doubt,
adopting techniques that

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.820
tap into your users' needs, one
of these four core or intrinsic

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.220
motivations, is going to be
a great way of ensuring that.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.360
So we're now going to dig
into some examples of how

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.910
app developers are
tapping into these four

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.740
intrinsic motivations.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.170
And also look out for
a future blog post

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.417
on the Google Play Dev
"Medium" publication

00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:48.750
where I'll be deep diving
into this in a bit more detail

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.380
as well.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.430
So game elements in
and of themselves

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.470
do not create engagement.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.780
But when these elements
appeal to what intrinsically

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.890
motivates us, they have a
better chance of creating that.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.020
And so I want to now talk
you through Catch It English.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.700
This is a language learning app.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.121
They've obsessed over the use
of game elements within the app,

00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:12.370
and you can see they've had
some really great success.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.170
They have a seven-day
retention rate

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.875
of 45%, which is on
a par with RPG games.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.750
And I'm sure many app
developers in this room

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.934
would love to have a
retention of almost 45%.

00:15:23.934 --> 00:15:26.350
So let's now look at the two
techniques that they've used,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.560
and the intrinsic motivations
that these tap into.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.960
So within the app, they have
study group functionality.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.240
These study groups
collaborate together

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.550
to help each other
learn the language,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.070
and this taps into our
desire for relatedness--

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.220
so to have connections
and to support others.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.020
Now, an interesting
twist here is

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.210
that the study groups
together can then

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.110
compete with each other.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.710
And again, competition
on a leader board--

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.990
that's a really classic
way of trying to tap

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.300
into our desire for mastery.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.340
We want to keep
improving and get better,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.430
and, ideally, be
better than our peers.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.130
So as well as this,
the app itself

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.640
has some really exciting
visual and audio cues.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.050
And they're created
in such a way

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.970
that they help
reinforce progress

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.550
as the user is going through
the app and learning English.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.850
So various studies suggest that
altruistic behavior releases

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.780
endorphins, also known
as the helper's high.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.830
So giving your users
the opportunity

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.740
to help others, no
matter how indirectly,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.590
can really tap into
their drive for purpose.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.750
The yoga app,
Yogaia, really cares

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.910
about getting more
users to attend

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.190
their online live classes.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.710
And so what they did
was they ran an A/B test

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.780
with this in-app messaging here.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.000
And essentially, what
they're asking is,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.770
if you attend this
live class, we

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.200
are going to donate
money to charity.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.410
And in fact, this actually
gave them a 9% uplift

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.700
in class attendance.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.230
And also, goal setting goes
hand-in-hand with our desire

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.340
for mastery.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.530
And I'm sure many
app developers here

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.290
are helping their
users reach new goals.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.440
And so I'm going to now talk
through two different examples

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.069
of app developers who are using
these types of game elements

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.819
and seeing great success
in terms of user retention.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.250
So the hiking app, ViewRanger--

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.609
they have allowed users to
sign up for in-app challenges

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.650
to hike more, to cycle more.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.800
And when they did some analysis,
the users that had signed up

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.980
for these challenges were
actually four times as active

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.330
within the ViewRanger app
than those who hadn't.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.470
There's also the Smoke Free app.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.440
Now, they did an
A/B test offering

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:47.260
50% of users daily missions, and
the other 50% didn't get access

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.790
to any daily missions.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.590
And what's really
amazing here is

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.100
that the users who saw the
daily missions within the app

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.390
were twice as likely
to quit smoking

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.680
after three months, so really
powerful motivational stuff

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.700
there.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.410
And so I want to
take a step back now.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.310
Think back to that user behavior
you had identified earlier.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:11.010
Are you using rewards to
effectively drive this?

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.690
I'm going to now share with
you a hierarchy of rewards.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.260
This is devised by the
gamification consultant,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.610
Gabe Zichermann.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.870
And it helps to suggest the
order of rewards and how costly

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.360
they are or how powerful
they are at driving

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.160
loyalty and retention.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.430
And so you can see at the
very bottom of this is stuff.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.600
Stuff is things like cash,
gift cards, freebies.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.950
So why is this the least
powerful when so many of us

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.840
offer discounts and freebies
to try and incentivize people?

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.040
And one of the reasons
could be that they neglect

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.200
what genuinely motivates us.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.510
If you go back to the idea
of the RAMP framework,

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.767
relatedness, autonomy,
mastery, purpose--

00:18:51.767 --> 00:18:53.850
getting these one-time
rewards doesn't necessarily

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.290
tap into that long term.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.050
And again, while
money and cash can

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.990
be sufficient to drive
short term behavior change,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.930
it can very quickly lose its
power because people quickly

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.030
come to expect the
reward every time they

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.220
take that particular action.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.890
And often, you have to give
more to get them to be motivated

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.000
to act the second time.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.060
So what I would
suggest from this slide

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.050
is rewarding your users with
more meaningful rewards.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.660
So if we look at
status, how can you

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.860
make your most engaged
users feel like VIPs?

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.610
What are the different
perks that they can

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.100
get that other users might not?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.080
And then if we
think about access,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.940
what are the features
within your app that

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.529
maybe are exclusively
accessible to certain users?

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:38.070
And that could be
a more powerful way

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.990
of engaging them
and actually keeping

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.170
them retained for longer.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.080
So I'm sure many of you in the
audience are game developers.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.570
And you know that game
elements, as I said before,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.240
do not in and of themselves
create engagement.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.210
So I wanted to leave you
with a cautionary tale.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.180
So points and badges,
they're great.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.250
However, if they
don't genuinely map

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.360
to what really
motivates your users,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.980
and if they don't symbolize
hard-earned achievements,

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.920
then they're not going to
sufficiently motivate users.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.470
And if anything, what they
might actually do is make

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.200
them feel like they're being
bribed to act in some way.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.400
And this can lead
to user frustration.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.970
So take a look at this
Play Store app rating

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.710
of a particular developer.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.020
When they implemented
a points-based system,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.650
they quickly saw a dramatic
decrease in the average rating.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.840
Because even though
they had implemented

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.380
the elements themselves, they
hadn't necessarily connected it

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.980
to what motivated those users.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.020
So you've thought of
the behavior change you

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.670
wanted to see in your users.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.580
We've talked about how you
can simplify the behavior, how

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.850
you can trigger,
and then also, how

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.890
you can connect that
behavior to something

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.110
they find intrinsically
rewarding.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.030
So I'm now going to
hand over to Sami,

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.880
who will reveal how The
Fabulous app successfully

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.890
drives behavior change
not just within the app,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.450
but also within their
users' everyday lives.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.749
Thank you.

00:21:00.749 --> 00:21:02.040
SAMI BEN HASSINE: Thanks, Jeni.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.920
Hi, everyone So I'm the
co-founder and CEO of Fabulous.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.180
Fabulous is an app that helps
you build healthy routines

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.650
into your life.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.230
We are incubated at Duke
University and the Center

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.620
for Advanced Hindsight, which
is a lab led by Dan Ariely,

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.410
professor of behavior economics,
and the author of the book

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.130
"Predictably Irrational."

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.410
So I'd like to frame
this presentation

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.372
around this framework
that you have developed

00:21:31.372 --> 00:21:32.830
at the lab that
could help you make

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.640
better decisions in your app.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.300
So first of all, think
about the behavior.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.750
What's the exact behavior that
you want your user to achieve?

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.330
Then think about the barriers.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.180
What are the elements that
could prevent your user

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.290
from achieving this behavior?

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.500
And finally, think
about the benefits.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.230
What do I gain once I
achieve that behavior?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.896
So let's quickly jump
into one example.

00:21:56.896 --> 00:21:58.270
This is the first
screen that you

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.490
used to get when
you opened Fabulous.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.680
And as you can see,
it looks pretty good.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.540
Let's get Fabulous.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.581
What's your most important
health goal right now?

00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:09.400
Then you can choose to feel
more energized, to sleep better.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.510
Looks pretty well.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.500
But there is one big
problem with this screen.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.000
I'll give you just a few
seconds to think it out.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.450
So the problem with the
screen was the question

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.010
that we were asking.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.500
What's your most important
health goal right now?

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.410
So when users read this, they
started asking themselves

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.090
all sorts of questions.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.160
Can I make the wrong choice?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.940
Can I change my opinion later?

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.090
What if I want to
change my goal?

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.170
So one simple change that
we did is just asking them

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.300
which goal would you
like to start with.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.670
And now, we are giving
them the permission

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.780
to change their minds later.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.010
And this has uplifted the
onboarding completion rate

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.250
by 15%.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.670
So we wanted to go
even further than this,

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.530
and we started limiting
the options as well,

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.350
like providing them
with a default option.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.460
And this again has increased
the retention on day one.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.050
So here's a tip.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.360
Your user is using
your app, and he's

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.450
asking himself all sorts
of questions all the time.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.280
Can I put my credit
card information?

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.690
Is it secure enough?

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.770
So try to answer all these
questions for the user.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.420
Try always to provide the
answer, so that the user

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.770
doesn't feel frustrated.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.990
Because otherwise, if
he starts asking himself

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.510
too many questions, he
will just close the app.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.220
So to tell you a little
bit about Fabulous.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.710
In Fabulous, we aim to help
you build a morning routine.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.320
And in our opinion, this
is a good morning routine.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.250
You wake up.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.420
You drink water.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.930
You exercise a little bit,
and then for some people,

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.640
you would eat a great breakfast.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.004
In order to get you to do this,
this is how we used to do it.

00:23:47.004 --> 00:23:48.170
This was the old onboarding.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.730
So you would get
to the screen where

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.680
you have all these
habits, and then

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.630
everything else is
in and out, and you

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.940
need to tap on Drink Water.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.550
So we were forcing
the users to do this.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.640
And I have to tell
you, they were really

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.150
frustrated about this.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.030
They thought that we
were forcing them.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.670
They even sent us
this kind of email.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.950
You betrayed my trust when I
had great expectations for you.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.290
Well, how can we solve this?

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.010
Let's go back to these
ideas of behavior economics.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.220
Let's first start
with the behavior.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.590
What's the behavior that
you are trying to achieve?

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.770
Feeling more energized--
well, that's not the behavior,

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:29.270
actually.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.830
That's the outcome.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.000
If you want to think
about the behavior,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.860
think about the exact steps
that your user needs to take.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.620
In our case, it's waking
up in the morning,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.420
reaching out to my
bottle of water,

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.870
and then drinking water, and
taking some time to feel great.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.680
The behavior is not the outcome.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.070
And then let's get to the
second step, the barriers.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.530
I want to drink water,
or I don't want.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.130
What are the barriers?

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.080
So we conducted a user survey.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.920
And these were the
three main obstacles.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.350
I'm not convinced that
I need to drink water.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.430
I want to drink water, but
I don't have water at reach.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.060
Or I'm just not very committed.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.800
Let's try to solve this.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.100
This is the new onboarding.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.910
The new onboarding, instead
of asking you to drink water,

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.900
we start by asking
you a few questions.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.560
Do you want to build a habit
of exercising in the morning?

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.760
Some people might say yes.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.240
Some people might say no.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.419
Then, do you want to
build the habit of eating

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:28.710
great breakfast in the morning?

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.030
Same, some people might say yes.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.071
Some people might say no.

00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:33.900
And then we ask you the most
important question for us.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.730
Do you want to drink
water in the morning?

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.930
So this seems very easy related
to the three other goals.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.120
It's just drinking water.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.720
So even if I said no to
the two other questions,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.710
I'm going to say yes.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.480
Almost 99% of the
people are going

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.970
to say yes, I want to
drink water in the morning.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.840
And in this case, it was
your choice, actually.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.530
It was something that
you choose to do.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.240
It's not us forcing this on you.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.470
Now, let's think about
the second barrier.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.370
I'm not very committed.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.110
I don't feel very
committed to this.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.940
Well, what you can
do in this case

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.120
is using what we call in
behavior clinics implementation

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.130
intention, which is
simply asking the user.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.390
Do you commit to
drink water tomorrow?

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.520
And you can even
enhance this effect

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.920
by using what we
call active choice.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.600
Active choice means
that you're going

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.570
to reframe the yes question
as something very positive

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.740
for your user, like--

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.560
I want to drink water and
feel great about myself.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.920
And then you frame the
negative answer as something

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.250
not that good.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.120
I don't want to drink water.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.940
I don't care about my health.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.230
So here's another way in
which you can do this.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.210
As you know, we're all
trying to get our users

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.830
to invite their friends.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.570
And generally, we
would ask them.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.700
Please invite your
friends to our app.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.155
That's something really great.

00:26:48.155 --> 00:26:49.900
It will make us happy.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.680
But generally, users
will just turn away.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.610
So another way of doing
this is, first of all,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.036
by stating the benefits.

00:26:58.036 --> 00:26:59.660
If you invite your
friends to Fabulous,

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.270
you are much more likely
to complete your habits.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.970
And then second of all,
let's use the active choice.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.090
So here we provide them
with three choices.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.240
Two of them are positive.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.380
One is negative.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.160
One of them is--

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.340
I'd like to invite my friend
to join me on this journey.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.370
I want to invite my friend to
monitor me on this journey.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.070
And then the third choice is--

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.505
I'll do it on my own.

00:27:19.505 --> 00:27:21.820
It's a little bit
negative, actually.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.790
So always answer this
question for the user.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.170
What is in it for me?

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.510
What do I gain out
of doing this action?

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.980
Always provide the benefits.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.890
Go through the copy of your
app, and state everything

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.920
as benefits, not as goals,
not as objectives, but as

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.530
benefits for the final user.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.050
Now, here's a bonus one.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.120
You can get your user
to commit even more

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.700
by using what we call a
commitment contract, which

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.780
is simply asking the
user to commit to a place

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.210
and time in which they are
more likely to accomplish

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.930
that behavior.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.340
And then you would ask them
to sign up with their name.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.890
This is called the
commitment contract.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.000
Now, let's think about
the next barrier.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.950
Well, I want to drink
water, but I just

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.590
don't have water at reach.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.420
If you think about
your users, they

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.540
are much more likely
to commit to your app

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.070
when they first opened the
app or when they have just

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.810
completed one milestone.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.750
So this is the best
time for you to ask

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.460
for even more engagement.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.760
In our case, after they commit,
we're going to ask them--

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.910
would you like us to
send a reminder tonight

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.640
so that you put your water
bottle by your bedside?

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.420
This is beneficial
for the users.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.320
So they are really
likely to say yes.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.380
If you are a finance app,
this could be the right moment

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.840
to ask them to set
up automatic saving.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.060
If you are Google Photo,
this is the right time

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.700
to ask for auto backup
of your pictures.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.700
So think about one
action in your app

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.090
that could really lead
to much more engagement.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.310
Think about ways to
make it automated,

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.610
and then ask the user to
commit to this on high points,

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.640
either on the onboarding or
just after they successfully

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.830
completed the milestone
within your app.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.240
So now lets get to the third
part, the benefits part.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.000
What do I gain out
of doing all of this?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.190
Well, this is an interesting
one, because, of course,

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.870
it's changing from
one app to the next.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:18.800
If you are a weight loss app,
it's very easy for the user

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.660
to know that they
have gained something.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.820
They will just weigh
themselves one week in,

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.520
and they would see if this
has been beneficial or no.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.130
So in the case of Fabulous,
since we didn't have that,

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.510
we thought about this idea.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.410
So each time that you
complete your habits,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.250
we are going to ask you to
take some time to celebrate,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.690
to feel good about yourself.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.010
You need something tangible
to provide for the user

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.140
after a few days of
usage so that they

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.730
understand that they are gaining
something out of your app.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.220
And here is a good
way to think about it.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.840
Let's suppose that
they keep using

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.850
your app for a few months.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.980
How's this going to
transform my life?

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.590
Now, take all these
benefits and make

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.010
them immediate and salient.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.090
Tell the user-- this
is what you are gaining

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.410
on every step of the way.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.650
So here it is.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:10.550
We have now applied the three
tenets of behavior economics.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.590
First of all, we started
with the outcome.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.870
We want the user to
feel more energized,

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.470
and from there, we got the exact
behavior that we need to apply.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:22.550
I want to wake up and reach
out to my bottle of water.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.920
And then we conducted
a user survey

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.480
to know about the barriers.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.450
And some people are
not committed enough.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.940
In this case, we used what
we call the implementation

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.130
intention in order to
get them to commit.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.140
Some people didn't
have water at reach.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.130
So we used the
active choice idea

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.470
in order to get us to send
them a gentle reminder

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.510
that same night for
them to put a water

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.640
bottle by their bedside.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.850
And then we have provided
them with a tangible benefit

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.640
by asking them to
celebrate for a few minutes

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.930
their achievements.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.420
Hope this has been useful.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.940
Thanks, and back to Jeni.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.250
JENI FISHER: Thank
you very much.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.950
So I want just to recap.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.780
If you go back to
that one key behavior

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.630
you identified at the
beginning of this talk,

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.030
I really hope that you
found something inspiring

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.059
from both mine and
Sami's session,

00:31:12.059 --> 00:31:13.600
and that you already
have great ideas

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.225
of how you are going
to implement these

00:31:15.225 --> 00:31:17.530
into your own app.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.309
And so once you
have done that, I'd

00:31:19.309 --> 00:31:21.100
love it if you could
share with us your app

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.180
techniques via Twitter using
the hashtag #appengagement

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.480
and to keep in touch with us
about Google Play in general

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.290
as well.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:31.990
Please stay up to date
via these links here.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.680
And as I've mentioned before,
the medium.com/googleplaydev is

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.710
another great resource
for best practices.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.930
So I hope you really
enjoyed today's session.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:45.290
Thank you so much for listening,
and if you have any questions,

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.410
please go ahead and
step up to the mic.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.968
Thank you.

00:31:48.968 --> 00:31:51.902
