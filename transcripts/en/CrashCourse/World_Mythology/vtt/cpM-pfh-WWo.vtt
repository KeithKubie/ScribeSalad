Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.100
This is Crash Course Mythology and today, we're going to talk about

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.400
symbols, dreams and a couple of very busty figurines.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.620
It's the great mother goddess.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.600
Are you excited Thoth?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.099
Yeah, I know, you don't have a mother, you created yourself, but come on!

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.070
She's the best!

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.440
Unless, of course, she doesn't exist and if that's the case, what do I do with all of these great goddess mother's day cards?

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.700
The mother goddess is an archetype.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.580
Psychology fans will know about archetypes from the work of Carl Jung, who saw the repeated patterns in myths

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.960
as emanations of what he dubbed humanity's collective unconscious,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.080
meaning the symbols and ideas that all

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.000
humans share simply as a result of being human.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.400
Archetypes can be used to explain why the same

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.440
patterns emerge in different myths from different places throughout the world.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.119
Some of the archetypes that repeat all willy-nilly are the dying God, the destroyer God,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.120
the trickster and the primordial pairing of the sky and the earth. Hey Sky Dad, hey Earth Mom.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.340
The archetypes we'll be examining in the next few episodes are just those:

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.740
the Father Creator and the Great Mother.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.490
Ugh, cosmic parents. I mean I guess the upside is that if you have to move back in with them after graduation their basement is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.479
literally infinite

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.899
Downside being of course that it is also literally Hades.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.259
We're doing an episode on female divinity before archetypal male divinity because there are some theories that Earth mom

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.279
actually did come first. As I pointed out most human societies are patriarchal and have been for a long

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.159
long time, but certain historians,

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:50.659
sociologists, archaeologists, literary critics and mythologists have argued that in prehistoric times human societies were more

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.409
matrifocal, less violent and more cooperative. The idea that human societies began as matrifocal and goddess

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.369
oriented goes back a long long way, with scholars asserting that many if not most primitive societies featured a religion

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.638
that was based around ideas of fertility and motherhood.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.499
According to mythologists Scott Leonard and Michael McClure, "Throughout the 19th and 20th

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.950
centuries the literature of several disciplines took for granted

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.600
the existence of primal mother or great goddess and further assumed that her religion and the societies

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.179
based upon it were part of the primitive past from which man

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.309
happily escaped through the logocentric power of intellect." Yeah, that's right

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.419
We reasoned ourselves right out of peace, fertility and harmony. Good going, human mind. A leading proponent of the great goddess

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.650
theory was Maria Gimbutas who connected

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.550
archaeology to the women's movement

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.520
and who probably would have liked it a lot if you put the Venus of Willendorf on your sign at the woman's march.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.589
Those involved with the goddess movement of which Gimbutas was a leader saw in this mother-centric religion "an appealing alternative to the brutality,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.940
materialism, spiritual bankruptcy and ecological shortsightedness of modern patriarchal social systems."

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.019
Whoa, tell us what you really think. The goddess movement is a very cool idea

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.200
but it does have a couple problems. For one: It's based a lot on images like this one. Hey, there

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.559
she is again, the Venus of Willendorf. Sort of makes you feel more fertile already.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.550
But here's the thing. The discovery of female figures like the Venus of Willendorf

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.470
was taken as evidence of religious practices that focus on the fertility aspects of the female,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.100
but there's no real proof that figurines like these were part of any worship or ritual at all

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.390
Maybe they were just sexy lawn ornaments. There are problems with creating a picture of

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.429
female-centric social organizations based on figures like this that signified fertility and magical desires for successful births.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.470
Also, we've discovered lots of female figurines and not all of them have the...

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.399
attributes associated with fertility and not all the figurines are female; many of them are male, a lot of them are even

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.630
androgynous. This lack of gender specificity points to what might be the biggest challenge to the goddess school. It relies on

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.910
modern gender binaries and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.450
stereotyping. "Supporters of the goddess movement reversed the values of male-dominated Victorian

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.899
era science, which saw women as primitive, natural beings separate from an inferior to, rational men,

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.430
never questioning

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.220
whether our prehistoric forebears imposed the same

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.970
male-female polarities

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.459
upon their world or held the same assumption about the erotic and to the symbolic as we do." This is a good reminder that we

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.040
always need to be aware of how we are imposing our own beliefs and values on history and prehistory

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.369
And if I can impose my own values for a second, yes,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.349
Victorian science is the worst. So, maybe you believe in a fertile, peaceful,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.760
paleolithic, matriarchal world order that spawned great goddess myths around the world,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.000
maybe you don't, but there stories of goddesses from everywhere at all times

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.480
and they share some

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.480
similarities. One of the most common literary

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.120
ideas is that of the triple goddess, which Robert Graves wrote about in his book, The White Goddess. An

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.370
influential typology, the triple goddess sorts goddesses into one of three types:

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.210
virgin, mother, and crone. If you find this virgin, mother, crone thing troubling, you are not alone;

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.440
It's a system that sees women through the eyes of men and basically categorizes them on whether they're sexy, and since that is

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.990
uncomfortable-making, we're going to look at the basic roles of goddesses in myths in the terms used by Maria Gimbutas: life, death, and

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:40.250
regeneration. Goddesses of life are maternal, often associated with the life-giving Earth. The Greek Gaia is a prime example,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.549
although there aren't a lot of myths about her specifically.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.590
She's often supplanted by Demeter. Sometimes these life-giving goddesses are associated with primeval

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.049
creation like Tiamat in the Sumerian creation

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.910
stories, or Cipactli, the great goddess of Mexico who swam through the primordial waters of chaos in the form of an enormous

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:07.040
crocodile, which seems like a pretty sweet way to travel. Life-giving goddesses are occasionally seen as protectors as well as nurturers.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.270
An example is the Persian goddess Anahita, who was sometimes depicted in armor,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.989
sometimes as a nurturing mother and who was said to have power over the water; in dry-as-heck with two hockey sticks Persia,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.989
Water mom brings forth and preserves life and, as moms often do, also probably reminds you to shower.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.149
Goddesses of death are often seen as queens of the underworld, like Persephone, whom we've met, and

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.449
Isis who was able to resurrect her husband Osiris. In these roles great goddesses control the cycles of growth,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.740
decay and rebirth:

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:44.060
the seasons. One of the goddesses we met in an earlier episode Izanami died and went to the underworld after giving birth to fire.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.219
Her husband Izanagi went to look for her, but, finding her as a rotting corpse, was

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.620
terrified, so he ran away.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.040
I mean,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.609
can you blame him? Izanami considered this a divorce, which also seems reasonable, and so she returned to the underworld.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.530
On occasion, goddesses associated with death are portrayed as witches or seers,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.569
often appearing as wise old women, like the Greek witch Hecate, who is sometimes said to have three heads: a snake's, a

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.809
horse's and a dog's, making her a one-goddess petting zoo. Death goddesses are also often associated with fate,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.750
apportioning a person's life, ordaining health, disease,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.459
prosperity and suffering. The Greek Moirai and the Norse Norns were goddesses of this type. And finally, goddesses of regeneration

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.409
often relate to sexuality in myths, appearing as virgins or nymphs.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.359
Sometimes they're also responsible for creativity: according to Leonard and McClure, their pulsing

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.090
Sexual energies impel mortal creation to renew itself, and thus their influence redeems

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.410
individual mortality through beauty, passion, and offspring." Pulsing sexual energy? Oof, is it getting hot in here or

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:57.309
is it just these mother goddesses? One other interesting thing about goddesses of regeneration: they seem to have a tendency to bestow their favors on

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:04.269
mortal men and that just does not seem to work out. For example: We're going to go somewhere we haven't visited yet:

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.450
Ireland. Take us there, Thought Bubble. One Irish

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:15.010
regeneration goddess is Nimah of the Golden Hair, whose name means beauty. Nimah was the daughter of the sea and

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:23.109
Tir-Nan-Og, the land of the blessed. One day Nimah stole the poet Oisin away from his people and brought him to Tir-Nan-Og,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.179
where they lived together as lovers for what turned out to be a very long time.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.500
While he was with her, Oisin remained young and virile.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:38.229
Enchanted as he was, Oisin forgot about his people who continued to age and to die as

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:42.399
mortals tend to do. He stayed at Tir-Nan-Og for centuries,

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.239
and really, it's tough to blame him, but Oisin became homesick.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.270
Eventually Nimah grew tired of his complaining

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:54.489
so she sent him home on a magical horse with a warning not to dismount.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.640
But as soon as the magical steed touched human soil,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:05.020
the saddle buckle broke and Oisin fell to the ground. In an instant, all of the centuries that Oisin had spent on the isle of

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.789
the blessed caught up with him, and he grew old and died. Strangely

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:16.780
there's an almost identical story from Japan. In this one the sea goddess Oto-Hime falls in love with a mortal fisherman and

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:24.529
takes him to her palace under the sea. After a few days of romance, the fisherman starts to worry about the people he left at home.

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:26.000
He begs Oto-Hime

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.929
to let him return and she agrees, but only if he promises to carry a tiny box to the surface and

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.970
never open it.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.850
So, you see where this is going; hundreds of years had passed, not just a few days, and guess what?

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.060
He opens the box. All of the years that had passed

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:49.729
surround him like a mist, and his body withers into dust. Thanks for that Thought Bubble, that was...

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.950
uplifting? So great mother goddesses can create the world and grant you

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.789
fertility and peace and equality and all that other good stuff,

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.219
or they can steal you away from your home, ravish you for a couple centuries and then turn your body into dust. That's part of what

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.700
makes great goddesses so powerful. No matter what form they take,

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:11.059
they're usually multifaceted. Unlike some gods

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:18.079
I could name. *cough* Zeus. Great goddesses are almost always complex and contradictory, which is the way we like it here at Crash Course.

00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:22.519
I'm definitely sending that mother's day card now. Thanks for watching, we'll see you next time
