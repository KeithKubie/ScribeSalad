[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.140
-In the beginning,
"Hand to God" announced

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.000
it was coming to Broadway.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.560
We didn't have any movie stars.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.170
We weren't adapted from a film
or any of those guaranteed

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.495
money makers. (SHOUTING)
It was suicide.

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.631
(CALMLY) But "Hand of God"
opened, and we got amazing

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.130
reviews.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.930
I mean look at of these
things, and that one, god.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.110
And audiences are losing
their freakin' minds over it.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.070
How do you like
me now, Broadway?

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.243
"Hand to God" on Broadway, for
tickets visit telecharge.com.

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:43.130
[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.310
ALAN SEALES: So please
welcome the cast, playwright,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.535
and producer of "Hand to God."

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:51.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.044 --> 00:00:57.710
Now, if you guys don't mind, for
those of you who don't know you

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.640
are, please go down the
line and introduce yourself.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.300
BOB SAGET: My name is Bob.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.716
I'm single.

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:11.240
I'm not in a program, and I'm
fortunate to be in the part

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.420
that Marc Kudisch originated
in this amazing play

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.620
with these amazing,
brilliant people

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.300
that I can't believe
I'm having such

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.712
a wonderful experience with.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.420
And I hope to see you
all at summer camp.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.940
I could have gone out stronger.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.200
I'll tell the aristocrats joke.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.754
Thank you.

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:30.170
ALAN SEALES: We'll
come back that.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.850
BOB SAGET: I'll see you later.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.960
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.620
ROB ASKINS: He was asked to
say his name and who he plays.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.745
BOB SAGET: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:37.953
ROB ASKINS: Oh, there you go.

00:01:37.953 --> 00:01:38.555
There you go.

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:39.430
My name's Rob Askins.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.130
I wrote the play.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.550
BOB SAGET: Say more, come on.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.966
ROB ASKINS: I'm
going to say more.

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:44.940
I'm not as interesting.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.990
STEVEN BOYER: There's
plenty of time.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.640
ROB ASKINS: Oh, come on,
please, let's me on to this guy.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.480
He's so well dressed.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.105
LUCAS MCMAHON: My name is Lucas
McMahon, the associate producer

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:52.690
of the show.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.800
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
I'm Michael Oberholtzer.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.870
I play a character named Timmy.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.830
SARAH STILES: Sarah
Stiles-- I play Jessica.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.955
STEVEN BOYER: Steven Boyer.

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:01.122
I play Jason and Tyrone.

00:02:01.122 --> 00:02:02.580
GENEVA CARR: I'm
Geneva Carr, and I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.995
play Jason's mother, Marjorie.

00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:07.900
BOB SAGET: Do we
go back to me now?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.240
ALAN SEALES: If you want
to continue the joke, yeah.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.000
ROB ASKINS: Do you want to give
my portion of the interview?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.590
BOB SAGET: No.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.921
ROB ASKINS: Will you
ask him my questions?

00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:17.420
ALAN SEALES: All right, Rob,
where did the idea for the play

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.170
come from?

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.160
BOB SAGET: I can't talk anymore.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.830
ROB ASKINS: I grew up in Texas.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.215
My mother had a Christian
puppet ministry.

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:27.470
ALAN SEALES: Oh, that's real?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.590
ROB ASKINS: That
is a real thing.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.920
It was not like the Christian
puppet ministry in the play,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.830
thank god.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.330
And I've been dealing
for a long time

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.160
with self-destructive behaviors.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.115
And I'm still dealing with
self-destructive behaviors.

00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:45.740
ALAN SEALES: You say
that so ominously.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.500
ROB ASKINS: Huh?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.465
ALAN SEALES: You're like--

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:48.573
ROB ASKINS: I believe in tone.

00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:50.310
ALAN SEALES: Oh,
should I interview you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.059
like this the whole
time? (STRONG VOICE) I

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.620
should interview
very dangerously.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.100
ROB ASKINS: Yeah, let's
do it Charlie Rose style.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.461
ALAN SEALES: All right, cool.

00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.210
ROB ASKINS: And so I
was looking for a way

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.850
to acknowledge
self-defeating behaviors,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.980
and I was looking
for a way to do it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.108
that would be cuddly
and easily marketable.

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:06.399
GENEVA CARR: Easily marketable?

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550
ROB ASKINS: I'm so
glad they're behind me.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.090
This is the best set up ever.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.590
STEVEN BOYER: Is
your microphone on?

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.720
ROB ASKINS: I don't think
so, but I can project.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.845
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, it's on.

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:20.470
I hear him.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.400
ROB ASKINS: And so I drew on my
past as a Christian puppeteer

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.510
and as somebody who
liked to break things.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.190
And then I saw the
very talented people

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.550
behind me standing
together at a party.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.100
And I said, they are the
people that can bring those two

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.920
opposing forces--

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.510
STEVEN BOYER: Like
those two drunk people

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.767
can really bring this to life.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.350
ROB ASKINS: Right,
I saw them fighting

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.705
in an alley over a doughnut.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.010
And somebody took off a sock.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.550
And then the rest
is on Broadway.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.877
ALAN SEALES: So your past
as an actual pupeteer--

00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:02.960
I was going to ask where
Tyrone came from in terms

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.120
of being at a puppet versus a
real flesh-and-blood person,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.400
like another actor on stage.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.560
So it was your
past experience as

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.150
an actual Christian puppeteer?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.066
ROB ASKINS: As an actual
Christian puppeteer--

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:18.070
also, I think a lot of brother
plays are divided self plays.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.357
I think Sam Shepard's "True
West" is a divided self play.

00:04:22.357 --> 00:04:24.190
I think obviously
Shakespeare's twin plays--

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.740
there are a lot of twin plays.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.430
I think a lot of that has to do
with most of the time character

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.460
and personality or horse shit.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.689
Like, we have so many voices
inside of us at all times.

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.480
BOB SAGET: Are you
putting down horse shit?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.740
ROB ASKING: Yes, sir.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.150
And so I was like, oh,
well, let's acknowledge

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.846
the war within the individual.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:45.470
And so a puppet's a
great way to do it.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.310
BOB SAGET: Wow, can
I ask a question?

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.870
Did you live this
childhood a little bit

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.454
of what Jason, Stephen's
character, goes through?

00:04:53.454 --> 00:04:54.870
ROB ASKINS: It's
a great question.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.520
There are some scenes
in the play that

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.550
are ripped from
the headlines that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.900
are very accurate and painful.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.360
BOB SAGET: And you used
humor to get through it?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.490
ROB ASKINS: If you
could say that this

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.260
is getting through it, yeah.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.590
BOB SAGET: I didn't
mean-- I didn't mean this.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.230
ROB ASKINS: I'll lean
the fuck in, man.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.185
I'm not scared.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.560
BOB SAGET: Oh, I
know you're not.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.390
ROB ASKINS: I'll
lean the fuck in.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.306
I'm about to fall over
I'm leaning in so hard.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.750
ALAN SEALES: So the show
pokes fun at, I guess,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.125
several well-known
organizations,

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.260
like Sesame Street, and
actually, it sort of

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.250
spoofs "Avenue Q," which
is a spoof in itself.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.140
ROB ASKINS: Never heard of it.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.890
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.074
And, of course,
religion-- I mean, is that

00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:40.490
my personal
interpretation, or was

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.323
that intentional that
you kind of wrapped it

00:05:42.323 --> 00:05:43.550
all together like that?

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.459
ROB ASKINS: Religion spoofs
itself a lot of the time.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:47.500
ALAN SEALES: Fair enough.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.971
ROB ASKINS: We don't
have to reach real far

00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:51.220
to put some spin on that ball.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.290
But at the same time-- I
love the smattering giggles.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.490
Those are my favorite.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.620
I can't get through
the goddamn lines.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.000
But at the same time,
there is much good,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.730
and there is much
worthy and much worth

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.250
focusing attention
and human interest.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.540
So I think in the same way
that personality and character

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.810
sometimes are our
strategies, so too

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.470
is an opinion on something
as complex as the human

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.410
relationship to the divine.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.240
And sometimes it takes
both laughter and tears

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.484
to get at it.

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.650
ALAN SEALES: I'm going to
let that sit for a second.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.240
That's good.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.330
Lucas, how did you get involved,
in the first place, yourself?

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.930
LUCAS MCMAHON: So
I actually deserve

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.390
no personal credit for it.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.430
The lead producer of the
show, Kevin McCollum,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.370
who I work with, but
couldn't be here today

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.340
because he's in Washington,
DC for the opening

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.980
of "Motown, the Musical," which
is another one of our shows

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.930
which is coming back to
Broadway this summer.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.650
And I mention it
only because I'm

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.620
hoping for another free
meal in your cafeteria,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.550
but, anyway, he's there.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.320
So he actually saw the play at
the Ensemble Studio Theater,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.370
the roots of which Rob
and Steven and Geneva

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.080
can talk a little
bit more about.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.530
But he, I think, recognized
the real brilliance

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.730
of this playwright right
here and these actors,

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.180
and saw something really
unique and that needed

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.100
to be seen by as many people.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.680
Commercial theater
is about bringing

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.400
the work of really great
artists to as many people

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.910
as possible and as many
places as possible.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.210
And so Kevin, who has also
produced "Rent" and "Avenue

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.330
Q" and "In the Heights,"
so a bunch of big flops.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.830
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.710
GENEVA CARR: No
vision, that guy.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.940
LUCAS MCMAHON: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.480
Really fell in love
with this show.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.510
I started working with
Kevin about six months

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.000
after that, when he had been
developing the show with Rob

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.810
and Moritz, the Director.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.430
And then we brought the
show to MCC theater,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.810
which is a wonderful off
Broadway theater company.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.320
Yes, it deserves a
big round of applause.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.630
Steven and Geneva were
in the show off-off

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.480
Broadway at Ensemble
Studio Theater,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.110
and then Sarah and Michael
joined the show at MCC,

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:16.520
as well as a new design team
and a bunch of other people

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.640
who came together to bring
you the production that

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.350
is now on Broadway today.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:27.140
We opened in February
of 2014 at MCC,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.970
down at the Lucille
Lortel theater.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.770
And we're very blessed to
receive a wonderful reception

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.850
from the audiences
and the critics.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:40.130
And then moved to the show to
the main stem, to Broadway.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.520
So that's kind of
a brief history

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.070
of how the show came together
and moved to the Booth Theater

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.430
where it is today.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.090
ALAN SEALES: So
Steven and Geneva,

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.000
you guys have been around, you
said, from the very beginning,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.499
right?

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:53.500
I'm looking behind me.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.060
I've got to move back.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.768
STEVEN BOYER: Hi.

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.520
ALAN SEALES: Sorry, camera guys.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.154
There we go.

00:08:57.154 --> 00:08:59.570
Yes, so you guys have been
around from the very beginning.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.244
So how have you seen this
show like evolve over time?

00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:04.160
STEVEN BOYER: Take it.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.590
GENEVA CARR: Oy, well,
this is actually,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.235
I would say that it's the fourth
production that Steven and I

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:10.526
have done together of the show.

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.270
Because the original
show that we did,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.550
we did several readings
of "Hand to God"

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.990
because Rob wrote it in 2011.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.240
So we did several
readings of the play,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.270
and then we did a showcase at
Ensemble Studio Theater, which

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.132
is where you don't pay
the actors anything.

00:09:24.132 --> 00:09:25.840
They do it for free
because they love it.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.650
And we had hit on our hands.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:33.610
So they give us a mini contract,
so we did it at EST in 2012,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:39.060
and Kevin came to see it in
2011 and actually funded to 2012

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.250
production off-off Broadway.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.130
And that's one of
the amazing things

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.760
that I don't know if you know
that producers do, and Kevin

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.940
is the king of it, is
if he finds something,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.620
he'll work with it until
he thinks it's ready.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.700
So then he moved us to
MCC, which is off Broadway,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.700
and we got Sarah and Michael
and another actor Marc Kudisch

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.790
until we were lucky
enough to get Bob.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.610
BOB SAGET: I'm changing
my name to Kudisch.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.450
GENEVA CARR: Yeah, Bob Kudisch.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.040
So there so many things to say
about how a play gets developed

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.550
and how it's been for
me, but in a nutshell,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.190
the original reading with
Steven, it was a cold reading.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.940
And they said, hey,
we're just going to do

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.890
this reading of this play.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:16.810
Rob wrote this place.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.144
He thought of you two.

00:10:18.144 --> 00:10:19.560
ALAN SEALES:
[INAUDIBLE] the fight

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.810
in the alley about the donuts?

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.350
GENEVA CARR: Right, yeah, yeah--
yeah, we were dating-- no.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.350
No, no, that's not true.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.141
ALAN SEALES: Donut?

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.260
GENEVA CARR: So the
original reading,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.959
we show up to do
this reading, and do

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:33.750
for those of you who
haven't seen the play,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.050
it's really complicated.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.320
Forget the rape scenes.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.490
There's a puppet.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.930
And they were going to bring--

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.910
STEVEN BOYER: That's the
quote that's going to go out.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.920
The Google interview soundbite.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.660
ALAN SEALES: Forget
the rape scene.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.140
There's a puppet.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.598
STEVEN BOYER: Cast
of "Hand of God"

00:10:47.598 --> 00:10:49.320
says, forget the rape scene.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.110
There's a puppet.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.780
BOB SAGET: She did
say forget, though.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.590
GENEVA CARR: You can
edit this, right.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.415
ALAN SEALES: A little bit.

00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:04.790
STEVEN BOYER: Doesn't matter
what we talk about from here

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.289
on out.

00:11:05.289 --> 00:11:07.070
That's the pull quote.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.570
ROB ASKINS: They're just going
to cut out the word "forget,"

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.114
so it says, rape scene--
there's a puppet.

00:11:13.114 --> 00:11:14.780
BOB SAGET: Also it's
the strongest laugh

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.651
that's happened so far.

00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.250
It could be the whole clip.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.222
GENEVA CARR: Do you want
to take it from here?

00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:21.680
STEVEN BOYER: I
don't know what you

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.850
were-- where were you going?

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.850
GENEVA CARR: I was going to
tell a good story about you

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.050
about this original reading.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.600
STEVEN BOYER: Let's do it.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.300
GENEVA CARR: We do this reading.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:28.840
We show up.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.350
And they have said
to Steven, oh, hey,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.820
we're going to bring an oven
mitt because there's a puppet.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.150
So Stephen, who is
the true professional

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.030
that you see before you,
decided that wasn't good enough.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.300
So he googled easiest puppet
to make, which we sock puppet,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.710
and he showed up to this
cold read with a sock puppet.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.720
And from--

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.260
STEVEN BOYER: --with arms.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.530
GENEVA CARR: Yeah, with
arms with like little hanger

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.010
arms and lipstick and
eyeshadow, I remember.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.170
And he was two people, and
that's the trick of the show.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.980
The show is a lot of things.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.340
But he plays two
different people,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.970
totally different people, that
have scenes with each other,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.980
and it's astounding to see.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.790
So we did reading after
reading after reading,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.050
and it wasn't
until we met Moritz

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.400
that I knew we had the right
director because Moritz

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.590
loves a laugh, but he will
sacrifice a laugh for story.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.460
So all this time that
we've been moving

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.360
the play, the other
thing, Rob is not

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.890
afraid to make the play better.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.250
So I remember off Broadway,
our first 10 performances,

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.220
we had a different ending
every single night.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.010
I had to learn new
lines every single night

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.520
until we got it right.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.900
And then on Broadway,
the same things,

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.885
that Rob and Moritz were not
willing to sit on any laurels

00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:39.760
that they had gotten.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.070
They wanted to make the
show the best it could be.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.450
And it's been massaged
in such a way that

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.875
makes it what it is today.

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:47.750
STEVEN BOYER: That scared
the shit out of me.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.360
I'm always like,
everybody loves it.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.179
Don't touch it.

00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:53.220
I'm like, don't touch it.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.830
We don't know the weird
alchemy that makes this work,

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.630
so please don't touch a line.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.360
Like, I just really--
it's so frightening to me,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:07.300
but Rob and Moritz were brave
enough to like slash and burn

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:07.840
and--

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.680
SARAH STILES: Tell you
to shut up, do it--

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.263
STEVEN BOYER: Exactly, like, and
just like bring in new pages.

00:13:12.263 --> 00:13:14.222
And I'm like, I don't if
this is going to work.

00:13:14.222 --> 00:13:16.137
ROB ASKINS: Yeah, but
there's something great.

00:13:16.137 --> 00:13:18.090
Like, if we hadn't
had four productions--

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.179
do you know what I mean-- when
we were in a Broadway theater

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:23.845
that none of us thought
we'd ever be in?

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.250
STEVEN BOYER: Oh, yeah,
I mean, the stakes

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.680
kept getting higher and higher.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.780
ROB ASKINS: Right, and I'm
like, I got a new ending.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.945
And you're like,
fuck your new ending.

00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:33.820
GENEVA CARR: And I'm
like, I want to hear it.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.090
I want to hear it.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.300
ROB ASKINS: Right, you're like,
you can go fuck yourselves.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.440
I wish I had a trailer.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.030
But that's the thing.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.811
But then it was like, then
we all chilled the fuck out.

00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:47.810
Do you know what I mean?

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.635
And then the work got done.

00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:51.010
STEVEN BOYER: And
also what helps

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.150
is we put that ending up
in front of an audience,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.680
and we're like, oh, it's better.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.030
ROB ASKINS: Yeah.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.090
STEVEN BOYER:
Because the reaction

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.840
from the very beginning
in 2011 and 2012

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.900
was so above and
beyond, that it's

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.140
like this can't
possibly get better.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.570
And then it kept getting better.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.970
And that was beyond-- I didn't
think that was possible.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.220
GENEVA CARR: Yeah, me neither.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.850
LUCAS MCMAHON: But
the development

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.520
of new work and new
plays, that's something

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.936
that I think a lot
of people don't

00:14:20.936 --> 00:14:22.230
know how much goes into it.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.330
it's not just, if you create
something and people love it,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.200
it's how do we make
it even better.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.750
To paraphrase Jerome
Robbins, shows

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.190
are never finished, just
abandoned for lack of time.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.000
So I think the instinct
is always to keep working

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.370
and how do we make that
moment better and stronger.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.870
And so the tireless work
of everyone on this stage

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.940
that we get the play
that is before you today,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.600
which started in this
really incredible place.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.960
But I think where it ended
is even stronger and more

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.559
affecting for the audience.

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:57.850
ALAN SEALES: So the only
character not on stage with us

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.220
now, obviously, is Tyrone,
or I guess, arguably he is.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.149
But I want to roll
one video first off.

00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:04.440
We've got two videos of Tyrone.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.340
So I'll roll the first one
now to kind of give you

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.964
guys, if you haven't
seen the play yet,

00:15:07.964 --> 00:15:13.190
a little bit of intro into who
Tyrone is as the puppet here.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.620
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.120
-Tyrone's, he's
an amazing actor.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.850
-Genuinely honest on a stage.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.510
-He really likes to
think on his feet,

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.800
but he does have
some memory issues.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.065
-No, he drinks
everything-- bottled water.

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:32.940
-Definitely hungover.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.080
He's usually complaining
of a headache,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.100
and he seems really dehydrated.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.350
-Antifreeze.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.950
-He really wants to kiss me.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.847
-Nicotine oil.

00:15:40.847 --> 00:15:42.680
-When maybe he's been
drinking a little bit,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.340
those are kind of tough.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:45.845
-The drugs.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.330
Yeah, krokodil, have
you heard about that?

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.830
-Well, I'm sure you know,
he was a movie star,

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.200
and then his star
meter on IMD went rrr.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.220
-Krokodil, your skin
starts to peal off.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.670
It's from like Russia.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.110
-I don't like to use the
term sexual harassment, but--

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.510
-He has certain talents.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.250
One of those talents
is blackmail.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.280
-You know, we had words.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.130
He came at me.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.260
-Well, not like the devil,
but like an asshole.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.650
-I came at him.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.510
He drew a little bit of blood.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.790
-He has huge anger issues, but
that's what makes him so great,

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.050
you know?

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.555
-Tyrone, thanks for joining us.

00:16:25.555 --> 00:16:26.805
-Hey, thank you for having me.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.950
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.432
ALAN SEALES: So,
Steven, you showed up.

00:16:36.432 --> 00:16:38.890
So you read a script for the
cold reading, you were saying,

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.990
and you showed up with
your own handmade puppet.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.980
Was that--

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.105
STEVEN BOYER: That's right.

00:16:44.105 --> 00:16:45.780
I'm that guy.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.090
ALAN SEALES: Was that
your first, I guess,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.810
entry into
puppeteering, or did you

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.090
have any experience with that?

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.390
STEVEN BOYER: I'd done a show a
couple years before that called

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.520
"Jollyship The Whiz-Bang."

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.730
That's a pirate
puppet rock opera.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.855
I only do the most
fucked up plays.

00:17:00.762 --> 00:17:02.470
Yeah, that was by a
guy named Nick Jones.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.510
And that was the first time
I'd done anything with puppets,

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.109
but they were very
different from this.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.630
They weren't sock
puppets or whatever.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.069
So I kind of learned how to
do some sort of puppeteering

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.210
during that, a few years before
the first read through of this.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.001
ALAN SEALES: So what was your
process like for just learning

00:17:20.001 --> 00:17:20.500
the lines?

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.490
Because like the lines
come at you so fast.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.990
They're just whizzing by, and
it's like, you, hand, and you,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.615
hand, you hand.

00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:28.460
STEVEN BOYER: Well, I
mean, Jason and Tyrone

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.187
are written as--
I mean, you could

00:17:30.187 --> 00:17:31.270
look at it is a monologue.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.640
But it is written as
dialogue because they're

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.060
two separate characters
with completely different

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.470
personalities and brains.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:44.280
And you have to-- Jason and
Tyrone will cut each other off.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.490
They would be talking over
each other at the same time

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.350
if they could, but
all of the sound

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.260
is coming out of my mouth.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.890
We tried a music
stand for awhile

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.790
because I had no hands
to hold the pages,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.626
and that just--
it was very weird.

00:18:03.626 --> 00:18:05.500
I mean, there were like
a couple music stands

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.680
in different parts of the
stage, and I'd just be like,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.221
and I'd have to turn
the page, and be

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:12.661
like, I don't know where I am.

00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:15.380
It was basically like you just
had to learn the lines at home

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.202
and come in and when
rehearsal came around,

00:18:19.202 --> 00:18:20.410
it was just time to rehearse.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.255
ALAN SEALES: Did you start
slow and just like gradually

00:18:22.255 --> 00:18:22.755
speed up?

00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:26.330
STEVEN BOYER: No, I couldn't.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.960
It wouldn't work.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.710
Like it was-- I just dove in.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:37.261
I mean, it was--
it's-- yeah, I mean,

00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:38.760
like even when we
were at the table,

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.820
it was hard to read it
and not do the puppet--

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.410
the naked version of the
puppet, with like the bones,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.020
the bones of the puppet.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.140
This is me with no clothes.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.170
ALAN SEALES: Pixilated
puppet right here.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.350
STEVEN BOYER: We're going
to green screen that later.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.090
ALAN SEALES: That's right.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.130
STEVEN BOYER: But it was--
it's hard to explain,

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.960
but when you try
and break it down,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.560
sometimes we would try--
there's a scene between Jason

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.980
and Tyrone where Tyrone
wakes Jason up in bed.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.640
And there's a scene in
Jason's bedroom, where Tyrone

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.200
is kind of berating him and
telling him that he wants him

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.660
to like step up and be a man.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.650
And when I would run through
it just as Jason or just

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.940
as Tyrone, it just
didn't feel right

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:31.650
because they need each other,
and they're two split sides

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.020
of the same thing.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.640
And dividing them up,
it just felt wrong.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.679
ALAN SEALES: Which is harder for
you to play, Jason or Tyrone?

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.220
STEVEN BOYER: I
think, you know what?

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.640
I think Tyrone is actually
kind of closer to me.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.755
I am a small--

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:52.300 --> 00:20:00.610
I am a small, furry,
red-headed, disgusting--

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.990
with no pants or legs.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.510
But Jason-- the thing
is that Jason is so

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:13.410
sort of wounded and shrinking.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:21.730
He's such a-- he wants to hide
so much that putting yourself

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.490
back in that place
of what it felt

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.270
like to be a teenager that
really has no idea what you're

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.850
going to end up being like as
an adult is painful and hard.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:36.110
And the further I get away
from it, the more difficult

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.080
it is to get back to that place
of-- I mean, I'm in my mid 30s

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.580
now.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.240
I know exactly who I am,
and I feel very secure

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.450
in my personality.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.370
But, you know, that
time in everyone's life

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.610
is very difficult.
And so getting back

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:56.320
to that place for
Jason is harder

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.023
for me, whereas Tyrone knows
exactly who the fuck he is.

00:20:59.023 --> 00:21:03.555
He's the devil, which is why
I feel so much closer to him.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.884
ALAN SEALES: Michael and Sara,
you guys came into the show,

00:21:10.884 --> 00:21:12.300
obviously, later
into the process.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.170
What was the audition process
like for the two of you?

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.330
SARAH STILES: Michael,
you have to tell yours.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:16.630
It's so good.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.350
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
No, go ahead.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.496
I'm practicing sleeping
with my eyes open.

00:21:19.496 --> 00:21:20.620
GENEVA CARR: No, you do it.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.080
You do it.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.560
You go.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:21.850
It's so good.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:22.180
It's such a good story.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:22.580
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: No, please.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.289
No, ladies first.

00:21:23.289 --> 00:21:24.705
GENEVA CARR: Come
on, please, shh.

00:21:24.705 --> 00:21:25.310
Do it.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.320
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: So hold on.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.550
Let me wake up really quick.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.700
OK, thank you.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.700
Is mic on?

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.910
I don't want to be that
dickhead with the mic not on.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.760
They're just like-- OK, it's on.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.550
So I just-- I auditioned
for this thing.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.190
I was one of the few
people in New York that

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.479
missed the production at
EST, and I kick myself

00:21:45.479 --> 00:21:48.020
because I think I didn't get a
chance to see this awesome hit

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.560
play by this guy Rob Askins
and this amazing performance

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.574
by Steven Boyer and Geneva Carr.

00:21:52.574 --> 00:21:54.990
And then I found out that they
were-- my agent sent me out

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.232
for it, and I went in for it.

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.190
And it was very rare that
I didn't get a chance

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.980
to read the entire script.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.330
And so they gave me the
sides, and I went in,

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.910
and I just completely
played everything

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.590
like just straight--
very, very serious.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.760
And Rob was in the room
and Moritz, the Director

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.135
and the artistic
director of MCC,

00:22:12.135 --> 00:22:14.250
and they're just dying laughing.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.520
And I just walked
out of there just

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.710
feeling like I was a
complete and utter failure

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.900
because my best work was
eliciting so much laughter.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.280
And it wasn't until I went
home and actually read

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.620
the script that I
realized that that

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.649
was exactly what the play was.

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:32.940
And interestingly enough, it
became a challenge for me,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.690
as the process went
on, when we did

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.040
off Broadway and on Broadway.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.470
And there was this quote
that I came across.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.291
It was by George Dawes Green.

00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:41.540
Probably most of you know him.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.494
He's from "The Moth."

00:22:43.494 --> 00:22:44.910
I'm going to
paraphrase it, but it

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.451
was when everything
opened up for me,

00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:48.220
and it totally
comes back to this.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.700
He said something at the
center of every great story

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.140
is a flaw, a human flaw.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.920
It's actually failure.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.500
And a great storyteller
recognizes in some way

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.440
that he's a clown.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.920
And we identify with that
because we're all clowns.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.844
And when I read that, that
was like the point for me

00:23:06.844 --> 00:23:08.760
where I realized it
doesn't matter what people

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.530
think of this kid Timothy.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.490
If they laugh at
him or with him,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.260
or if they don't laugh
at all is journey

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.300
that the permission is
there, and the story

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:23.930
is such that-- we've always said
it's a very serious play that's

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.210
fucking hilarious.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.210
Do you know what I mean?

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.043
And that's what this
is that we're doing it,

00:23:28.043 --> 00:23:31.220
and it's the best kind
of comedy, in my opinion.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.357
And with that, I'll pass it
on to the great Sarah Stiles.

00:23:34.357 --> 00:23:36.190
SARAH STILES: I mean,
there was an addition.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.710
I went in.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.376
And I was lucky.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.950
I don't know.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.230
I wanted a job, and
I wanted this job

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.590
because I read the script, and
I thought it was brilliant.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.890
And I'd done a lot of
musicals, and so I really

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.560
wanted to do a play.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.290
And so this was my first play.

00:23:56.325 --> 00:23:58.200
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
And she's amazing in it.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.020
She really is.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.103
You should come see Sarah.

00:24:00.103 --> 00:24:01.300
She's so good.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.480
She makes me crack
up all the time.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.060
Just when I think she can't
get any dryer in her part,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.360
she just comes on like, God,
somebody just woke me up,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.927
and now I've got to go on stage
and-- it's so-- she's so good.

00:24:12.927 --> 00:24:14.510
STEVEN BOYER: Comedy
scientist, Sarah.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.000
GENEVA CARR: She is.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.070
Her timing, it's impeccable.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.944
ALAN SEALES: Do you guys
ever break on stage,

00:24:17.944 --> 00:24:19.910
or is it all
perfection every night?

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:20.550
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
Perfection, man.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.300
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.762
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
I'm a perfec--

00:24:22.762 --> 00:24:24.134
I'm a fucking professional.

00:24:24.134 --> 00:24:25.550
SARAH STILES: We
have a hard time.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.525
We have a hard time.

00:24:26.525 --> 00:24:28.650
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: But
I'm a professional always.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:29.220
I never break, man.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.678
SARAH STILES: There's one line
about a milk-stained vagina.

00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:34.645
And if it is said incorrectly,
we can't keep it together.

00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:36.270
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
Yeah, that's true.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.060
This is dangerous.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.020
We have to like
separate our eye contact

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:40.700
because I will break with her.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.810
SARAH STILES: Because we also,
our characters hate each other.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:43.350
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: Right.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.099
SARAH STILES: So there
can't be a twinkle,

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:46.400
or else it's all over.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.195
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: Yeah,
and sometimes like Steve

00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:48.590
will do something, and
I'll look at Sarah,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.235
and she's just like, did you
just see what I just saw?

00:24:50.235 --> 00:24:51.940
And then we just start
fucking laughing.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.440
It's horrible.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:52.775
It's very unprofessional.

00:24:52.775 --> 00:24:54.980
SARAH STILES: And then
Steve is like, you guys.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.730
STEVEN BOYER: Yeah,
but just with my eyes.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.690
It's just like, juh.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:59.415
SARAH STILES: Pull it together!

00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:01.040
STEVEN BOYER: (MENACING
WHISPER) We are

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.360
in front of hundreds of people.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.850
BOB SAGET: I'm new to this,
but when Michael has a tendency

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.870
to make me want to go up,
and I never would want to do.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.550
So when I looked at
him onstage during

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.987
a confrontational scene--

00:25:12.987 --> 00:25:15.070
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
Serious-- very, very serious.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.240
BOB SAGET: Look into
this brilliant woman's

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.650
eyes because I actually
was going to crack up

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.549
like Jimmy Fallon on "SNL."

00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:24.840
That is not a good thing to do.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.460
You're a bad boy sometimes.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.680
GENEVA CARR: He is bad.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.500
He is bad.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.790
ALAN SEALES: I feel,
Timothy-- Timmy.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.740
Michael, I feel
like you-- sorry.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.690
Timmy, I feel like
you could turn up

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.620
the Timmy0 dial
like as you wanted

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.560
to you because your character's
all sort of like, what's

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.930
up, right?

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.190
And I feel like if you turn
that up just a little bit,

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.757
it would just go over very
well and making people--

00:25:45.757 --> 00:25:48.090
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: Yeah,
there's different frequencies

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.770
that I work on, most certainly.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.830
Matinees, they get their own
frequency, Thursday nights.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.050
Saturday nights I fucking
rock out with my cock

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.096
out always,
literally-- literally.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.310
Yeah, no, but that's--

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.143
LUCAS MCMAHON: Our sales
for Saturday nights

00:26:06.143 --> 00:26:07.144
just skyrocketed.

00:26:07.144 --> 00:26:09.060
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
But, no, that's his play.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.100
I mean, he wrote
this character, man.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.052
There's so much place to play,
man, for all of us really.

00:26:15.052 --> 00:26:16.760
ROB ASKINS: Pull your
penis out on stage.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.676
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: Rob
wanted dick on stage,

00:26:18.676 --> 00:26:21.764
and I was the one that signed
the contract that said, sure.

00:26:21.764 --> 00:26:23.180
BOB SAGET: So far,
the sound bites

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.010
are rape with a puppet and
rock out with your cock out.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.610
STEVEN BOYER: Rob
wanted dick on stage.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.054
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
There is no dick on stage.

00:26:34.054 --> 00:26:34.970
You look disappointed.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.090
There's no dick on stage.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.340
I'm sorry.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.160
STEVEN BOYER: I mean,
we're all up there.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.530
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: There's
plenty of dicks on stage,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.940
but you just don't see them.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.441
This is a very
serious play, people.

00:26:45.441 --> 00:26:47.690
ALAN SEALES: You spend like
10 minutes with your pants

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.195
down, at one point.

00:26:49.195 --> 00:26:51.480
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
Don't say too much, now.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.730
BOB SAGET: That's a
real spoiler alert.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.712
ALAN SEALES: His pants are
down, and I'll leave it at that.

00:26:56.712 --> 00:26:58.920
Yeah, Sarah, your character
Jessica is like the only,

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.950
I guess-- we'll use air quotes--
"normal: character in the show.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.980
Is that a challenge for you
to just play everything so,

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.426
I guess, normal and deadpan?

00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:11.550
SARAH STILES: I don't know.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.640
No, I'm going to
name drop right now.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.810
Spielberg came to see
the show, and he said,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.970
Jessica's like the therapist
of the show, which I thought

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.670
was so cool.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.854
But, yeah, she's-- I don't know.

00:27:25.854 --> 00:27:27.020
I've learned a lot from her.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.910
I have to say, when I get myself
into situations in my own life,

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.180
I often wonder, what would
Jessica do right now.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.560
But she's very insightful
and smart and grounded.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.767
Yeah, she's awesome.

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:38.850
ALAN SEALES: So, we've got
another video of Tyrone

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.180
that I want to queue up here.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.890
But in the meantime,
if you guys have

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.110
any questions for the
cast or Lucas or Rob,

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.430
come up to the mics here.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.015
But let's roll that
next video, please

00:27:49.015 --> 00:27:49.910
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.280
-Yes, I-- I went to Devry.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.480
-Devry acting school?

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.627
-That's right.

00:27:54.627 --> 00:27:56.460
-I didn't realize they
had an acting school.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.335
ALAN SEALES: They do.

00:27:57.335 --> 00:28:02.190
I got a master class from,
um, Freddie Prinze, Jr.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.820
-So at Devry, you met who would
become your best friend, Elmo.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.040
-Whew, OK, (CLEARS
THROAT) yeah, Elmo.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.690
What about him?

00:28:17.432 --> 00:28:19.140
-Yeah, they have a
history, and, uh, they

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.340
don't get along very well.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.590
-You guys were inseparable.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.730
-Oh, yeah.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:23.500
-Best friends.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.640
-That's right.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.170
-I know that Tyrone, I think,
was something about "Sesame

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.680
Street," and then
Elmo booked it,

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.730
and that's definitely--
that definitely has not

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.440
been put to bed.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.410
-It was a-- it was
an improv audition.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:39.050
They said, so we're going to
work with the letter F What

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.160
starts with the letter F?

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.240
That answer changed
the course of my life.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.540
-Is it true that
Tyrone attacked a man

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.180
dressed like Elmo in Times
Square? (WHISPERING) Yeah.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.165
-He lost his mind on this
poor man dressed up like Elmo.

00:28:58.165 --> 00:28:59.040
-He was just yelling.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.840
He's like, tickle this.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.120
Tickle this!

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.940
-I mean, he took that guy down.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.469
It was frightening.

00:29:05.469 --> 00:29:07.760
I didn't know what I was--
people were running in right

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.400
and left.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.820
-He went into like
a fugue state.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.290
He doesn't even--
he blacked out.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.210
He doesn't even remember this.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.201
-If Elmo were here right now--

00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:15.701
-Is he here?

00:29:15.701 --> 00:29:17.665
Is he here?

00:29:17.665 --> 00:29:19.138
-He-- he's not here.

00:29:19.138 --> 00:29:22.387
-Oh, god, er.

00:29:22.387 --> 00:29:23.470
(CLEARS THROAT) I'm sorry.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.320
What's the question?

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.064
-If I'm going to
be honest, I think

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:30.212
that he's a little intimidated
by Elmo and his success.

00:29:30.212 --> 00:29:32.340
And I think he's
a little jealous.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.770
--[BLEEP] you, you
fuzzy piece of [BLEEP].

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.070

my show, my show.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:39.860
ALAN SEALES: Very cool.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.770
BOB SAGET: They didn't
leave the word "fucking."

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.770
You've got to move that.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.590
Slide that over.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.580
ALAN SEALES: Let's get the
lights up on the Q&amp;A over here.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.410
Yeah, we've got a
couple questions

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.550
once the lights come up.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.754
Yeah, go ahead.

00:29:55.754 --> 00:29:57.712
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: Hey,
man, what's going on?

00:29:57.712 --> 00:29:59.461
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if you can hear me,

00:29:59.461 --> 00:30:00.500
so I will project too.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.749
BOB SAGET: But this is Google.

00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:04.132
Shouldn't the audio all be good?

00:30:04.132 --> 00:30:05.840
ALAN SEALES: There's
data mining going on

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.730
of all of your temperatures.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.688
LUCAS MCMAHON: Actually,
they're all holograms.

00:30:08.688 --> 00:30:09.430
That's what is.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.880
STEVEN BOYER: Kanye's going
to ask a question in a second.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.379
AUDIENCE: I was fortunate to
see the plays a few months ago.

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.070
I'm from Atlanta,
a visiting Googler.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.010
And so I really was impressed
with the Southern accents

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:21.700
because it's not always the
easiest for non-Southerners

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.970
to do our accent.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.940
So in particular, Geneva, I
think yours was really good.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.190
GENEVA CARR: I'm from Atlanta.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.112
I went to Paideia.

00:30:29.112 --> 00:30:30.070
AUDIENCE: There you go.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.945
So yours was natural.

00:30:30.945 --> 00:30:33.860
For the rest of you,
how do you approach

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.595
plain, good old
Southerners from Texas?

00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:40.895
SARAH STILES: We
listen to Geneva.

00:30:43.244 --> 00:30:44.910
GENEVA CARR: I'm also
the dialect coach.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.378
SARAH STILES: I don't know.

00:30:46.378 --> 00:30:47.710
We didn't-- did we have one?

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.710
STEVEN BOYER: I mean,
it's in the script.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:49.876
A lot of it's in the script.

00:30:49.876 --> 00:30:53.410
I mean, whenever they say the
word "can't," it's written

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:53.910
"cain't."

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.030
I cain't.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.280
I cain't do it.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.280
I cain't.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.950
And we're like, oh, cain't.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.550
Oh, they say
"cain't," all right.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.069
SARAH STILES: How many
syllables does child have?

00:31:04.069 --> 00:31:05.610
GENEVA CARR: (SOUTHERN
ACCENT) Child.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.280
STEVEN BOYER: (SOUTHERN
ACCENT) You are a child.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.390
GENEVA CARR: He knows
what I'm talking about.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.473
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:31:14.144 --> 00:31:15.060
ALAN SEALES: Yes, sir.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.810
AUDIENCE: All right,
thanks for coming.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.440
Specifically for the guys
in front, I'm just curious.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.290
The medium of putting this is a
play as opposed to as a musical

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.370
or something digital,
prerecorded, movie, TV series,

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.400
YouTube vignette--
I'm curious what

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.855
was your thought about
putting this specifically

00:31:32.855 --> 00:31:33.480
in that medium?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.240
And now that it's
been so successful,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.285
how much you thought
that played into it?

00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:40.910
ROB ASKINS: I'm going
to take this one.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.470
LUCAS MCMAHON:
Yeah, you take it.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.980
ROB ASKINS: The thing that
Steve does is miraculous.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.530
What everybody does
onstage is miraculous.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.190
But to watch
somebody in real time

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.010
deliver performance
like this is something

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.550
the only theater can capture.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.550
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.090
Like on film you could
cut away and go, oh,

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.245
that's a special effect,
or they did many takes.

00:31:58.245 --> 00:31:59.590
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:00.990
But to watch it live--

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:05.937
I also think that
there are-- people

00:32:05.937 --> 00:32:07.520
don't expect to see
this kind of thing

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.840
when they go to the theater.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.840
Do you know what I mean?

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.970
There's a lot of blood.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:12.790
There's a lot of
laughs, and it's

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.640
kind of three-chord
punk-rock theater.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.850
ALAN SEALES: There a
lot of blood, actually.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:16.558
ROB ASKINS: Yeah.

00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:17.700
STEVEN BOYER: Blood, sex--

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.730
ROB ASKINS: Yeah, and
it's something that--

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.829
BOB SAGET: --that
always go together.

00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:24.370
ROB ASKINS: If you're
doing it right.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.895
STEVEN BOYER: You've got to
raise your age range, Bob.

00:32:30.275 --> 00:32:31.650
BOB SAGET: Please,
let it happen.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.760
ROB ASKINS: Yeah, so
when the audience sees

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.510
that, and everybody's
crammed together laughing,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.330
that energy just sort
of multiplies on itself,

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.374
and it gets pretty-- it
gets like a rock concert.

00:32:42.374 --> 00:32:43.790
LUCAS MCMAHON: And
I will also say

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.230
this play is-- we go to the
theater to be surprised.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.650
We go to the theater to
have a live experience

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:54.840
that we feel like we couldn't
see in our everyday life.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.335
As Rob said, a
screen is distancing.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:05.004
You can do amazing things
on television and movies.

00:33:05.004 --> 00:33:05.920
You can do explosions.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.860
You can do car chases.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.300
But to have that
kind of exhilaration,

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:15.460
but all it is these brilliant
actors and a puppet,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.990
that live experience, I
think, is so thrilling.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.680
And I think we as
human beings, we

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.500
are hardwired to want to
gather and experience stories.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.330
And I think that what
this man has done,

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.410
what these actors do
eight times a week

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:35.130
is they get 800 people
in a room and experience

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:38.410
a full range of emotions.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.470
And they're experiencing
it with people who are

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.500
live on stage in front of them.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.010
And I think that's what makes
this show really special.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.220
I think it's what makes the
medium of theatre really

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.070
special.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.390
So I think that that is
what these people capture

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.620
in their art, and
that's really special

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:00.980
and I think really necessary
to the culture of this world.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.286
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:02.286 --> 00:34:04.950
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, Bob,
you got the benefit

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:06.580
of being able to
come in near the end

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.949
here and see a finished,
polished product.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.854
What was your first
impression of the show?

00:34:12.854 --> 00:34:15.020
BOB SAGET: Well, I'd seen
the play seven months ago.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.436
Kevin McCollum's
a friend of mine.

00:34:16.436 --> 00:34:19.420
I was in "Drowsy Chaperone,"
and I closed that one as well.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.274
So I'm a closer.

00:34:22.274 --> 00:34:23.440
But this thing is moving on.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.555
It's going to London with
people that need dental work.

00:34:27.055 --> 00:34:28.404
ALAN SEALES: Sound bite.

00:34:28.404 --> 00:34:30.170
BOB SAGET: OK, I
shouldn't have said that.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:30.810
ROB ASKINS: No, that's me.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.560
I need the dental work.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.435
BOB SAGET: Oh, that's
what I was saying, yes.

00:34:33.435 --> 00:34:36.084
So I saw the play, and I
was with two of my daughters

00:34:36.084 --> 00:34:37.500
and someone else
I can't remember.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.850
I had to put her down.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.480
But I could not believe-- it
is exactly the sensibilities

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.170
that I love.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.739
It is exactly
everything that hits

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.940
me, which is it's something
very, very serious,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.420
which is people's problems
with their families, to denial,

00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.360
non-communication,
pain, death, and to be

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.670
able to find humor in that.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.961
And there's different places
throughout the play acting

00:35:03.961 --> 00:35:07.820
with these people, these
amazing artists, where

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.580
as it's been written
by this maestro,

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.590
the pressure in the
cooker is building.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.430
And at different
times, it comes out.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:20.100
And so a lot of times, there
will be very dramatic moment,

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.870
and then this humor
comes out, sometimes

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.830
out of uncomfortability, because
people have been through this.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:27.000
People have problems.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.950
People have a child who has a
Tyrone personality, whether it

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.310
be-- I mean, I know
people that have

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.910
people that go through
similar things,

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.010
but not as organic as
a Shari Lewis problem.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.510
Too dated a reference,
sorry Google.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.414
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:43.414 --> 00:35:45.080
GENEVA CARR: They can google it.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.590
BOB SAGET: They can google it.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.390
But the play just
touched me deeply,

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.130
and I laughed my ass
off, and I thought

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.770
it was a miracle when it
was over and one of the best

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.630
plays I'd ever seen.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.755
I've seen two other plays.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.180
I saw "Paint Your
Wagon" and [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.430
And one time I got into
Blue Man Group free.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.050
But the thing hit me on
a very, very deep level,

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.660
and it is a perfect play.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.530
Every time I'm backstage
thinking about it,

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.232
because now I'm past the point
of thinking about myself,

00:36:21.232 --> 00:36:22.190
I think about the work.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.280
A great writer, great
writing, answers

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.180
the question you have in your
mind the moment you have it.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.960
It takes you to that
moment in the next scene

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.756
and in the next
piece of dialogue--

00:36:35.756 --> 00:36:36.630
but what happened to?

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.890
And they're answering it for
you organically from your gut.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.500
And I also I'm proud
that I'm bringing

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.170
my version of Pastor
Greg to the play,

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.620
which is a different take.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.030
And I also feel, not unlike
Sarah's character Jessica,

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.150
that I have a moral
fulcrum to the play,

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.150
that I'm trying to
move things forward.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:01.860
And as unequipped as I am as a
human being, as Pastor Greg is,

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.420
he still loves this
woman, no matter what,

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.860
even though his pants are down.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.270
But I never said that.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.420
But it's an amazing work.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.410
And everybody should go
see this play-- everybody.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:15.470
It closes January 3rd.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.825
You all, everybody in this room,
owe it to yourself to see it,

00:37:18.825 --> 00:37:22.480
especially if you have
psychological problems.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.220
And if you work at
Google, odds are--

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:29.990
So we welcome you
and come back stage

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.380
and meet Steven and see
the sweat that comes out

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.560
of this genius after he's done.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.512
Just smell his sweat, and
you'll become smarter.

00:37:37.512 --> 00:37:40.630
ALAN SEALES: Do you enjoy
performing in theater or TV

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.430
and film more?

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:43.890
I mean, you've got a little
experience with TV, I guess.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:49.489
BOB SAGET: I like performing
behind black felt.

00:37:49.489 --> 00:37:51.030
ROB ASKINS: Yeah,
totally absolutely.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.610
BOB SAGET: That's right.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:51.910
STEVEN BOYER:
(WHISPERING) I don't

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:52.110
know what he's talking about.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:52.690
BOB SAGET: The
first rule of improv

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.390
is agree with the psychopath.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.940
ROB ASKINS: Yeah.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.600
BOB SAGET: I love-- I give
1,000% to whatever I'm doing,

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.180
so if any women are
interested-- no.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:08.350
So this play is all I
care about right now.

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:09.177
I love stand up.

00:38:09.177 --> 00:38:11.510
I'm going to go on tour in
January and do some stand up.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.310
Thank you.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.800
And I am more Tyrone
than I am anyone else.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.300
But I'm actually
changing and evolving,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.700
and this experience--
every piece of work

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.970
you do changes your life.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:26.970
And these four years these
people have worked on this,

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.650
so it'll be a big life
change for everyone.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.970
And so stand up is
something I love.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.460
I actually like
directing the most.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.293
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:38:34.293 --> 00:38:38.320
BOB SAGET: Yeah,
traffic-- I work as a cop.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.130
No, I really do.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.389
I've got a project.

00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:41.680
I've directed a bunch of stuff.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.070
ALAN SEALES: I walked
right into that.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:43.510
BOB SAGET: What?

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.093
ALAN SEALES: I walked
right into that.

00:38:45.093 --> 00:38:48.260
BOB SAGET: That's what I'm
hoping in traffic you do that.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:53.132
But I love all the arts.

00:38:53.132 --> 00:38:54.590
My favorite is spin
art because you

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.590
don't know what you're
going to make when that--

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.700
--goes around.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:04.010
That was one
question, wasn't it?

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.630
40 minutes went by.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.260
ALAN SEALES: It's amazing.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.050
So the--

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:09.314
BOB SAGET: Sorry.

00:39:09.314 --> 00:39:11.480
ALAN SEALES: The feedback
from the public, initially

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.970
you said it was very good.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.450
Obviously, it's still very good.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:17.826
Has there been anybody, like
any celebrities, any VIPs who

00:39:17.826 --> 00:39:19.581
have come to see
the show who-- like

00:39:19.581 --> 00:39:21.830
Mother Teresa showed up and
was like, this is amazing?

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.530
Or anybody who has come
that's surprised you?

00:39:26.924 --> 00:39:28.590
STEVEN BOYER: Hugh
Jackman saw the show,

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.094
and afterwards he seemed
kind of like stunned.

00:39:31.094 --> 00:39:32.510
And we're like,
how'd you like it?

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.676
And he's like, (AUSTRALIAN
ACCENT) that was bizarre.

00:39:37.099 --> 00:39:38.010
We're like, yeah?

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.846
And he's just like,
that was bizarre.

00:39:44.895 --> 00:39:46.270
ALAN SEALES: The
general feedback

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.228
from like critics and
audiences and everything,

00:39:48.228 --> 00:39:50.520
has there been anything
that has surprised you

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.270
from the audience?

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.820
Like do people come
thinking that it's

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.990
a legit religious type
of show, or do people

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.940
know it's a satire?

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:06.990
GENEVA CARR: Well,
some people have left

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.600
because it can be shocking.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.010
But I do not think that
it is offensive to anyone

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.340
who is church going.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.130
Like my buddy from Atlanta,
I'm from the deep South,

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.870
and my friends have come.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.280
And in their mind, Pastor
Greg does minister us

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.600
and does help us, even though I
do some pretty shocking things

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.430
with the Bible.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.910
STEVEN BOYER: Very
few have left, though.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.500
Very few, I mean, in the grand
scheme of things have left.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.791
BOB SAGET: I believe if mostly
because of incontinence.

00:40:34.335 --> 00:40:36.460
GENEVA CARR: We have had
some people faint through.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:36.690
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.770
GENEVA CARR: Those are
my favorites, yeah.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.311
SARAH STILES: We
had to stop the show

00:40:40.311 --> 00:40:42.637
one because it was a big faint.

00:40:42.637 --> 00:40:43.720
STEVEN BOYER: I love that.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.095
BOB SAGET: I wish
I would've done

00:40:45.095 --> 00:40:46.670
this thing from the beginning.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.620
ALAN SEALES: Was it
the language that

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.060
made them faint, or
like that one scene--

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:49.850
SARAH STILES: The blood.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.490
STEVEN BOYER: There's
a lot of blood.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.698
GENEVA CARR: There's a lot--
there's some scenes that

00:40:53.698 --> 00:40:54.407
are pretty gory.

00:40:54.407 --> 00:40:55.990
ALAN SEALES: Right,
right, right, yes.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.000
GENEVA CARR: --and
terrifying and unexpected.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.780
And we've had--

00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.254
STEVEN BOYER: It's got blood.

00:40:59.254 --> 00:40:59.795
It's got sex.

00:40:59.795 --> 00:41:00.720
It's got puppets.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.220
LUCAS MCMAHON: And you know,
and I think that this is a play

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.610
that really aspires
apathy in no one,

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.755
which I think is what you aspire
to do when you create theatre.

00:41:08.755 --> 00:41:12.465
because there were a couple
like old matinee ladies

00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:14.350
who came to the early
one was like, what the?

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:18.154
And just like, they were
horrified, and I loved that.

00:41:18.154 --> 00:41:19.320
I think you loved that, too.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.270
BOB SAGET: Oh, yeah.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.610
but they love it though.

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.193
LUCAS MCMAHON: Yeah,
and they love it,

00:41:22.193 --> 00:41:24.040
and the vast majority
of them, even who

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.160
come in expecting something
totally different.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.640
I'll tell you one story that
happened early in previews.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.014
There was another show on
Broadway early this year called

00:41:30.014 --> 00:41:33.570
"Act of God" with the
wonderful Jim Parsons.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.250
At our are like third preview,
I was sitting behind a woman

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.065
who turned to the man
next to her and went,

00:41:37.065 --> 00:41:39.065
(IN NEW YORK ACCENT) is
Jim Parson's in Act Two?

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.480
No, he wasn't.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:51.064
But she left, and she had gotten
there completely by accident.

00:41:51.064 --> 00:41:52.980
Thought she was going
to come see Jim Parsons.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.130
He wasn't there.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.210
But she loved the play, so
I think the surprise of this

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.700
appealing to people you
wouldn't expected it to appeal

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.906
to has been really exciting.

00:42:01.906 --> 00:42:04.280
BOB SAGET: I was personally
excited because my television

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.410
daughter from a show I once
did, Candace Cameron-Bure came

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.440
to the show a couple
weeks ago, and she

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.870
is very strong in
her Christian values

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.390
and proud of that and a
very dear friend of mine.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:16.820
And she loved the play.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.520
And we talked
about it at length.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.110
It's not a play
that-- she also loved

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:28.660
that I was a Lutheran minister,
and that I'm getting closer

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.722
to what she would like
me to [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:31.722 --> 00:42:33.750
and that I find
the Bible sacred.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:40.007
And then there was quiet.

00:42:40.007 --> 00:42:41.590
ALAN SEALES: So the
show, as you said,

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:45.670
it's closing January 3rd
here in New York, but it's--

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:46.420
BOB SAGET: No way.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.670
ALAN SEALES: Moving to London.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.810
So is anything in
the show changing

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.546
as it moves across to London?

00:42:53.546 --> 00:42:54.920
Is the script
remaining the same?

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.300
GENEVA CARR: Aside from the
cast drop, what's changing?

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.265
ROB ASKINS: We're going to
see what jokes maintain.

00:43:02.265 --> 00:43:03.140
You know what I mean?

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.056
Like we're going to see
if there aren't subtle

00:43:05.056 --> 00:43:07.380
changes in rhythm
and in content that

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.840
maybe help some
of the jokes land,

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.018
because jokes are so cultural.

00:43:11.018 --> 00:43:13.184
STEVEN BOYER: You're going
to say "brilliant" a lot.

00:43:13.184 --> 00:43:14.800
ROB ASKINS: Exactly.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.590
We'll get to use a lot more C
words because they don't have

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.886
a problem with that over there.

00:43:20.886 --> 00:43:23.367
GENEVA CARR: But it's not an
offensive word over there.

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:24.450
ROB ASKINS: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.142
LUCAS MCMAHON: I
think it's going

00:43:25.142 --> 00:43:26.767
to be interesting to
see what audiences

00:43:26.767 --> 00:43:28.900
respond to there versus here.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.297
I think a part of
the brilliance of Rob

00:43:31.297 --> 00:43:33.930
is that he really
listens to audiences,

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:40.141
and he really listens to
the way actors take a line

00:43:40.141 --> 00:43:41.640
and how you can
make it different so

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.840
that in their voice it fits in
a way that will make it funnier.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.230
And so I think will be an
interesting experience to see.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:55.520
Because over there,
they love plays

00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.412
that are really kind of
like rough and incisive.

00:44:00.412 --> 00:44:01.620
But it's a different culture.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.828
It's a different sensibility.

00:44:02.828 --> 00:44:05.830
They have a different
sense of humor.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.650
So I think that will
be largely the same,

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.050
but it'll be interesting to see.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.430
GENEVA CARR: There have
been so many English people

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.840
that have come to see the
show and come up to me.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.640
And I think you're
going You'd be surprised

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.056
how much of the
play they're going

00:44:17.056 --> 00:44:18.990
to get without assistance.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.365
I think it's universal.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.630
They eat biscuits, you know?

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.630
ROB ASKINS: Well, yeah,
and when you have people

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.576
even in this country going,
Christian puppetry, really?

00:44:30.576 --> 00:44:31.450
You know what I mean.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:35.230
I feel like there are a lot
of things that will translate.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:39.980
I feel like isolation and mental
disease are pretty universal.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.020
So is a good sex joke.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.469
ALAN SEALES: So we're
wrapping up time here.

00:44:44.469 --> 00:44:46.010
BOB SAGET: This is
really fun though.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.767
Could we keep going?

00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:49.600
I mean, it's Google.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.330
Can't you just keep going?

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.617
LUCAS MCMAHON: We've got
nowhere to be till 7:00, so.

00:44:53.617 --> 00:44:55.700
ALAN SEALES: People have
other meetings to get to.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.640
Yeah, this is a work day.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.816
ROB ASKINS: Yeah, we'll
go to the meetings.

00:44:59.816 --> 00:45:02.412
I don't want to promise
anything to these guys.

00:45:02.412 --> 00:45:03.620
BOB SAGET: [INAUDIBLE] to go.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.244
I want this to be
like "The Internship"

00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:07.590
with Vince Vaughn
and Owen Wilson.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:11.150
I want to try to come up with
a project, have it spread.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.410
ROB ASKINS: [INAUDIBLE]
buddy comedy

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.710
ever-- you and I going to
different meetings at Google.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.168
BOB SAGET: We'll
go to pizza shops.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.280
STEVEN BOYER: I expected
more hover boards today.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.320
Where are the hover boards?

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.820
BOB SAGET: What
about the food here?

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.820
My god in heaven.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.070
ALAN SEALES: You just want
to talk about just anything

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.345
to stay on stage?

00:45:28.345 --> 00:45:29.720
BOB SAGET: Now
you understand me.

00:45:35.408 --> 00:45:38.714
(SINGING) I had a dream.

00:45:38.714 --> 00:45:40.880
ALAN SEALES: All right,
let's see, what could we do?

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.360
Steven, if Tyrone used Google,
what would he search for?

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.730
STEVEN BOYER: It's a three-way
tie between furry porn, sex

00:45:54.730 --> 00:46:04.490
with house plants, and how to
make amphetamines from Imodium

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.520
and Vick's VapoRub.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.358
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.605
ALAN SEALES: Fair
enough, all right.

00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:15.230
BOB SAGET: There is
Google in the play.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.970
I am looking on the computer at
one moment trying to find out

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.670
about possession and things.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.000
ALAN SEALES: So you movie type?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.460
BOB SAGET: I'm
actually in my mind

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:31.620
I'm on Google searching-- in
my mind, which is a rough place

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.731
to be.

00:46:33.731 --> 00:46:36.230
ALAN SEALES: So everyone, if
there's no more live questions,

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.438
everyone, remember our
discount go/hadtogod-discount.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.577
Oh, question!

00:46:56.577 --> 00:46:57.910
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER: Here we go.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:58.600
AUDIENCE: We'll do a
live a question, so.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.620
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.786
AUDIENCE: The subtitle
there, "a new American play,"

00:47:01.786 --> 00:47:05.780
thank you, for new, and not a
revival of "Paint Your Wagon."

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.990
You said American play.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.260
What context?

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.840
I mean, it's going to play
well in London you believe.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.910
Is it uniquely American
values or universal or just

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.077
you've got to say something?

00:47:16.077 --> 00:47:17.910
LUCAS MCMAHON: I can
take that because we're

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:18.940
the ones that put it--

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:20.244 --> 00:47:21.660
AUDIENCE: Marketing
people, right?

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.900
LUCAS MCMAHON: No, I think that
there's on Broadway right now,

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.120
there's-- the season we saw
we were coming into were a lot

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.020
of plays that were
imported from London.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.500
And they're all great plays, and
they're all very worthy shows.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.180
But there's something
that's really

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.590
special about having
a show that was

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:42.890
created by American audiences.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.980
And there is something uniquely
American about the play.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.890
It doesn't mean that
it's not universal

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:53.890
and it can't play just as well
in London or Paris or South

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:54.400
Africa.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.040
But there is something--
the American spirit

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.980
of this play I think is part of
what makes it really special.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.920
So I think that we
were excited when

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.075
we went to market the play
about being very open about that

00:48:10.075 --> 00:48:13.540
and saying, this was a show
made by American audiences

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.020
about the American experience.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.600
And I think that
that's something

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:24.340
that we need more
of on our stages.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:27.520
And I think that we
thought that that would

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.020
get people just excited to--

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.860
AUDIENCE: Marketing stake.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.757
LUCAS MCMAHON:
--that sensibility.

00:48:35.757 --> 00:48:36.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:39.240
BOB SAGET: Originally, it said
a new play from the Philippines,

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.430
and nobody was--

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.062
LUCAS MCMAHON: It
didn't test well, so.

00:48:45.062 --> 00:48:47.020
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, one
more question over here.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.130
AUDIENCE: Can you tell us
more about Christian puppetry

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.270
because when you
first said that,

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:51.353
I thought you were joking.

00:48:51.353 --> 00:48:54.350
But very quickly it became
clear that you weren't joking.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.482
And that was a huge
surprise to me,

00:48:56.482 --> 00:48:57.690
so I'd love to hear about it.

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:02.430
ROB ASKINS: This is my
favorite question ever.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.780
This actually really
dovetails very nicely

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.750
with the Americaness
of the question.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.170
There's something
really-- there's

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:15.030
a special kind of anxiety
in American Christianity.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.890
And I think the puppet
ministry is very nicely

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:19.990
symbolic of that.

00:49:23.552 --> 00:49:24.885
Megachurches are a motherfucker.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.801
And things get weird
in the suburbs.

00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:34.300
There's a strange
thing that happens

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.290
once you feel like all the
problems have been solved.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.290
Do you know what I mean?

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.300
Like, Christ as come,
and everybody's saved,

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.530
and why is everybody
still miserable?

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.610
I'm going to come back
to puppets, I promise.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:47.790
I saw your disinterest.

00:49:53.886 --> 00:49:56.190
So you're endlessly
purchasing things,

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:59.840
putting a gym in your church
and a Starbucks church,

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.040
and a puppets ministry
in your church

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.400
hopefully hoping
that you're going

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.020
to augment the
religion in some way,

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:11.830
so they finally, the
promised paradise occurs.

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.060
It got dark.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.150
Yeah, and so that's
something that my mother did.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.020
My mother was looking for
a place to access a church,

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.790
and she liked children, and
puppets seemed innocuous.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.110
And so we bought
a script online.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.720
And you can go on
right now and purchase

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.649
everything you need for your
own Christian puppet ministry.

00:50:34.649 --> 00:50:36.190
Do you have a more
specific question?

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.280
I'm sorry I took that
to a weird place.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.520
AUDIENCE: Oh, it just
seems so bizarre to me.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.744
I was like wondering
like why and how,

00:50:43.744 --> 00:50:45.410
and just very basic
newspaper questions.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.076
GENEVA CARR: It's how
you teach children

00:50:47.076 --> 00:50:49.860
about Jesus and the Bible,
and you re enact Bible stories

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.915
with puppets, and that's
how you get children

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:53.040
involved and indoctrinated.

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:59.720
BOB SAGET: Well, I was raised
Jewish, and I'm Episcopalian,

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.089
and I don't understand it.

00:51:01.089 --> 00:51:02.130
AUDIENCE: I don't get it.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:03.546
BOB SAGET: So I
was raised Jewish,

00:51:03.546 --> 00:51:06.300
and we would have
holidays, like Purim,

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.930
which no one outside of
the faith would know.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:11.760
And you would dress up.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:17.470
It was not puppets, but we'd
put on shows as Queen Esther

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.850
and Mordecai, which just
sounds like a comedy

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:24.120
team in the Village.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.780
But we would-- but it
was about community,

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.470
and it was about
teaching culture.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.390
And it is a way to
segue into getting you

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.560
into the religious
beliefs, and it's

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.370
true of every-- well,
of a lot of cultures,

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:41.590
but Christianity, for sure.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:43.730
His experience with
puppet ministry,

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.537
you have my empathy forever.

00:51:46.537 --> 00:51:48.120
ROB ASKINS: Well,
also, I think, also,

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.400
like religion and culture
are stories that we tell

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.160
about large groups of people.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.810
And sometimes the rituals
that we create, like Purim,

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:57.600
like even the Seder
dinner, where we act out

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.280
parts of the
religious narrative,

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.960
like we get to be
the divine, and we

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.932
get to be the heroes
in our stories.

00:52:05.932 --> 00:52:08.140
BOB SAGET: And talk of things
thousands of years old.

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.348
ROB ASKINS: Exactly, so it's
a way to place ourselves

00:52:10.348 --> 00:52:11.610
in the tradition.

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:14.914
But, yeah, they're also cute.

00:52:14.914 --> 00:52:17.655
GENEVA CARR: It's very Southern.

00:52:17.655 --> 00:52:18.460
It's very Southern.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.460
They do it in the South.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.350
This might be why
you don't know it.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:22.060
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I'm
from North Carolina,

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.330
and it didn't seem
out of place to me.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:28.500
STEVEN BOYER: I'm from Ohio, and
I knew about puppet ministry.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.157
It was something that made
its way to central Ohio.

00:52:31.157 --> 00:52:32.740
MICHAEL OBERHOLTZER:
I'm from Indiana.

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.823
I'm from the very same
sect of the Lutheran church

00:52:34.823 --> 00:52:36.510
as Rob Askins, and
I have never, ever

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:38.350
experienced puppet ministry.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:41.480
I had no idea what the
fuck this was-- seriously.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.845
So, go figure, right?

00:52:42.845 --> 00:52:44.220
ALAN SEALES: All
right, well. we.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:49.750
BOB SAGET: I was a
virgin until I was 17.

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.140
And up to 17, puppets
were all I had.

00:52:54.564 --> 00:52:55.480
ROB ASKINS: I love it.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.070
It was good, baby.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:57.361
BOB SAGET: A little sound bite.

00:52:59.144 --> 00:53:00.560
ALAN SEALES: Bob,
you're all done?

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.384
You're good?

00:53:01.384 --> 00:53:02.300
BOB SAGET: I think so.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.258
You're the first man
that's ever asked me that.

00:53:04.258 --> 00:53:05.477
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:08.484 --> 00:53:10.650
ALAN SEALES: All right,
handofgodbway.com, give them

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:11.896
another round of applause.

00:53:11.896 --> 00:53:12.888
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:12.888 --> 00:53:14.376
BOB SAGET: Thank you, Google.

00:53:14.376 --> 00:53:16.195
LUCAS MCMAHON: Thank
you for having us.

00:53:16.195 --> 00:53:17.770
STEVEN BOYER: Thank you so much.
