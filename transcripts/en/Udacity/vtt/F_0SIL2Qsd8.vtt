00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.130
In each step of the migratory path of the

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.450
Great Human Expansion, humans founded a new area with

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.690
a small population. Now this illustration here is showing

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.630
you the great genetic diversity of the population here in

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.510
Africa, and then as a subset of the population

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.720
moved over here to the Middle East for the first

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.080
time. And colonize the area. Notice the reduced number

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.210
of people, but also the reduced genetic diversity. This randomly

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.980
selected group had a much smaller gene pool. There's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.140
less allelic diversity than the bigger population over here

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.400
from where it came from. Of course, over the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.380
generations, this allowed new alleles to gain a foothold. For

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.800
example, the purple allele, in this case, is the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.000
most prevalent in this population. Whereas, over here, in the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.010
original population. Purple is prevalent, but maybe not to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.420
the same extent as it is in this new population.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.780
This specific bottleneck effect right here. Reduced

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.420
genetic variation at each founding spot. It

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.030
happened again as humans moved outward, and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.910
colonized new areas. Each time experiencing another

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.490
bottle neck. This altered the allelic composition

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.910
compared to the original population. Not only

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.850
from the population that it recently came

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.750
from, but the very original population out

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.560
of Africa. This special kind of bottleneck event is referred to as

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.960
a founder effect, because as you found a new area, a new founding

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.120
population, as you colonize an area, you have reduced genetic variability. So a

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.060
specific kind of bottleneck has occurred,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.770
that's referred to as the founder effect.
