00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.700
So we've made a lot of
progress on Sunshine.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I'm feeling a lot better about it.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.920
&gt;&gt; Right, but
you have to admit it's pretty boring.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.150
Oh come on, like you haven't noticed
that there's no way to personalize it.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.600
You know if it was my app there'd
be some sort of Cheyenne, right?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.330
So I was just wondering,
do you have any ideas?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.070
&gt;&gt; Actually yeah, I think there's a lot
we can do on the personalization side.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.420
I'm not sure about Cheyenne though.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, come on.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.460
Obviously everybody
needs a little Cheyenne.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll take your word on that.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.000
She is cute though.
