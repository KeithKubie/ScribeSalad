00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.900
We're asked to select which
fractions add together

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.350
to make 25 over 22, or 25/22.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.100
You can use as many
fractions as you need.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.615
Put all unused fractions
into the trash can.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:13.760
So let's think about
how we could do this.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.409
So I actually want to use
the largest fraction first,

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.700
just so I can get pretty close.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.300
So I'm going to make 16/22.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.620
And let's see, if
I add 8/22 to that,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.450
then that's going to get me
to--let's see, 16 plus 8,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.010
that gets me to 24/22.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.490
This is 16/22 plus 8/22
is going to get me 24/22.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.170
And if I get one more,
that gets me to 25/22.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.240
And then I could put these
unused ones down here

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.957
in the trash can.

00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:46.890
So I'm going to put these
unused ones down here.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.760
And let's actually
check our answer.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.360
Got it right.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.901
And there's multiple
ways that we

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.150
could have actually done this.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.820
Actually, it's not clear
that there's multiple ways

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.623
that we could have done this.

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:57.335
Let's see-- is
there any other way?

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:05.530
Yeah, because even if we
did the 2 and the 4 here,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.100
we would have to get to-- let's
see, 8 would get us to-- this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.280
is 2/22 plus 4/22
is 6/22, plus 8/22

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.005
is going to be 14/22, yeah.

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.510
And then if you put 16/22,
there's going to be too many.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.400
So actually, the way
we did it was the way

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.441
that you've got to do it.

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.720
So the 2 and the 4 I'm going
to put in the trash can.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.180
And 16 of something plus 1 of
something plus 8 of something

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.170
is going to be 25
of that something.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.503
And in this case, the something
that we're talking about

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:33.620
are 22nds.
