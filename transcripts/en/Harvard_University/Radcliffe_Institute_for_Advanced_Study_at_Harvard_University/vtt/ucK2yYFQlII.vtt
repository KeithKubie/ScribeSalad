00:00:06.552 --> 00:00:08.170
- Welcome back.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.970
I hope everyone
had a good lunch.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.620
And we are ready to
continue with our program.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.350
I'd like to invite Vincent
Brown to the podium,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.510
and he will introduce our
wonderful poet for the day.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.415
Vincent Brown is a Professor
of African American studies

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:33.190
and of History at
Harvard University.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.100
He's also the Director
of the History Design

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.140
Studio at Harvard.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.620
And he writes and teaches
on the African diaspora.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.540
Vincent.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.800
- Thank you, Evelyn, for that,
and thanks too to the President

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.910
Faust and to Dean Cohen and
everyone at Radcliffe who

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.940
helped make this
possible, this very timely

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.580
and I think important symposium.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.760
Thanks too for inviting me to
introduce the brilliant poet

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.470
Natasha Trethewey
this afternoon.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.280
We've been gathered to consider
how we live with the past

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.160
so that we can better
envision our future.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.680
We cannot undo
what has been done.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.030
We must remember it all, putting
our recollections together

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.880
in ways that allow us
to live our values,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.210
and to enact them
for common benefit.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.050
Now, I'm not a poet, and nor
am I particularly poetic,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.340
but as a historian, I'm humbled
by the way Natasha Trethewey

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.260
engages so deeply with history.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.510
And I'm intrigued by the
differences in the ways poets

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.820
and historians
work with the past.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.340
Historians tend to follow
chronological genre rules.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.570
We like time lines then move
our stories and arguments

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.790
along direct pathways.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.160
We hold on to the
arrow of time, pulled

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.140
along its fateful
trajectory toward what

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.420
we hope is the truth.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.950
Who owned slaves?

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.690
What work did they do?

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.139
How much profit did they
yield for their exploiters?

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.540
How did legacies of
privilege and loss

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.756
accumulate between then and now?

00:02:16.756 --> 00:02:18.380
Now, Professor
Trethewey would probably

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.020
be too polite to say
it, but in some ways,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.060
the chronological vectors
employed by historians

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.690
run parallel to the
typological classifications

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.690
of racial thinking.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.380
We mark clear distinctions
where there are only overlaps,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.190
intersections, and blurs.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.170
A thing happened in this
place on this day in this year

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.850
and we can tell
you how it changed

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.692
into that thing on
another day years later.

00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:45.150
But of course, this
isn't generally

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.240
the way people
experience the past,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.830
any more than it is
the way they experience

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.600
belonging and connection.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.040
Instead, most people look
backward, leap forward,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.730
or enter fugue states where
we can be every win at once.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.490
I am a slave.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.710
I suffer those lacerations.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.290
I endure the humiliations.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.970
I continue to service a debt
for credit I never received.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.970
This kind of experience
isn't easily represented

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.500
within chronology.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.650
Temporal life makes a more
aesthetic and poetic claim

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.820
to the truth.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.340
So rather than showing
how to write history,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.250
poets teach us how
to live with history.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.540
And in this, Natasha Trethewey
is a marvelous guide.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.540
She leads us into
history as participants,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.110
drawing us close to the
past, its aspirations,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.690
predicaments, and struggles.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.060
Alongside her, perhaps we
can see that better future.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.720
Her work certainly
shows it to me.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.060
So please join me in
welcoming the former 19th Poet

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.910
Laureate of the United States
of America, and former Radcliffe

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.420
Fellow, Emory University's
Robert W. Woodruff Professor

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.000
of English and Creative
Writing and soon

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.220
to be professor at
Northwestern University,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.005
because she says she likes
the cold, Natasha Trethewey.

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:09.985
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.620
- Thank you.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.490
Good afternoon.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:23.770
I am honored and delighted to
be at this wonderful conference.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.900
I'm going to read
a poem very much

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.370
about historical memory and
historical erasure, what

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.640
gets told, recorded,
passed down, who

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.430
does the telling, and
recording, and what's

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.770
left out of our national memory
about slavery, the Civil War,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.370
and the aftermath in
which we are now living.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.730
This is the imagined journal
of a former slave who

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.910
has enlisted in the Union Army.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.730
The first regiments of the
Louisiana Native Guards

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.760
were mustered into service
in September, October,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.720
and November of 1862,
and the second and third,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.690
made up of men who had been
slaves only a few months

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.520
before enlisting.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.410
During the war, the
Fort at Ship Island,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.750
Mississippi called
Fort Massachusetts,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.230
right across from my hometown,
Gulfport, Mississippi,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.190
they served as guards
to Confederate soldiers,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.250
military convicts,
and prisoners of war.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.170
One of the men on the island,
an Officer, Francis Dumas,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.080
the son of a white Creole
father and a mulatto mother who

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.990
had inherited slaves
when his father died.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.570
And although Louisiana
law prohibited him

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.410
from manumitting those
slaves, after the preliminary

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.290
Emancipation Proclamation,
he freed his slaves

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.110
and encourage those men of
age to join the native guards.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.120
The poem begins with an epigraph
from Frederick Douglass that

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.390
reads, "If this war
is to be forgotten,

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.480
I ask in the name of
all things sacred.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.740
What shall men remember?"

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.570
Native Guard, November, 1862.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.440
Truth be told, I do
not want to forget

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.200
anything of my former life, the
landscape's song of bondage,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.030
dirge in the river's throat,
where it churns into the Gulf,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.080
wind in trees choked with vines.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.440
I thought to carry with me
want of freedom, though I

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.780
had been freed, remembrance,
not constant recollection.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.470
Yes, I was born a
slave at harvest time

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.600
in the Parish of Ascension.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.800
I've reached 33 with history
of one younger inscribed

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.090
upon my back.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.430
I now use ink to keep record,
a closed book, not the lure

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.910
of memory, flawed,
changeful, that

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.530
dulls the lash for the master,
sharpens it for the slave.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.130
December, 1862.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.020
For the slave, having a master
sharpens the bend into work,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.320
the way the sergeant moves
us now to perfect battalion

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.150
drill dress parade.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.200
Still, we're called supply
units, not infantry.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.650
And so we dig trenches,
haul burdens for the army,

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.680
no less heavy than before.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.010
I heard the colonel
call it, nigger work.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.980
Half rations make our
work familiar still.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.920
We take those things we
need from the Confederates

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.720
abandoned homes, salt,
sugar, even this journal,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.720
near-full was someone else's
words, overlapped now,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.390
cross-hatched beneath mine,
on every page, his story

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.355
intersecting with my own.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.980
January, 1863.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.220
Oh, how history
intersects my own birth

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.650
upon a ship called
The Northern Star.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.700
And I'm delivered into a new
life, Fort Massachusetts,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.310
a great irony, both path
and destination of freedom,

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.310
I had not dared to travel.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:19.060
Here now, I walk ankle deep
in sand, fly-bitten, nearly

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.350
smothered by heat, and yet
I can look out upon the Gulf

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.260
and see the surf
breaking, tossing

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.940
the ships, the great gunboats
bobbing on the water.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.270
And are we not the same, slaves
in the hands of the master,

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.570
destiny?

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.860
Night sky red with the
promise of fortune,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.340
dawn, pink as new flesh,
healing, unfettered.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.300
January, 1863.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.120
Today, dawn red as warning,
unfettered supplies stacked

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.760
on the beach at our
landing, washed away

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.780
in the storm that rose too
fast, caught us unprepared.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.310
Later, as we worked, I
joined in the low singing

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.580
someone raised to pace
us, and felt a bond

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.760
in labor I had not known.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.690
It was then a dark
man removed his shirt,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.790
revealed the scars
crosshatched like the lines

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.030
in this journal on his back.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.670
It was he who remarked
at how the ropes cracked

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.280
like whips on the
sand, made us take

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.020
note of the wild dance of
the tent loosed by wind.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.700
We watched and learned.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.030
Like any shrewd
master, we know now

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.450
to tie down what we will keep.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.350
February, 1863.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.390
We know it is our
duty now to keep

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:55.020
white men as prisoners, rebel
soldiers, would-be masters.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.090
We're all bondsmen
here, each to the other.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.760
Freedom has gotten
them captivity,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.660
for us a conscription
we have chosen,

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.870
jailers to those who still
would have us slaves.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.930
They are cautious,
dreading the sight of us.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.170
Some neither read nor
write, are laid too low

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.760
and have few words to send,
but those, I give them.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.760
Still they are wary of a Negro
writing, taking down letters.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.240
X binds them to the
page, a mute symbol

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.430
like the cross on a grave.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.930
I suspect they fear I'll listen,
put something else down in ink.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.780
March, 1863.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.320
I listen, put down
in ink what I know

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.550
they labor to say between
silences too big for words,

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.290
worry for beloveds.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.470
My dearest, how are
you getting along?

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.740
What has become of their
small plots of land?

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.740
Did you harvest
enough food to put by?

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.680
They long for the
comfort of former lives.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.860
I see you as you
were, waving goodbye.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.670
Some send photographs,
a likeness in case

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.980
the body can't return.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.610
Others dictate harsh
facts of this war.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.730
The hot air carries
the stench of limbs,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.140
rotten in the bone pit,
flies swarm, a black cloud.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.390
We hunger, grow weak.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:32.090
When men die we eat
their share of hard tack.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.460
April, 1863.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.940
When men die, we eat
their share of hard tack,

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.000
trying not to recall their
hollow sockets, the worms

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.060
stench of their cheeks.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.560
Today, we buried
the last of our dead

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.110
from Pascagoula,
and those who died

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:54.390
retreating to our ship, white
sailors in blue firing upon us

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.300
as if we were the enemy.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.600
I thought the fighting over,
then watched a man fall

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.110
beside me, knees first
as in prayer, then

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.000
another, his arms outstretched
as if born upon the cross.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.740
Smoke that rose from each
gun seemed a soul departing.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.160
The colonel said, an
unfortunate incident.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.850
Said, their names shall
deck the page of history.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.580
June, 1863.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.430
Some names shall deck
the page of history

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.650
as it is written on stone.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.350
Some will not.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.590
Yesterday, word came of colored
troops dead on the battlefield

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.670
at Port Hudson, how General
Banks was heard to say,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.890
I have no dead there,
and left them unclaimed.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.520
Last night, I dreamt
their eyes still open,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:56.040
dim, clouded as the eyes of
fish washed ashore, yet fixed,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.110
staring back at me.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.580
Still, more come today, eager
to enlist, their bodies,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.680
haggard faces, gaunt limbs,
bring news of the mainland.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.740
Starved, they suffer
like are prisoners.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.820
Dying, they plead for what
we do not have to give.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.035
Death makes equals of
us all, a fair master.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.350
August, 1864.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.230
Dumas was a fair
master to us all.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.910
He taught me to read and write.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.510
I was a man servant,
if not a man.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.290
At my work, I studied natural
things, all manner of plants,

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:44.190
birds, I draw now in my book,
wren, willet, egret, loon.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.970
Tending the gardens, I thought
only to study live things,

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.990
thought never to know
so much about the dead.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.920
Now I tend Ship Island
graves, mounds like dunes

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.590
that shift and disappear.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.860
I record names, send
home simple notes,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.780
not much more than how and
when, an official duty.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.590
I'm told it's best
to spare most detail.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:15.180
But I know there are things
which must be accounted for.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.800
1865.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.380
These are things which
must be accounted

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.460
for, slaughter under the
white flag of surrender,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.510
black massacre at Fort
Pillow, our new name, the Core

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.380
D'Afrique, words that take
the native from our claim,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.210
mossbacks and freedmen,
exiles in their own homeland,

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.680
the diseased, the maimed, every
lost limb and what remains,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.370
phantom ache, memory
haunting an empty sleeve,

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.180
the hog-eaten at Gettysburg,
unmarked in their graves,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.560
all the dead letters unanswered,
untold stories of those

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.040
that time will render mute.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.040
Beneath battlefields,
green again,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.740
the dead molder, a scaffolding
of bone we tread upon,

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.450
forgetting truth be told.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.650
Thank you.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.400
[APPLAUSE]
