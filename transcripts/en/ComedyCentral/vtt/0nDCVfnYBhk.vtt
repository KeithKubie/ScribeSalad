00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.508
AND HIS 1,000 ROUGH RIDERS
GO TO CUBA.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.076
THE TRANSPORT SHIP
ISN'T BIG ENOUGH.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.879
300 GUYS HAVE TO STAY BEHIND.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:16.216
EVERY OTHER GUY HAD
TO LEAVE HIS HORSE BEHIND.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.186 line:0%
 
SO THESE GUYS LAND IN CUBA,

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.888 line:0%
 
AND THEY GET AMBUSHED.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.423
THEY'RE IN A VALLEY
BETWEEN TWO HILLS

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.760
WHERE THE SPANISH
HAVE THE UPPER HAND.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.796
THEY'RE SITTING DUCKS.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:34.768
TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S MEN
START TAKING FIRE.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:39.806
HE LOSES OVER 200 OF HIS MEN
IN THIS 20 MINUTES.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.042
TEDDY ROOSEVELT RIDES UP
TO THE SECOND-IN-COMMAND

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.845
OF THE REGULAR ARMY,
AND HE SAYS,

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.415
WE'RE GETTING OUR ASSES KICKED
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.317
THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA SURVIVE

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.719
IS IF WE CHARGE
UP THIS HILL.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:56.456
AND THE SECOND-IN-COMMAND
OF THE REGULAR ARMY SAYS,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.359
THE COLONEL ISN'T HERE
TO MAKE THAT CALL.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.395
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:05.132
AND TEDDY ROOSEVELT SAYS,
I AM A COLONEL.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.502
IT'S MY CALL NOW.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.305
HE RIDES,
UNAFRAID OF BULLETS,

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.373
TO THE FRONT LINES.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.343
HERE, TEDDY ROOSEVELT
IS HERE.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:21.114
HIS HISTORY AND HIS PEOPLE
ARE STANDING BEHIND HIM.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:24.685
HE SAYS, I'M GONNA GO.

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:26.687
I'M GOING UP THIS HILL.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.722
AND I'M GONNA--

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.759
AND I'M GONNA DEFEAT
THESE SPANISH FORCES.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:35.662
FOLLOW ME.

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:38.699
AND IF YOU TURN AROUND,
I WILL SHOOT YOU.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.435
SO TEDDY ROOSEVELT
LED THIS CHARGE

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:46.173
AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED
TEDDY ROOSEVELT UP THE HILL.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.309
THEY BEAT BACK
THE SPANISH FORCES.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:52.112
AND THE SPANISH FORCES
RETREATED,

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.115
BUT TEDDY ROOSEVELT
KEPT CHARGING,

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:59.286
AND WITHIN TWO WEEKS,
SPAIN SURRENDERED.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.556
WHEN HE WAS 11 YEARS OLD,
TEDDY ROOSEVELT SAID,

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.158
IF I'M GONNA BE ANYTHING,

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:08.896
THE THING THAT I'M GONNA BE
IS A BADASS.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.901
AND THAT DAY, HE FULFILLED
THAT PROMISE TO HIS YOUNG SELF,

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:17.237
AND HE BECAME
A [bleep] ROCK STAR.

00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:20.240
[triumphant music]

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:20.340
