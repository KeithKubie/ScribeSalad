00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If we increase of change of susceptible persons, that cannot possibly be vaccination.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We also would increase the total number with that if you form S+I+R, the total number.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You'll see that the rate of change of the total number would be precisely

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
these 1,000 person a day positive rate of change.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It cannot be deaths, so we're left with births and immigration. Births do not make too much sense.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The total number of persons would increase, but as the total number of persons increases,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the number of births should also be increasing.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It should not be constant. What's left is immigration, which makes much sense.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
1,000 susceptible persons are added to the population per day.
