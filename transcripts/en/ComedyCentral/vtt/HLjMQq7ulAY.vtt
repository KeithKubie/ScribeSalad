00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
Hun's kuba here disguised as a Flula Borg at the roasting of Bruce Willis aka John McClane not certain when he changed his name

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.410
I'm going to speak with visitors of this roasting and find out whether all my detonators

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.969
Give me some tips of how I can defeat him. Finally. I think you can only defeat him with words words

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.150
So write a haiku, you know, don't go after his

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.430
Waterfalls, it's all about the eye contact and the list, you know, this throws action here is off. Everybody knows that that's a confusion

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430
So I should say confusing

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.750
But stronger kung fu film film, yes, exactly. Luckily he's getting very old

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.809
Age ain't nothing but a no age is actually important, you know, he's often barefoot

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.829
So I'd put a lot of obstacles on the ground tell that he lives in air ducts

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.128
So I would just pump a lot of gases through those ducts and you know take his wife. Are you guys friends now?

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.169
Have you been able to wrap things up? I sent him to MySpace page requests. Just nothing

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:07.869
How can the same witch happen to the same guy twice

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.969
I think it's actually five times now, you know, that's what life is it's just like the same

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.549
it over and over so

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.479
I

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.608
Hope I never like have to do this again. You know, we're out the detonators

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.079
Where am I definite us who they're hidden in the gimps outfit?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.309
I'm pretending to know what you're talking about because I literally have never seen any of his films here

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.610
Is that what you wanted me to do? And that's the

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.519
Detonator. Oh, here it is. That's not what is this? What is this Trapper Keeper?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.220
my detonators are up bearish that's with a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780
You
