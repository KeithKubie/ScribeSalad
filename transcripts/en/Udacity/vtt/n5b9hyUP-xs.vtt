collected and provide a discussion of its implications. This often means

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.560
offering an explanation for of any unexpected values you see. This section also

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.160
allows you to reflect on the experimentation itself including any suggestions,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.860
any suggested further work or for improving the study process itself.
