00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.900
Let me just show you some examples
of what we mean by tracking.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.390
And here is some slightly older ones.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.440
The one on the left here is
this girl jumping around.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.140
You see the little red
ring around her head.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.760
That's, I think that's Andrew Blake's
daughter a long time ago.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.870
I think she's now a lawyer.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.710
So that tells you something
about the time difference.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.510
Andrew, I have no idea if that's true.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.720
And also from a similar work is
this leaf blowing in the wind.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.780
And you'll notice,
as the camera zooms in and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.620
out and things move around, it does a
pretty good job of sticking to the leaf.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.530
Both of these examples were work
that Andrew and Michael Isard did in

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.760
the particular type of tracking that
we'll actually do not this lecture, but

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.000
a couple lessons from now.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.820
Here is a slightly more recent one.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.100
This is a tracking of body
parts as somebody's moving.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.410
And you can see the,
the reference there.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.240
And again, this is a tracking problem,
but it's tracking with a model.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.000
Right?
So the idea is I

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.480
want to be able to track
where the parts have moved.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.490
Here you see a sort of a more
traditional notion of tracking.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.580
But in this case,
it's lots of targets, right?

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.760
So there are a lot of people say
walking around in the street here.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.440
And you'll notice that it
does a really good job

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.550
of keeping track of all the people.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.387
The little box that's
around each one of them and

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:11.050
there's another little
box that's on their head.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.650
Here there's just a little bit of
animation showing you that it's

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.740
tracking them through spacetime, right?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.530
So this volume with these
trajectories through there

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.430
are showing you how it's doing
the reasoning over spacetime.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.000
There are a couple of interesting
things to notice here.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.462
Watch this guy going behind the pole.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:31.480
All right, so he goes behind the pole
and he appears the other side.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.740
And you might ask, how does it do that?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.030
&gt;&gt; How does it do that?

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.790
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you yet.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.730
I'll tell you soon.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.920
And also here, it's showing you just the
heads that have been tracked to show you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.120
that it's recovered that.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.910
So this is an example of sort of a state
of the art tracking at least of a,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.000
of a couple of years ago.
