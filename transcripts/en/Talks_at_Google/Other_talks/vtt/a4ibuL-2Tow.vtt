BRIAN CUSACK: I'm here today
with Jim Koch, the founder

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.100
and chairman of Boston Beer
Company that you guys all know

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.050
was the brewer of Sam Adams.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.500
He does have a new book out.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.865
He's in his 32 year--
is that correct?

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:24.490
JIM KOCH: Yeah.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.372
BRIAN CUSACK: Of brewing
Sam Adams beer and a number

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:28.455
of other different things.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.044
You going to crack
one for me too, Jim?

00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:31.960
JIM KOCH: If you want.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.330
BRIAN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.630
JIM KOCH: I hate drinking alone.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.338
BRIAN CUSACK: OK.

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.990
Well, you've got
about 110 people here

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.366
at some point they are going
to be drinking with you.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.050
And maybe more that just
aren't here for this.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.610
Thank you very much.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.090
So I just want to start off
with a couple of questions

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.115
about authoring first.

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:52.490
And then we'll
get into the beer.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.990
OK?

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.550
We'll get into the beer talk
and the Boston Beer story.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.830
So I'm curious, Jim, in
the last several years,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.560
I know-- I tried to start
counting last night-- I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.410
think I know between five and
10 people-- five and 10 Boston

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.970
business people
who have published

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.910
books in the last couple
years about business.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.810
And I just wondering what's
your-- what was your motivation

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.650
today or when you started
this project to write a book,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.470
and what were you
trying-- what did

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.660
you want to contribute
to the business dialogue

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.310
or for folks like
this in your book?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.640
And cheers by the
way, another book.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.940
JIM KOCH: Cheers.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.740
BRIAN CUSACK: OK.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.190
JIM KOCH: I got better head.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.150
Always a good thing.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.600
I'm sorry.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.810
I'm really sorry.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.410
So I apologize.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.620
It's a little weird for me
to be speaking to all of you,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.580
realizing that I am the
stupidest person in the room.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.040
But I've had 18 beers today.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.230
Not full beers but
tasting and sampling

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.000
so maybe-- you all
may be smarter than me

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.275
but I've had more beer.

00:01:58.275 --> 00:01:59.400
BRIAN CUSACK: Which might--

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.250
JIM KOCH: We'll see
how that works out.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.590
BRIAN CUSACK: Which
might make you smarter.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.350
JIM KOCH: We'll see.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.058
BRIAN CUSACK: OK.

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:04.240
JIM KOCH: We'll see.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.740
So I'm sorry, the question was,
what made me write the book?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.040
BRIAN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.400
What motivated you to
write a book today or now.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.150
JIM KOCH: Well, it
wasn't so much today.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.250
I started working on it
three or four years ago.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.230
I was actually
surprised at how much

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.340
work it is to actually
write a book as opposed

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.730
to ghost writing it or
something like that.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.100
It was a lot of work, it was my
summer project for three years.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.300
The motivations were, over 32
years I've had a lot of people

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.130
ask me, you know, Jim,
what did you learn?

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.870
You started something
in your kitchen,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.599
whatever, helped create a
whole revolution in beer.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.890
Did you learn anything from it?

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.720
It was kind of depressing
when I wrote it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.550
because it's divided up into
chapters and each one of them

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.560
is kind of a story with
a lesson-- so something

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.380
that I learned-- and I
started Sam Adams 32 years ago

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.990
and there's like 40
chapters in the book.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.560
I mean, do the math.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.620
I only learned one thing a year.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.440
That's not a lot
but it's all I had.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.420
So that was one
reason I wrote it,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.260
was to kind of put down on
paper what I had learned

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.830
and-- I didn't want it
to be a normal business

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.645
book because, frankly,
most business books,

00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:37.460
they're ghost written and
they have one or two ideas

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.870
and then they stretch
them out to 180 pages

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.070
and they'd have been much
better as a five page "Business

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.300
Review" article because
that's what there is

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.530
and then there's one
idea and then they just

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.090
beat the thing to death.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.300
And my experience
was not that way.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:09.180
It wasn't a single big truth
but rather stories and lessons

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.080
from them.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.720
And I don't know, I
guess, philosophically, we

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.905
have Plato and Aristotle
and for Plato knowledge

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:27.200
was almost mathematical,
Pythagorean, geometric,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.260
everything that
was real knowledge

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.490
had to be universal and
necessary and constant.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.100
And I don't think
business knowledge

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.960
is universal and
necessary and certain.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:53.490
It's more contextual
and probabilistic

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.200
rather than A squared plus
B squared equals C squared.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:07.280
So I wanted to approach business
learning in a more Aristotelian

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.680
way, that it's stories
and we learn by stories,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.590
and knowledge is contextual
and probabilistic.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.790
So that was one reason.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.550
I guess the other reason was
so that my children would

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.400
know what I was doing
when I wasn't there.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.510
BRIAN CUSACK: OK.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.770
JIM KOCH: Missed
their soccer games

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.880
and their plays
and all that stuff.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.140
Which anybody who
starts a business,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.430
I don't want to make it too
beautiful and idealistic.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.070
There's lots of
sacrifices and there's

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.850
a certain amount of pain
that comes with the territory

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.790
because you really have
to make trade-offs.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.630
And so I wanted my children to
know what I was doing when I

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.050
should have been
there and wasn't.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.633
BRIAN CUSACK: Have
they read the book?

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:02.425
JIM KOCH: Oh, yeah.

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:04.299
BRIAN CUSACK: And were
they pleased with what

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:05.190
you were doing?

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.110
What did they take from it?

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.290
JIM KOCH: They were like,
Dad, you swear too much.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.170
And we'll see.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.440
They will absorb it.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.590
But to me, actually, also
did the auto book myself.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.130
So I recorded every
word of that book

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.454
so that my grandchildren
could actually hear my voice.

00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.870
BRIAN CUSACK: So there's a
legacy component to it as well.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.900
JIM KOCH: You don't leave
behind that much in this world.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.250
BRIAN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.500
So there's a legacy component.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.800
Also, by using the
word Aristotelian,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.095
you've elevated yourself
to the 25th percentile

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:43.280
of smarts in the room.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.560
JIM KOCH: All right!

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.240
BRIAN CUSACK: All right?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.680
JIM KOCH: I'm getting
closer, you guys.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.013
BRIAN CUSACK: You're doing well.

00:06:47.013 --> 00:06:48.634
JIM KOCH: I'm getting closer.

00:06:48.634 --> 00:06:49.550
BRIAN CUSACK: Second--

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.966
JIM KOCH: I was going to say
stochastic but I don't really

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:53.470
know what it means.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.820
I said probabilistic.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.278
BRIAN CUSACK:
Neither do I. I would

00:06:56.278 --> 00:06:58.604
have got to the 50th
percentile for that one.

00:06:58.604 --> 00:06:59.520
What did you write on?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.870
What kind of device?

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.445
JIM KOCH: Everyone has a dirty
little secret in this world.

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:06.070
BRIAN CUSACK: Do you
have a typewriter?

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.030
JIM KOCH: My dirty little
secret is I can't type.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.630
I really-- I mean, everybody
here grew up with typing and I

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.450
didn't.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.920
I was in college-- I
made it through college

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.600
by always finding a girl
friend who could type.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.920
That kind of worked.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.520
And we-- at Boston Beer we
avoided email for as long

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.820
as possible and did
things off of voicemail.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.285
Which has its own
special advantages,

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:34.660
and I'm not sure
which is better,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.190
but email has clearly
triumphed over voicemail.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.980
So I-- the book was
either transcribed

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:51.970
into a voice recorder and
then typed out or handwritten.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.460
So I wrote a lot
of it on legal pads

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.780
with different--
because it was a--

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.150
which is a somewhat sensual
experience, a tactile

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.500
of actually writing
something and actually caring

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.347
what the letters look like.

00:08:09.347 --> 00:08:11.180
BRIAN CUSACK: As is
reading the book itself,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.810
is the actual sensation of
the pages in the modern world.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.205
You know, the book
itself is this tactile.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:17.830
JIM KOCH: Yeah.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.110
And there was a
guy here, I can't

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.355
remember what his first
name was, he was at MIT,

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:27.352
it was 10, 15 years ago--
something Negroponte.

00:08:27.352 --> 00:08:28.310
BRIAN CUSACK: Nicholas.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.005
Nicholas--

00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:29.209
JIM KOCH: Nicholas.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:29.280
OK.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:29.520
BRIAN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.170
Nicholas Negroponte.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.870
JIM KOCH: Right.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.840
And he wrote a book
called "Being Digital"

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.390
and I remember reading
it and thinking,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.220
this is pretty
interesting because he's

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.880
talking about being digital
and he wrote it in a book.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880
BRIAN CUSACK: Well, he--

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.310
JIM KOCH: And at the end
of the day I was like,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.602
a book is pretty user-friendly.

00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:49.643
BRIAN CUSACK: Sure it is.

00:08:49.643 --> 00:08:51.710
JIM KOCH: It's actually
much more user-friendly

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.460
than a Kindle.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.400
BRIAN CUSACK: And at
that point in time

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.130
it was probably going to reach
more people than any other form

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.630
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.600
JIM KOCH: Still does.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.960
More books, I believe, are
read as physical books than as

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.939
digital.

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:04.730
BRIAN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.280
JIM KOCH: Paper's
pretty user-friendly.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.330
BRIAN CUSACK: Absolutely.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.615
Now, I did read the book.

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:09.430
JIM KOCH: Good.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.310
The book.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.650
BRIAN CUSACK: I read the book.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.300
JIM KOCH: The physical book.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.633
BRIAN CUSACK: The physical book.

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:13.280
JIM KOCH: OK.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.040
BRIAN CUSACK: And take
us back 33, 34 years

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.277
and just tell us the story.

00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:23.110
I know it's really super
basic, but how'd it

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.862
start, why did it start?

00:09:24.862 --> 00:09:26.070
JIM KOCH: Very good question.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.320
And I'll give you sort of--
or go back to the beginning.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.620
I was born, I was very small.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.050
I got bitter as I got older.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.550
BRIAN CUSACK: You went down to
the 10th percentile just now.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.030
JIM KOCH: All right.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.820
It feels very comfortable.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:51.330
I grew up in Ohio-- in southern
Ohio-- and when I was 17

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.320
the letter came in
the mail that changed

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.197
the trajectory of my life
because I went to public school

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.530
in southern Ohio and I was
first kid from my high school

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.530
to go to Harvard.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.640
And that was just-- I
go back to my reunions

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.460
and I realize how
important that was.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.760
I came here, went
to Harvard College,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:23.430
and then went to-- Harvard has
this masochistic program that

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.200
allows you to do a JD and an MBA
in four years instead of five.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.630
So I started there.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.200
So I started right
out of college

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.670
and went to this JD MBA program.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.820
Did the first year of law
school, the first year business

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.330
school, and was just
sort of burnt out.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.160
And I did something-- apparently
I'm the only one that's

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.560
ever done it-- I dropped out.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.330
Just dropped out.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.580
And left because I felt like--
I talk about it in "Quench Your

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.840
Own Thirst"-- but
I felt like, OK,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.800
I was in this river that was
moving me along and the place

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.910
that it was going to go, which
was back then corporate America

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:14.110
or big law firms, I didn't
want either one of them.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.460
And I didn't know how
to find an alternative

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.039
and I couldn't resist the
force of the river, so I said,

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.080
I got to get out of here.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.510
So I dropped out,
worked odd jobs,

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:33.540
everything from Manpower--
you know, which was $2 an hour

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.360
stuffing shampoo bottles into
variety packs-- to [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.300
but mainly I worked
for something

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:48.000
called Outward Bound which
is experiential education.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.140
And it taught me a great deal
about leadership because--

00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:01.070
and it was-- well, you get
eight or 10 people, average age

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.815
early 20s, 28 days late-- take
them out in the wilderness,

00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:07.023
28 days later you're supposed
to bring them all back.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.850
And there's all these business
books about leadership

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.320
that are OK.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.450
They're talking about
leadership in an office

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.502
and they're all important, but
what I got out of Outward Bound

00:12:22.502 --> 00:12:23.960
was a different
kind of leadership.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.400
It was out in the wilderness,
and most importantly,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.410
if you made bad decisions you
had a decent chance, sooner

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.150
or later, somebody was
going to get killed dead.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.250
And it actually happened
on a companion patrol

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.580
to mine where my
equivalent, the instructor,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.740
made some bad decisions
and he killed a girl.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.020
And it's no fun finding
bodies and bringing

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.290
them back-- they
begin to smell--

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.440
it's not a fun experience.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.400
And it's a very
dramatic experience.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.720
And that taught me
things about leadership

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.920
that you're not going to
learn at business school.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.090
And some of them,
when I wrote the book,

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.440
I realized, wow, I learned a lot
of things from Outward Bound,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.680
maybe more than I learned at
business school or law school.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.750
And eventually, after
three and a half years,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.672
I realized, OK,
this is not what--

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:24.130
I don't want to be
an Outward Bound

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.190
instructor for the
rest of my life,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.790
I'm going to go back and
get finish my education.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:34.510
Which I did and I
spent six years working

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.210
for Boston Consulting Group
back in the early days.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.892
And after six years I
thought, OK, I like this,

00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:45.225
it's challenging, there's a
lot of intellectual content.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.150
It's a great job.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:55.190
I had this beautiful office
on the 33 floor of 60 State

00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:00.240
Street, it looked over the
harbor, you fly first class,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.780
you stay at the--
all that stuff.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.600
But I thought, is
this what I want

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.670
to do for the rest of my life?

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.520
And the answer was, no.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.770
And then I realized,
well, the rest of my life

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.226
starts tomorrow,
so if I don't want

00:14:14.226 --> 00:14:15.600
to do it for the
rest of my life,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.960
I don't want to do it tomorrow.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.210
And I went in and
I gave my notice.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.550
I don't know what
I was going to do

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:27.450
but I knew that I didn't want
to work for a big company.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:33.030
I've had this somewhat
unusual career experience--

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.510
I'm 67 now, had multiple jobs--
but one of the things I've

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.250
never had is a boss.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.870
I've never had a boss.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.740
And so I realized, I'm
a really bad employee.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.110
There must be some reason
I've never had a boss.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.910
I've avoided things
where you actually

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.990
have to come into
an office, work

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.620
in the same place every
day, and report to somebody.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.360
And I didn't want to have that
at the time so I thought, well,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.490
maybe I'll-- I'll
start my own company.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.580
And this was in 1983, 1984.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.040
Somewhat unusual.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.240
I mean, we are now in
a much better culture,

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:22.710
but back then, there was no
fast company, no real culture

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.820
of entrepreneurship.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:29.290
It was a somewhat-- there wasn't
much even of a venture capital

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.180
community at that point.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.130
But it was just
starting to happen

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.130
and I thought about, well,
what do I want to do?

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.940
I looked at-- my experience
was-- once I quit my job,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.620
ideas sort of flooded in.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.330
And I guess I would
think about it

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.910
as, we're all kind
of radio recei--

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:58.370
we're all receivers and ideas
for businesses are out there.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.530
They're like radio
frequencies and it's

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.140
a matter of not finding them,
it's a matter of tuning in.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.980
And once you tune
in, there's lots

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.670
of stations playing and
lots of opportunities

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.860
and interesting
things you can do.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.520
And Google has this
amazing culture

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.200
of encouraging that within
a corporate structure,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.800
which in and of itself, is
a huge reinvention of how

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.500
organizations function.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.270
And the opportunities
that are out there.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.470
One of the things that I guess
I would hope people remember

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.400
is, we all live
in the status quo.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.220
The status quo sucks.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.590
The only reason the
status quo exists

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.880
is because nobody's figured
out how to make it better.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.430
But somebody will.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:57.380
Whatever element the
status quo there is,

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.570
somebody will eventually figure
out how to make it better.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.190
And that was kind
of my mentality of,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.920
I'm going to find something
where I can do that.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.410
I have this peculiar
background-- family background,

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:17.329
I guess-- I am the sixth oldest
son in a row in my family

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.380
to be a brewer.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:19.881
A brewer.

00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:20.755
BRIAN CUSACK: Brewer.

00:17:20.755 --> 00:17:22.329
JIM KOCH: My father
was a brewmaster,

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.819
my grandfather was a brewmaster,
my great grandfather,

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:28.750
my great great grandfather, my
great great great grandfather

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.222
were all brewmasters.

00:17:31.222 --> 00:17:32.680
BRIAN CUSACK: In
the United States?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.971
JIM KOCH: In the United States.

00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:35.030
Before that in Germany.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.030
And I don't really care.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.780
I'm American.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.070
Forget about Germany.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.569
I just happen to be American
and I'm proud of it.

00:17:44.569 --> 00:17:46.443
To me it's a better deal
than being a German.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.610
That's just my
personal preference.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.500
So I thought-- and there was
this sort of gravitational pull

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.210
about brewing.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.840
And my dad discouraged me.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.320
I told him, you know--
well, let's see,

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.830
the stimulus came from
reading an article that

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.280
was in "Inc. Magazine"
when they first started.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.740
It was December,
I think, of 1983

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.990
and they wrote about a
brewery in San Francisco

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.790
called Anchor Brewing.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:25.010
And they were an outlier.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.000
When I was at BCG,
a lot of what we did

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.360
was find relationships
between one thing and another,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:42.147
that bigger lowers
costs or, I don't know--

00:18:42.147 --> 00:18:43.480
BRIAN CUSACK: Smaller is faster.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.400
JIM KOCH: Smaller is faster, all
these general rules of business

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.850
that you would find.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.300
And the problem with
the general rules

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.050
is they're the general rules
and most people know him.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.600
So there's not really
much advantage there.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.160
What was-- really
where the value added

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.940
was in the outliers,
the points off the line.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.640
And it always fascinated me.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.650
I'd draw these graphs and
you'd see the general rule

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.170
and you'd tell the client that.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.270
But then I'd look at the points
that weren't on the line.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:22.620
I remember in 1978, like in
building cars, volume per style

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.990
lowered costs for
virtually every auto

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.450
maker in the world
who wasn't Japanese.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.870
And the Japanese had lower
cost, higher quality,

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.270
and shorter runs,
smaller volume per style.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.140
Those outliers where
all the truth is.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:46.680
So Anchor's-- Anchor Brewing was
an outlier and the truth hidden

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:58.540
in their being the outlier was
that volume and scale are not

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.250
necessary to be profitable
and successful if you offer

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:08.070
a unique, differentiated,
and higher quality product.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:13.030
And so that was
essential insight

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:17.940
that started Sam
Adams was if I make

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.750
that-- if I make great beer
here in the United States,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.421
somebody is going to drink it
and I can build a business out

00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:27.920
of that.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.950
Now, it's embarrassing to
go look at my business plan.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.540
If I did write one,
it's not that long,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:42.010
but it's got some graphs and
it back-- you all won't even

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:46.410
know this but they used to
have to print special log log

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.760
paper because you
couldn't do it with Excel.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.390
There was no such thing.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.220
So they were-- people printed
log log papers, semi log

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.170
papers so you could plot
logarithmic and semi

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.670
logarithmic relationships.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.170
I did this business plan with
these kinds of things in it.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.560
I thought I was really smart.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.740
I looked at small scale brewing.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:15.420
There was no craft brewing, the
term hadn't been invented yet.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.970
There were just a handful of
wackos that we're doing this.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:26.040
Bike mechanics, dope
smokers, odd balls

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.230
that were going into this.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.920
And my business plan that
I raised my money on,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.490
and it was-- I
raised $140,000 and I

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:43.860
had $100,000 myself-- was that
I would grow for five years,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:50.590
reach 5,000 barrels of beer,
a million dollars in revenue,

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.460
eight employees, and I could
pay myself $80,000 a year,

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.270
which is probably $150,000
in today's dollars.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.710
And I thought, if
I could just do

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.439
that, I would be a happy
man for the rest of my life.

00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:04.230
BRIAN CUSACK: That was
your five year plan?

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.740
JIM KOCH: That was
my permanent plan.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.531
BRIAN CUSACK: That was
your permanent plan.

00:22:07.531 --> 00:22:09.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.090
JIM KOCH: Projection was 5,000
barrels, a million dollars,

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.050
I would plateau.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.141
BRIAN CUSACK: OK.

00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:14.640
So--

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.800
JIM KOCH: Didn't work out.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.010
BRIAN CUSACK: So I don't want
to go through every chapter,

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.340
but-- so how about this.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.290
At five years, where were you?

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.242
JIM KOCH: Well, let me think.

00:22:31.242 --> 00:22:32.940
Let me put it this way.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.670
We hit 5,000 barrels not in
five years but in five months.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.780
BRIAN CUSACK: OK.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.822
JIM KOCH: And we are
now over four million.

00:22:41.822 --> 00:22:43.280
BRIAN CUSACK: Four
million barrels.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.354
JIM KOCH: So I was off
by almost 1,000 to one.

00:22:46.354 --> 00:22:47.770
But it was in the
right direction.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.170
So it's OK to be wrong
as long as you're

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.310
in the right direction.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.020
BRIAN CUSACK: Do
you actually think

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.020
there might be a lesson when you
look back at the simplicity--

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.610
not the accuracy of
your business plan

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.080
but the simplicity of
your business plan,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.330
that there's a lesson in that?

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.685
JIM KOCH: Absolutely.

00:23:00.685 --> 00:23:04.580
And it's an important
lesson because it

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.200
had a simple idea that clearly
had upside if I could do it.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.740
And, in addition,
the truth-- and I

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.610
wrote it in the last
chapter of the book.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.760
It was actually the only
chapter where I sat down,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.950
wrote the whole thing straight
through in about an hour,

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.666
and the editor
didn't fuck with it.

00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:31.580
So it's like the absolute
most sincere chapter.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.500
But I had a chance
to think about,

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:41.980
what if I'd done my
business plan and no more?

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.100
Where would I be now?

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.920
And I realized, I'd
be just as happy.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.350
Maybe happier.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.940
Because my plan was I'd
have this little niche

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.460
business making great
beer, become a beacon

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.280
for quality brewing
in the United States,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.090
and I wouldn't have to drag
my ass all over the country

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.050
and it wouldn't be
that complicated

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.760
and I could work 40
or 50 hour weeks.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.120
And I realized,
had that happened,

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.404
I'd probably be just as happy,
maybe happier, than today.

00:24:17.404 --> 00:24:18.570
BRIAN CUSACK: But who knows.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:19.403
JIM KOCH: Who knows.

00:24:19.403 --> 00:24:21.080
BRIAN CUSACK: But who knows.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.980
Can you tell us about
the name of the beer?

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.813
JIM KOCH: Sam Adams?

00:24:23.813 --> 00:24:24.800
BRIAN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.550
JIM KOCH: OK.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.530
I'll tell you the
real story because--

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.120
BRIAN CUSACK: And
what it almost was.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.994
JIM KOCH: Well, there
was a couple of things.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.740
My background was
in manufacturing.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.420
I was a manufacturing
consultant so I

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.220
had no experience
with marketing,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.220
I didn't really have
a great opinion of it.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.140
In manufacturing it's all about
making a superior product,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.700
and I believe that's
actually true with everything

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.710
that you do.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.140
So I don't know what
to name the beer

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.200
and I had a whole bunch
of different names.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.390
I thought of them.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.770
My original one was to
call it what it was.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.420
Because the recipe for
Sam Adams Boston Lager

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.280
came from my great
great grandfather's

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.690
brewery in St.
Louis where he made

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:18.540
this beer in the
1860s, '70s, and '80s,

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.990
kind of during the golden
age of American brewing

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.930
when American
brewers were making

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.680
rich, flavorful beer
that was winning awards

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.320
all over the world.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.815
And I thought,
well, I'll call it

00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:34.110
what it was originally called
which was Louis Koch Lager.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.240
Now, unfortunately, my name
is German and it's spelled

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.070
K-O-C-H. And people are
prone to mispronounce that,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.215
sometimes in an obscene way.

00:25:46.215 --> 00:25:48.570
So somebody looked
at it and said, Jim,

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.830
you can't call it that.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.930
I mean, particularly,
you've got it

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.200
in a 12 ounce long neck bottle.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.070
People got to put
that in their mouth.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.420
I just don't think
that's a good idea.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.565
And that was a
lesson light in time.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.190
Well, maybe that's not
something that people

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.790
want to put in their mouth
in that long neck bottle.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.340
So I thought, OK, I'll
think of something else

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.090
and so I came up with a
bunch of different names,

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.200
including Samuel Adams.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.100
But one of my original
investors was a marketing guy

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.500
and he's like, Jim, you can't
just come up with these names.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.200
You don't know what you're
doing, you need a professional,

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.950
you need to find professionals
who can name your beer for you.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.890
And I was like, well,
are there people

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.592
who make a living naming beers?

00:26:36.592 --> 00:26:41.040
And he said, no, no, no, no,
get an ad agency, they'll do it.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.880
And so I found this ad agency.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.520
It was actually
three bartenders.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.710
So I said, OK, I
like these guys.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.570
And for, I don't know what
it was, two, three grand,

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:54.590
I was like, can you
come up with a name?

00:26:54.590 --> 00:27:00.050
And I explained to them I want
an assertively American name.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.870
I'm not trying to be a fake
European beer because there

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.110
were a lot of them back then.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.010
Lowenbrau was brewed
by Miller and there

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.240
were a whole bunch of German
sounding-- Earl Langer

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:19.070
and even Michelob is a Bavari--
Bohemian brewing village.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.520
So I want an assertively
American name

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.000
that would be a good bar call.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.430
So they listened to
all this and understand

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:29.370
what I'm trying to do.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.240
And then two weeks
later I come back

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.013
for-- I don't know if anybody's
been through an ad agency

00:27:36.013 --> 00:27:36.554
presentation.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:39.780
OK.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.990
I hear the laughter.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:49.910
So it's kind of
this kabuki theater

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.430
and they go through
this thing like,

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.130
oh, we heard
everything you said,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.150
we listened, you wanted a name
that was assertively American

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.220
and a strong bar call,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.780
and we thought about this,
but that wasn't good enough.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.220
And we thought about this
and that wasn't good enough.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.850
And then we went back and we
did more work and we kept going,

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.050
and finally we came up--
we finally have the killer

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:19.220
name for your beer, Jim.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.630
And it's like, oh, great.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.504
What is it?

00:28:22.504 --> 00:28:24.420
And you could almost
hear like this drum roll.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.670
It was like, Jim, the perfect
name for your new beer

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.304
is Sacred Cod.

00:28:33.304 --> 00:28:36.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.820
Right?

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.320
Love it?

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.350
That was it.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:46.820
Apparently-- I was
like, sacred cod?

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.080
Sounds like sacred cow,
it's a stinky fish,

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.930
you're bringing a
religion into this.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.060
I mean, I like beer but it's not
always a religious experience,

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.460
you're just trying to get laid.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.020
Oh, it's the state's
symbol of Massachu--

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.190
there is a sacred cod.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.320
It hangs in the
state-- in Beacon Hill.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.580
You might have seen it, right?

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.230
It's this really sort
of stupid gross looking

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:18.130
wooden plaque that is gilded
with gold leaf with this fish.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.320
Because I guess the cod was
a big part of the economy

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.480
of Massachusetts in the 1600's.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.440
We've forgotten about that.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.590
So that was my experience
with marketing genius.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.730
Even worse, I
hired them and they

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.030
were my ad agency for 10
years and they actually

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.230
did a whole bunch
of other good stuff.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.572
But the sacred cod
thing was a bomb.

00:29:39.572 --> 00:29:40.280
BRIAN CUSACK: OK.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.640
That's what we-- but how'd
we get to where we are?

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.485
JIM KOCH: Oh.

00:29:43.485 --> 00:29:44.250
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.940
OK.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.070
I forgot about that.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.620
All right.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.120
So I had this list of names.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.620
It was like 300 names
that had come to me.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.000
Because it took me a
long time to leave BCG,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.550
some old clients
came back, I needed

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.820
to keep working and doing
the right thing for them.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.210
And I finally left.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.980
So I had hundreds of names.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:09.940
I winnowed it down
to half a dozen,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:15.450
and the ad agency-- Gere
and Hoffman Goranson--

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:20.750
they actually found somebody
who could do the names.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.430
The Sam Adams name
actually on the label

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.410
came from-- it cost me
$400, it was a woman at BCG.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.620
Now, this is going
to strike all of you

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:36.830
as petroglyphs, as
incredibly primitive.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.440
But, in 1984, there
was no PowerPoint.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.970
Presentations are called slides.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.000
Right?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.970
It's a complete anachronism.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:55.130
Slides were either
35 millimeter slides

00:30:55.130 --> 00:31:00.100
that went through a
projector or, simpler to do,

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.690
was acetates.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:09.080
Essentially, the way slides
were made 30 years ago

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.790
was there were graphic
artists at a place like BCG

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:19.250
and they-- you'd make the
slide on graph paper, whatever

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.880
kind it was-- semilog,
linear, whatever--

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.630
and then an artist would
put tracing paper over that,

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:34.500
take this osmiroid pen, and
draw in the lines on it,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.290
and then have these rub
off things for the dots

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.280
and this tape that would
make the actual line.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.710
You probably remember this.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.330
And then they'd put it
in a-- I hate to say it.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:46.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.430
BRIAN CUSACK: Well, OK.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.980
So if we're going there, who
was not born when any of this

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.599
was happening?

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:52.140
Raise your hand if
you were not born.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.375
Yeah.

00:31:52.375 --> 00:31:52.610
OK.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.526
JIM KOCH: Oh, come on.

00:31:53.526 --> 00:31:54.794
It's most of you.

00:31:54.794 --> 00:31:55.294
So--

00:31:55.294 --> 00:31:57.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
people were drawing them

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.155
with pens on acetate.

00:31:58.155 --> 00:31:58.780
JIM KOCH: Yeah.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.100
And then you would
take the tracing paper

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.980
and you would put it
on a copying machine,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.830
and instead of paper you
would put these clear sheets.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.920
And that would make your slide.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.320
So there were these,
quote unquote,

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.180
artists who were
totally underutilized.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.260
They'd gone to RISD or someplace
like that so were actually

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.150
very talented artists,
but they ended up

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:26.210
with this sucky job of
rubbing off lettre set

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.200
points onto tracing paper.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.270
But there was a
whole bunch of talent

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.820
there so I went to--
there was one of them that

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.210
did what most of my slides-- her
name was Dale Hutchinson-- who

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.975
was a really talented artist,
just totally under utilized.

00:32:39.975 --> 00:32:43.110
I said, Dale, will
you make my label?

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.560
And she did.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.970
She charged me $400.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.240
That was the original
Sam Adams label.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.300
So I had that label and then
one that the ad agency had done,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.100
and I had-- I had
six different names.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.200
There was Sam Adams,
there was New World,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:04.340
there was James Otis,
there was Liberty Tree,

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.520
there was Joy Street--
which is on Beacon Hill,

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.520
had a brothel in the old
days-- and Golden Oak.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.790
I think those were the six.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.260
This was my market research.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.099
So I had a little six pack
and I went from bar to bar

00:33:22.099 --> 00:33:24.265
and I would go in the bar,
I'd talk to the bartender

00:33:24.265 --> 00:33:27.105
and I'd say, I'm going to
start a brewery in Boston.

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.175
He was like, what?

00:33:28.175 --> 00:33:30.540
I'm going to start small
and I'm going to make a beer

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.873
and I don't know the name of it.

00:33:31.873 --> 00:33:34.940
Would it be OK if I talk to
the people here in the bar?

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.500
And I didn't do it on Friday
nights, I'd do it in the week.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.880
So I collected data.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.420
That was my data.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.920
I had like 200 data
points and the two winners

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.620
were Sam Adams and New World.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.300
New World was the first
clipper ship ever built.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.300
It was built in East Boston.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.490
It was a beautiful ship crossing
the label, breaking the frame.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.420
And those were the two winners.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.830
And I couldn't decide,
and eventually I

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.240
had to because we had
to print the labels.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.600
The beer was getting ready and
I just sort of closed my eyes

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.260
and I thought, what do
I want my beer to be?

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:18.210
And for some reason-- Sam
Adams was just this very cool

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.920
historical figure.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.790
He started a revolution,
he was actually a brewer,

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:29.409
and he was the first of the
American founding fathers

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:32.011
to believe in
American independence.

00:34:32.011 --> 00:34:33.469
The rest of them
were like, we need

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:35.290
to fix the relationship
with Britain,

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.540
we need representation
with the taxation.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.800
Sam Adams was like, fuck them.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.100
We need to be our own country,
we have our own destiny,

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:51.510
we are different, we
need to be Americans.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:56.620
And he has this wonderful--
his last act was where he

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.110
was buried, where his grave is.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:03.850
And if you-- Sam Adams was a
propagandist, a rabble rouser,

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.280
a true revolutionary.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.750
He wasn't an
establishment figure.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:11.730
He stirred up the people
against the British

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:16.450
and he provoked the British
into the Boston Massacre,

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:20.000
into shooting five
unarmed Americans.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.600
His cousin, John Adams,
who was the lawyer who

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.310
defended the British troops.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:31.270
Sam Adams was the
radical who drew

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:35.960
bright lines and the British
fired on these Americans

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.040
and five of them died.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:44.030
Sam Adams chose to be
buried on Tremont street

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.590
on the Freedom Trail in
the Granary Burying Yard

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.920
at the bottom.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.480
And if you go through
the graveyard, the rich,

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.460
the well-born people
are all at the top.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.810
John Hancock, James
Otis, et cetera.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.470
Ben Franklin's parents.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.580
Sam Adams chose to be
buried at the bottom where

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.300
the ordinary people were buried.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:12.100
And he chose to be-- its
in the right hand corner

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.780
at the very bottom--
he chose to be

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.780
buried around--
and around him are

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.620
five very small gravestones.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:24.480
Those were the five victims
of the Boston Massacre.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:32.050
And he chose to be buried
closest to the first man

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:38.856
to die in the cause of American
liberty and independence,

00:36:38.856 --> 00:36:42.460
a man named Crispus Attucks
who was a black man,

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.830
an African-American.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.400
So next to Sam Adams is
buried an African-American.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:55.950
And that was, for his time,
that was a very, very powerful

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:56.550
statement.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.610
BRIAN CUSACK: It's still
a very powerful statement.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:58.110
JIM KOCH: Yep.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.860
BRIAN CUSACK: Really
a powerful statement.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.765
JIM KOCH: 200 years later.

00:37:02.765 --> 00:37:04.140
BRIAN CUSACK: We
have a question.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.160
JIM KOCH: Good.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.352
AUDIENCE: So I wasn't
around for the revolution.

00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:11.810
JIM KOCH: Well, the craft beer
revolution, you've lived it.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:12.210
AUDIENCE: But--

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.500
JIM KOCH: Many revolutions.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.290
AUDIENCE: But--

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.260
AUDIENCE: I was
around for Letraset.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.070
I remember the section of the
Coop that had all the Letrasets

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.610
and it was fascinating.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.990
And across the street from
the Coop was the Wursthaus.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.320
JIM KOCH: Yes.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.778
BRIAN CUSACK: And
the Wursthaus was

00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:29.090
famous for having 100 beers
or something like this.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:29.420
JIM KOCH: Yes.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.961
AUDIENCE: They were
famous for having

00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:33.410
a long list of beers, none
of which they had in stock.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.676
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:33.676 --> 00:37:34.020
OK.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.330
JIM KOCH: And the rest
of which were stale.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.296
AUDIENCE: Details.

00:37:36.296 --> 00:37:38.400
Details.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.907
But they were known--
they had their own-- fine,

00:37:40.907 --> 00:37:41.990
for the menu of 100 beers.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.320
JIM KOCH: Now a freaking bank.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.610
It was much better as a bar.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.157
AUDIENCE: So they had 100 years
and they were all imported.

00:37:48.157 --> 00:37:48.740
JIM KOCH: Yes.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.800
AUDIENCE: They probably
had some local ones.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.510
JIM KOCH: No.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.650
There were no local ones.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.010
AUDIENCE: Not at all.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:53.320
Maybe.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:53.680
OK.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.180
JIM KOCH: None.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:54.530
Zippo.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.488
AUDIENCE: All imported.

00:37:55.488 --> 00:37:57.580
Because imported beer, as
we all know, is better.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.080
Right?

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.786
This was the--

00:37:58.786 --> 00:37:59.625
JIM KOCH: Well--

00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:01.041
AUDIENCE: This was
the reputation.

00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:02.260
JIM KOCH: Beer is perishable.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.520
Beer is liquid bread.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:03.960
AUDIENCE: I understand.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.751
JIM KOCH: It lasts for
four or five months.

00:38:05.751 --> 00:38:06.900
AUDIENCE: I understand.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.714
But that was the
reputation at the time,

00:38:08.714 --> 00:38:11.130
that if you wanted good beer
you had to buy imported beer.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.180
And at the same
time, by the way,

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.310
there was entrepreneurship
at that time.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.830
Microsoft, Apple, VisiCalc.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.620
VisiCalc had come out
with its killer app

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.010
a few years before you started.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.884
JIM KOCH: I remember.

00:38:21.884 --> 00:38:24.760
I actually finally
finished business school

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.739
with Dan Bricklin.

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:26.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.340
JIM KOCH: And Tiny Troll.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.700
He was writing Tiny Troll
two levels up from me.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.660
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.490
So this stuff was going on, and
here you are as an entrepreneur

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.920
and you say, I want to
start my own business.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.140
And you see VisiCalc
taking off and you

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.660
see your ancestor's business
of beer-- American beer--

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.760
and everyone knows that only
imported beer is good beer.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.140
Did you think about--
I'm really happy you

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.910
did the beer, by the way,
because it's my favorite beer.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:59.180
But did you think about
high tech as a possibility?

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.020
Did you think about other areas
of starting your business?

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.250
JIM KOCH: You know, the
quick answer is, no.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.940
Because, the same thing here.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.910
I'm looking around this room and
everybody's smarter than I am.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.300
So don't go into business where
everybody's smarter than you.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:21.930
I had a client when I was a
consultant who was in the air

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:26.290
conditioning business, and
General Electric was my client,

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:30.660
and the guy who ran their
air conditioning business was

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.780
a nuclear engineer.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:37.730
And we eventually ended
up selling it to Trane.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:42.380
And the guy who ran Trane
was a nuclear engineer.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.380
I learned from those
guys because they said,

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.510
we were nuclear engineers
and everybody else

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.280
was smarter than we
were, but then we

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.280
got into air
conditioning and nobody

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.466
was smarter than we were.

00:39:55.466 --> 00:39:57.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.990
And they did quite well.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.842
That's why beer has
done well for me.

00:40:02.842 --> 00:40:04.300
AUDIENCE: You're
being very modest.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.405
I mean, you were at BCG,
Harvard MBA, et cetera,

00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:11.040
so you're doing the
modest show very well.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.160
JIM KOCH: I know what high IQ
looks like and it's not me.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.764
In all humility.

00:40:16.764 --> 00:40:18.680
BRIAN CUSACK: Another
question over here, Jim.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.337
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:20.337 --> 00:40:22.420
So it seems that there's
traditions in the brewing

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.950
that it goes from
father to son or father

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.300
to grandson and
things like that,

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.704
and your recipe is from your
great grandfather you said?

00:40:29.704 --> 00:40:30.620
JIM KOCH: Great great.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.010
AUDIENCE: Great great.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:36.370
So it's kind of a
two-parter, my question.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.810
This is like-- this has
happened a number of times.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.620
For example, Bitter
Brew details what

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.530
happened in the
Budweiser family and how

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.636
that whole process broke down.

00:40:46.636 --> 00:40:49.010
Can you speak about whether
or not anybody in your family

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.934
is interested in taking
up the brewing thing,

00:40:50.934 --> 00:40:52.600
and similarly, can
you talk about what's

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.140
happening in your industry
with consolidation and InBev

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.939
and your thoughts about that?

00:40:56.939 --> 00:40:57.480
JIM KOCH: OK.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.563
Those are quite different.

00:40:58.563 --> 00:40:59.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.106
I know that they're hard--

00:41:01.106 --> 00:41:01.980
JIM KOCH: Let me, OK.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.630
I'll answer them both.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.210
AUDIENCE: I think that the
InBev one is kind of related to

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.902
what happened at
Budweiser wite--

00:41:05.902 --> 00:41:06.526
JIM KOCH: Yeah.

00:41:06.526 --> 00:41:09.150
The gene pool got
to the shallow end.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.500
JIM KOCH: Yeah.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.930
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about those two things,

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:13.860
if you would, please?

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.401
JIM KOCH: OK.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:24.320
I have four kids and
one of them ended up

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.900
as a lawyer-- public defender.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.570
I have three daughters.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:33.090
So one is a public
defender, a second

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:37.580
is in college in pre-med, wants
to be an orthopedic surgeon

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.680
because somebody told her
that orthopedic surgeons get

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.785
to play whatever music they want
in the operating room and she

00:41:43.785 --> 00:41:47.990
thought that was cruel,
and the other has just

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:49.090
graduated high school.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:54.180
And then I have a son who I sort
of had this conversation with.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.960
His name's Charlie and
it's like, OK, Charlie,

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:04.150
there's 310 million people in
the United States, one of them

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:06.470
is a seventh generation brewer.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.510
Just one out of
310 million people.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.660
And then happens to be you.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.630
And God bless him.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.866
He said, Dad, you're
such an asshole.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.250
You got to do what
you wanted to do

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.320
and I'm going to do
what I want to do.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.810
He loves kids.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.600
He's a school counselor.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.130
And he's happy.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.180
So I'm good.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.790
If it ends there, that's OK.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.570
He got to do what
he wanted to do.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.760
And we'll see.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.030
I have one 18 year old.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.521
We'll see where she ends up.

00:42:44.521 --> 00:42:45.770
BRIAN CUSACK: Fingers crossed.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.550
JIM KOCH: Well, you know, I
got to do what I wanted to do

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.500
and I've always told my
kids, do what you want to do,

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.892
do what makes you happy and
that's going to make me happy.

00:42:54.892 --> 00:42:57.100
AUDIENCE: Which is a lot
different than the Budweiser

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.766
family, I think.

00:42:57.766 --> 00:42:58.400
Part of it's--

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.570
JIM KOCH: Well, then you get
to the Busch family, which,

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.890
amazing family, amazing
story, four generations

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.360
of extraordinary people.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.840
Four out of five isn't bad.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:15.120
But they're gone.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.820
They're not in the
business anymore.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:23.950
They got taken over by a bunch
of very, very smart Brazilians.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.190
That's business.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.570
It's competition.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:32.410
The smart, energetic, talented,
capable, resourceful people

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.260
are supposed to win.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.960
This is America.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.000
It's not aristocracy.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.340
You've got to earn it
with every generation.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.820
That's a good thing.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.320
BRIAN CUSACK: Do
you want to comment

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.467
on the landscape of the
business, though, of the beer

00:43:47.467 --> 00:43:49.800
business, and what does that
mean to you for the next 10

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.030
or 20-- personally or your
business-- the next 10

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.015
or 20 years?

00:43:53.015 --> 00:43:53.890
JIM KOCH: Well, sure.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:58.827
We have-- the last 10 years,
landscape in American beer

00:43:58.827 --> 00:43:59.660
has totally changed.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.210
Today, 90% of the beer
made in the United States

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:12.250
is made by two foreign
owned intergalactic brewing

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:16.750
conglomerates that you wouldn't
even know the names of them

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:17.740
necessarily.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.880
They own everything.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.820
There's one in-- run by
very smart Brazilians out

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.090
of Brussels because the tax
rates are low called AB InBev.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.970
There's another one run in
London by very smart South

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.105
Africans called SAB--
you wouldn't know what

00:44:37.105 --> 00:44:40.640
it is-- SABMiller MolsonCoors.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.960
So all these beers, I mean,
you see them on the shelf

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:50.600
and you see Rolling
Rock or Beck's or Stella

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.980
or Goose Island.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.120
They're all owned
by the same company.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.640
They're all owned
by this huge-- and I

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.590
could go on with others--
owned by this one big company.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:08.730
And then on the other side you'd
see Coors or Miller or Redd's

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:13.560
or Molson or Leinenkugel.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.390
They're all owned
by the other one.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.730
They make 90% of the beer
in the United States.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:21.540
And then the other
10%, 12%, is made

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:28.180
by 5,000 small independent
brewers like Sam

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.870
Adams and 5,000 others.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:33.350
That's the structure
of the beer industry.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.580
BRIAN CUSACK: And
will that 5,000 grow,

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.130
shrink, what do you think?

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:41.160
JIM KOCH: I think it
can double to 10,000.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:47.030
The question would be,
what does that look like?

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:50.140
And that's just a
fundamental issue.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:55.450
Most of the current
5,000 are essentially

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:58.550
bars with a brewery
in the back, taprooms,

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.220
whatever you want to call them.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.290
And that's a very
viable business model

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:05.470
because, as a brewer,
you make a keg of beer,

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.270
you can sell it into
the distribution

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:12.130
channels that will put it--
go through a distributor

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:13.260
into a bar.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.250
You get like $100.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.340
Or you can open a
taproom in your brewery,

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:23.580
sell it to people who come
in over the bar for $1,000.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.330
And I know you guys are smart,
so you can figure that one out.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:29.160
That's a decent--

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.540
BRIAN CUSACK: $1,000
is more than $100.

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.040
JIM KOCH: $1,000 is better.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:31.831
BRIAN CUSACK: Yeah.

00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:33.590
OK.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.640
Thank you.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.940
Questions?

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:40.310
AUDIENCE: So for me beer
is more about the malt,

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:48.730
and I find most American
microbrews too bitter.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.286
When will the hops tyranny end?

00:46:50.286 --> 00:46:53.610
JIM KOCH: Well, people
like what they like

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:58.170
and you have to respect
the authority of people's

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.430
own senses.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.830
I'll give you my opinion because
I think both are valuable.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:09.330
To me, a beautiful
beer is a balance

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:13.320
between the body and
sweetness of the malt

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.530
and the spiciness and
bitterness of the hops.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.220
That's the essential
flavor structure of beer.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:27.480
So to me, you want to taste
both of the brewer's ingredients

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.170
in the beer.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:36.950
Probably the best example I can
give people is Boston Lager.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.550
Which is why it's
been the leading craft

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.250
brewer for 30 years.

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:45.170
So at the end of the day,
people want something

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:48.180
that is enjoyable to drink.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.630
When I make beer,
my first criterion

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:53.140
is, is this a pleasure to drink?

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.490
Now, we do make
some hoppy beers.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:48:01.110
We make some savagely
hoppy beers like Rebel Raw

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.420
which is over 100
bitterness units, which

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.910
is tongue-scrapingly bitter.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:10.150
AUDIENCE: Well, Boston Lager
is already too hoppy for me.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:11.660
JIM KOCH: Oh, my.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.030
All right.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:18.020
Well, we do make some like
Sam Adams Oktoberfest.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.690
That's very malt forward.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.340
That is a beautiful
malt showcase.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:29.680
I make a beer called Irish
Red which, again, is very--

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.540
in Ireland they can't grow hops
for shit so they-- but they can

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.420
do barley.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.820
So Irish and Scotch beers
are very malt forward.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:43.430
So we make a Scotch Ale which
kind of appears and reappears,

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:44.680
we don't make it all the time.

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.330
But I love it and it's
got a smoke malt in it.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:52.440
So that will come and go.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.810
Irish Red is very malty.

00:48:56.532 --> 00:48:57.520
Oh, gosh.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.000
Octoberfest.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.390
Winter Lager, more malt forward.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:07.770
Has some orange zest some
cinnamon and some fresh ginger

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:08.380
in it.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.690
So there are-- to your point,
the brewer's art encompasses

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:15.470
many, many ingredients.

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:19.480
A brewer can make beer from
anything they can imagine.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:25.350
I've made beer from maple
syrup, from cranberries,

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:30.320
from grains of paradise,
this West African spice,

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.740
from orange zest, lemon
zest, from tamarind,

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.980
some of the more controversial.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.099
I made beer from roosters for--

00:49:46.099 --> 00:49:47.390
BRIAN CUSACK: It's in the book.

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.930
JIM KOCH: It is.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:48.835
BRIAN CUSACK: It's in the book.

00:49:48.835 --> 00:49:49.751
JIM KOCH: In the book.

00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:51.170
Had two roosters in the kettle.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:53.300
There used to be, actually
not that far from here

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.530
up in Inman Square,
a place called

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:57.580
Mayflower Poultry that
would give you-- I

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.340
went there and got
fresh killed roosters.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:49:59.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:00.700
JIM KOCH: Is it still there?

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:01.325 --> 00:50:02.930
Well, they're on
Cambridge Street.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:03.670
JIM KOCH: OK.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.940
Yeah.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.606
You can get fresh
killed roosters there.

00:50:05.606 --> 00:50:07.590
So I got two fresh
killed roosters,

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.408
put it in the beer--
feathers, feet and all--

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:12.116
and it was great.

00:50:12.116 --> 00:50:14.970
It was called Old Cock
Ale for a friend of mine

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:18.900
who turned 50 when I
thought 50 was really old.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:23.100
We made beer with 40 pounds
of grilled beef hearts.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.510
I got thousands of
letters from PETA

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.660
about that, that beer was
supposed to be vegetarian.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.680
Who cares.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.750
So the brewer's art
encompasses everything.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:34.890
We're not like wine makers.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:37.000
Everybody thinks their
role model is wine makers.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.940
And the poor wine maker,
they have one ingredient.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.070
Grapes.

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:51.480
And they have two choices, skins
or no skins and steel or oak.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.320
That's basically the choices
that a wine maker have.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.970
Which, I mean, let's face it.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:00.320
Red wine pretty much
tastes like red wine.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.630
It's not that easy to
tell the difference.

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:06.430
And the same is-- but
with beer, nobody's

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:14.630
going to mistake cream stout
for Sam Adams or for Rebel IPA.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:20.100
Nobody's going to mistake
Utopia's for Porch Rocker

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.230
or Oktoberfest.

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:27.110
Beer-- the brewer has
all these choices.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:31.560
A good friend of mine, Sam
Calagione at Dogfish Head,

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.310
he said, well, the
poor winemakers,

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:38.560
all they have is the
missionary position.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.990
One ingredient every
night for winemakers.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.380
Missionary,
missionary, missionary.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.550
They just have these grapes.

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:51.520
And what I've added to Sam
is-- and Sam-- we're brewers.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.030
We have the Kama Sutra.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:58.368
If we can imagine it and we do
a little yoga, we can do it.

00:51:58.368 --> 00:52:00.260
BRIAN CUSACK: All right.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.350
We have time for one
more question only,

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.390
and I think if we were going in
order it'd come from back here.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:09.015
JIM KOCH: I'm going to show you
some science while you're here.

00:52:09.015 --> 00:52:09.950
This is--

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:11.991
BRIAN CUSACK: We have time
for no more questions.

00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:13.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.540
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.240
JIM KOCH: --IPA.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.360
We replaced carbonation
with nitrogen.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.430
So you get a whole
different experience.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.760
Doesn't even sound the
same as a regular beer.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.600
[SOUND OF OPENING A SODA CAN]

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.590
You get all that whoosh and
then you pour it in like this.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:36.486
And in the glass you get this
amazing theater, this storm

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.860
going on, the bubbles-- if
you can see them-- the bubbles

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.620
are going down.

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:46.210
You have this sort of cascade
and slowly over 90 seconds,

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:50.130
it will form this
beautiful tight head

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.930
of very small bubbles,
which are nitrogen bubbles.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.530
And you probably all
know Boyle's law,

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:01.110
so they're in relative
equilibrium to the atmosphere.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:03.180
So they're small,
they don't need

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:08.160
to expand because the
atmosphere is like 80% nitrogen.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:14.432
And that's my little Bill
Nye the Science Guy thing.

00:53:14.432 --> 00:53:15.640
BRIAN CUSACK: And that's new?

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.260
That's new.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.920
JIM KOCH: Yeah.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.630
Yeah.

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:21.200
What you discover is that
the hidden ingredient

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.020
beer is carbon dioxide.

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.250
It's a huge flavor impact.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:30.040
Nitro IPA is 100 BU's,
but because it's nitrogen,

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.860
it drinks like 50.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.870
So I guess where
I'm getting to, beer

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:36.820
has been around for
12,000 years but there's

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:44.330
enormous room for reinvention,
for disruption, for innovation.

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.620
Just because people have been
doing it for 12,000 years

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.100
is no reason to keep
doing it tomorrow.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.550
BRIAN CUSACK: And I think
that's a perfect place to stop.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:53.770
So thank you very much.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:55.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.930
JIM KOCH: Cheers.
