00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.040
In the last video, we learned
that an ellipse can be defined

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.660
as the locus of all points
where the sum of the distances

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.702
to two special points, called
foci-- and let me draw this all

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:15.090
out, so that's my x-axis-- the
sum of the distance to these

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.040
two special points, called
focuses or foci, is a constant.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.330
So if this is my ellipse-- I'll
draw it out, that looks about

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.630
where I want it to be right
around, that looks about

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.640
right-- it's centered at the
origin, doesn't have to be, but

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.040
for our purposes, let's make
it centered on the origin.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.170
If this is one focus point
right here, and this is the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.180
other focus point, this ellipse
could be defined as the set of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
all points, or the locus of all
points, where if I take the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.920
distance of any one of these
points that exist on the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.300
ellipse and take the distance
to each of the locuses-- sorry,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.730
each of the focuses-- if I take
that-- nope, I don't want to do

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:08.220
that-- if I take that distance
and add it to this distance, so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:19.770
let's call this d1-- nope, too
thick-- let's call that d1,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.100
this is d2-- that that's going
to be equal to a constant

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100
number along the whole ellipse.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.540
So if I take a random point
along the ellipse, say I take

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:38.930
this point right here, and if I
were to sum this distance to

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:48.160
that distance-- so let's call
this d3, this is d4-- the sums

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.840
of these distances to the focus
along with this ellipse are

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.100
going to be a constant.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.330
So in this case, d2 plus d1,
this plus that, is going

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.120
to be equal to d3 plus d4.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.410
And this would be true wherever
you go along the whole ellipse,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.430
and we learned in the last
video that this quantity is

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.715
actually going to be equal to
2a, where a is the distance

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:14.800
of the semi-major radius.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.830
If this is the formula
for the ellipse, this is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.310
where the a comes from.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.330
x squared over a squared
plus y squared over b

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.230
squared is equal to 1.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.750
And we learned that the focus,
the focal distance-- or the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.510
distance from the central of
the ellipse, which is this

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.400
distance right here-- that
focal distance is just the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.640
square root of the difference
of these two numbers.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.040
If this is the focal distance
from here to here, it's just

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.490
equal to the square root of--
if a is larger then it would be

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.220
a squared minus b squared,
which is the case

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.200
in this ellipse.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.430
If we have a vertical ellipse,
and I really didn't cover it in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.450
the last video, but let me just
show you what it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.690
would look like.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.650
Let's say that the ellipse
looks something like this.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.110
I'll use blue.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.560
Let's say the ellipse
looks like that.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.720
In this case, our semi-major
radius is now in the y

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.280
direction, so this is b, this
is a, and in this case, b is

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.200
greater than a, because the
ellipse is tall and skinny.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.460
In this case the, focuses
are always going to lie

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.900
along the major axis.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.050
In this case the major axis is
the vertical axis, so the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.640
focuses are going to sit here
and here, and in this case, the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.520
focal lengths are going to be
vertical down from the origin

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.550
and vertical up from the
origin, and we get, instead of

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.770
it being a squared minus b
squared, now since b is larger

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.940
than a, the focal length, which
is this, is going to be equal

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.680
to b squared minus a squared.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.040
Fair enough.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.540
Now I did all of that to kind
of compare it to what we're

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.940
going to cover in this video,
which is the focus points or

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.360
the foci of a hyperbola.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.750
And a hyperbola, it's very
close to an ellipse, you could

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.760
probably guess that, because if
this is the equation of

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.000
an ellipse, this is the
equation of a hyperbola.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.340
x squared over a squared
minus y squared over b

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.830
squared is equal to 1.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.517
Or we could switch these
around, where the minus

00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:34.850
is in front of the
x instead of the y.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.870
And we could cover
that in a second.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.810
But this hyperbola looks
something like this.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.000
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.410
If I draw the axes, and then I
want to draw the asymptotes--

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.250
you could prove it, you could
look at the some of the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.490
previous videos, but the
asymptotes for this hyperbola

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.190
are going to be y is equal to
plus or minus b over ax, so

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.430
it's going to look-- I'll just
draw them as kind of tilted

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.430
lines, so it would look
something like that,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.810
something like-- nope.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.850
I want to make it
something like that.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.630
Those are the as-- but this
one's centered at the origin,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.210
because it hasn't been shifted,
and then that's those

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.340
two lines right there.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.370
And then, this is what I call
kind of a horizontal hyperbola.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.180
The way you can think about
that is, well, if you solve for

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.830
y, you'll see that you're
always going to be a little

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.910
bit lower than the asymptote.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.010
The other option is you say,
OK, can x or y equal 0?

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.130
Well if y is equal to 0, that
puts us along the x-axis, and

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:54.380
you get x squared over a
squared is equal to 1, which

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.090
means that x squared is equal
to a squared, which means that

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.260
x is equal to plus or minus a.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:11.350
So the points a,0, and
the point minus a,0, are

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.150
both on this hyperbola.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.120
And since they have to kind
of be contained by these

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.080
asymptotes, never go through
it, you know that this is going

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.795
to be a hyperbola that opens to
the left and the right, so

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:23.714
it'll look something like this.

00:06:23.714 --> 00:06:26.022
Let me use its color.

00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:29.420
So it'll look something-- this
is the hard part-- it'll get

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.890
closer and closer on that side,
and then you kind of view this

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.480
as one of the vertexes or
vertices of the hyperbola,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.430
and it'll go like that.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.260
Where this distance-- and
notice the similarity here with

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.900
the ellipse-- this distance
right here-- let me do it in a

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.430
more vibrant color-- this
distance right here, between

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.760
these two I guess you could
call them the elbows of the two

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.380
ellipses-- that distance
right there, that is

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.980
a, and this is also a.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.300
So you have a 2a distance,
which is very similar to this

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.320
situation, where this distance
is a and this distance is a.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.430
So your distance between the
two left and right points in a

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.440
horizontal ellipse is the same
as the distance between the two

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.130
left and right points
on a hyperbola.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.440
It's just the hyperbola
opens outward while the

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.020
ellipse opens inward.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.050
Fair enough.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.620
But the whole point of this
video is to discuss foci, and

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.700
you might have guessed-- and I
did touch on it in the last

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.580
video-- that hyperbola also
have foci, but they open.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.750
They're going to be to the
right and the left of these two

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.190
points, so this is a-- let me
do them in a bright color,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.630
because I want you see them--
let's say that those are the

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.810
two foci-- and a hyperbola,
this is-- and notice

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.350
the difference.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.760
An ellipse, one of the
definitions of an ellipse, was

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.690
the locus of all points or the
set of all points where the

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.000
distance from each of those
points, the sum of the distance

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.090
from each of those points to
the two foci is a constant.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.370
Now the definition of a
hyperbola, one of the

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.470
definitions of a hyperbola, can
be the locus of all points

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.750
where you take the difference--
not the sum, you take the

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.840
difference of the distances
between the two foci, so if--

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.800
let me write that down.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:24.270
So this is d1, and this is d2,
so you have a situation-- and

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.310
we could take the absolute
value of the difference,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.210
because they might be, they
might at some points d1

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.340
will be longer than d2
if you're on this curve.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.560
If you're on this curve, d1
will be shorter than d2-- So d1

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.820
minus d2, the absolute value is
going to be equal to constant.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.560
In the ellipse situation,
d1 plus d2 was a constant.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.450
So they're very
closely related.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.635
In the ellipse, you're taking
the sum of the distances

00:08:49.635 --> 00:08:52.730
to the focus points and
saying it's a constant.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.200
In a hyperbola, you're taking
the difference of the distances

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.070
to the focus points and
saying that's a constant.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.840
So this number right here is
going to be the exact same

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.490
thing as if I took a point
right here-- and I'm picking

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.650
these points arbitrarily, as
long as they're on the

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:15.530
hyperbola, and if I called
these two points d3 and d4, the

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.700
difference between d1 and d2 is
the same thing as the

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.910
difference, between
d3 minus d4.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.370
This is going to be a
constant the entire way

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.970
around the ellipse.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.400
And so the next question
is, what is this constant

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.800
going to be equal to?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.180
And this is where it's useful
to find a point where you can

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.270
kind of get the intuition, and
we did it with the ellipses,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.530
where we said if we take these
points, we used logic in the

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.690
last video to say oh, the sum
of the distance between this

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:55.170
and this, that sum, is going to
be equal to, we saw, is going

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.830
to be equal to 2a, or
the distance of the

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.680
semi-major axis.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.710
Because this distance was the
same as this distance, so this

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.970
plus this is the same thing as
this plus that, which is 2a.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.540
So the entire time, the
contents, the sum of the

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.130
distances to the two
foci was equal to 2a.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.490
Now in the hyperbola, what
is the difference of the

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.830
distances to the two foci?

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.650
So let's take this point right
here on the hyperbola, and

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.960
we're saying so what is-- let
me do a good color-- what is

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.750
the magenta distance-- that's
the distance to that foci--

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:40.630
minus this-- let me pick
another color-- minus this

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.190
light blue distance?

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.500
This magenta distance minus
this light blue distance.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.780
So we can make a very similar
argument that we made in

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.520
the ellipse situation.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.100
This light blue distance is the
same, the distance from this

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.590
vertex or from this leftmost
point of this rightward opening

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.170
hyperbola to this focus is
the same as this distance.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.460
Because a hyperbola is
symmetric around the origin or

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.700
the focal length is the same on
either side of the center of

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.490
the hyperbola depending on how
you may view it, but I think

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.910
that's not too much of a
stretch of a statement for

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.600
you to for you to accept.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.500
So if this distance is the same
as this distance, then the

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.020
magenta distance minus this
blue distance is going to be

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.410
equal to this green distance.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.690
And this green
distance is what?

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.430
That's 2a.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.920
We saw that at the
beginning of this video.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.130
So this, once again,
is also equal to 2a.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.420
Anyway, I'll leave
you there right now.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.890
Actually, let's actually just
do one problem, just because

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.150
I like to make one concrete.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.280
Because I told you at the
beginning that if you wanted to

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.395
find the-- so if you have an
ellipse-- so if you have-- this

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:56.880
is an ellipse, x squared over a
squared plus y squared over b

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.470
squared is equal to 1, we
learned that the-- that's over

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.290
b squared-- this is an ellipse.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.980
We learned that the focal
length is equal to the

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.960
square root of a squared
minus b squared.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.530
Now for a hyperbola, you kind
of see that there's a very

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.540
close relation between the
ellipse and the hyperbola,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.790
but it is kind of a fun
thing to ponder about.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.066
And a hyperbola's equation
looks like this.

00:12:22.066 --> 00:12:26.870
x squared over a squared minus
y squared over b squared, or it

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.030
could be y squared over b
squared minus x squared over

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.790
a square is equal to 1.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.980
It turns out, and I'll prove
this to you in the next video,

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.460
it's a little bit of a hairy
math problem, that the focal

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.490
length of a hyperbola is equal
to the square root of the sum

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.940
of these two numbers, is equal
to the sum of a squared

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.890
plus b squared.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.360
So if I were to give you--
so notice the difference.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.350
It's just a difference in sign.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.130
You're taking the difference of
those two denominators, and now

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.330
you're taking the sum of
the two denominators.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.510
So if I were to give you
the following hyperbola.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:08.870
x squared over 9 plus y squared
over 16 is equal to 1.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.230
Well, the first thing you do
is-- though I've never-- well,

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.870
we could just figure out
the focal length just by

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.950
plugging into the formula.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.910
The focal length is equal
to the square root of a

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.460
squared plus b squared.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.840
This is squared,
right? a is three.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.240
b is 4.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.490
So 9 plus 16 is 25,
which is equal to 5.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:35.430
And so if we were to graph
this-- that's my y-axis, that's

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.970
my x-axis-- and the focal
length is the distance to, in

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.640
this case, to the left and
the right of the origin.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.210
If it was kind of an up and
down opening hyperbola, it

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.680
would be above and below the
origin, so this is a-- oh

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.260
sorry, this should be a plus.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.660
We're doing with a hyperbola,
that should be a minus.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.680
Don't want to confuse you.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.360
What I had written before,
with a plus, that would

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.320
have been an ellipse.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.450
A minus is the hyperbola.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.480
So the two asymptotes-- this is
centered at the origin, it

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.790
hasn't been shifted-- are going
to be 16 over 9, so it's going

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.050
to be fairly steep asymptotes,
it's going to look something

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:14.620
like that and that, those
are the two asymptotes--

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.920
The two vertex points are at 2
times a. a is three, right?

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.930
a squared is equal to 9, b
squared is equal to 16, so this

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.920
is the center, so the two
vertex points, this is 3 minus

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.410
3, and then the focal points
are going to be at, from the

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.860
center, 5 to the right, so
that's going to be right here,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:43.730
so that's 5,0, and minus 5,0.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.870
This is minus 3, and this is 3,
so if we were to graph it, it

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.920
would look something like this.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.110
There you go.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.830
And if you were to take an
arbitrary point on that

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.540
hyperbola and take this
distance and subtract that from

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.420
that distance, that will be a
constant number that would be

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.760
exactly equal to 2a or exactly
equal to 6, in this

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.810
particular example.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:12.400
Anyway.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.397
Hopefully I didn't confuse you
too much with that little sign

00:15:14.397 --> 00:15:17.260
error near the end of the
video, but in the next video,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.620
I'll prove to you this formula,
which is a little bit of hairy

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.980
algebra but it's fun
to do regardless.
