00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.120
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.960
&gt;&gt; Next is Stephanie
Stillo who is the curator

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.970
of the Lessing J. Rosenwald
Collection in the Rare Book

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.200
and Special Collections Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.100
Prior to joining the
Library of Congress,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.360
she served as the Mellon professor
of History and Digital Humanities

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.790
at Washington and Lee University
where she taught classes

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.530
on digital exhibition and
design, public history,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.710
and digital story telling.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.410
She's going to highlight some
work at the Library of Congress

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.020
that relates to collections as data
in her talk, Only Once Imagined.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.270
Stephanie.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.570
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Stillo:
Thank you very much.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.590
And thank you for NDI for
inviting me to speak today.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.570
I've been working with them

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.670
on a digital scholarship working
group recently and I've really come

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.030
to respect the depth of knowledge
and commitment that they have

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.050 position:56%
to sharing the Library's collections

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.170
which I think is certainly
something that we see here today.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.640
And a special thank you also to
Sarah for that lovely presentation.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.780
We were just commenting
about how we were tearing

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.500
up a little bit in the back.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.860
So the title of my talk I feel
like requires some explaining.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.190
Also I realize that it might be a
little bit risky to begin a talk

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.130
with poem that is called The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.300
But nonetheless here we go.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.580
So I am the Rosenwald curator
here at the Library of Congress.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.220
And I have the great
privilege of overseeing one

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.030
of the largest Blake collections,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.490
William Blake collections
in the world.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.710
And I never get tired
of saying that out loud.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.230 position:56%
That's always a really fun statement
to say at any point really.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.610
So Blake -- I think
about Blake a lot.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.050
And Blake wrote this
particular work immediately

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.520
after the French revolution.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.830
And the poem is very much this
homage to the concept of change,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.570
to change in conventional morality,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.220
to change in politics,
to change in religion.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.020
And it is a quite inspiring quote.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.450
So as a rare books curator,
I think about Blake a lot.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.760
And I think about this
idea, Blake's idea,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.760
of the once imagined quite a bit.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.370
And I usually think
about it in the context

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.500
of the way printing changed
European society after 1455.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.330
And I like to think
about what Europeans saw

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.260 position:56%
or what they were thinking when
they saw the first image of the moon

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.160
through a telescope; right?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.650
Or the first microscopic image
of a feather or a blade of grass.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.920
And I think about how these
visualizations empowered public

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.250
knowledge and really upended
traditional intellectual thought.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.410
So I think about history a lot
working in a rare books division.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.610
But what I find very inspiring
about this moment in history,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.850
about our moment in
history, is that the way

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.030
that the digital tools are
allowing us to live in this age

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.530
where the once imagined
is true again.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.330
And through new data sets,
through new methods of analysis,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.100
through new visualizations,
we're able to ask questions

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.920 position:56%
that simply weren't possible before.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.060
And in a way we're standing, I
think, at this similar moment

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.820
of change which is quite exciting.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.140
So today I've been asked
to talk about my experience

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.440
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.750
Now, I have to begin with
somewhat of a confession.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.820
And my confession is that I work
at the largest library in the world

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.920 position:56%
and I'm not a librarian, and this is
a reoccurring confession in my life.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.830
I've taught digital humanities
and I'm not a technologist.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.750
I -- a lot of my research
right now focuses on the impact

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.240
of preservation technology
on historical research

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.410
and I'm in no way a scientist.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.660
But what I am is a historian
that has wandered into one

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.010
of the greatest repositories of
human experience ever amassed here

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.100
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.880
At over 160 million items
here at the Library,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.550
we are a galaxy of stories.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.620 position:56%
And so today I want to talk about
my methods of using these resources.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.380
But I think what's far more
exciting is that my voice, I think,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.660
is part of this much larger choir

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.480
of research that's really changing
the way that we're thinking

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.600
about our collections at
the Library of Congress.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.560
So the first time I stepped into
the Library was not as the curator

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.350
of the Rosenwald collection.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.840
It was back in 2012 and
I was a Mellon fellow.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.310
And at that time I had
this very simple goal.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.130
I wanted to tell a
story about books.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.250
I was interested in how books
moved through time in space.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.710
I was interested in the
people who owned them

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.640
and the way they used them and
changed them for their own use.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.100
Books have certainly a
sort of life of their own

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.450
and the early modern world
particularly in the western world,

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.790
people would annotate and color
and draw in their books to be able

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.890
to understand the information
better.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.830
And I was terribly interested
in this idea of attempts

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.610
to organize knowledge, to -- to use
books in this very personal way,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.060
to classify the world around you,
to make information personal.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.560
But one of the challenges
of working with old books is

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.590
that they often bear the scars
of moving through time and space.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.420
Annotations fade; pigments corrode;
books are rebound and resold.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.810
Many of them lived through
revolutions and political

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.110
and religious censorship.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.030
They've crossed continents
several times over.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.860
And this all adds to
the story of your book.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:01.470
But it also adds another layer
of research that's very difficult

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.240
to access as just a
historian; right?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.690
So I wanted to follow
a book when I got here.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.890
But I needed a team
of detectives; right?

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.190
I couldn't do it alone.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.090
I needed someone to help me.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.400
And that's exactly what I found
in the preservation research

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.510
and testing division here
at the Library of Congress.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.680
For those of you that are
-- that do not work here,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.200
one of the most extraordinary
resources that we have

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.050
at the library are
these subterranean labs

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.690
in the Madison building
that are just filled

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.540
with this fabulous technology.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.470
Much of it that I do not
understand and teams of scientists

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.960 position:56%
that are dedicated to looking at our
collections as objects and digging

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.270
in beyond just what we
see under the surface.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.670
So when I arrived at the Library,
I met people that specialized

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.530
in technology that I had
never even heard of before.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.450
Again, I'm a historian.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.620
So things like multispectral
imaging and x-ray florescence

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.180
and microscopy don't exactly
factor into my vocabulary.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.170
These -- but these were the
kinds of technologies --

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.220
these forensic technologies
were exactly what I needed

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.730
to get the results that I
wanted from this project.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.200
And there was nowhere else that I
was going to find this combination

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.270
of resources and expertise but
at the Library of Congress.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.990 position:56%
So ultimately I had to learn, right?

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:36.290
So eventually I settled
on this fabulous book,

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.380
a World Atlas in the
rare books division.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.560
The printing was lovely
but the coloring

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.580
in the book was very, was sloppy.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.880
There were annotations.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.690
It was born in one place
and ended up in another.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.880
It was problematic and I've
really come to appreciate

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.350
as a rare books curator
problematic books.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.410
They tell great stories; right?

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.860
The books that look like crap
are the ones you always --

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.160
bring them on.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.760
They're quite fantastic.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.010
So -- and so I settled on this book
and, you know, like most research,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.310
it ended up -- the
conclusions of the project ended

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.460
up being much more than I expected.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.360
And I don't want to burden this

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.160
with too many specifics
but just very briefly.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.650
So the original print placed
the beginning of my story in --

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.150
with a son of a knife maker
in 17th century Amsterdam

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.890
in a print shop called
The Three Crabs

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.460
which I think is a great
name for a print shop.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.080 position:56%
Analysis of the annotations
revealed that my book moved to Italy

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.350
with a student of military
geography in the 18th century.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:47.660
And he -- he likely bound the work
and had significant annotations

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.780
so it was sort of revealing, this
interesting sort of organization

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.230
of his geographic knowledge.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.660 position:56%
The pigment analysis introduced me
to a 19th century owner that touched

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.040
up the colors, likely to vetch

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.290
a better price on the
antiquarian book market

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.360
when he tried to sell the book.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.250
And eventually found its way
actually to the collections of one

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.710
of the Library's greatest
benefactors.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.590
And only into the Library
collection in 1980, right?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:20.440
So this was, again, there
was a lot that, in the end --

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.530
of course, I had more
questions about my book; right?

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.850
But this was a great story.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.060
And one that I've been
able to talk about in terms

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:33.030
of this journey quite often
which has really been lovely

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:38.870 position:56%
and all emerges out of this early
research at the Library of Congress.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.230
So now I have the great
honor of being the curator

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.830
of the Rosenwald collection
which is one of the greatest,

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.800
graphic arts collections
in the world.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.700
And since I've become the
curator I've continued to work

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.290
with our preservation
division to think

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.950
about unlocking new stories; right?

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.950
Opening new doors for research.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.710
And I'm very lucky that
we're able to do this.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.730
So just to give you
a couple examples.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.460
Through multispectral imaging

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.020
and principal component
analysis we were able

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.030
to identify Saint Catherine
of Alexandria

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.720
in this 15th century paste print.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.020
It's quite rare.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.040
There's not many of
these that survived

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.840
but we're able to recover
this image.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.850
Rightfully so because Saint
Catherine is the patroness

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.150
of librarians.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.540
So we had to make sure, you
know, that we got her back.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.950
So -- so we should all
expect good fortune.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:43.860
We have in the -- in the Rosenwald
collection we have canceled plates

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.720
from William Blake's
America so the first

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.590
of his continental
prophecies; right?

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:55.680
And this plate has personal
annotations, pencil annotations

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.300
from William Blake
and they're fading.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.510
So through, again,
multispectral imaging

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.100
and principal component
analysis, we're able to pull

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.170
out these annotations
which are essential

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.830
for the historical
record for William Blake.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.500
Again, here's some more images.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.690
But one of the projects
that I'm most proud

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.570
of which is a new partnership
between the rare books division

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.210
and the preservation
division is a particular type

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:28.670
of what you might call down market
printing in the 15th century.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.480
These are called block
books, block book printing.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.960
They -- due to their
sort of low status

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.880
and ephemerality they don't
really last past the 15th century.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.540
The technique doesn't last
really past the 15th century.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.040
They're somewhat lost in
conversations about --

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.620
about print in this really
important 15th century moment.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.020
And it's unfortunate because
these are really the prints

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:01.300
that helped guide European
devotion for nearly a century.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.340
So these new technical studies
are really helping us think

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:09.990
about new sites of production
for these particular works

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.340
through analysis of pigments,
through analysis of ink,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.230
through analysis of paper; right?

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.380
And we're able to get at these --
these sort of wonderful resources

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.270
in this new and fascinating way.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:35.150
So even with all of these
new projects and even

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.200
with now being the
Rosenwald curator,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.200
I still think about
my one book, right?

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.770 position:56%
And I think about where it all began

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.810
and why I was able
to tell that story.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.590
And I think about that one
story within the context

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.890
of our 160 million
items at the library.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.940
And each one of them
having their own story.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.690
And a lot of our collections
have been touched

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.200
by names that we know; right?

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.750
Names that we remember.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:16.050
Names like George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson, Rosa Parks,

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:23.240
Hannah Arendt, one of my
personal favorites, Carl Sagan.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:30.630
But I think what's most exciting
and what's happening at the Library

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.420
of Congress right now is that we're
starting to discover, I think,

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.060
the people that we rarely
hear from in our collection

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.570
and we're just starting to
hear from in our collections.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.770
And new stories that are coming or
that are emerging from the Library

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:52.130
from new partnerships and new
research in our collections.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.890
So for example, the Chronicling
the America API which is something,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.510
I think, that has already been
brought up but is helping us learn

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.540
about American agriculture.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.730
Thinking about this sort
of what the organizers

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.310 position:56%
of this project call this long human
history, right, of agriculture.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:16.650 position:56%
And the way that Americans were
swept into innovation and technology

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:21.170
and science that has come
to really define modernity.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:26.230
I've actually personally
forwarded this to the historian

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.220 position:56%
at the Department of Agriculture and
he's just delighted by this project.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.670
So it was very, like,
satisfying to me.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.990
It was -- to be able to
share this with someone.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.640
The availability of newspapers

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.250
and again the Chronicling
America API is facilitating new

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.910
conversations about
American lynching.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:51.490 position:56%
Paying necessary and close attention
to the victims of violent mobs.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.720
And exploring how newspapers
played this dual role, right,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:03.440
between violence and reform
and thinking about that.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.280
We are just starting to
learn about what we will --

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.580
what will be revealed
from the release

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.260
of our 25 million mark records.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.420
Benjamin Schmitt at Northeastern
University is using the data

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.750
to create a visual history of
marked cataloging at the Library.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.280
If you haven't seen this,
I encourage you to go look.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.250
It is quite fantastic.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.230
And has certainly the
potential for insights

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.300
into our own institutional history.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.610
I've been at many meetings now
where this has been brought up

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.160
and I can assure you that
every one at the Library

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.200
of Congress has an
opinion about this project

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.060
which is nice to see; right?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.200 position:56%
But it -- this is what these
projects do is they facilitate these

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.490
sort of fabulous conversations.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.020
And it's nice to see it here
certainly at the Library.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:05.060
So just to wrap up.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.550
Again, I like to think about
my experience at the Library

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.730
and my collection that I carried.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:18.190
Again, one collection within
a galaxy of collections.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.410
And I like to think of it
as this very small part

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.360
of an emerging mosaic of
research here at the Library

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.950
where we continue to
find those stories

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.790
that are hidden in our collections.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:40.710
And whether that be an American
farmer or our own catalogers

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.380
or the son of a knife
maker in Amsterdam,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.280
right, in the 16th century.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.890
And as we continue, I think, to
explore our data which again we're

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.220
at this really exciting moment
where we're having a renaissance

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.670
with our data that we're
starting to think together

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.180
about the digital tools that might
help us find these new stories.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.960
And we can only do
that together; right?

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.970
But what's so unique, I think,
about this moment is going back

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.750
to Blake's quote about "the
once only imagined," right?

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.630
That we stand at that
moment of change right now.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.090 position:56%
And that as we keep working together

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.440
and as we keep discovering
these collections

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.220
and as we keep making
them more available,

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.420
I feel like we come
closer to truly saying

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:40.350
that what we imagine today we very
well may be able to prove tomorrow.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.510
Thank you.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.070
[ Applause ]

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.190
