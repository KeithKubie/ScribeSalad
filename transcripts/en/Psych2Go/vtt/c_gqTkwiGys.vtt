00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.760
but before going into details on how to deal with it,

you might want to watch our video '7 signs you may have high-functioning depression'.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.560
This type of depression is a lot more common than you think.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.240
According to Anxiety and Depression Association of America or ADAA,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.920
Approximately 3 million people battle with it per year.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.920
Many times this mental disorder goes unnoticed because even though it's a debilitating problem,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.500
most people are functional, but don't worry.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.620
Here are 6 practical tips to deal with high-functioning depression.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.260
Number 1: Get organized.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.900
For some, high functioning depression means forgetfulness and disorganization even though you get things done.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480
You can't remember important dates and don't get to places on time among other things.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.000
Buy an agenda and faithfully write down everything such as doctor appointments, birthdays,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.660
projects, movie release dates, when your car on oil change is due, when bills need to be paid, even simple things like

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.980
anniversaries or when you start and finish your menstrual cycle.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.700
Your agenda will be your best friend

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.880
First thing each morning when you wake up,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.060
grab it and view what you need to get done during the day and week this way you won't forget anything

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.840
Number 2: Home organization.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.700
To help yourself out, clean and throw away anything you don't need anymore.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.920
If it's in good condition, you can donate it, or have a yard sale.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.160
Why? Because extra clutter in your home means it will be more difficult for you to stay organized.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.940
Go out and buy containers, decorative boxes and folders.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.160
The trick here is to divide things into their correct place.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.760
For example, in different folders place papers by categories such as car bills in one folder and utility bills in another.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.300
In your room, divide your shirts in one drawer and pants in another.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.220
The same goes for other materials around the house.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.720
The trick here is to put things in places that you will remember to look for it.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.620
Number 3: Socialization and Hobbies.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.300
High functioning depression comes with isolation.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.120
To fix this, get involved in your favorite activities or hobbies.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.920
For example, if you like to practice martial arts then take a class.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.100
This way, you are blowing stress off by doing things you love,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.120
but at the same time you are socializing with others.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.820
Number 4: Self care.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.600
The problem with depression is that you have zero energy to take care of yourself.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.440
In turn, your self-esteem will be on the floor.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.260
No matter how hard it gets, take care of yourself.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.000
I know you've heard this all the time,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.380
but get enough sleep, drink sufficient amount of water and eat plenty of healthy meals.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.440
Believe it or not, what you eat is how you feel.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.080
If you don't get hungry or thirsty,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.880
use an alarm clock on your cell phone to remind yourself to eat and drink water.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.660
There are even apps you can download that remind you of this,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.580
and on the plus side, some of those apps are interactive, making it fun for you.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.640
Number five: Distraction.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.920
High functioning depression is complicated in the sense that you are constantly overthinking and criticizing yourself.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.000
To counter this make sure you have healthy pastimes to keep your mind busy.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.200
For example, starting a new TV series or reading your favorite book, looking up new artists,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.360
coloring, going for a walk, hanging out with friends, going to the bookstore and etc.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.760
The point here is to keep yourself busy and not let your mind wander negatively.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.140
Number six: Exercise and Hygiene

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.840
Exercising and good hygiene improves your self-esteem and self-worth.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.620
Research shows that thirty minutes a day of exercise for at least four days a week will boost your mood.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.300
And I know when you are depressed, there's no way in hell you want to get up and move.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.520
But trust me, it makes a difference.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.900
If it's too much at first, start by taking a walk around the block and gradually add cardio to your routine.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.740
Look for fun exercises such as riding a bike, dancing, Zumba, running or sports.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.840
Anything that will get you moving, but is entertaining for you

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.440
Don't forget to shower and wash your face and mouth twice a day.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.000
This will freshen you up and lighten your groggy mood

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.140
High functioning depression is difficult to deal with, but not impossible.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.940
If these tips aren't enough to help you,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.080
then psychotherapy may be of great use.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.060
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.880
Talking to the right people who truly care will help you

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.140
Not only that, but if you end up taking medication for this, then remember, there is no shame in that.
