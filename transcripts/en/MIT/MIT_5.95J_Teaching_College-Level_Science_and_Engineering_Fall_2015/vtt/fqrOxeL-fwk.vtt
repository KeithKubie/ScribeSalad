JANET RANKIN: The
think-pair-share strategy

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.170
is one of the classic
active learning strategies

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.120
that one can use
in one's classes.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.730
And it has, as you might
guess, three parts-- the think,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.410
the pair, and the share.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.900
Often there's a collapsing
of the pair and the share.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.660
But in general, you
first give students

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.440
time to think about a
question or a situation

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.920
or some other scenario that
you want them to think about.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.217
And you give them time to think
actively but alone about that.

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:39.550
And often you can ask them
to write down their thoughts.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.980
But then at the end of
that short period of time,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.470
whether it's three
minutes or five minutes,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.210
you have them pair up.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.130
And if it's a really big class
or the numbers of students

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.500
in your class warrant it,
you can have them triple up,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.030
it doesn't have to be a pair.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.610
And they discuss whatever
it is they came up with.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.580
It's just an opportunity
for them to just say here,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.840
this is what I thought of.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.160
What did you think about it?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.750
What did you think
about what I said?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.420
So it's just an interactive
opportunity for the students

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.340
to hear from their peers.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.330
And then the key part when
they're talking to each other

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.910
is that the instructor
should walk around

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.820
the room and kind of eavesdrop
on what the students are

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.330
saying.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.270
So you want to understand
the kinds of things

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.550
they're talking about, maybe
not the specific details,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.530
but the kinds of things
they're talking about.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.680
And pretty quickly you
can learn if students

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.280
are on the right track or if
there's a big misconception

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.250
that maybe they
might be reinforcing

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.030
each other's misconceptions.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.940
So you want to know
that as the instructor.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.520
So that's why if possible,
to walk around the room

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.340
and just overhear what
people are saying,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.790
that can be a really important
part of that pair step.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.970
And then for the share,
you have them report out.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.390
So this does two things.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.660
One, it lets you bring to light
any specific comments that you

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.800
overheard during
the pair section.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.430
You can bring it up
with the whole class,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.800
because there can be
some really important,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.979
wonderful observations the
students make within the pair.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.800
And if you don't share that, or
if you don't create a situation

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.780
where that can be shared
with the bigger class,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.170
then everybody misses out
except for those three people.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.590
So it gives you an
opportunity to do that.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.540
It also gives you an
opportunity to globally

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.610
clear up any
misconceptions that you've

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.370
heard that have bubbled up
from this pair exercise.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.340
The other thing it
does is if there's

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.250
a group of two or
three or even four,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.330
but I think three
is probably optimal,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.060
the group reports as a group.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.870
It doesn't report
as an individual.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.870
So if a student is
a little insecure

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.410
or may not really want to
share what he or she thinks

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.500
at a personal level or
at an individual level,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.290
being able to share out
as a group is a bit safer,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.360
is a bit more comfortable
for many students.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.270
So that's what the
share part does.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.230
And then it just gets
the whole group together,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.270
and it lets you kind of sum
up the smaller conversations

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.420
with the larger group.
