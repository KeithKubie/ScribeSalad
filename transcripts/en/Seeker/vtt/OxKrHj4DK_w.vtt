00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.480
Out of fake gods and bad gods and demi-gods
and would-be gods.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.720
Out of the whole pantheon, which god makes
societies better?

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.349
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
Recently the idea that belief in one “big
god” lead to the rise of complex societies

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.390
held sway in research circles.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.079
But that’s being challenged by new research
published in the journal Proceedings of the

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.689
Royal Society B.[1]

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.650
So this is a story of different types of religion,
there’s more monotheistic religions with

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.281
a “Moralizing High God” or one supreme
being that hands out morality and punishment,

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:37.730
and religions that have “Broad Supernatural
Punishment”, which can be loosely polytheistic,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.340
meaning many gods and includes things like
ancestral spirits and concepts like karma.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.109
Previous research showed that belief in a
“Moralizing High God (MHG)” allowed societies

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.649
to become more politically sophisticated.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.660
This research seems to refute that.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.839
It showed that religions with multiple deities
or spirits or karma type punishments lead

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.250
to more complex societies, but religions with
one “head honcho” did not.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.530
But how does a belief in any kind of religion
build complex societies?

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.780
Well thinking you’re gonna be punished if
you do something wrong, even if no one is

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.110
looking, is a pretty good deterrent or it
might make us more likely to cooperate.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.020
One study published in the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology showed that people become

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.720
less hostile in a threatening situation when
they’re reminded of their religious beliefs.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.900
This is especially important when life gets
tough.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.900
[2]

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.729
Another study published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.009
that those who live in harsh environments
tend to believe in “big Gods”.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.860
They think these beliefs drive people to be
more pro-social when conditions make it hard

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.950
to survive.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.770
Cooperation, even if it’s costly to the
individual, could enable a group to thrive

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.000
in times of stress.[3]

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.340
But it seemed like an age old tale of correlation
not causation.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.880
Some studies show it’s the other way around,
as societies get more complex they're more

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.340
likely to have one central guy in the sky.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.130
One study published in the journal Current
Biology found that as a society became more

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.289
affluent, it triggered more moralizing types
of religions.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.289
[4]

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.730
Which gets us back to the most recent research.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.480
So, the team of researchers of various Australian
institutions looked at 96 Asian Pacific cultures,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.859
because these Austronesian cultures are well
documented and less influenced by main single

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.480
deity religions like Christianity and Islam.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.280
They found that belief in a head honcho deity
did not drive or sustain the evolution of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.800
political complexity, but rather it tends
to come along for the ride.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.320
The research also suggests that it’s belief
in broad supernatural entities like ancestral

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.800
spirits or karma actually smoothed the way
for cultures to become complex.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.220
And that makes sense, just look at history,
there’s plenty of examples of cultures without

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.750
High Moralizing Gods, like the Greeks and
Romans and Mayans, who built incredibly sophisticated

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.750
societies.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.161
Maybe because of the cooperative motives I
mentioned earlier or maybe not so nobly, the

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:43.520
supernatural gives more weight to your claim
to authority and power.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.220
If you say you’re in contact with these
gods, or that these gods are your ancestors,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.470
people are gonna believe you and maybe follow
you.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.870
So this research is still in it’s early
stage and clearly needs more study.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.540
And it’s not like you have to be religious
to have a complex cooperative society anyway.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.230
Other studies show that "Some of the most
cooperative modern societies are also the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.230
most secular".[5]

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.920
But how does this new research make you feel
about the role of religion in society?
