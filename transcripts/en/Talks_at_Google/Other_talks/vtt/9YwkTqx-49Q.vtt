Ming: Hi, good afternoon my friends and friends
on Youtube.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.080
My name is Ming.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.719
I am the Jolly Good fellow of Google, and
my day job is developing personal growth curriculum

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.719
for Google.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.869
A few years ago, when we set out to create
a corporate university in Google, we wanted

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.380
to go beyond just teaching people to do things.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.520
We wanted to develop Googlists as full human
beings, because we believe that leaders are

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.780
everywhere in Google, and the best leaders
develop themselves holistically.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.579
And one of the people whose writings informed
and inspired us towards the direction that

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.579
we chose is our honored guest today, Dr. Annie
McKee.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.749
Annie is one of the world's top leaders, one
of the world's top advisors on leadership.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:55.379
She was named one of 100 best leaders by Business
Week in 2005. Business Week called her the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.839
"High Priestess of Executive Coaching."

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.859
[laughter]

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.229
I'm not worthy.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.400
Annie is the founder of Teleos Leadership
Institute, a consulting for firm with a mission

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.620
of developing value based leadership and resonant
organizations.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.640
She has co-authored best selling books on
leadership including "Primal Leadership" with

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.820
Danny Goleman and Richard Boyatzis.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.570
Annie is someone whom I feel truly understands
the inner dimension in leadership and organizations.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.230
And, in person, I found her to have an energy
that is exciting and inspiring and at the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.750
same time gentle and compassionate.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.990
And it is an honor to know, to know Annie.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.840
And my friends, please welcome, Dr. Annie
McKee.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840
[applause]

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.690
Annie McKee: Hi everybody, how are ya?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.140
Ming, Ming, and Alana, I want to thank you
for bringing me here today and for helping

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.080
get everything set up so we can have a good
hour or so.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.110
I really am delighted to be here, because
it seems that, you know, the last year or

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.780
so have brought a lot of changes to the world.
I don't need to tell you that, but I just

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.480
want to set the stage a little bit, for what
I am going to talk about today.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.180
Things have changed dramatically not only
in terms of technology but in terms of the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.790
way we relate to one another around the world
and along with that come great challenges

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.560
for us individually about how we communicate,
how we relate to one another, how we connect.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.400
And also organizationally -- how do we work
and live inside our organizations in a way

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.800
that we take ourselves and our companies forward?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.980
It's not the same as it used to be.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.270
It really truly isn't.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.170
When we look at the models of organizations
that exist frankly in most companies today

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.480
and have existed for the last 3-4-5 hundred
years, they're modeled on the Catholic Church

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
and the military.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.460
They are pyramids with somebody at the top,
in the case of the former, somebody who has

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.470
a direct link to God.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.340
That's not the way it is anymore in many companies,
and people are struggling, and companies are

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.690
struggling about how to live, work, and lead
inside these new organizations.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.060
So that's what I want to talk about today.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.120
I want to make it really personal; I want
to make it about you.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780
In fact, I'm going to do something a little
unusual in a few minutes and break the action,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.959
have you guys talk to each other.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.069
Really get into the topics, and try to make
them your own.

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.270
Will you go with me on that to have a little
bit of fun?

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.140
Cool. Alright.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.110
Let me set the stage about what I would like
to talk about.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.110
It's good.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.190
If you looked at any of my writings, you know
I'm going to talk about emotional intelligence.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.599
I really do believe emotional intelligence
is at the core of effective leadership today.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.750
Why is that?

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.420
Because we need to relate to people differently
than we have in the past.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.890
We need much more self-awareness to be able
to manage ourselves, the stress and strain

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.040
of today's work places, to dig deep and find
our special talents and make sure we can bring

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.099
them out.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.150
We have to manage our own emotional responses,
to what's going on in our lives, in our work,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.470
in our relationship, etc., and we also have
to be engaged with other people in a way that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.050
allows them to be as effective as they can.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.180
Now what's exciting about this is that people
have been saying that stuff forever.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.850
I mean it is so obvious.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.550
It is almost silly, but the reality is that
there's science behind it.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.500
So, I'm going to talk a little bit about that.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.460
I'm also going to talk a little bit about
kind of a holistic approach to leadership,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.930
mind, body, heart, and spirit.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.000
And if you can imagine me sort of presenting
that to my publisher, Har--which happened

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.430
to be Harvard, and saying, "No, really, spirit's
part of the deal."

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.620
If you can imagine that conversation, and
how it went, but it's really true.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.750
I, I, obviously for our mind, you are recruited
for your minds, so I have been told.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.870
So unless one of you snuck in the backdoor,
you're all pretty smart.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.810
But that's not what makes the difference in
great leadership.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.030
I mean, that sounds strange maybe, but that's
not what makes the difference in great leadership.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.840
Maybe it makes a difference in becoming a
great engineer, but it does not make the difference

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.100
for great leadership.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.600
What does is what I am sort of facetiously
calling 'heart' up there, emotion and emotional

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600
intelligence.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600
And I have the word 'body'.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.050
Okay, what do I mean by that?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.840
Does it mean that you have to be strong and
big and rough and tough.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.330
Well, no, but it does mean you need to be
resilient, physically and psychologically

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.919
resilient, and by the way those two are intertwined.

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.990
'Spirit', okay, I'm not talking about religion,
although for some people, that's the way it

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.990
plays out.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.229
I'm talking about beliefs and values, and
how you live them, and how you stand up for

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.479
them even when things get tough.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.699
And again, there's some science around this
that I'm going to share just a little bit

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.169
later on.

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:58.320
Resonant leaders truly look out for themselves
in a positive and professional and powerful

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.389
way and they also look out for other people.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.900
Resonant leaders take in everything in their
environment and mix it like soup until it's

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.900
perfect.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.460
Just the ingredients go in one by one until
they are perfect and the ingredients are personal,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.900
the ingredients are professional, and the
ingredients are group oriented, because if

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.050
you -- if you ever were taught or believed,
that organizations are successful because

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.680
of one or two people at the top, or wherever,
it's not true.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.120
They're successful because of us as a group.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.520
So with that in mind, I want to take you through
a little bit of a reflection.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.440
I said I was going to make this personal and
here we go.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.660
I'd like you to look at the pictures that
I'm going to show over the next two minutes

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.660
or so.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.540
And I want to just, you just to think about
who these people are.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.009
Some you will not know.

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.623
The images will evoke things for you and just
stay with it for a minute and then I'm going

00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:53.623
to ask you to talk about them.

00:06:53.623 --> 00:07:10.699
[silence]

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:28.161
Annie: You know what?

00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:29.561
Before I ask you to talk about them.

00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:35.389
I want to tell you a story to bring home how
powerful each one of us can be, even if we're

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.509
not personally connected with another person
or another human being.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:43.860
The story I'm going to tell you, despite the
picture up there, is not actually about Nelson

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.860
Mandela.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.860
Okay?

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.800
It is about one of the people that he touched.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.050
Now, I happened to be very fortunate, in that
we've done quite a lot of work in Africa,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.569
and my husband is Zambian so we go there a
lot, and we've been able to do a lot of work

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:00.310
with people from all over the place.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.460
And in fact, we were working with the U.N.,
and when you work with the U.N., they take

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.169
security very, very seriously.

00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:12.150
So, you get off the plane in South Africa
for example, and the driver meets you, and

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.580
it was not until the second trip that we realized
that the driver was really a security guard

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.229
and was not going to let us out of his sight,
and there was a gun under the seat and all

00:08:19.229 --> 00:08:20.229
the rest of that.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:24.731
So these are highly trained professionals
and we were doing this work for 3 or 4 or

00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:25.731
5 years.

00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:30.330
So we would go all over South Africa in one
of those white Range Rovers with our driver,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.330
who was called Philemon.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:37.390
And you get to know each other, and you find
out a little about each other's lives, about

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.740
kids, about all that sort of thing, because
you're sitting in a car for hours on end.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:47.320
So, somewhere around year 2, we started getting
close, and I remember this one trip.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.360
We were driving up Limpopo Province which
is very remote, you might know.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.531
And Philemon told us his story of how he came
to be the person he was.

00:08:57.531 --> 00:08:59.240
We did not ask him -- it just sort of came
out.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.660
You all remember Apartheid in South Africa,
of course.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:10.950
And, you may or may not know it, but Pretoria
was a white only city during those years -- meaning

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.950
that Blacks could not live there; they could
only live on the outskirts.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.560
Now, obviously, it was a full and vibrant
city, so it required everybody to work.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.600
And people were, black people were literally
trucked in to Pretoria and trucked back out

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.760
to these god-awful townships every single
day.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.220
Well, one day, Philemon got home; his wife
rode a different truck, and she didn't come

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.972
home, and he got the neighborhood looking
for her, and all the rest of that.

00:09:37.972 --> 00:09:42.510
She just didn't come home, and they didn't
find her the next day or the next day, until

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:49.680
they finally found her 3 or 4 days in – dead,
still on the street, shot by the police because

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.190
she had been out after curfew trying to make
her way home.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:00.290
So Philemon told us what that did to him,
and I think you can imagine.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.180
He was filled with rage and hatred, and all
of the thing you can possibly imagine -- for

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.180
years.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.560
He said it became his blood -- that was the
way he described it.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:18.240
And his two small boys, who were 12 or 13
when their mom died, also became to be that

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.140
full of hatred and resentment and fear, too,
and they all in their various ways joined

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.019
part of the movement that were pretty violent.

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:31.850
So fast-forward a few years, and Nelson Mandela
is out of prison, and he is traveling the

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:38.380
country, talking about truth and reconciliation
and peace and no Civil War.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.491
Somebody dragged Philemon to one of these
great big rallies of 10,000 or more people,

00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:48.290
and he said he sat on the side; he sat on
the edge of the crowd, not interested in this

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.630
truth and reconciliation and peace.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.810
He wasn't interested, he said, but he started
listening to the man and listening to his

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.920
story about what he had experienced and his
children, etc.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:04.890
And he told me," I don't know what happened
that day, but at a certain point in time,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:12.650
I felt that the man was speaking to me and
me alone. All of those people disappeared.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:17.560
It's almost like a cloud came over and took
them away, and it was only me and him, and

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:24.260
he was talking to my experience, my losing
my wife and what I felt afterwards, and what

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.470
my life was going to be like if I kept on
the path that I was on, and what it could

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.900
be like if I chose a different way."

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:37.140
And he said, "I don't know what happened,
but I changed. That very moment I changed.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.230
And I got up off that rock and I walked into
a different life."

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.950
And in fact, he did.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.730
He went to school, and he got connected with
the U.N., and he ended up being in this good

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.120
job, and on and on and on.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.930
And his kids also became very successful.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:59.180
Now, I don't know that people change in a
minute, in an instance, but I do know people

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.540
change.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.990
And I do know they change, because somebody
touches their hearts.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:12.430
Somebody really goes in deep and finds just
that spark of hope, that spark of magic that

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:19.339
releases talent and potential, and a belief
in a better future.

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:25.670
So, I want you guys to turn that in on your
own lives for just a few minutes.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.010
Think about the people in your life; it probably
isn't Nelson Mandela.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:35.170
It might have been an uncle or an aunt; it
might have been one of your children -- who

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.840
allowed you to open up and see your life,
a different way.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.850
Somebody who saw something in you, who relied
on you for something, or who really saw what

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.709
you could be if you gave yourself a chance.

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:50.510
So, I'll time it, but for the next 3 minutes
just turn around and talk to each other about

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.120
whoever that person is for you.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:13:02.970
[audience talking.]

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:14.011
Annie: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:13:14.011 --> 00:13:15.011
Listen.

00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:19.570
The reason I wanted you to do that wasn't
only because I wanted you to connect with

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.730
what it means to be in contact again with
whoever that person was because it was probably

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.820
a pretty good experience.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.670
It's actually related to the topic, "How do
people change?"

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:36.459
And I want you to keep this in mind, as I
go through the rest of this material today.

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:39.850
People change when they want to, period.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.110
I don't care if you've got the best leadership
development program in the world.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.830
I don't care if you have the best teachers
in the world or that your bonus is going to

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:50.830
increase.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:56.050
People change because they want to, and they
usually change when they're moving toward

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:02.910
something that's really powerfully and positively
attractive to their whole lives, right, not

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.579
just their work.

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:10.070
And the other thing about this is that, generally
speaking, when people feel positive emotions

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:16.660
 – I'll get into this more in a bit -- positive
emotions, like excitement and energy and hope,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.110
right – we're more willing to engage in
the hard work of change.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:30.519
On the other hand, when we're feeling things
like judged, unfairly evaluated or, kind of

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:34.300
the incredible, along with the incredible
highs at work, those incredible lows that

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.490
you don't understand, that is when people
don't change.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.910
That's when it becomes really hard for people
to change fundamental habits such as those

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.041
that are related to emotional intelligence.

00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:50.130
So I want you to keep that in mind because
a lot of people will say, "We can't really

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.649
develop leadership – you're born with it.

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:56.970
You can't really develop emotional intelligence
because it's so deep -- things like self-awareness

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:57.980
and empathy.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:58.980
I don't believe that.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.839
I fundamentally believe that people like change.

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:08.900
But they've got to be touched or sparked in
a certain kind of way and as leaders here,

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.480
 -- and I hear everyone is supposed to be
a leader around here – that's what you need

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.450
to learn to do for other people, touch them
in a way that they want to go forward in a

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.610
different kind of way.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.010
Now it's really common sense what I'm talking
about.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:27.600
Resonant leadership is emotional intelligence
 – it's using your mind, your intellect

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.010
well, it's using your presence, your physical
appearance, and your resilience, and it's

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.149
sticking to your values.

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:37.010
There's nothing brand-new about that message.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:42.510
What's new about it is that we know these
things can be learned and we know which aspects

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.399
of them are really going to change the way
you show up as a leader.

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:49.649
So let's look at some of those.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:55.149
If it's true that resonant leadership is commonsense,
why is it not common practice?

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:58.600
We've gone around and looked at leaders thousands
and thousands of leaders around the world.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:05.779
And I hate to say it, but probably only about
10 or 15% would, in my mind, be considered

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:06.779
great.

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:10.701
And even if I used some of the research and
measured them up to benchmarks, etc., it's

00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:15.480
really low and that's just not right, because
people get up in the morning intending to

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.839
do a good job with the people who depend on
them.

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:22.220
And a lot of us just plain don't or if we
do, we fall down along the way.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.350
So, why is that?

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.660
One of the reasons I think is that we operate
on false assumptions about what it means to

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.110
be a good leader.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.130
A lot of us have that old fashioned model
that we tell – and somebody does, okay -- that

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.709
we should leave our emotions at the doorstep
of the workplace.

00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:40.810
That's all hogwash; it's not true.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.139
It simply isn't and the research tells us
that.

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:47.260
We need to bring our whole self to this thing
called 'leadership', and we need to let go

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.480
of some of these false myths that we hold
about what it means to be great.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.430
Myth #1: Smart is good enough.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.550
If you're a really good technician and if
you're a really good individual contributor,

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.760
you're going to make a good manager.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.160
No, you're not.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.179
Otherwise, we'd see a lot of better managers
out there.

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:10.780
The studies that we've done and our colleagues
have done have shown that competencies related

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:16.399
to emotional intelligence make the difference
 -- self-awareness, self-management, social

00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:22.659
awareness, and relationship management statistically
differentiate great leaders from their more

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:23.709
average peers.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:28.910
Now, you could spend your whole life being
an average manager or director, and you're

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.200
not going to get kicked out of your job.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.840
You're not going to get fired.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.629
You're just going to be average, which, I
don't know about you, but that's not good

00:17:35.629 --> 00:17:36.850
enough.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.190
Myth #2: Emotions don't matter at work.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.740
Well that's stupid.
People are emotional beings.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.090
We bring our emotions wherever we go.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.249
We can hide them.

00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:49.179
We can try to mask them.

00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:53.690
We can ignore them or deny them or whatever,
but they're still there and they affect us

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.690
and they affect other people.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.389
The recent neuroscience talks about how our
emotions, in fact, can open up our minds or

00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:05.029
close our minds down to get back to why this
is important at work.

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:08.570
Myth #3: You're a superhero.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:14.369
I mean, you can take anything that the world
or work dishes out.

00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:15.389
Well, maybe you can.

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:19.629
The people in this room are probably pretty
resilient; you're also recruited for that.

00:18:19.629 --> 00:18:20.629
Okay.

00:18:20.629 --> 00:18:23.789
And in fact, people who are good leaders are
very resilient.

00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:29.169
But even those of us who're really good, even
those of you who are at the top of your game

00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:34.789
at leadership, at leading others, at influencing
others, at inspiring them sooner or later

00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:41.230
the pressures of the world of work that we're
facing today can get the better of us and

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.769
bring us down.

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:44.559
And take each one of these a little bit more
directly.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.100
Why is emotion important?

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.380
Well, to simplify the science greatly, we
feel before we think.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.029
It is a survival mechanism.

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:57.769
It is the fight, flight, nurture, and comfort
response.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:04.669
When we're faced with stimuli, we process
it first in the limbic brain, the thing they

00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:06.080
call the 'primitive brain'.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.250
It's been with us a long time.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.169
It's what got us out of the way of the saber
tooth tigers and all the rest of that.

00:19:11.169 --> 00:19:17.760
It's still with us. You walk into your space
some morning and you look over across the

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.509
hall, and you see a couple of people who are
having an argument, maybe a polite argument;

00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:23.830
you know it's an argument.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.299
You are going to bristle up because you're
human and emotions are contagious and you

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:30.019
pick them up.

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:34.659
You're going to start feeling the way people
around you feel, just as they pick up on your

00:19:34.659 --> 00:19:35.659
emotions.

00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:36.919
So here's the worst-case scenario.

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:40.729
You feel and you react.

00:19:40.729 --> 00:19:47.320
Now let me say that differently. You feel
and then you act and then you think.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.080
Who among us hasn't done that?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:58.039
What we really want to do is to try to feel
and then think and then act, which is a skill

00:19:58.039 --> 00:20:02.279
that you can learn and it's a skill called
self-awareness and it's another set of skills

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:05.950
called self-management.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.399
Emotional attractors.

00:20:08.399 --> 00:20:11.909
Of the many emotions we feel, I put a few
of these up here.

00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:17.429
This piece of information is based on the
study of Chaos theory and applying Chaos theory

00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:21.919
to the interaction of human beings and how
emotions impact us.

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:26.720
Positive emotional attractors hope, joy, excitement.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.629
It could also be that edgy kind of excitement.

00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:30.940
It's not just good feelings.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.909
It's kind of like "Yeah, I got it".

00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:40.899
Those enable us personally to literally open
up our cognitive categories -- the way we

00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:46.470
process information, how we perceive situations,
and think more clearly, think more broadly,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.049
take in more information, and come up with
better answers.

00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:55.979
Positive emotional attractors, which let me
say this again, doesn't always feel good.

00:20:55.979 --> 00:20:58.149
Sometimes it's really edgy.

00:20:58.149 --> 00:21:00.450
Sometimes it's a little bit urrrr.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:07.100
Negative emotional attractors on the other
hand -- hate, fear, anxiety, extreme chronic

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.879
stress which, oh by the way, a lot of us feel
today even though we don't really admit it

00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:13.269
 -- we do.

00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:16.399
Those on the other hand close us down.

00:21:16.399 --> 00:21:20.450
They close down our cottic, cognic, cognitive
categories.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.529
They put filters over our eyes and our ears
and our nose and whatever else.

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:32.679
So, less information gets through, resulting
in worse decisions, hiding out, bad behavior,

00:21:32.679 --> 00:21:40.779
and generally an unpleasant person to be around,
which by the way is again contagious.

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:44.750
So, when we talk about emotional intelligence,
we're talking about something specific. And

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:49.730
let me say that there are a number of people
studying E.I., and we come at it slightly

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.499
different ways.

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:56.369
I'm not one of those people who says, "Our
way is the best way." or "Their research isn't

00:21:56.369 --> 00:21:57.369
great."

00:21:57.369 --> 00:21:58.369
I just don't go there.

00:21:58.369 --> 00:22:02.259
I believe the various camps -- and there are
about 3, including ours, who are studying

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:06.159
this thing -- are all doing the good work
of trying to figure out what it is that links

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.609
emotion to our behavior.

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:09.759
We do it with competencies.

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:15.489
Competencies are skills with intention behind
them based on our preferences about how to

00:22:15.489 --> 00:22:17.149
think, believe, and act.

00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:22.999
There are probably dozens and dozens of studies
around the world as well as about 40 years

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:26.239
of studies here in the US about competencies.

00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:32.220
They are observable behaviors that allow you
to be more effective at work – period.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.799
And our set allow you be more effective as
a leader.

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:38.399
Self-awareness: It's obvious.

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:39.399
I know myself.

00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:40.490
I understand my emotions.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.960
I know what I'm feeling, I know their impact
on me, and I can manage them.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960
That's number 2.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.659
I can manage my emotions for good.

00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:53.330
So I can draw deep down inside me when I'm
having a pretty bad day and find that glimmer

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:59.130
of hope that I know is there in me, and that
I need to spark in other people.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:05.529
I realize that my energy transfers to other
people, so I use it a certain way -- you can

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:07.200
do the same.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:13.159
Social awareness: I want to hone in on one
of these, which is empathy.

00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:14.159
Okay.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:19.609
I don't mean the psychological term, or the
 -- you may know the name of this psychologist,

00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:21.999
the Carl Rogers, "Oh, I know how you're feeling."

00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:26.970
No, okay. I mean understanding deeply what
motivates other people, what touches them,

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.559
what makes them move, what gets them up off
the couch.

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:36.009
It's a critical skill in leadership, much
underestimated.

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:39.640
And then finally, relationship skills: The
kinds of things you probably think about more

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.029
often when it comes to leadership -- inspiration,
teamwork, etc.

00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:48.599
All very important, but not possible without
the other 3.

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:54.610
You can go to 10 workshops at Harvard or Wharton
or wherever and study negotiation or influence

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.859
or whatever, and you're not going to be any
good at it unless you're self-aware, you manage

00:23:57.859 --> 00:24:00.460
yourself well, and you understand other people.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.090
You just aren't.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.090
Okay, this is fun.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:09.320
I recently have been writing for some of your
younger colleagues who are still in college.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.609
And I came across some really good research
on the link between emotion, thinking, and

00:24:14.609 --> 00:24:16.529
creativity.

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:17.649
Really good stuff.

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:23.119
Okay, so, if you think about creativity as
having a knowledge domain, you know enough

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:26.349
to be messing around with whatever you're
messing around, and sometimes that's really

00:24:26.349 --> 00:24:28.969
hard work and an emotional domain.

00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:31.840
Some people call that intuition; it's not.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.610
Okay, scientifically it is how we process
emotion and link them with our thoughts.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.889
There are kind of four ways of looking at
it.

00:24:38.889 --> 00:24:41.639
First, deliberate and spontaneous is one dimension;
you get that.

00:24:41.639 --> 00:24:46.649
And then there is cognitive and emotional.

00:24:46.649 --> 00:24:51.469
Creativity isn't something that always just
occurs to us or happens in our sleep.

00:24:51.469 --> 00:24:57.679
Sometimes it's a very deliberate process of
going back into our long-term memory and understanding

00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:02.029
what's there and linking it with kind of what,
again, most people call 'intuition'.

00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:04.269
I think I need to go this way.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:05.429
That's emotional.

00:25:05.429 --> 00:25:11.549
Sometimes it is spontaneous and your emotions
just burst on the scenes like 'I know exactly

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:17.460
what to do; now let me go understand what
other people say about this and see if I can

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.090
come up with something.'

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.029
So if you look at this, you've got deliberate
and emotional.

00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:25.440
You've got deliberate and cognitive, right?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.859
That might be sort of the way the light bulb
was developed.

00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:35.190
Test after test after test after test, years
of research, okay?

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:40.340
Then you've got spontaneous, both emotional
and cognitive.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.340
This is interesting stuff.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.909
You should get this the, there is a whole
stream of study coming out about this, and

00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:47.259
I highly recommend you go look at it.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:51.340
All right, here we go into the fun stuff again,
all right?

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.929
I've been talking about people.

00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:58.309
I would really love you to walk out of here
thinking, "Yeah, I could do this emotional

00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:00.789
intelligence stuff a little bit better. That
is cool."

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:04.929
But that's not enough and that's because we
work in groups.

00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:08.850
We don't work alone, and you can perfect your
E.I., but if you never use with other people,

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:09.850
you're sunk.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.879
It doesn't help.

00:26:11.879 --> 00:26:17.229
We're mammals; we sidle up to each other and
we share ideas and we share feelings.

00:26:17.229 --> 00:26:19.440
In fact, we share feelings even when we don't
know it.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.759
Emotions are contagious – literally.

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:27.590
There are these great studies that had started
in Rome, have now been taken up all of the

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:32.259
world -- looking at what they are calling
'mirror neurons', 'mirror neurons'.

00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:37.899
They are physical structures in our brain
whose purpose seems to be, sole purpose I

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:43.200
should say, seems to be to mirror the emotions
of other human beings.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:49.219
So it isn't just reading body language' it's
scientific transmission of feelings among

00:26:49.219 --> 00:26:51.099
and between people.

00:26:51.099 --> 00:26:53.970
It's an explanation for what we actually know
we do.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.710
Now this is particularly important when it
comes to leadership.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:58.869
Why is that?

00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:00.969
We're mammals – I'll say it again – we're
mammals.

00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:06.510
We look up to the stronger, more powerful
beings in our group and we pay a heck of a

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:12.009
lot of attention to their emotions, because
they can affect our lives.

00:27:12.009 --> 00:27:16.119
They have power over us, even if we don't
like to say that, they do.

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:19.190
And it's a dance -- you know this dance.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:25.330
When you first met somebody and you're sitting
down, there's all that's said, unsaid conversation

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.799
that's going between us.

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.610
Like I said, and it's not just reading body
language.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:34.879
It's a transmission of emotion, a transmission
of understanding, and it can be beautiful.

00:27:34.879 --> 00:27:41.450
Half of the time it is. I believe the greatest
inventions have come out of that kind of communication,

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.539
among and between people.

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:46.460
But it can also be dangerous.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:53.409
Dissonant leaders, positioned leaders or informal
leaders -- it doesn't matter.

00:27:53.409 --> 00:27:56.820
Dissonant leaders wreak havoc in our organizations.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.539
They hurt people -- they really do.

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:03.929
And you don't have to have a formal manager
or director position to be in this kind of

00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:07.830
situation where you potentially are harming
other people.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.900
You walk in as a team member in a morning
and grumble and groan about something that

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.489
happened to you yesterday.

00:28:13.489 --> 00:28:17.539
Add that little conversation then 10 minutes
later you bring it up again; you're pinging

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:22.369
somebody off the drawing board there.

00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:24.570
Okay, what happens?

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:29.070
A lot of people say, "Well you know, if they
didn't do such and such, I wouldn't be having

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.639
such a hard time. I wish that they'd change."

00:28:32.639 --> 00:28:35.250
Do you know I have heard CEOs say things like
that.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:45.219
It's crazy how people want to look up and
find somebody to blame, but the minute you

00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:51.739
become a victim, you stop being a leader,
and other people know it.

00:28:51.739 --> 00:28:55.879
So if you want to have impact, find another
way of explaining what's going on.

00:28:55.879 --> 00:29:02.200
Either take responsibility, right, or start
helping to fix the problem.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.989
Now for me, that's not all that easy.

00:29:04.989 --> 00:29:07.129
It's much easier said than done.

00:29:07.129 --> 00:29:12.729
Because if you step up and take responsibility
for fixing the problem, people are going to

00:29:12.729 --> 00:29:16.529
be pointing at you, and calling you "them",
right.

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:20.830
But it's the right thing to do.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.279
It's your choice -- "resonance" or "dissonance".

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:26.009
It's your choice; it really is.

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:30.210
You may say you can't affect things, and people
are stressed out, you can't get through to

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.559
them, or maybe you don't have time.

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:35.749
You could say all those things, but it's really
your choice.

00:29:35.749 --> 00:29:38.539
You have a lot of impact on the people around
you.

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:44.119
If you just take between now and noon tomorrow,
and just watch how people respond to you,

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:49.190
you will see how much impact you have on the
people here and the people in your life and

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.559
people at work.

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:56.210
So, let's say for a moment that you actually
get it -- you are emotionally intelligent,

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:02.149
you have a lot of commonsense, you know how
to apply it to work, but you start to realize

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:05.440
that you might be part of the problem around
here.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.669
Maybe it's at home, maybe things are a little
stressed out at home.

00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:12.269
You say, "Hey geez, maybe it's me, maybe I
really need to look at what's going on with

00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:13.269
me."

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:18.240
You say, "How does this happen? I don't get
up in the morning trying to cause people pain,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.690
or make them feel like I don't care about
them. But somehow those words just came out

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.700
my mouth in this group meeting, and I have
just kind of derailed the group."

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.539
You see it.

00:30:29.539 --> 00:30:31.359
How could this happen?

00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:33.091
Especially if you really are a good leader.

00:30:33.091 --> 00:30:36.309
Well, I'll tell you how it happens.

00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:41.359
We often expect ourselves and our leaders
to be superheroes, to take anything and everything

00:30:41.359 --> 00:30:47.360
the world gives us and just shed it off like
Teflon, and we're not like that as human beings.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.089
We need coping mechanisms, and we need to
know how to handle it, okay.

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:56.739
What happens for us is that, especially for
good leaders, especially for those who are

00:30:56.739 --> 00:31:02.220
really good at this thing called 'leadership',
you just take on the responsibility more and

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.220
more and more.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.999
And you like it, which is a good thing, right?

00:31:05.999 --> 00:31:11.989
But put that against the backdrop of a stressful
world, that's changing a lot.

00:31:11.989 --> 00:31:18.259
With balancing everything you can think of
from your life outside of here, to a team

00:31:18.259 --> 00:31:22.379
that you're not particularly attached to,
to a project that seems to be heading in the

00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:27.330
wrong direction and multiply that month after
month after month.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:32.039
You can start to find yourself really sinking
under the burden, no matter how strong you

00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:37.320
are, no matter now strong you are, and you
can really end up feeling this thing called

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.090
power stress, month after month, to the point
that you know what, you just don't have enough

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.849
to give any more.

00:31:44.849 --> 00:31:50.950
You just don't feel you can be at your best
as a leader or even as a professional.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.799
It's a pretty crummy feeling.

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:55.469
We call it the 'Sacrifice Syndrome'.

00:31:55.469 --> 00:32:01.059
Effective leadership, daily crises, the world
behind us, etc, ends up with us feeling like

00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:06.409
we we're really giving too much, and we're
not able to be our best -- when in fact, we

00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:08.589
can and could.

00:32:08.589 --> 00:32:11.909
I know you're all smart enough to be good
leaders.

00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:16.399
Chances are you wouldn't even be in this room
if you didn't understand some of the things

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:21.969
that go into being really effective in groups
and teams as a leader.

00:32:21.969 --> 00:32:24.190
So I know you can do this.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.539
We've looked at a few ways that can help people
 – okay and I mean really practically help

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:29.539
people.

00:32:29.539 --> 00:32:33.479
Stay in the zone of resonant leadership.

00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:37.619
Avoid that place we called the 'Sacrifice
Syndrome'.

00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:44.359
Make sure you can sustain your effectiveness
even when things are tough.

00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:46.809
There are a lot of ways of looking at that.

00:32:46.809 --> 00:32:53.130
Our choice has been to look at three particular
aspects, experiences really, human experiences

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:59.009
that affect us both neurologically, psychologically
and then cognitively.

00:32:59.009 --> 00:33:01.960
Mindfulness, hope, and compassion.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:09.349
Let me talk about them because they're a little
bit unusual topics to be discussing about

00:33:09.349 --> 00:33:10.349
business leadership.

00:33:10.349 --> 00:33:14.409
What do we mean by the 'mindfulness'?

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:21.059
Well, we've borrowed from two fields -- aone
is cognitive psychology.

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:26.070
Cognitive psychology is the study of how we
take in information, how we perceive stimuli,

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:29.959
how we organize it in our brains, and then
what we do with it, alright.

00:33:29.959 --> 00:33:36.840
The researchers in this arena claim, based
on very good research, that the extent to

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:44.799
which we can clearly understand how we take
in information, how we organize it, and how

00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:50.379
we use it -- helps us to be more effective
when we learn, when we try new things, when

00:33:50.379 --> 00:33:53.849
we're creative, when we're innovative.

00:33:53.849 --> 00:33:58.830
Cognitive psychology allows us to understand
what to do with information.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:06.070
Moreover, this stream of research tells us,
that if we're able to do this, the work, if

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:11.309
you can understand the segue, the work of
taking in information becomes less, it becomes

00:34:11.309 --> 00:34:13.429
easier, because our systems are more open.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.700
That's one side.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:22.059
We've also borrowed from certain aspects of
Buddhist philosophy which as some of you know,

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:27.329
much oversimplified once again, is the ability
to clear and calm.

00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:31.490
It is the way I think if it -- clear your
mind, calm your mind.

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:35.179
So put those things together, understanding
how your mind works and being open to new

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.679
information, clear and calm.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:43.919
You've got the basis for understanding what's
going on around you and not getting triggered

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:47.470
by your emotions quite as much as you would
normally.

00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:53.369
You've also got the basis to, if I can use
this word, manipulate your emotions so they

00:34:53.369 --> 00:35:00.150
work for you as opposed to beat you down.
You also have the basis for determining how

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:08.529
to face situations so you can both neurologically
and psychologically remain resilient, which

00:35:08.529 --> 00:35:13.089
brings me to the idea of mind, body, heart,
and spirit.

00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:18.660
Mindfulness allows you to pay attention to
your whole being which in our research and

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.260
our perspective is the foundation for good
leadership.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.589
You need it all.

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:32.380
There's no segmenting this thing. Mind, body,
heart and spirit together, informed by mindfulness,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.079
allows us to have our feet on the ground and
know where we're going, and understand how

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:42.510
to deal with the situations that we, that
we can then embrace.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.079
Hope, wow, it's a powerful thing.

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:53.289
Any of you who've experienced a loss or a
natural disaster or a tragedy in your life,

00:35:53.289 --> 00:35:55.519
you know what gets you through.

00:35:55.519 --> 00:35:57.059
It's hope.

00:35:57.059 --> 00:36:00.539
That belief that the future will be better
than the past.

00:36:00.539 --> 00:36:06.480
That if I put one foot forward, as hard as
it is, I'll get there.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.930
Or we'll get there.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:13.349
Well let me tell you, it's not only about
how it makes us feel.

00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:19.069
The experience of hope changes our neurophysiology.

00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:23.480
The exercise I had you do in the beginning
about talking about somebody who helped you

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:30.039
probably stirred up some feelings of good
energy, and probably hope.

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:37.839
When we are experiencing hope, a key is turned
and our parasympathetic nervous system, which

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:43.660
regulates how we respond to emotion etc.,
is turned on.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:50.089
What that means is, it is countering the effects
of our sympathetic nervous system, which is

00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:55.019
activated when we're under extreme and chronic
stress.

00:36:55.019 --> 00:37:01.609
So as lovely as the idea of hope is and as
much as it's been used in religions and spiritual

00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:04.240
practices, etc., that's not all that's good
for.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:10.640
It actually counters the neurological effect
of extreme and chronic power stress.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.589
And finally, compassion.

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:17.099
It's the same thing.

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:20.859
The experience of compassion is endemic to
human beings.

00:37:20.859 --> 00:37:26.510
We are drawn to feel empathy for other people.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.680
It's natural.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:33.400
In fact, it may be one of the bases of how
our species interacts on the planet; I believe

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400
it is.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.619
There is some new, again new research that
is indicating that in fact rather than being

00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:44.150
the war mongering, horrible beasts that we
are presented as in movies and TV, in the

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:49.030
news and all the rest of that, it may just
be that empathy is the driver of most of our

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.299
behavior on the planet.

00:37:51.299 --> 00:37:56.650
Compassion, like hope, triggers the parasympathetic
nervous system, which can help you get through

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.890
and be the best you can be, even when things
are a little bit tough.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.329
Now, practically what does that mean?

00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:03.190
Are you Mother Theresa?

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:06.950
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:15.339
Little acts, such as, saying, "Hey, how are
you?" and then waiting for the response, that's

00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:22.000
a compassionate act. Asking somebody, 'How
are you today?', letting them talk to you,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.140
and then actually responding, see if you can
perk them up a little bit.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.140
That's compassion.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.720
Mentoring somebody – that's a compassionate
act, whether it's formal or informal.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.369
Coaching somebody around a problem at work.

00:38:35.369 --> 00:38:36.549
Being interested.

00:38:36.549 --> 00:38:39.951
You don't have to do much to turn this on
at work.

00:38:39.951 --> 00:38:47.451
Okay, I've talked about emotional intelligence
and contagion of emotions, and how they can

00:38:47.451 --> 00:38:49.769
affect us personally.

00:38:49.769 --> 00:38:53.089
How they can affect our groups.

00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:57.970
And I invite you to take these ideas in, and
think about them consciously.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.599
Don't sort of stick them down and say, "Yea,
that is great. I'll work on that later."

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:06.039
Think about them consciously; live a little
bit more consciously around your emotions

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:07.990
and mindfulness and hope and compassion.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:12.430
Turn that dial 2 degrees, and you will be
a better leader.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.130
You will be a better leader.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.930
Give people the opportunity to learn from
you.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:23.329
Give them hope; show them you care.

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:29.160
These are practical, commonsense, research-based
ideas that can help you actually be the change

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.519
you want to be in the world.

00:39:30.519 --> 00:39:35.390
And I invite you to give me a call in 6 months
and see how it worked out.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:41.099
Thank you very much.

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:43.809
[applause]

00:39:43.809 --> 00:39:45.750
I would love if anyone has questions.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.119
I know we're toward the end of our time pretty
soon, but if there are some questions, I'd

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:50.430
love to take them.

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:54.029
If you ask me a question, I will repeat it
back in the microphone so we can all hear.

00:39:54.029 --> 00:39:57.130
Any thought or ideas or comments?

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:02.549
Yea, in the back.

00:40:02.549 --> 00:40:10.140
[male voice, inaudible]

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.589
Annie: Great question.

00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:15.079
Let me just be sure I heard you.

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:21.590
You're asking about emotional intelligence,
and it being a differentiator between senior

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.750
or exceptional leaders and average.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:24.809
And how do we assess it?

00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:29.130
[male voice, inaudible]

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:34.210
Annie: That is an excellent question.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:38.500
Okay, so how do you assess emotional intelligence
in an interview for example.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.569
It's easy to assess technical capabilities
usually.

00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:44.181
It's difficult to assess emotional intelligence.

00:40:44.181 --> 00:40:46.971
All right, there are a couple of things that
you can do.

00:40:46.971 --> 00:40:52.109
First of all, you've got to turn on your "empathy"
 , okay, and be really watchful about the

00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:53.490
person's behavior.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:59.549
And the kinds of things you're looking for
are curiosity about you, curiosity about the

00:40:59.549 --> 00:41:04.460
situation; are they open to looking at the
situation and making sense of it?

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.119
Okay, that would be sort of reaching out and
looking.

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:09.740
Are they able to express empathy in the form
of curiosity?

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.579
Are they able to express social awareness
by how they showed up and what they're wearing,

00:41:13.579 --> 00:41:14.579
and all of the rest of that.

00:41:14.579 --> 00:41:17.390
So you can use your own powers of observation.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:22.460
My favorite way to try to get at the heart
of that without a formal assessment is to

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:28.859
ask them to tell me a story, a real story,
about a situation in which they were expected

00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:32.529
to lead, and the group was very difficult,
and what they did.

00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:37.369
And then, as I'm listening, I'm coding for
the competencies. I'm coding for emotional

00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:39.599
self-awareness.
Did they fly off the handle?

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:41.430
I'm coding for self-management.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:46.380
I'm coding for the initiative. I'm coding
for the ability to even look at difficult

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.519
situations positively.

00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:53.619
So, those are some tips, but I want to answer
the question in one other way, okay?

00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:59.900
Formal assessment, in my belief, in my sort
of research background, it's impossible for

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.890
individuals to self assess their own emotional
intelligence.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.490
Why is that?

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:11.039
If you're not self aware, how can you possible
measure your emotional intelligence?

00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:17.280
So, we use group level evaluation when we're
trying to assess emotional intelligence.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.849
Really, it's other people's opinions, but
if you get enough, you've got a hint about

00:42:20.849 --> 00:42:21.849
where you're going.

00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:27.261
So if you have the opportunity to do the 360,
or to get data, that's using emotional intelligence

00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:30.150
competencies, you're more likely to be able
to see that profile.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:36.150
But short of that, using what we call a critical
event interview, having them tell you about

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.779
an event and literally coding yourself helps.

00:42:38.779 --> 00:42:42.289
Or you can ask them to write it down ahead
of time, before they come in.

00:42:42.289 --> 00:42:45.119
And literally, sort of qualitative research,
code it.

00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:47.130
That was a great question.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.130
Others?

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.130
[pause]

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.109
Guy in the back? Yes.

00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:54.829
[pause]

00:42:54.829 --> 00:43:10.359
Could you come out, so I can hear you?

00:43:10.359 --> 00:43:12.079
[inaudible]

00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:18.980
Annie: Good question, yep.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.710
[inaudible]

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.000
Great. That's a great question.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.450
Okay the question was about the emotional
intelligence, competencies, mindfulness, hope,

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.769
and compassion.

00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:31.850
That's really a tall order.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.770
You know, you can't just turn the key and
have those things part of your being.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:39.369
And that's absolutely true, absolutely true.

00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:40.809
There's two answers to this, okay.

00:43:40.809 --> 00:43:42.380
The first one is more macro.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.839
How do people learn?

00:43:43.839 --> 00:43:48.500
Okay, so the first step in the learning process
is to make sure that you actually care about

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.970
learning, and you want to.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.339
That's the first step.

00:43:51.339 --> 00:43:53.390
You've got to attach it to something bigger.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.710
I'll give you a quick example.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:57.410
There's this one executive I was working with
in Italy.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:01.730
Actually. I was coaching him, and he had a
problem with empathy.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.490
I mean, he was just tearing his team apart.

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:08.480
He was the Deputy CEO, slotted to be the CEO,
but he wasn't going to get there unless he

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480
fixed this problem.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.690
He'd been told, "You either stop destroying
teams or it's over."

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.210
And he was like, "Empathy? How can I learn
about that? I don't really care about it,

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.210
anyway."

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:19.210
[laughter]

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:22.670
Through the coaching process, he didn't, he
really didn't.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:27.780
Through the coaching process, not quite sure
how it happened because I did not ask him

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.780
about his family.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.710
That's sort of the line in coaching.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:36.359
It came to him that this lack of empathy,
was actually interfering with his relationship

00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:40.089
with his wife and most importantly his 14-year-old
daughter.

00:44:40.089 --> 00:44:43.520
This light bulb went off in this guy's head,
and he was like, "Okay, I'm getting a handle

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.210
on this thing. I'm going to do it."

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:49.200
And so we went through some processes, which
will bring me to the second part of the question

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.150
of helping him to see when he needed it, and
how to practice it, okay.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:56.869
So, number one you've got to figure why you
want to change this thing.

00:44:56.869 --> 00:44:59.910
Second you're absolutely right.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.859
It takes practice.

00:45:01.859 --> 00:45:03.750
It doesn't happen overnight.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.759
You need to become almost like a helicopter
over yourself, viewing your own behavior and

00:45:08.759 --> 00:45:11.369
emotions consciously.

00:45:11.369 --> 00:45:14.630
And checking when you're going off the path,
okay.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:19.789
You also need some understanding of how you
can create experiments for yourself and to

00:45:19.789 --> 00:45:23.220
improve slowly over time.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:29.450
And note those markers on some sort of mental
map, and usually that doesn't happen easily,

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.329
unless you've got some help.

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:35.980
You need somebody -- a friend, your partner,
whatever, you need somebody to be in it with

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.269
you giving support, because it's not that
easy.

00:45:38.269 --> 00:45:43.859
And then last but not least, especially when
it comes to mindfulness.

00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:44.950
It's a daily practice.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.980
Let me give you some very practical ideas,
okay.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:54.769
If you're trying to deepen your capacity for
mindfulness, you really think that's probably

00:45:54.769 --> 00:45:58.210
the first place to start, which for most people
I believe it is.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:59.640
You can do some really simple things.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:05.720
You don't need to meditate 4 hours a day or
take 16 weeks off and go to wherever in meditation

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.720
patient retreat.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.720
You really don't.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.789
You really don't need to do yoga every day.

00:46:08.789 --> 00:46:12.440
If you do these things, more power to you.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:18.279
What it takes is just a little bit of time,
every single day.

00:46:18.279 --> 00:46:23.259
Where you're not doing the stress routine,
you're are not making the to-do lists, you're

00:46:23.259 --> 00:46:24.880
not worrying about what's happening at home.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:29.099
You're not worrying about the project that's
running off the rails or whatever.

00:46:29.099 --> 00:46:30.099
You're quiet.

00:46:30.099 --> 00:46:33.970
I mean, literally 10 minutes in bed before
you get up.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:40.529
Emptying your mind, breathing deep, oxygen
affects all this, you all probably know that,

00:46:40.529 --> 00:46:41.529
makes a difference.

00:46:41.529 --> 00:46:47.990
Twenty minutes walking from one building to
another without anybody else, by yourself,

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.650
not fussing about what's happening next.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:55.690
It sounds so trivial, but those little things
make a difference.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:47:01.519
And as you become accustomed to this habit,
you can turn it on instantaneously.

00:47:01.519 --> 00:47:05.740
Before I get up and do a talk I will go over
for 5 minutes and sort of, whew, get rid of

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:13.069
whatever is there, and then I'm back to sort
of a nice, resilient place again.

00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:16.800
I don't want to over simplify this, but if
we try to make it complex, none of us are

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.000
going to do it.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.390
Get out on your bike, go for a run, go for
a walk, get away from people, focus on clear

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:29.440
and calm.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.490
Good question.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.490
Others?

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:32.990
Anybody else?

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.990
Yes.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.499
[inaudible]

00:47:36.499 --> 00:47:41.160
Annie: Good question.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.109
How do we interact with the people who aren't
at this talk?

00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:49.059
Who do not have emotional intelligence, or
at least don't use it?

00:47:49.059 --> 00:47:52.880
The first thing I would say is what was on
one of the slides, don't be a victim, and

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.999
just don't go there.

00:47:54.999 --> 00:47:57.849
Secondly, build some good fat walls around
you.

00:47:57.849 --> 00:48:00.940
So they don't hurt you.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.941
Don't let these people hurt you.

00:48:01.941 --> 00:48:05.630
They're trying to hurt you in some cases,
and in other cases they don't know, but in

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:10.450
either case don't let them hurt you because
they can really damage your self-esteem.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.920
Then the third is don't do it back.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:21.249
If you do it back, you're just facilitating
the growth of a beast inside your group.

00:48:21.249 --> 00:48:24.829
So don't be a victim, boundaries, and don't
do it back.

00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:26.070
And go do good where you can.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:31.609
Fourth, fourth, right the fourth and final
suggestion -- if it's like that chronically,

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:33.549
get out.

00:48:33.549 --> 00:48:35.049
Just get out.

00:48:35.049 --> 00:48:36.049
It's not good for you.

00:48:36.049 --> 00:48:37.320
Thanks.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.759
Okay, we're at our time.

00:48:39.759 --> 00:48:42.880
I would like to thank Alana and Ming once
more.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.019
If we could give them a hand.

00:48:44.019 --> 00:48:45.019
Thank you.

00:48:45.019 --> 00:48:47.180
[applause]

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.549
And I wish you all a good day.

00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:51.890
And I hope to see some of you later and again.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:52.119
Bye.
