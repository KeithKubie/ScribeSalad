Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on and spill? Burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       just checking in on you. I'm just checking in on just seeing how your week's going. You know a lot of people when they podcasts for one week, they don't fucking think about their listeners for the rest of the week, but you know what, not this guy, I think about you. I think I think about you. What was it that was fucking guns and roses, right? All that fucking falsetto singing back then. Oh Lee,

Speaker 4:          00:00:42       you woo hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, hoo.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       Everyone will go nuts and they would have their fucking lighters up in the air already. Right out of the gate. You can say, Gee, Bill, you have a lot more energy than you've had lately. What's going on with you while ty, what's going on? Today's the last day we're wrapping on the movie front run of storing a Hugh Jackman directed by Jason Reitman. Um, this is the last day. I'm very excited because I think it's going to be a great movie. And I also get to go home and see my yeah. Family is that my daughter over there? MMM. Very cool. I got a quick little run in New York and then I'm done and I'm just done for the rest of the year. Other than the Times I go to New Mexico and Arizona. Okay. I mean, I still am a traveling comedian. I still am a plate spinner, but uh, I'm pretty much home til like the end of January, which is awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       So I will be spending that time with my family and uh, going in, punching up and editing some of the first cuts of a season, three of f is for family. That's what I'm doing, you know, getting into the, uh, thanksgiving spirit. Thanksgiving often overlooked. Okay. You know, the second Halloween comes along, everybody goes, oh shit, it's the fucking Christmas season. But people forget that there's a holiday. You know, the holiday, you don't have to have any gifts. All you gotta do is show up. You show up the Wednesday before thanksgiving, you go down to the local bar and a lot of the checks that you were too afraid to talk to are going to be down there. A lot of the chicks that were afraid to be talked to or going to be down there, everybody's looking for some sentimental sex. Right. What are some, what if encounters,

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       sorry. I don't mean to go. All Harvey Weinstein here. All of that was consensual. All right. Jesus Christ. There's just one accusation after another finally beat. All these famous people are starting to go like, yeah, I have no idea who that is or, yeah, I dunno. I Dunno. I don't remember that. You know, which I was surprised right out of the gate. They didn't do, I'm not condoning their behavior. I'm just saying legal advice.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Yes. Later after the jazz has disappeared off for you throughout the plant that you fucking came on, you'd think that these people would go into denial like that fucking Supreme Court judge. God, I, I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't do that. I just went back to my study and I was reading on how to become a better person this slowly starting to do that. Um, but anyways, why, why bill? Why on such a, a glorious holiday month would you bring up such a scandal? Um, there should be like, you know what, you should start doing like a, like, you know, you have like a dead pool. They should do. You should do like a pool now where you just fucking, you try to bend on who's the next person.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       I can't even say anything because it's not funny to Fuckin accuse somebody that shit. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       I'm trying to think of anybody who I've, and I ain't going to fucking do that, but let's get it. Let's go with something positive. I went to the best music store. I've been to an [inaudible] since, I dunno when with the best commercial on Youtube, which I am going to post off of the Monday morning podcast, Twitter account, uh, Portman's music store in Savannah, Georgia is hands down the best music store I've been to. Um, what do you want? Uh, you want a French horn? They got it. You want a bassoon? They got it. You want to Didgeridoo? They got it. Are you an old man and you got to read some charts and your fucking eyes had gone. They actually sell readers up at the, up at the counter a little, you know those glasses when you don't want to just waste your money getting a prescription, do you just go out and you get the readers? You just try some her, I, these are all good things that go right. They sold those, uh, I went over there just to get some drum sticks and next thing you know, I'm actually thinking of buying a trumpet.

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       I always loved the trumpet. I always love the power of that fucking instrument, you know? And uh, I actually looked at one for the first time I had this guy explained to me the whole way that it worked and I was thinking about it. And then fortunately I called my laugh and she goes, you're not buying a fucking trumpet. Why do wives always do that? They always, you know, I'm not saying that she was wrong, but they always do. You like, you're not doing that. You're not buying a boat. You can do, you're not putting a speed bag up on the side of the house. One. Yeah, it doesn't rain that much to the tree over it, honey. We're not doing that right. They always do that to us, but one can, can we always ever sit there looking at me like, like hunting. You're not buying another pair of shoes. You're not buying any more throw pillows. You already can't sit on the fucking couch. There's too many. I'm not yelling now. I am.

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       Yes, but I, I wasn't. Oh, you know what? Fuck you. Yeah. Fuck you fine. I don't give a fuck. I never didn't want to go there anyways. Why do you hope to ruin the weekend,

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       right? That's the way it goes. Why can't we do that? What, you know, we should just, we've got to figure out what they do. Obviously we can't start crying, you know? No fucking send us to some God damn home. I'm going to do that next time. Uh, buying a trumpet. You're not buying a trumpet. Dopey

Speaker 5:          00:06:32       me. Tell me.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       She was right in another life, you know, come on man. The trumpet with the plunger on the end, getting that Jimi Hendrix. Why was sound, maybe that's why, that's probably where he got it from. Right? He probably wanted to have that sound in the guitar because he was probably listening to somebody playing a fucking horn. I don't know what, but uh, I always loved the trumpet and the trombone and the sac sex phone's kind of hacky to like, that's like Lichen Guitar. Everybody likes fucking guitar. Everybody likes somebody who comes to horns. Everybody likes to saxophone. Write the fucking, Trump owns the shit, right? The trumpet, the ability to do a big band. And those four trumpet players show up. They fucking, you know, they stand up and they start playing their little section. They almost knock you out of your seat.

Speaker 6:          00:07:24       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       I Dunno man. They will fucking cool. And they were expensive as shit. Like the cheapest one was like that they had, there was like six, seven, 800 bucks. You want to, parents are always fucking freaking out when their kid stops playing the trumpet. It's like, dude, you know, I could have bought a new ride Moa.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       Do you know what stopped me from playing the trumpet? Other than, uh, just poor, you know, musical gifts was, I didn't want to get that fucked up live. And then the guy behind the counter told me, he said, all that's just poor technique. That's just from Preston. I probably, your amateur or whatever the fuck they call it is wrong. So to make up for it, you got to press it against your lips and then you get like that, that you know, yeah, you look like somebody beat you with a trumpet rather than you play one. Right? And he's like, no, you just want to be relaxed. You want to be relaxed since everything is that in life, you know what I mean? Do you want to be relaxed? You want to hit a home run? Don't try and kill it. Just swing through the fucking zone.

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       But the bat, meet the ball there it goes right in a little league field for me. Professional guys, they could hit it out of Fenway plaque, right? Stop trying to kill it. Golf. You want to drive it a bunch of yards there, right? You want to show off? You're on the first tee heavy. All the fucking white dude standing behind you. One woman in somebody of color so nobody can say you're fucking membership is racist, right? You fly them in, everybody's standing there watching you. You're waiting to tee off, right? You feel in the sweat going down the Becky a ball bag. And what do you do? You grip it a little tighter. You fucking go back like John Daly is swing outside your zone and you fucking go through your little hat with the pompom falls off, you fall on your ass, you white slacks, get a grass date on them. And where does the ball go? Huh? Fucking record shades off the ladies tees and everybody snickers, everybody snickers and you're in a bad mood. You have a bad round and then you fucking come home. You throw your clubs down, right? And then you wife comes out and once you to emote and next thing you know you get your hands around her throat, right? Her eyes are rolling back. She's making dents on the file, what you need, you know how it is,

Speaker 6:          00:09:46       right?

Speaker 2:          00:09:47       You know how it ends. It ends with a trip to home depot. You buy in a pickax and some sort of live and all you had to do, all you had to do was just relax. Go up this smile and wave at all your so called friends that you know, a rooting against you. You know, stay within yourself, be nice and relaxed. Don't give a shit, let the face meet the fucking ball there it goes right down the goddamn fairway.

Speaker 6:          00:10:14       But no,

Speaker 2:          00:10:15       you tried to kill it and one and it ended up happening. An innocent woman died.

Speaker 6:          00:10:21       Right? And how are you going to get caught? Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       Cause of the back of her head. The imprints going to be on the hood of the car. They come over there to dust it, right? And then they'll still be able to tell it's the perfect shape of her skull with the little blue little ponytail, you know? And then you just sit there. That's when you break down on the, on the fucking stand, like all, I'm one of those classic, uh, iron side, the right writer with man. Remember those old stupid court dramas, the early days of movies and television shit. All the Ed to do is just ask the person, the defendant a bunch of quick questions.

Speaker 6:          00:11:04       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       it just be like, you went golfing that day, didn't you? Yeah. What about it? Everyone was watching it one day. They were watching and you squeezed the glove clutter. I know I didn't Jabba. And You keep saying, then you went home and he tells you, I write it. I did it. She never believed in my golf game. She right. They always did that. And then they always shook women and slapped them.

Speaker 6:          00:11:33       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       You know, but that was the backbone. Oh, Hollywood. And for some fucking reason, 67 years late, everybody's surprised that people are running around, grabbing people by their private, Eh, finishing on a plant. Um, anyways, I guess, was it the midterm elections? I don't. What happened? All I know is I was down on the set and somebody said, hey, it's a good good day for Democrats. And I was just like, uh, what do you mean? He goes yesterday, man, he said the Democrats, Democrats fucking killed it yesterday. And my first thought was, well, did they elect good Democrats? You know what I mean? I don't like how people look at politics the way they look at their sports team. You know what I mean? Where like if it's a bad call, as long as it goes into the favor of your team, you're like, ah, that was fine. You know, like Hillary supporters doing that stupid. Thank you Hillary, which was probably started by her people.

Speaker 6:          00:12:34       MMM, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:35       I don't understand what people on the left are doing. Still trying to push her over the top. At some point you just got to admit you wasted a draft pick and you got to move on to somebody else. I've never seen somebody just keep coming back like fucking Freddy Krueger since probably Richard Nixon. That has to be her spirit animal. My favorite, my fucking, I didn't just say favorite. That's the thing I hate the most when people say so and so is my spirit animal. We fucking 11. You got a pen pal too? Um, yeah, like if I was her, I would just, I would look, I would look at Richard Nixon

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       and be like, okay, this guy lost you. No one on the radio last on TV. He was sitting there, you know, sitting there like how you normally sit, right? He's got sweat on his upper lip. JFK comes in all tanned up. He's got his legs crossed, like he's doing panel on the fucking tonight's show. You know, all the women are watching going off. I had to think a political dick that would be the deck. Right? So everybody fucking votes, you know, thinks that he one on TV, Nixon loses the election and then he lost the governor's race in California and literally was out of politics in that eight years later. Oh, tricky Dick came back and won the fucking White House. I think that's what Hillary is trying to do.

Speaker 6:          00:14:07       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       But just watching everybody on the left, just ignoring, completely turning a fucking blind eye to the fact that Bernie Sanders got more votes and the debt, they admitted it in court. The Democratic National Party colluded with her campaign to make her the fucking representative. I mean, can you give me a fucking break? She's fucking sitting here bitching about the electoral college. I don't get it. I get, if you're, you're a woman and you want a woman to be president, but you know, can you pick a good one? Can we start with that?

Speaker 6:          00:14:45       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       I mean, how much more corrupt can, I don't know. I just don't get it. People and being a namerd with either the bushes and the Clintons, I, I've had enough with them. I want a new last name lying to me. Is that asking too much? Um, but so anyway, so I checked out some of those elections and I'm way in over my head here, but I just saw these weird headlines like, congratulations, such and such state, you elected the first transgendered person way to go Vermont or way to go do jersey. You elected the first Muslim, whatever, that this seat guy or whatever, I don't know how to say to whatever, there was nothing in there that you elected somebody who was qualified that's going to do a great fucking job. Who happens to be Polynesian or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       I don't understand it. Read the exact same. Well that's like, that's like how white supremacists vote. You know, they vote strictly by you know, race or whatever. Like that doesn't make any sense. Like can we just vote for people who are good, who actually have demonstrated that they can not be swayed by money and they're actually going to do what's going to be good for the environment that's going to be good for, for poor people, middle class people that's going to be good for this country. Don't just fucking vote for somebody because of their genitalia or, or you know, I mean, I don't get, I don't get it. This whole fucking idea that that sociopath's selfish people. Liars are only white male heterosexuals and that only they are susceptible to. Um, being weak when they get positions of power is, is, is not a good road to go down is the only thing I'm going to say.

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       You got to, I don't know how you, uh, figure out what the fuck somebody going to do, but like to just be excited that somebody got in there because of their sex or their race is a, is a very short sighted way to look at it. You've got to look at what the fuck they did is all I'm saying. And I did not see that in the headline. I just thought, oh good, this person's in there, you know? But I feel like that's how we try to fix shit. Like, oh my God, there was eight years of Democrats. Fuck this. Let's do, let's, let's vote all Republican. Oh, wait a minute. That doesn't work. Let's go all Democrat. That's what we just keep fucking doing. And now we're going to do that. I think on a, a, uh, a, uh, what do you call it? Gender and a race thing is what they're going to do and it's going to be fucking, I'm telling you, you're going to see the exact same scandals. I did not have sex with that woman.

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       You wait, I want to see how this plays out when they get in there, right? When the non, he's get in there and they got their own private fucking subway, you know everybody's eating fucking lobster, you know, and it's all just sitting there dangling. You know, you want to be present. Hey Buddy, you want to be president, right? And they got to get in bed with all of these evil fucking corporations. And then when they get in there, they got to do what those corporations want, right? They got to do what the fuck they want. And then if they do, then you end up like, like Obama, like Bush, like Clinton, like all of these fucking people after their president. Then you go on the fucking bribe money tour going out, air quote giving speeches, right? Why are you still giving speeches? You're not president anymore. You know what I mean? Is Dan Marino walking around with the football still throwing passes. He's retired. What the fuck are you all your collect? Yeah. Obama right now is on tour. $69 million tour giving speeches.

Speaker 2:          00:18:50       Let's say the guy, does it give a good speech but 69 million in one year. The Fuck Outta here. The fuck out of here? Who's he going to go talk to? Huh? What was he talking to, Joe six pack? I don't think so. Um, I know that was a very bleak way of looking at it, but there's something positive in there. I think we need as, as everybody represented, obviously in government, but you got to make sure that you're not just voting, you know, just to get a woman in there or somebody's got to make sure they're good. And that is, that is my problem with the Clintons. I just think that they're just fucking, they like, I don't even know what they are. They just sold his fucking people. There's gotta be somebody better than her. All right. But you know, Democrats, if you want to hang your hat around, somebody with Mike Dukakis is fucking charisma. Who's is comfortable in his own, her own skin is Al Gore to fucking loses. They can't say no to people lost the election. Um, have you ever heard me talk politics as much in your life? Would you think someone who doesn't watch Fox News or CNN or MSNBC or anything else who kind of just gets his news from overhearing one comment from somebody on a set? Well, doing eight lines in a movie.

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       Um, anyways, so let's get back into my wheelhouse. All right. What happened? This is the podcast. I fucking talk about what I want. I talked about buying a trumpet and I'm talking about a, you know, be funny if a woman gets in into office like, like, what is she gonna like, how is she going to give it to, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:33       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:33       She gotta get like a bunch of fucking [inaudible] like j crew, like boy toys running around the White House. Uh, who knows. I don't know what they're going to do. She'd probably go like that. That Ferdinand Marcos chick there who had like fucking 50,000 fucking shoes. That's what it is. Guys are into like, fuck it. We're animals, right? Ladies are into stuff. Maybe that's what it is. They'll blow the entire defense budget on like broaches or some shit. All right. This is some of the dumbest Shit I've ever said. Um, I hope it makes you feel better about yourself. All right. Oh, the last day of the shoot, 84 days sober. I did it. All right. I booked this thing. I was a fat booze bag. I stopped fucking drinking. I did it. So can you and I'm so I'm a little nervous here because now the shoot ends tonight and uh, so now what do I do? It's this weird thing where I don't want to, I don't want to end my streak. I forget. I get at least a hundred days, then I've gone through Thanksgiving without drinking. But is that a bad thing?

Speaker 6:          00:21:39       You know what I mean? Rather than, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       drinking and kind of forgetting half the meal and then waking up at four in the morning with the TV still on, you know, sweat my ass off in some Thanksgiving sweater being like, what the fuck? Where is everybody? Did I say goodnight? You know, next day you go downstairs, you talked to your wife, feel like a good morning. She just looks at you and keeps brushing your teeth. You're like, oh fuck.

Speaker 6:          00:22:12       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:22:12       Did you have fun yesterday? She stops brushing your teeth, slams a hand down on the counter, spits out the fucking turns the sink on it, turns it off, and then turn. So you're like, oh fuck. What did I do? What did I say? I don't want to do that. I'll do that the day after, right when I watch all those rivalry games, hoe did the Alabama Crimson tide against the Auburn Tigers? Um, I'm missing everything. I don't know what's going on in the world. Uh, I had a lot of people send me a

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:22:52       you know, tweets and t, uh, texts and all that shit. Unfortunately about the fatal crash.

Speaker 6:          00:23:00       Oh, Bob,

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       sorry, I just clicked this fucking thing off of, uh, Roy Halladay and uh, yeah, that's fucking brutal. That's brutal. Did see that guy in Boston sports radio just fucking went off on him.

Speaker 6:          00:23:16       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:23:18       You know, what's hilarious about that whole clip is he makes his point in the first like eight seconds. He says what he feels about it and then continues to say it.

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       I almost thought it was like on a loop. He just kept going, oh, look at me. I got to play the idea. I'm waving at the fucking window. He said that like nine times. Um, I was kind of done with the guy when he called Halladay, uh, Jack Wagon who says, I understand you can't curse on the radio. Um, I dunno, but the weird thing is that there's, they're blaming the, they're starting to blame the plane and uh, I don't think that's right. I mean, if it's pilot error both times, I don't think that that, you know, what's scary is the other one. Right. And have you thought about this the first time that type of plane crashed? I guess the test pilot, he was flying into this canyon flying low and he, they're guessing that he thought he was in this different part of the canyon that was going to, it opened up to a lake.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       But this one didn't like it started to get narrow and then he went into basically a mountain called DSEC and if, and basically the angle that he would've had to fly out if he pulled back on the stick, he was going to fucking stall. So he had to try to do bang a UAE basically, I would think. Um, yeah, that's why I like a helicopter cause you just go, just stop those fucking things. You have to keep like a shark. They've got to keep moving forward other than that's fucking it. Um, but I gotta tell you, man, that plane looks cool as hell. It really does. It really looks cool. And um, I dunno, but all of this shit where people speculate and all that, just shut the fuck up. All right. The FAA will investigate and like whatever. And in a certain amount of time, six months, a year, whatever, they'll come out with their official report.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       All these fucking people who don't fly, listen to them talk about, it was kind of a, I dunno, it was kind of funny like this and Oh, this is the third time, mom, blah blah. You know, there's a lot of times if something's easy, people will do dumb shit with it. Like the helicopter that I want to buy, you know, it's, it's basically like the Robinson, but they corrected all the safety issues on it. First of all, having a fully articulated main rotor system where you could actually push the stick forward and not enter into some sort of low GI or mass bumping situation. So there was a guy that got it and he was trying to demonstrate how you could fly like an asshole, which is what you should never do. And he slammed the stick forward and he went into a nose down attitude.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       But it was, it's a carborated engine and the way the fuel is, is fed in. When he tipped it forward, he basically starved the carburetor of fuel and he stalled it, demonstrating that he wouldn't get into one situation. He created another situation and that he then crashed it. So, you know, people will always, I, you know, the very little that I know about aviation, whenever a new design comes out, you know, people are always like, well, let's see. Let's let people fly in it and let them die and then they can fix it and let you warn you about all of this stuff. But a lot of times it's just people, it's just weird thing where they make it safer and make it easier and then someone will then do something.

Speaker 6:          00:26:58       I don't know,

Speaker 2:          00:27:00       I'll do something like that, just slam a stick forward or something. So I have no idea what that guy was doing, but it's brutal, man. So obviously condolences out to him and his wife and kids. Man, it's fucking brutal. Um, all right, when with that sad frigging story, um, that guy in Boston radio though, it was also like, I feel like it's much as he felt what he was saying, he was also trying to be edgy.

Speaker 6:          00:27:21       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:27:23       You know, and it's one of these things, if anything that he was saying was actually true, it's like to kid don't need to say that. Why are you adding to the pain of his family if you really give a fuck about his wife and kids? All right. If somebody did something dumb, everybody knows that they did something dumb and then they died. Then Shit, just shut up about it. Let you should really upsets me. It upsets you. Upset you don't even know the fucking guy. It was such like a car dash she into, I just felt like for me that was really upsetting. Um, anyways. Mian ds everybody, uh, beyond days, beyond days, don't slam the fucking stick forward. [inaudible] if you're in a Cabrini fucking whatever I want to buy. Um, why would I go into that? Why? Why the fuck would I die? What can I say? Ah. [inaudible] swing the club. Nice. No single golf club. Relaxed Doo Doo Doo Doo. Brds

Speaker 7:          00:28:22       the, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:28:24       you got nothing that runs through the legs cause I'm thinking that. Fuck it. All right. I'm sorry. You know what? I feel like Casey case am I just went from a tragic, tragic fucking story to singing about underwear right now. You can't make that transition. Me, Andy's everybody. Me undies makes you, but [inaudible] will be proud to wear and check this out. I'm not the only one who loves me undies. Listen to what longtime listener and me undies enthusiasts, George has to say. [inaudible] I note from George and, uh, Bill burr listener and be on ds Fan. I decided to try at Mandy's BC because I love bell bar bear. I sat it. Okay. Is that what you want? All right. I did it. I tried it on this off bloody underwear. My Dick liked it. Okay. Um, I smile every time he sings the song. Although it's so easy to skip the eds and the podcasts, I always listened to bill [inaudible] Baba Baba Baba, you guys know this.

Speaker 2:          00:29:23       He loves these fucking things. They're nice and comfortable and he loves me on these cradling the family jewels to get 20% off the best and softest underwear and socks you'll ever own. Free Shipping and a hundred percent satisfaction guarantee. Go to [inaudible] dot com slash [inaudible] that's [inaudible] dot com slash bar. Well, that was too short. I should probably read what the guy said. All right. I always listened to bill's read and I'm so glad Mandy's has stuck with them. It's been probably two years since I bought my first pair of meundies and now I have a monthly subscription because they are that comfortable before me undies. I used to buy the three pack of underwear in retail stores until I realized that I wanted to treat my junk to something more comfortable. And that starts with a great pair of undies, cradling the family jewels that is just so slick.

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       The way that is read, it reeks of that. It was rewritten by the advertisers. I'm sure there's a George n out there, but I don't think he wrote it as eloquently as that. If he did go to Madison Avenue Kid, you've got a career, you've got a few chat. All right.

Um, I've been so frigging busy traveling around doing shows and finishing up this acting gig that I have not watched. One second of my beloved Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics. I haven't watched anything. And a friend of mine on F is for family. A Cleveland Cavaliers Fan was raving about how well Kyrie Irving was doing with the Celtics. So I watched a little bit of highlights last night of the Celtics defeating the Lakers. I saw that Lonzo Ball, is that his name or is that his dad's name? I saw that he actually played well and believe in, not even as a Celtics fan. I'm happy for that Dude because his fucking dad is like such a crazy person that it makes people hate this kid. The kids never said Shit, you can't pick your parents and that the dude's dad did a lot of good things. He is playing in the NBA,

Speaker 6:          00:32:15       but um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       I don't know what he's doing.

Speaker 6:          00:32:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       He's fucking wrestling. I don't know what is the one?

Speaker 6:          00:32:27       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       I don't know what the fuck he's doing, but that's going to be one of those things. To some point that kid is going to have to make a very uncomfortable break with his overbearing father, but the Celtics won and I'm watching the highlights and I don't know anybody on the team anymore. We still got Marcus mot. It seems like we got rid of everybody else. Crowder, Avery, Bradley, Isaiah Thomas. I knew they were all gone. But you know, Kelly, a Lennox gone. Everybody's fucking God. There's like two people left from last year's team. That kid green was looking great. What the hell did he go? I was all, I, I missed all of these fucking trades. So, um, I dunno, I'm right back to only being able to name a couple of Celtic. So, uh, I'm excited that, uh, this, I'm going to get back into them. I'm going to get through my, uh, my little New York run here. Thank you by the way, to everybody that's coming out to my show Sunday night.

Speaker 6:          00:33:28       Yeah. And, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       in New York City. Thank you for getting bit in the tickets. You can watch me trouts and material. Fuck around, do some shit that works and do some shit that doesn't quite work.

Speaker 6:          00:33:38       And, um, but when I come back, when I come back, I am a,

Speaker 2:          00:33:43       that's it. I'm watching the NBA and NHL package and I can't, I'm so fucking psyched of going out on by my nieces and nephews, a bunch of gifts. Uh, I'm going to come back east for Christmas. Everybody in my family who hasn't met my beautiful, gorgeous, lovely daughter. Uh, my wife sent me video yesterday of the first time she was on a swing, which are, you know, thank God for video. I would have missed it.

Speaker 6:          00:34:07       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       Oh it was just awesome. She was so happy. And then the way she was sitting there, she had like an elbow, like she was hanging out the driver's side window. She was so totally chill. She has like a, like a, like a relaxed confidence about her and she's a sweetheart, you know? So all I gotta do is not be an angry maniac. You know, who can do, I'm going to be an angry maniac, but I'm going to be less of one. And when she calls me out on it, when she inevitably learns how to talk, I'm just going to admit to, it'd be like, you know what, you're right. Daddy needs to work on that because I don't want to, I don't want to ruin what she looks like. She's gonna be mad cause she, I just kids going to be special. You know, like all dads, I am a little biased, but I'm telling you, um, anyways, which is another reason to not be boozing around the frigging house. Right.

Speaker 6:          00:34:59       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:35:00       I think that's what I'm going to do. I think in, in, in the next year, I'll keep my drinking on the road. That's what I'll do. I live this double life, stone sober at home, pushing her on a swing, wearing sweaters, smiling and waving. And then on the road I'll just be in the gutter after my shows. That's too sad. I would never do that. Um, anyways. And I heard that kid for the Bruins, that kid on bu who stepped up last year was looking, looking very promising. I heard he's playing really well. I heard the Bruins of fast. I know we don't have the greatest record at this point, but you know, a long season, I cannot fucking wait to get back to my family and just a, you know, I don't know. I'm not gonna do shit for like two weeks, right through thanksgiving, right till the end of this month. And then I'll, you know, whatever, you'll start getting busy again. But who gives a fuck? I'm gonna Really gonna try to enjoy the holidays this year. I'm getting into it. All right, I'm going to buy a fucking tree. I'm going to do the whole thing. Although where I usually buy my tree, you know, got all of you and got all fucked up down there now. So they prepare, they can't sell the trees there. Who knows what, they'll probably knock it down the building to put up another building. That's the big move out here, right? Build these, uh,

Speaker 6:          00:36:21       I don't know what you call him.

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       These high rises, luxury rentals. Do yourself a favor. Don't rent a luxury apartment when you can just instead go out and buy a starter house. Throw all that money down the fucking toilet. Okay. Please don't do that unless you want it. If you want to do it, by all means, go ahead and do it. So, um, I was reading, I always read drum magazine, I Read Modern Drummer magazine and um,

Speaker 6:          00:36:50       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:36:51       I saw this whole article on um, these drummers favorite like prog rock bands from the 70s. And uh, you know, early genesis. You know, when Peter Gabriel is still in it and Phil Collins was on drums, King Crimson, all of these bands. So I actually started listening to King Crimson, that band, that album red and it's pretty fucking out there. This shit is pretty fucking out there. Some of it doesn't hold up, some of it does. But when they get into the real trippy keyboard shit using all the effects and everything, um, that definitely gets a little bit nuts. But, uh, I dunno, I was always curious of like Bill Bruford strumming. Like he was always on, you know, the cover of those magazines. I know he played in yes. And all that time he's this amazing drummer. So I was kind of psyched to finally be able to hear him play. But, uh, I dunno. I think I'm going to listen to some of that shit. If anybody has any good suggestions.

Speaker 6:          00:37:52       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:37:54       I don't know. I can't help but feel like it's very hipstery a lot of that I don't get into progressive. I don't mind fusion. Fusion is cool, but progressive gets a little, uh, you know, reminds me of Kevin Murphy wants what Kevin Murphy listens to. One F is for family, so I'll just treat it as like research or whatever. All right, I'm babbling here. Once again, thanks to everyone's going to come out to my show Sunday night and thanks to everybody on front runner, they gave me a part here in this movie. I had such a great time on the shoe and a bunch of people, just awesome people and

Speaker 6:          00:38:31       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       I'm really excited to get back to my family and just enjoy the holidays and everything. This is a great time of fucking year. You know, it would've been nice if I could have said that without cursing, but I'm not the brightest guy. All right, go fuck yourselves. Go Celtics, go patriots. Go Bruins. I Dunno if we have a soccer team. I don't know what it is, but I'm just, that's it, man. I'm going home. I'm putting on my fucking pajamas and I ain't doing shit for the rest of the fucking year. Except Christmas shopping, cooking, thanksgiving dinner, flying back east, meeting a bunch of relatives, giving out gifts to the out of fucking crisis. It's always busy, isn't it? Who gives a shit? All right. Go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend. Enjoy the music here. And uh, also, um, we got another 30 minutes. If you knew my podcast, we always played like a greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon podcast. Uh, you know, from a few years ago. Maybe this year. I don't fucking know. All right. See, you can be the best

Speaker 3:          00:40:23       [inaudible] [inaudible] it's

Speaker 8:          00:40:24       going on. It is a bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, November 9th, 2009. And yes, I am a little late with this one. It is a well into Monday evening here in Los Angeles. And uh, I had, I just had a whirlwind of a week. I really did. I really did. It should been my, my basically my Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, my last whatever that is, five days should have been filmed. Okay with like that MTV style where just as you start to focus on what the images they fucking quickly cut to what you were just looking at from the side in a black and white, black and white, you know, you know your mother used to film up punked and Ashton Kutcher would be standing there like, okay, check it out. I'm fucking zippy. Sea Crest is going to get a glazed doughnut, right? And then Bam. Then they go from the side and he'd be fucking sitting there with his hat sideways.

Speaker 8:          00:41:27       Remember that I had like a fucking, I had, I had an eight, like I heard like a totally TRL experience. I had an unbelievable fucking week, you know? Why do I feel like what? I actually feel guilty about it like telling you guys that I had an unbelievable week. Like I have to fucking apologize to you guys during a free podcast. Fuck you. You know I gotta tone it down. Why? Because your week sucked. Why can't you be happy for me? Why did I turn the fucking fan on? It's God damn hottest fucking hell. In order to this about my apartment? No. Bill, what is it? Hang on a second. Let me turn this fucking thing on. Come on, turn on. Um, the problem is is I live in a desert and uh, this time of year, the sun is like three, four hours where it just beats down right on the corner of my apartment.

Speaker 8:          00:42:16       And uh, it's just sitting there naked. There's no avocado tree or a whatever, cactus or any shit to block out the sun. So it just heats up like an oven. And then I always try to close the windows. You know, I've, I've explained this before because I say Cantala in the podcast and uh, I want my neighbors to think I'm a swell guy. No, I don't. I don't give a shit what they think. I just don't, you know, if somebody steals something, I don't want them to think it was me. That's basically an all right. So this was my week. Listen to this all you fuckers in your cubicles, Huh? Is it Tuesday morning? Did you already throw your hands up and give up on me? Like, I wasn't going to fucking do it this week, or at least today. Shame on you. You could have been listening to this yesterday.

Speaker 8:          00:42:59       At the end of your job, you know when you're supposed to be getting all your spreadsheets in order, Huh? Right around the time that egg salad sandwiches starting to bug you and you're thinking, can I, can I shoot it right into the fucking staples office chair that I'm sitting on that sorta has some sort of foam underneath it? Um, isn't that the worst? When you have a sit down job and you have a chair you can't fart into, that's really bad. You know, you've got, you've gotta wear like two pairs of boxers every time you have Mexican. Right. Jesus, Bill, shit jokes, three minutes. Right. Right into the podcast. Huh? This is how it's going to be. Sorry, I was just adjusting myself here. Not that kind of way. Just to Justin everything cause I, it's a long fucking story. What I have to go through to turn the fan on and keep the podcast going.

Speaker 8:          00:43:46       I have to stretch the technology out. All the why is, um, all right, this was my week. Alright, Wednesday, Wednesday I fly to a JFK in New York City and um, cause I'm getting ready for my big town hall show, my First Theater Gig in New York City, right? So I'm on my way there and I land right around five 30 just in time for the fucking traffic. And low and behold, the Yankees are playing game six of the fucking world series. All right. And if they win that night, they're gonna wrap the shit up. I'm staying in a hotel in Times Square. I bring my girl along, right? It's a big fucking weak for me, you know, and I'm sitting there riding and going, please let the Phillies win. Please let the fucking Phillies win, you know, and then when games seven so I can walk, watch all those fucking sad sack Yankee fans with those satin Yankee jackets that they wear.

Speaker 8:          00:44:45       You know, like they're in some biker gang on fucking happy days. I don't, they're like one of the only teams left. It's still has those satin jackets. Um, anyways, but it was not to be right. Then. Um, I started to watch games, sex and Pedro's on the mound and he starts off with like an 84 mile an hour fastball and I just really had a bad feeling that I was going to watch the end of his career that night and he was going to let up like 17 runs and I, I couldn't watch it, so I shut it off. So, uh, I have to do opie and Anthony in the morning. So I take my vitamins, I go to sleep or whatever, uh, try not to get sick on the road. And right around right around writers, I'm starting to nod off. I hear the first screaming that I would hear for the next three hours. I just hear like way off, you know, basically where I'm sitting in Times Square is about a half a block away. So all I hear right is about rate and not off and get a nice eight hours sleep right before I go to do the morning radio. All of a sudden I just hear like [inaudible] well, good stories. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:45:57       Woo.

Speaker 8:          00:45:57       Right. Couldn't really make it out. It wasn't that clear. And then I started hearing from her, I'm sorry, these horns blowing. And it was like the whole fucking stadium. I guess they want it. I figured it out at that point. That's like the whole fucking stadium decided, what do we do now? Let's go to time square and keep bill up for the next fucking three hours. And that's what they did. And it was so loud. It's so ridiculous. I was actually sitting there with my head in between two pillows, like I was having a fucking like, like a head sandwich. Right? It was so fucking loud and so ridiculous. I was actually laying there laughing. Um, and one of the fucking odds, right? One of the, one of the, one of the biggest red sox fans, one of the guys who hates the Yankees the most, okay, I live 3000 miles away.

Speaker 8:          00:46:46       What are the fucking odds? This one random day I'm going to fly in and they're going to win the world series and that is going to decide to celebrate half a fucking block away. So, uh, that was my first night. Um, and the next night I did a Gig for a, actually I didn't height this gig because I was trying to sell tickets for my town hall Gig. And, um, I actually on Thursday I opened for this up and coming comedian then I'm sure all you guys [inaudible] you're going to know about soon a guy by the name of Dane Cook. I don't know if you've ever heard of him. Just uh, you know, up and coming guy, you know, just, just trying to plug away, I opened up for them at Madison Square Garden, I a 10 minutes and it was, wasn't like the, the, the theater at Madison Square Garden. It was where the next play.

Speaker 8:          00:47:37       And uh, I'm trying to think the last time I worked with him on the road, I think maybe we did a college gig together about 15 years ago, way back when we were starting out in Boston. So it was, uh, I gotta tell Ya, that's, it's been a long time since I did a gig that wasn't like, if I do Letterman, I get butterflies. But it's been a long time since I've done a standup gig where I got that wasn't going to be on TV and I actually got butterflies. I, uh, I was standing back there waiting to go on and I was like legitimately, uh, not like nervous to the point that there was going to fuck with my set, but I was like, I don't know what it was. I stumped because I kind of got to this like Madison, it's canyon, right?

Speaker 8:          00:48:21       And uh, fortunately I had the presence of mind to be like, you know what? When are you ever gonna get to do this again, bill? I'm going to go with never, I'm going to bet I'm going to pet the long shot on this one and guests that you're never going to get to do this again. So, uh, or most likely, you know, never say never. So why don't you go up there and fucking enjoy it. And right before Dan does is shows in the round. So it's like 20,000 fucking people. And I'm sitting there looking at the stage and I'm trying to figure out who am I going to look at. So fortunately before I went out there, I go, Dan, exactly how does this theater in the round work it? He goes, it's no big deal. He goes, it's just like, it's like four theaters.

Speaker 8:          00:49:02       There's one in front of you, one of the right one or the left and one behind. You just break it up like that. Then all of a sudden it didn't, it, it just made sense. And I went out there, he actually had a great car. I mean, I was freaking out. I knew I was gonna be doing the Gig for about six days and I was just going on, my God, is this going to be a bunch of Facebook hotties? And I'm going to go up there saying con to every other word and that it just can be looking at me like Wednesday and coming on. This guy is angry, but they weren't. They were fucking awesome. And they totally listened. And, uh, I was probably, uh, one of the best 10 minutes sets I think I've ever had as far as, uh, many times you get to do a 10 minutes set and you get to look up at a Stanley Cup champion banner.

Speaker 8:          00:49:42       You know, by the way, why is Madison Square Garden? Um, I'm not trying to be a dick here. Why is it considered a basketball Mecca? They always say that like when Michael Jordan would go there, it's, you know, it's a basketball Mecca. Lebron James. It's, it's a basketball and they, we say that to basketball Mecca. All right. Now fans of the New York Knicks. All right. And you're a true fan right now if you're still watching those bumps. Okay. Going through a real rough patch. Um, I wanna I want you to justify, send me an email and tell me, explain to me how Madison Square Garden is considered a basketball Mecca. How, okay. The Knicks haven't a championship since 1972. I think they won the other one in like 69 or 70. They've won two championships. The fucking spurs have won like what? Four, five. How is Madison Square Garden a basketball Mecca if that's a mecca.

Speaker 8:          00:50:44       What was the old Boston Garden? We want 16 there or say like the La Forum, the La Forum, they won a five, six, seven. I don't know what they want their, they want a good, they weren't like nine. I think they won nine out there. Okay. If, if if Madison Square Garden, I'm not gonna, I'm not being a dick here. New York City is a basketball Mecca that uh, Rutger park or whatever the fuck it is with a goat. Right. He used to fucking, uh, lift up a refrigerator and put it on top of the back board is not how the, the urban myth goes or whatever the fuck it was. Lew Alcindor. Right. All those guys came from there. I understand that. I understand all those players, but there's only been fun. There's two championship banners hanging in Madison Square Garden. Okay. So I'm going to kind of be a jerk here and say that it's not a basketball Mecca.

Speaker 8:          00:51:41       I don't think you've earned the right, what? College basketball maybe, you know, I dunno. I think he'll let you, I think you guys really need to win a lot more. The fucking Chicago Bulls. When six in the 90s it's the first three at old Chicago Stadium and then the other three. What at the United Center? Is that how it went? I don't, I don't fucking know. All I'm saying is, uh, you guys need to bring that down a little bit. You know, that's like you ever see like when you see a restaurant they, they will, they'll say a welcome to two world famous blah blah, blahs and you sitting there really, really, they, they know about this in Portugal. They don't, you just say in that, and I think that fucking, you know what Madison Square Garden is just like Ray's famous pizza in New York City. Every fucking one claims to be, there's a couple of, there's a couple of comedy clubs.

Speaker 8:          00:52:34       The Ward, the world famous fucking Yuk, Yuk, slap a knee, whatever the fuck they call them. It's like, it's not world famous. It's not alright. It isn't okay. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. I beat that to death. I really got off the rails here. Let me get back to my fucking story here. All right. Um, so the first night I go Yankees won the world series and their fans keep me up, um, for like three hours. All right. And uh, oh, I actually congratulated the Yankees on, uh, on the radio the next day, which is probably very surprising to a lot of people if you'd like to hear it. Go to the wire, just Google bill burr opie and Anthony show a Yankee rant. For some reason they called it a rant, but I was actually congratulating them and I meant everything that I said and it might've sounded like I was being a little sarcastic, but I wasn't.

Speaker 8:          00:53:23       Anyways, let me plow ahead. So the next night I opened for Dane at Madison Square Garden, right. I'm fucking is pictures of like Frank Sinatra and Elvis, I'm talking to the security guard has been there for 40 years. He's pointing out where Mike Milbury went into the stands and beat that guy with his own fucking shoe. Right. The guys ever seen that. And of course not. You're not hockey fans actually look, look up Boston Bruins fight fans. Just looked that up. It was a Bruins rangers game and I think it was Terry O'Reilly. Somebody grabbed the stick and they hit him with it thinking, you know, typical fan like that. Like that's not a real guy. He's on skates. I have fucking chuck Taylor's on. He can't catch me. I don't know how he did it, but Terry Riley climbed up the fucking glass and grab this guy and then the rest of the Bruins followed him in the stands.

Speaker 8:          00:54:11       And um, this is how far we've come as a society. Back then. That was probably a story for about five days. There were lawsuits or whatever, but you never heard about, there was no fucking ESPN who's at came and it went there wasn't suspended for life, you know? No. Latrell Sprewell kind of shit. Nothing. They went up there, they beat fans with their own clothing and then they went back on the ice and they finish the fucking game as far as I know. Um, anyway, so then Friday night I, uh, I did my first theater Gig and I want to thank everybody who came out there was a huge milestone in my career to be able to perform in a theater in New York City and, uh, sell the thing out. Um, everything went awesome. I got a standing ovation and, um, had, uh, three killer comics on in front of me, Joe De Rosa, Paul Versey, and then there was this curl if this contest winner.

Speaker 8:          00:55:04       And of course her name escapes me at this point because I talk on my cell phone too much and I can't remember any fucking thing anymore. Oh, and speaking of that Shit, uh, no, no, stay on track. They'll stay on track because I was making a couple of corrections from last week. But, uh, so Saturday night comes Saturday night I was up in Boston, I did the, uh, comics come home with a Camelia, Denis leary and all that type of shit. And that was in front of 6,000 people. So basically over three days I went on in front of a almost 25,000 people. And, uh, now I'm sitting in my bedroom talking to myself and do an orange fucking microphone. So you know, I'm coming down a little bit, getting back to reality, you know, how's that for a fucking weekend? I can't believe it. Unbelievable. I can't believe it.

Speaker 8:          00:55:57       And then he says unbelievable. Just in case she didn't realize that it was unbelievable right. Now, you know what's funny about me? I'm actually self conscious right now that a, I talked about so much good shit that happened to me. That's, that's what it's like to be a fucking German Irish Catholic from Boston. That's what it is. Oh my God. A bunch of good stuff happened. I should feel guilty, you know? And I almost said fuck you to you guys. Like you're actually, you give a shit. Either way. I really got issues. All right, let's uh, let's make a couple of corrections. All right. Last week, that racist movie, I was trying to remember the name of it's birth of a nation and I want to thank the 87 people who brought that to my attention. And I also mentioned I was going to read a book about how to speak better on stage using, uh, using my voice correctly.

Speaker 8:          00:56:42       And people want to know the name of the book that I was reading. I actually lied to you. I'm not reading it. I keep starting the book, but it's really involved. It's a selector. Dory or fram. There's emotional when you're deliberate body. And I'm just like, oh my God, I hate school. And then I close it and then I'll read like slashes autobiography or like, what's the guy from the red hot chili peppers? Anthony Kietus. I'm sort of skipping around his biography. Um, but the name of the book is called freeing the natural voice by Kristin link ladder. All right. L I. N. K. L. A. T. E. R. M. I just been doing a lot of shows and uh, I have a tendency to yell from my throat rather than down here by the fucking diaphragm. You like that here? That, that's fucking Ray's famous pizza. That's an awful burger from a diner. And that's uh, some bar pizza that I got up in Boston trying so hard to get in shape.

Speaker 8:          00:57:41       I just don't think it's going to happen. Fuck that pat. The whole fucking goddamn summer to get in shape and I didn't do it. I've been a fucking idiot. Like usual. I'm waiting till the last week, like one of these chicks on the shows right now. I just don't eat. Then I show up in a strapless dress with my fucking I fucking, I was gonna say clavicle showing is that said though. Was that a word? Collarbone. There you go. What does the clavicle, is that that thing on your back? That looks like a sale. What does that your shoulder blade is that call the clavicle?

Speaker 8:          00:58:13       I don't fucking remember when it radius Ulna. Tarsal metatarsal Phalanges. Um, [inaudible] anyways, let's, uh, let's plow ahead here with the podcast. So I'm actually now I'm like hardcore. There's no turning back. I have to drop like 10 pounds before my special. All my big fucking TV kitchen, kitchen, TV sized head is going to look fucking ridiculous on TV. So I really got it. I got to get the booze weight off and I actually just went for a bike ride. Um, I was hiking up one of these parks out here out here at Griffith Park. You know the observatory. You guys ever see a, that James Dean movie. Then he filmed something up there or Charlie's angels. And when those four skinny whores are up there with their botox in their fucking twats hanging out, remember that last scene that, that, that's the observatory. So the other day I was hiking up to it on foot and I see this fucking like 55 year old guy, white hair pedaling up the hill.

Speaker 8:          00:59:10       Like he's in a fucking Viagra commercial and I'm going to look at that son of a bitch. You know, when he had all the, all that he had all, he had the whole getup on, you know, the whole Lance Armstrong outfit. Like he's gonna, you know, ride through Paris and throw his hands up right under the OCTA triumph. Right. Rather than, he's just riding up a hill in the middle of a desert, sucking in bus fucking fumes. But I was impressed and I was like, you know what, if that old best it can do it, you know, and I got to admit 55 and La is like 32. The way these people work out out here. All right. And, uh, I'm sorry to the people in the middle of the middle of this country and, uh, down south. All right. Unless you love, and people do that when they, when they insult you and then they say they're sorry, but you know, they're not, you know, I get that a lot at the end of my shows.

Speaker 8:          00:59:56       I didn't think you have funny, you know, I mean, I'm sorry I didn't and I'm always like, okay, yeah, yeah. Cause you know, it's like, I know other people did, but you know, it's like, you know, I'm sorry, I just, I just didn't, why do you keep a Paul? You're not sorry. You're not sorry. Okay, I got it. You don't like me and I don't give a shit because you already paid for a ticket. You paid to watch me annoy you. And I find that I find that humorous. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead. So I figure I gave myself 10 days to be able to fucking make it all the way up to this Goddamn Hill. And I just did it today in the middle, all the way up to the top. I'm not gonna lie to Ya. I feel like I'm going to fucking die.

Speaker 8:          01:00:40       But I, uh, I actually made it up there. So now I don't know what to do. I thought that that was going to be my project. I would just do that every day. And every day I get a little bit farther. And while I would focus on the carrot in front of me, I would just drop this booze weight. Right? But what happens the first fucking day? I go all the way up the goddamn thing. It's now what do I do? You know what I gotta do? I gotta join a gym and I got a Tro to weights around. That's what I gotta do you know what? In the mail today, I got a free 30 days at Gold's gym. Anybody work at a gym? How is this free? 30 days going to work out for me. Sign up for three 34 FRI third I can't even fucking talk. The Hell is wrong with me. I know what's wrong with me. I've fucking flown like 200 hours on a plane the last goddamn two months.

Speaker 8:          01:01:33       You should have seen this fucking douche bag putting his coat in the overhead compartment on my flight out here. I couldn't tell if this guy had the biggest Yamaka on I'd ever seen in my life or he had just shrunk his jazz hat. You know, you know those little jazz hats that those black guys were. And then white guys where when when they get into jazz to try to act like they get it to, you know those ones though, the African colors, you know, and you just sit there and talking about a Charlie Parker, you know, in your version of salt peanuts or whatever the fuck it is. And I don't know what it was. Any Jewish people listen to

Speaker 10:         01:02:20       this shit? Huh? Let me ask you a question. Is it technically still a Yamaka when it almost goes to the front of the guy's guys hairline and all the way to the two ways. Let me this thing, it looked like a, like a, what is that thing the Mexicans do they use the, uh, the Tortilla, right? How fucking ignorant am I have every goddamn culture out there. I thought a Yamaka was beanie. Is that incorrect? I call him a beanie for a long time and I always used to get looks. I was like, yeah, the guy had the fucking, I had the fucking beanie thing, the a, and then I get looks and it's like, oh, this kid's, I cursed. That's I say, fuck when I'm trying to gather my thoughts. Sometimes the fucking, uh, beanie rather than saying the, um, Oh gee, what is that thing called the beanie?

Speaker 10:         01:03:05       I put the fucking in front of it and then it adds an extra edge to it inadvertently. Then people like, oh my God, he doesn't like Jewish people with hats. Um, is it a beanie or is a beanie that thing with the little propeller on top of it? And another question. Did anybody ever have those? Does anybody old enough to actually answer that fucking question? Is that one of those Hollywood things, cartoon things that they just acted like people used to have those back in the day, I know kids used to wear those little raccoon hats. You know back when it was game all over the place. You know mothers made pies and stuck them on window sills. Stanley, have you going to shoot it? You better cook at, we're going to have to eat it. Right? Did white people ever say that or did we just waste if we always just wasted shit? We've always had the MTV

Speaker 8:          01:03:53       cribs approach to fucking nature having way white people didn't. Buffalo bill used to just ride around shooting buffalo in the head, laughing his ass off to that Fu Manchu that connected to his sideburns. You know what? How much more did you increase your odds of having your legs sewed off like soda sought off what you drank? Brandy, if you had that little fucking, that Fu Manchu, what does that one called as far as the facial hair mask and a lot of questions. Maybe I should have done some research. The only person I've seen with that is that Guy Lemmy from Motorhead and then afterwards, the dude from Metallica had it. He had it for a minute there. James Hetfield. Why don't we get to the questions here? I seem to be asking a lot of questions here. Why do I get to some of your questions and I'll try to answer them a question.

Speaker 8:          01:04:44       A bill. I have two questions. I can't help but notice these fucking annoying commercials and ads about selling your gold. Um, I wondered whether or not you thought this was a conspiracy to round up all the gold still owned by individuals so that when the dollar completely tanks, the people won't have anything of worth for themselves. Uh, no, I don't think it's a conspiracy. I just think that those guys late night are doing a much smaller version of the scam that bankers did originally is what they're doing is they're taking gold and they're just giving people a piece of paper for it. But it's not as bad as when the banks did, did the banks did it. They said, give us your goal, then we'll give you these little pieces of paper that are redeemable anytime you want, you can come back and get your goals. And needless to say, eventually, uh, you couldn't claim your gold anymore. And uh, they just sort of cap it.

Speaker 8:          01:05:40       No one knows where it is cause you can audit them. Um, so yeah, that's what those guys are doing. They're anticipating I probably the tanking of the dollar they get, I don't know if you guys, have you seen those commercials where they're just like, I used to a bit about it. You know, if you got an old class ring, if you got a broken bracelet, if you got some busted jewelry sandy and your goal, then we will give you cash for it. That's what they're doing. Um, and for those of you who think I'm a fucking moron, um, if you had a sandwich shop and somebody walked in and tried to buy a sandwich sandwich with some rubles, you tell them to go fuck themselves. But if somebody who came from a country that used to use rubles but at a handful of gold, you know, you still would be like, dude, what the fuck?

Speaker 8:          01:06:25       I don't know what gold is trading at, but you'd know that the gold had value. Okay, that's the great thing about gold all around the fucking world. You can get yourself a god damn sandwich with a piece of gold. I challenge you to buy anything with the fucking ruble. Go ahead and do it. Um, or some defunct, the yen. Do they have that anymore in Japan? Bill, you're getting in over your head. Shut the fuck up. Just keep moving. So no, I don't think that that's a conspiracy. I just think that that's one of the oldest scams in the book and a JP Morgan and the guys that was a Jekyll's island or whatever Federal Reserve, those guys perfected it. God bless him. Shame on us. Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool us for a fucking hundred years and a yeah, we're fucking morons. Okay, next one.

Speaker 8:          01:07:13       Um, also I'll be coming to Cleveland to see you and wondered if the same guy that opened for you in Pittsburgh, we'll be opening for you in Cleveland as well. Um, oh, that was Doug [inaudible]. Doug Seen Yay. Getting some props, ducks and yeah, he's hilarious. I kind of rotate my openers. Um, when I go to Cleveland, who's it going to be? Ryan Dalton in a Jason Lawhead. Actually two guys that I've known for about five years right now. They're based out of Cleveland. Travel all around. Absolutely fucking hilarious. And A, I lose half my liver every time I go out there and work with them. So I love those guys and they're going to be opening their fucking hilarious. So, uh, if you're wondering if I'm going to have a funny opener. Yes, I am. Um, next question. Bill. As a say of bills and a Sabres fan. I think I have it the worst with two lost Stanley cups and for lost Super Bowls and 11 years of 11 years without a playoff appearance.

Speaker 8:          01:08:06       Do you think I'm right? No, I don't. I do not. I think you definitely have it bad. But um, for the longest time everybody talked about Boston and then we want a bunch of shits. So that was over and they have been talking about the cubs, blah blah blah, blah, blah. But I think the worst city to be a fan in right now is Cleveland. Very quietly. Those guys have gone my entire life and nobody has won anything. The Cleveland browns have never won a Superbowl. The Cleveland Cavaliers have never won an NBA championship. And the Cleveland Indians haven't won a world series since 1948 so and less your in your seventies. Um, for all extensive purposes, the Indians have never won a world series. Do you understand that? Cause you gotta be like at least like eight years old, nine years old to remember a fucking world series.

Speaker 8:          01:09:02       Now, some douche bags going to email me actually always shakes your job when the Tigers won it in [inaudible] 68. Who gives a fuck? You know what I'm saying? Don't be a cunt. All right. Um, so I would say that they have it worse. Um, but yeah, you guys are, you know, you're right there. You're right there with them. That's one of those things. It's like, do you really want to win that argument? Remember longtime ESPN long time ago, ESPN did, who has the, who had the worst curse, the Boston red sox or the Chicago cubs and they did this stupid trial and they had like George Wendt from cheers, who's a Chicago guy. He's arguing to be like, no, we're more miserable. And it's just like, all right, you want to win that contest? That's all you. Who the fuck would want to win the misery contest?

Speaker 8:          01:09:46       It's really beyond me. So congratulations. You didn't win it. I think people in, uh, Cleveland, um, our world, I think, how do you think those guys feel? Have to fucking guys with world series rings this year? It used to be, uh, used to be on the fucking Indians or half the guys in the world series, right? Cc Sabathia. Ah, fuck. Who was the other guy? God dammit, I had them right at the tip. I got to stop talking on my cell phone. Manny Ramirez. Okay. We'll see how the last couple of years. Manny Ramirez, red sox bought him, right CC Sabathia the fucking a Yankees bought that dude via the brewers. Who else did Jim tell me play on the Phillies last year.

Speaker 10:         01:10:30       I mean, the Indian should have won it. They should've won it. But the way baseball is is a, you know, it's not competitive anymore. That's why I'm kind of a, I think I'm tapping out on baseball. I don't give a shit anymore. Uh, I dunno. In my world competition, I was right. Actually wrote an email to a guy about this. I met my world. Competition is our best guys. First. Your best guys, best team wins. That's to me is competition. Uh, I don't think competition is our best guys. Plus your best guys, verse whatever the Fuck you have left. Stupid. You know. Do you mind when you were kids and you'd be choosing up sides? You know when right off the bat, if two of the best guys were on the same side or in the end it seemed uneven people you'll

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       and when I was from, and it was called snuck teams Smu, see k, I've never heard that anywhere else. I was like, suck with an eminent snuck people. Ignore smoke teams. The teams are smug ain't what the fuck that that's, that should have been said like during the little rascals era, but some reason it was said during my childhood, he's a smug teams. So then you had to break them up. You had to break up the evil empire, the fucking, the fucking Yankees or the red sox Dodgers or whatever. Any one of these teams. I mean the Yankees are in a league of their own, but you know what I'm saying? Red Sox and all them are just as much part of the fucking problem. They would break up any of those kids know enough to break up those fucking teams. All right. Anyways, plowing ahead. Um, let's read, uh, what the fuck was I going to read here? Um, questions already did that, this is called broads over there broads over there. I don't know what the hell it says. Let's read this one. Bill. I had been a fan of yours sometime. Just want to tell you that. I think you're a great thank you. Why don't I fucking delete those? Um, I think your comedy of up at the [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          01:12:21       All right. Anyways, uh, the reason I am writing you is to tell you a funny story. Uh, my girl dating five plus years now and I live in Tucson, Arizona, and she's always bitching at me saying, we never do anything anymore. Well, my job is very consuming of my time. And I realized that she was correct. So what do I do? So what I do is I try to come up with something we could do together that would be entertaining and unique, something different that is not an average night out in Tucson se. The guy's using his brain, trying to surprise her. Anyways, I've been telling her about your comedy and showing her clips of you, uh, that I found on your myspace page for the past few months. She really seemed to enjoy it and laughed hysterically. So I planned this great evening for the 20th of November, um, which goes something like this, head up to temp Eav, have a nice dinner and head over to the Improv and watch your show.

Speaker 8:          01:13:11       You're eight o'clock show a while I bought the tickets and thought I would surprise her with the whole thing. She loved the idea and she was very excited and I was supposed to pleased to see her excited about the event. Well, we were telling our friends about it and she sort of says this, well it's his evening and I'm just throw at a tagging along. Uh, I got to admit that, um, I was a little upset at this point because I intended this whole thing to be a gift from me to her. Which is funny because this is very similar to the story that you told on October 19 on the October 19th podcasts when you took your girl in the corvette up the PCH. She just showed a shot. Ah, she just showed it sort of shut me down. Um, so my question to you is why is it never enough?

Speaker 8:          01:13:58       Ah, what a great question. Do you realize you just ask the question of properly every guy on this fucking podcast, um, hold on. I'm just going to pause here while the women roll their eyes and I got it both. Shit, that's not true. It's just, you know, you got to use your imagination. What did like surprises? They just fucking shut up. Just shut up. Would you just shut up and take off all those fucking layers so that the 18 hundreds, you know with your panties and your panty hose and your slip and your fucking skirt. All right. What am I talking about? I Dunno. Um, anyways, uh, where'd I lost my place? I'm, so my question to you is, why is it never enough? I can do everything she wants, but she was still find a way to make me look like an asshole. Making me a, making it seem like I'm dragging her around and making her do all that stuff that I want to do.

Speaker 8:          01:14:56       I guess that is why I relate to your comedy because it seems that she is only happy when we do all the things that she wants to do. Uh, you know what I'm talking you don't want to talk about with Brunch Street Fairs in the candle store. Uh, nevertheless, we are going and really looking forward to seeing you in person. Uh, I hope to see you have to show signs of cds and DVDs. All right. Um, why is it never enough? I don't know. I don't know why. I don't know if it's an insecurity that they are, they're always questioning whether you truly love them or not. Um, I have no idea. I don't know why. I mean, I would think that. All right, look, look, look at me. Okay. I went, I rented a corvette for the day, core veteran vertebral and I drove my girl all around La. We went up the fucking Pacific coast highway, looked at the ocean, we had lunch.

Speaker 8:          01:15:52       I took her out to this beautiful bar late at night. I drove through the Hollywood hills with the top down looking at the stars, looking at the lights out over the city. I thought it was a very romantic thing and then I got on the podcast and she was just like, yeah, that was really just, that was really your thing. I just did that for you. You know, I just thought of fat there and a $30,000 automobile, you know, seeing views that people fly six hours to thi and just, you know, just got a free lunch out of it and free fucking drinks and you ever watched the prices right there? You spit on my own microphone and you never have the prices right. You have watched the prices, right? Sure. We all have. Okay. Getting a corvette, I mean like, and then go into that restaurant and driving up to PCH and looking at the lights and going out to the fucking bar in the hotel where John Belushi.

Speaker 8:          01:16:44       Oh deed. Isn't that, that sounds like one in one of those showcases that you bid on. Are you going to bid? Are you going to pass? You know? Oh Dude. You know what? Speaking of that, I was watching, I was watching the prices right the other day and uh, I had like a white guilt moment. Okay, this, this black dude goes up to go spin the big fucking wheel, right? And you know, you know the deal. If for those of you who don't live in this country, you basically, you spin the wheel, whoever comes close to dark, closest to a dollar without going over gets to then go on and bid on the big surprises. All right? That's for people in England and Australia. And I'll let you to email me if you don't know the show. So

Speaker 10:         01:17:24       basically they have every denomination from 5 cents, 10 cents, 1530 40455050560 all the way up to $1. So this like 55 year old black dudes spins the wheel and it stops on 30 cents. Okay. Now you can decide to stay or spin again. Now I'm not a fucking math petition, but I think, uh, you want to hit on 30 cents, right? You want, he's looking out at the crowd and I'm like, is this guy fucking kidding me? And I'm kind of laughing going out. He's a little bit old. He's a little bit older, right? His family's gonna straighten it up for him and he looks out in the crowd. I don't know if they told them, I don't know what the fuck they told buddy goes, I'm gonna stay. He stayed on 30 cents and I'm looking at drew Carey going like, all right, I know what Bob Barker would do.

Speaker 10:         01:18:22       Bob Barker would be like, okay, wait a minute. You sure you want to stay on this? 30 cents is really low. He would have helped him through it. But drew Carey just went like, he's gonna stay on 30 cents. All right, let's bring up the next person. So the dude is standing there with the 30 cents up above them. And I wanted to laugh my ass off and be like, what a stupid fuck. But then I felt guilty because it was a black dude and I'd be white laughing at this black guy. Like he's a moron. And that's one of the, that's the worst thing about racist is a ruined your ability to be able to laugh at a moron because he's

Speaker 8:          01:18:59       another color. Then all because all of a sudden it becomes this ugly thing, you know, I'll give a fuck what color you are. If you're playing a game, we're trying to come close to a dollar and you stop at 30 cents, you're a fucking moron. And I should be able to laugh. And I was laughing and then I felt bad. And then I actually thought, oh shit, someone's gonna take that clip and they're going to put it up on youtube and then someone's going to write a bunch of racist shit underneath it rather than sticking with the subject that this individual who happens to be a black dude is a fucking moron, you know? Or at the very least didn't understand how the game worked. Look at that. I had to get, still had to give him the benefit of the doubt. A fucking game show that's been on 40 fucking years. Um, Jesus Christ. How did I get on that subject? All right, let's get back here. So my question is why is it never enough? You know what? My girls got the flu right now. How funny would it be if I actually called her in here right now with the flu to ask her this question? I'm really jeopardizing my relationship. Should I do what everybody? I think I'm going to do it. Hang on one second. Let me see if I can get her in here. Hold on. Hey

Speaker 11:         01:20:02       Mia. Hey Dad and your dad.

Speaker 8:          01:20:15       Alright, she's coming in. Don't say anything. Right. Watch miss. Finesse my way through this. Yeah, it's, come on in for a second. Alright. Making her way in. Ladies and gentlemen, making her triumphant return to the podcast. Look at you officially sick, officially sick pajamas, socks. Is that orange juice or you got any booze in there? On the rocks? Okay. Yes, it is everything. Don't worry Cleo. We'll get it. Um, all right. Here's a question for you. Here's a question one of my listeners had. All right. Yeah. I'm not trying to be hostile here. This is the female question. I know we had a big battle about that dude who punched that chick in the face, right? Rihanna, Rihanna, Chris Brown and Chris Brown. We had a big argument on the plane about that. It really bad. Um, all right. Should we talk about that argument or should we get into this?

Speaker 8:          01:21:14       Why don't we get into this and then, and then we'll do the argument, then we'll wrap it up, then we'll segue. There you go. All right. I'll read this to you and then you have to go. We have to come closer to the Mike here. Um, don't look over my shoulder. She, she reads way faster than me. It makes me self conscious. All right. Basically, there's this guy, he's got a girl. I'm going to paraphrase, my listeners don't have to listen to this shit again. Um, they'd been dating for five years. She always complains that they never do anything because the job is very time consuming. He admits this is job is his team. His job is very time consuming. Okay. All right. We're on the same page. Yeah, we're ready to go. Okay. Listen, she starts coughing.

Speaker 3:          01:21:53       Don't make me,

Speaker 8:          01:21:54       I've been doing this story every day, all day long. I make a left. So she starts coughing. You're terrible. She's like,

Speaker 3:          01:22:01       I'll listen to you selling. He's selling. You worked in a mine. Listen to that. That's horrible.

Speaker 8:          01:22:13       God, how did I ever find you attractive? Oh my God. I'm joking. No, I'm joking. I told you you're adorable. All right. So any ways, any anywhere, easy, easy. She says, Oh my God, this is horrible. You sound horrible. Alright, I'm listening. All right. Stop doing that. Be a performer here. Okay. All right. Jerry Lewis would have just, yeah, sat down. Um, anyways lady. See what a great sense of humor she's got even with the 105 degrees. So no, it's not that he doesn't take her, she said, she just said he doesn't take her anyway. Do you understand that? I understand. Okay. He has a time consuming job. She complains that they don't go a lot of places. She's claiming that they don't go anywhere and he admits that he works a lot and he might not have enough time here. Okay. Just don't side with the broad cause she has a Twat here.

Speaker 8:          01:23:09       All right. Really? Yeah, I know I had to go there. Makes the guys laugh. Alright. Uh, so anyways, so then he just, so he decides he's going to take her somewhere. So he sees that I'm going to be common in town. Right. He starts showing clips of me. Um, I, my space page. Of course she starts laughing cause I'm fucking hilarious. Right? We know this. And handsome. Yeah. Thank you. All right. So he goes, all right, this is perfect. So he gets tickets to my eight o'clock show. He's going to take her out to dinner. He's going to take her out to the comedy show. She says, that's not a good idea. He says, yeah, so we site, he feels like he's fixed the problem. So the next night they're talking about it to their friends and uh, he says where he's going to go and what they're going to do.

Speaker 8:          01:23:51       What should we have done? What shouldn't we do? Remember that? No reservoir dogs. Oh yeah. So you like telling jokes? Huh? Gig when like a budget girls in a school yet. I'm sorry. I know I do. Bad Impressions. Um, terrible, terrible. I know. So, uh, anyway, so then he finally ends up saying it to, uh, he brings it up. She brings it up in front of her friends and she said, well, it's his evening and I'm just sort of tagging along. All right. And he goes, I got omit that. I was a little upset at that point because I intended this whole evening thing to be a gift from me to her. Okay. Right. So he goes, it reminded me of when you took your girl out on the corvette and you said the same thing. Right? So he says, my question to you is why is it never enough?

Speaker 12:         01:24:44       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:24:45       I don't think that it's okay. I love it. Your tongue tied. Look at, see what you're doing right now. No. Say what's your exact say exactly what you're thinking. Don't do this is you try to figure a way to spin this shit. Don't spin it. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:24:57       I'm not spinning it because it's not like it's not enough. But I think where she's coming from, it's not like

Speaker 12:         01:25:04       the whole

Speaker 8:          01:25:06       he did. No, no, no, no, no. I, like I said, it comes from this point of insecurity that you guys never feel loved enough. Can you listen to me? It's hard, but yeah. Okay.

Speaker 13:         01:25:18       He is a fan of yours first she, she became a fan of yours but he is like a long time fan. So even though she would enjoy seeing your show, of course it's, he has more of a connection to you and your, your comedy than she does. He has more invested because he's, he likes you and she had just heard of you I guess when he introduced her to your clips on youtube and stuff. So in a way it's like, oh well I like it and I'll show it to her and how she thinks it's funny. So we'll make a night out of it. But it's not as if, I don't know what else she likes. I mean, I'm sure she likes going shopping and whatnot. So basically the fact that he didn't see, he didn't say, Hey, you know what, I have the afternoon free. You want to like go to the farmer's market or go like window shopping or whatever that have been an evening or an afternoon all about her. That's like the difference. And so can I interrupt right now? Yes.

Speaker 8:          01:26:11       It's a relationship. There's two people. It's not a birthday [inaudible] I understand. If it's her birthday, it's all about her. She goes, you never take me anywhere. So basically the problem here is the place that he's taking her to, he can actually have a good time at, he should actually take her to something that he doesn't want to do.

Speaker 13:         01:26:31       No, I think the issue is that she would have maybe preferred it if it was 100% all about her. Like if it was, so you guys are selfish specifically that she wanted to do? I don't know if she saw for sure not. Well, it sounds like she's a little, she's being a little bratty about it now though.

Speaker 8:          01:26:49       I'll take that. That was very, I'll, you know what, I appreciate that they know what the fact that you actually admitted at least to the, now I can listen to your opinion a lot more open mindedly

Speaker 13:         01:26:58       yeah, sure. Okay. A little, I mean, she's being a little bratty to throw that in there, especially to her friends. But yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:27:05       What do you think I would do? What do, what do, what do you think I would do if you did that? If, if you, if you made the comment in front of your friends. Okay. And then I've already, I've, uh, I've already stopped talking to us. We're coming home. All we hear is this silent. We're of our Prius.

Speaker 13:         01:27:23       See how it starts off. Giulia somehow. Um, I don't think I was being bratty though when I made the remark.

Speaker 8:          01:27:32       No, I understand it now. What it was was I loved the corvette long before I loved you. So it really was something more about me then.

Speaker 13:         01:27:42       Well, I don't,

Speaker 8:          01:27:44       was I smiling too much that day? Is that what bugged you?

Speaker 13:         01:27:47       No. Listen, as awesome as it was to ride in a corvette down the PCH Malibu, that was fucking amazing. It was not the, one of the things that I had on my mind as something fun to do. When you mentioned it, I was like, yeah, that, that sounds awesome. We did it. It was even better. But yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:28:04       they know we'll, we'll, we'll wait a minute. As far as your days that you've had out here in La, where does that one rank?

Speaker 13:         01:28:09       It's like number two to my birthday. See?

Speaker 8:          01:28:14       Yeah, a random day in October. So it was a fucking big time score and you still had to be like, wow, that was really kind of your thing. Why? Why would you do that?

Speaker 13:         01:28:23       You just said that I wasn't being bratty when I said it. And now you're, now you're,

Speaker 8:          01:28:27       no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I have memory problems. Wait, what? When did I say what? I wasn't, I sent you weren't being bratty with what? Okay.

Speaker 13:         01:28:33       Oh, I said, I don't think that I was being bratty when I said the thing about that. And you were like, no, no, no. I see where I see where you're coming from. You just said it. And that's not what I meant. Oh Great. How convenient.

Speaker 8:          01:28:45       Look me, I can't remember anything from, I don't have any short term memory anymore, so I don't know who that guy was. Who was who. I don't even know if I was agreeing with you. You know what? I'm never taking the stand if I ever kill anybody because I'm not going to be able to test them on it. Honesty.

Speaker 13:         01:28:58       It was a nice thing that you did and it was, it was unnecessary for me to say that

Speaker 8:          01:29:05       it wasn't a, you guys have to hang on a second while I kiss my sick girlfriend. Well there you go. See that wasn't necessarily that guys, I didn't have to slap her around. I didn't have to call any of them names over there like Chris Brown. Oh I don't.

Speaker 13:         01:29:20       And it was unnecessary for her to say that because he was trying to do a nice thing. Yes he is more of a fan of you than she is making it more of an better and more interesting fun night for him than for her even though she would have enjoyed it, but it was unnecessary.

Speaker 8:          01:29:34       Oh well let me ask you this. Don't know, most women just automatically see that with the idea. So then would she get self conscious and feel like she had to call, call it out before they set it? Would she may be say that because she's kind of embarrassed that, that, that, that like, yeah. Like, cause if he said it, you know, you know, what are you doing? Oh, he's taken me. See this guy, Bill Barry says cunt, every other word. That's what he's doing on this romantic night. God Damn it. I think she might be right.

Speaker 13:         01:30:04       Yeah. You know what? Yeah, I bet. What happened was, oh, what did, what is your boyfriend and doing? Oh, what are you guys doing? Oh, we're going to dinner and then we're going to a comedy show and I don't think that's necessarily the first thing on a woman's mind when it comes to a romantic evening.

Speaker 8:          01:30:18       Okay. Last question. Tell me, you didn't feel like you were dating Paul Newman when we were driving up to fucking PCH with the top down. It was pretty impressive. You didn't feel like Nia Woodward? I did. It did. Exactly. It's a fucking great idea.

Speaker 13:         01:30:32       Ballet like ran up to us and we pulled into the, uh, parking. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:30:36       Oh, I'm putting in a special spot. And God, Pat was back then underneath that overhang. So the shade would be, w was be all nice and cool. Yeah. Was pretty hot. You know, they don't do that when you pull up in the Prius, do they? No, they do not stick that bitch right out in the sun. Um, all right. So let's, let's get, let's get onto, let's get onto our argument. So, right. We're, we're flying back from New York City. How amazing was I a town hall? You were amazing. Standing Ovation. Yes. Right. You're fucking right. Am how insecure am I that I had to make you say that for the sixth time. You're insecure, but I'm the yeah, exactly. All right. So let's plow ahead here. Um, so we're flying back from, uh, where are we at Boston at that point. Yeah. And, uh, I don't, I don't know if we'd already watched the youtube clip or whatever. Rihanna had gone on TV talking to Diane Sawyer, breaking it down. Yep. Talking about, um, you know, getting the shit kicked out of her by that dude with the beaver teeth. Right.

Speaker 8:          01:31:41       He really looks like a bug to beaver. He does. He has no business being a pop star. Um, he better too, right? He did. Why wouldn't you? You got to utilize your weapons. So we're sitting there and it's this real is this really sad interview and she's just like, I just felt silly and stupid. You need to do for me. So this is what I did. So it started off as a joke and I said, all right, this is my impression because wrong. All right, to go on record as saying that I feel that this is so wrong, but the things you do that are so wrong. All right, well this is the deal. I was talking about how they, she was just saying that, you know, I found an inappropriate text message and then things escalated and then next thing you know, he caved in my cheek and started biting me and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 8:          01:32:30       And I was just like, you know what? She left out a lot of the details and cause what I've learned with arguing with women is when women argue when you're there or not winning or they're not getting you to admit that you're wrong, that some point they make this switch in there where they're just like, I'm just going to make this person is mad as I possibly can by using every ounce of information that I know about him. So truth, uh, you know what? That's as good as a yes. Anyway, so this is one of those in the moment jokes. I can't remember what they said. I said, this is my impression of, of the conversation before. I can't remember what, how I did it though. I was like, wish you see from Barbados, but for some reason I started doing this really bad Jamaican accent and I go Yaman Yaman who be sending you the text, man, you'll fuck you bitch.

Speaker 8:          01:33:23       I ain't go say not in your mind. Who gave you the text message? You fucking buck tooth be, I can't remember it somehow talked about his teeth and you will laugh in your fucking ass off. I can never recreate that. That's why I had to tap out and you will laugh in your fucking ass off and it was totally wrong. And, but then like halfway through it, I started making my point of how I'm so sick of every time a woman gets the shit kicked out of her, not every time, but all these women they always get, they always get to show guys in that bad light of all these guys who beat the shit out of the women, but they never show when women fuck over guys ever in those situations ever. Like you know the situations that, that, that, that I've seen where, you know, a friend of mine, you know, she slammed the door into them and then just called the cops and said that he hit her and they without question, arrest him and then that fucked up his job and now everybody looks at him like he's a wife beater.

Speaker 8:          01:34:18       He never even did it. How come Oprah never does shows about that? That was our big argument. And then she somehow, you know me, the way I say Shit, somehow it seemed like I was advocating that the guy did nothing wrong. And like, just, you know, all women are these horrible, manipulative yes. And you're not, you're not horrible manipulate preachers, but you guys do, you definitely manipulate. Can I burn a joke here that, that fucking milkshake joke, I'll burn it. I don't have that many, uh, listeners, I'll still probably do it on my special. I don't give a fuck. So here's a little t's kind of like when you see a movie trailer, this is kind of a bit I'm doing on my, uh, my special, this is what my girlfriend did one night when I was driving home. This is how much they manipulate, or as I call it, lie to get what they want. I was driving home and I was looking at this fucking, there was this diner and I was driving home and it was late at night. I was like, you know, hey, you know, I'm gonna stop there. I'm going to get one of those milkshakes. And you'd just like, oh my God.

Speaker 8:          01:35:20       Fuck you. It's hilarious. Let's not forget at the end of the day, my job is to like make those people left. Okay? Nia, you don't understand. These people work hard all week. These were Americans. They need to come out and forget about their problems now, whatever. I don't have one of my Mel Blanc. I got one fucking voice. I do. Nice reference. I watch cartoons. Really? Is that all it takes to impress you on a first date? That's how you ended up with me. He knows who does the voice of bugs bunny. This guy is a keeper. I think this guy will be able to provide what we ever hung out when I hooked up. We'll save that for another one. But you gotta you gotta Tell Him, Huh? You had to be impressed with my skills. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yes. You'd see that. They just won't give it up. This guy was fucking cock blocking me on an Olympic level.

Speaker 8:          01:36:10       He saw I was going to hook up. He actually tried to split a cab with you. Yeah, no, on the way home and I got around that. Yeah. Got around that. What happened? I fucking put the cards. I went all in just like world series of poker. I went all fucking in. She, she was trying to be all coy with Little Sammy Davis Jr had on trying to play all hard to get high thinking you were dealing with the sophomore in fucking college. Like I didn't have any fucking lines. Yeah. And that douchebag kept coming over, cock blocking me. He invited we, we will all set. I was hanging out. I'm going to tell right now. We were hanging out. Right. Me and this other dude and all of a sudden he shows up. Right. And I can see, I can see the vibe. I see the look on her face. I know she wants it now. I get, I don't know. He just, you know, shut up. You look great. You came up, you had a nice big smile and you're being flirtatious. And I immediately liked you. Right. So you went to the bathroom, you're with a friend. I'm with a friend. Every guy knows what you're supposed to do. Take that fucking battleaxe out of the picture.

Speaker 8:          01:37:16       Okay. Take one for the team. I can't remember who the fuck you with. So if it's one of your friends, I apologize. Um, whatever. Alright, a war memorial. Um, so what is this fucking, he goes the opposite route. I said, look, you went to the bathroom. I said, listen, I'm really doing well with this girl. All right, so a duty, I hate to like keep it like a chick. No, I had to be like, so if I'm not paying attention, he's, you don't get upset. This is how like female, this dude was, right. So I fucked in. He is where he ends up doing. Okay. The fucking guy ends up as we're going to leave, you know, I'm thinking, okay, he's going to try to peel off with a, your girl who's not a battle ax and he just, he invites another dude over and he goes, hey, you guys all want to get something to eat member and member and invited us over.

Speaker 8:          01:38:02       Now we're sitting there. It's me. You, you're not so battleaxe friends and three other fucking cocks are sitting there and I'm trying to hit on you. Yeah. And he keeps jumping in. Then he goes, Hey Nia, where do you live? Oh, I live up that way. You want to split a cab? Remember that? And I had to be like, no, no, no, you didn't. It was over at that point. I made the move. Remember that? I said, are you at least I bought before he fucking said that shit. He was doing everything. I remember I didn't have any cash and I pulled out my credit card. I said, you guys just give me the cash or just put it on my credit card. And he goes, oh, he's just trying to get the miles. Remember that anything could do to make me look like a shithead.

Speaker 8:          01:38:40       I thought you were like, Bam, I'm paying for the whole meal. No, no, no, no. They gave me money cause I didn't have any cash. This is how I got you, what you was sitting there. And I said, look, uh, we at least going to be able to split a cab because I wanted to go over and have a drink with you. And I was like, oh, we should be able to split a cab. And then you like, why? Why do you want to split a cab? Just putting up the roadblock. And that's when I went all in. I said, cause I want to kiss you. Bam. Right. And then that was it. I didn't fucking talk to you after that. Yeah. You sat there with that little stunned look on your face. Then what happened? Then we walked outside them, Dan, Dan, Dan, we walked out.

Speaker 8:          01:39:15       That was the shit. That was one of the greatest I used to do. The fucking guys like that used to always get me, I fucking nailed that stuck the landing like a male Mary Lou Retton and you know what the best part was. Then I stood up, we were all, and I, at that point I was like, fuck it. I said what I wanted to do, all this shit is in, I don't need to talk to her anymore. And I sort of peeled off. Right. And then everybody got up to leave and then you kind of touched me on the shoulder, said, don't worry, she doesn't usually like, don't worry, we're going to split a cab up time. And then I'm like, oh, this is going to be great because now I'm in and I'm going to get you get to watch that little fucking cock block, get his balls knocked on the, on the, on the fucking sidewalk.

Speaker 8:          01:39:53       And that's what happened. He came out right, clapped his hands. Remember that came out just like you, just like, so you guys ready to go and you're like, ah, yeah, actually we're taking a cab. And he was, and he was so in cock block mode. He still didn't know. He's like, oh well they live right near you. And you were like, listen, we're taking a cab and we're going uptown. And you leaned over and you set it. And then that's when he realized that everyone realized he was a cock block and dish. And then what did he do? He goes, oh yeah. I mean, yeah, oh, hold on. He just fucking peeled off, Huh? Then what happened?

Speaker 8:          01:40:28       My, at my other fucking classic line, we're fucking real. June was a masterpiece, fucking masterpiece. Then we got in the cab and you said, I thought, I thought you were going to kiss me. And we fucking driving like a maniac. And I go, I can't the calves jumping around too much. I go a kiss you at the first red light right now. You're trying to make this whole like I was fucking seducing you and it worked right? Then we hit the fucking red light. Yeah, I put one on you, Bam. Right? Couldn't feel your fucking feet.

Speaker 8:          01:41:04       I'm gonna make this story last nine hours long. And then you know what happened? Then I sat back and I was playing mister fucking cool again. Like I'm fucking Walt Frazier in 1972 oh the callback to the nicks from an hour ago, right? Then what happened? We stopped again and I'm sitting there looking out the window and you go, it's another red light right now. And then, and then we heard that cheesy saxophone from every fucking sexy movie in the 80s right? And then you are going, I'm not going home with you. I'm not going home with you. Now, whenever they say that guys, you know, they're not going home with you. You know that shit. So what you have to do is you have to constantly make them feel like it's safe and they're in control. So before, actually before you said you weren't going home with me, I felt your vibe.

Speaker 8:          01:41:49       I knew the deal. So I just said, listen, I know we're not going home together, but I'm really am a good time with you. I'd like to have another drink with you. All right. I know a nice bar. Ba Ba ba ba Bam. Right? You didn't go home with me. We had like fucking eight more drinks and made out for like the next five hours. And that fucking hell's kitchen bar had a great time. Yeah, there you go. So there's a little story people, there's your little backstory hour in one fucking minutes. There you go. Oh, you know I've got, damn it. I didn't get to this. You want to, you want to hear something that's gonna make your, uh, your fucking privates crawl. Sorry, what's was disgusting? I'm out of funny shit. I'm over time right now. Listen to this guy. You know, I was talking about that, that cut down there at the, at the diner that one day. Remember that guy good. Greg Did Jersey, you fucking faggot. Whatever the hell he said.

Speaker 10:         01:42:42       So people, people were talking about, people would talking about like all the, uh, you know, all the assholes in the confrontations and some people had the confrontations. Yeah, some people won the fights, some people lost the fight. Some people want and got sued. All the people walked away and had the fucking anger like I did. So he goes a podcast, the bullies point of view. This is from the bully. Listen to this. This is really interesting, Bill. I just listened to your last two podcasts and listen to the stories of these guys that went, that want to beat people, uh, when they're bullied. Well, I think I'm the bully. I've got 100 stories, but I'll give you two short ones, right? Fat People Bother me.

Speaker 10:         01:43:24       This guy's awesome. Fat People Bother me. Smelly people do to combine the two and give me lots of alcohol and I go off. So I'm down the, uh, down the hatch and Manhattan and fat smelly and Fet smelly guys come in, I can't help but tell them that they are an embarrassment to the white American race. This is where he becomes like this area and psychopath, I guess this isn't funny anymore. And he goes, and I'm tired of picking up their slack now if he's just saying that to be funny, that's fucking hilarious for one white person to say that to another white person. You're an embarrassment to the white race and I'm tired of picking up the slap, take a fucking walk. At least he goes, they don't say a word. So I slapped one right across the face. He goes, why? I'm not sure.

Speaker 10:         01:44:10       What's that movie you love there with, with Christian Bale? American psych. Yeah. I think this is the guy I'd love to see his business card. He goes out, there's six of them. I have four or five guys with me. But they wouldn't have known that if they wouldn't have known that and they just walked up, they just walked away out the door probably to grab some fried food. Uh, but the point is they didn't do anything. Did I feel bad about it? Not really. A, it's a pretty funny story to tell when I'm drunk. Most of this story.

Speaker 10:         01:44:42       Oh, these stories are hilarious. I don't even know if they're true, but these are fucking make me laugh. Arena elements story too. So I'm at a bar with a couple of guys and there's a midget in it. Uh, for some reason I don't notice the little man, but my friends do in the midget jokes commence. And one of the little men's friends says something to my friend. I told him to shut the fuck up and poured my corona on him. Uh, he didn't know what to do. About 10 minutes later I ordered a shot and saw some near the bar and toss that and him too. He did nothing. Why? Because 98% of the time, people, uh, people don't know how to react and clam up. It's not just your listeners are you, it's mostly everyone. So don't feel bad about freezing up and missing your opportunity. Um, and you're right that we don't always get what we deserve. I've been kicked out of more bars than I can remember. I've had sex with more women than I can remember and showed all of my friends pictures of them. Where did it get me to a six figure salary?

Speaker 10:         01:45:42       Wait a minute. You just want it to be fake. You want it to be fake. Nia, have you ever seen an asshole who takes what he wants?
