Simone says for the footer can I just
call the display contact function and

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.162
append it to the footer,

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:12.270
although the header already displays
the same contact information?

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.870
Yes you'll probably need a slightly
different function just because you're,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.230
well or it could be this, it depends
on how you define it but if you write

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.960
something that adds the information in
the same way, just to a different div,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.920
then sure, give that a shot,
reuse your code, that's great.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.760
It is true that it's just repeating
the same information, but

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.750
that's just to sort of remind you at
the end that, by the way, here I am,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.600
now that you finished
looking at my resume,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.530
here's my contact information again,
thanks a lot.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.540
Comment really from Simone
who says believe it or not,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.930
I actually really like the colors
on the resume as it is,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.355
would you recommend that
I change it anyway?

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:54.060
No, if you love it you don't have to.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.800
Thank you for saying that you like it.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.590
We'll have to pass that
on to the designers so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.600
don't feel like you have to change it.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.180
But maybe for practice you might,
you might do it.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.080
With data.otherfunction, function
declaration, I'll switch back over.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.450
Do you still need the var other
function statement or is it okay,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.290
is the data period other function
equal function statement sufficient?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.980
Do you need var in that?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.880
&gt;&gt; When you're adding a function
to an existing object, so,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.787
in this case we have data,
which is our object, and

00:01:30.787 --> 00:01:36.460
then we added this function called
other function to data down here.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.730
And we we went through that.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.460
You actually don't need var in this
case because all we're doing is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.600
adding something to
something that exists.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.210
And because data had already
existed we're just adding to it and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.000
not creating a new function or
a new variable or anything like that.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.955
And because of that,
you actually don't need to use var.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.300
&gt;&gt; So she's asking in project two,
do we have to put all the info that is

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.570
named your education image
into resumeBuilder.js.file?

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.160
Does that mean that we do not do
any in line text in the html file?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.705
So the html file is, yeah,

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:21.260
I don't think you have to in
line anything in the html file.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.548
Everything that you work on
is on the JavaScript file,

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:32.840
so I think it's best practice
to sort of just do all your

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.510
processing and rendering the data
within JavaScript functions,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.170
and then calling those functions
within your html file.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.747
&gt;&gt; Everything, all the information
about your resume, all the information,

00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:50.954
everything goes into your
resumeBuilder.js.file.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.600
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cry says,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.980
how do you make a resume interactive
when they usually contain a static view?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.135
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah that's a great question.

00:02:58.135 --> 00:02:58.740
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.310
&gt;&gt; So, in our instance,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.170
we're actually adding the sort of
interactive component with map.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.100
it's either going to be a map of where
you either worked or gone to school and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.380
it'll be very similar to like a Google
map, any sort of map you see online.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.390
Now that will sort of be the interactive
element that we're requiring.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.060
But just sort of in general I mean,
you can take a look at, search for

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.250
resumes online of web developers or go
to any sort of web developer website and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.120
their resume is usually on there.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.710
And there's some interactive elements.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.950
Sometimes it's just as simple
as the navigation menu bar

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.350
moving in a certain way, or disappearing
as you scroll down the page.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.140
Or it could be as crazy as
something like parts of the resume

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.420
come flying into the page or there's
a background photo and the background

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.380
photo changes as you scroll through
the resume and stuff like that.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.200
I've seen a lot of really interesting
and creative ones out there.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.050
There's really no limit what you can do,
it's kind of like being an art student.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.090
You're limited by how much you're
willing to put into the project.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.510
&gt;&gt; I found a lot of JavaScript
codes online that I want to use.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.690
Can I copy it and use it as long as I
understand it and can fully explain it?

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.680
Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.450
I mean that's 90 percent of what
a lot of web developers do.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.119
I think, is they go online they
read code, they reuse code.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.090
Gosh, I don't know where I would
be if I didn't have the internet.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.416
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would still be stuck
trying to learn CSS right now.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:40.295
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I would be like,

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:42.326
how do I flush out a box?

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:43.447
Do I need to look up the book?

00:04:43.447 --> 00:04:44.988
No.

00:04:44.988 --> 00:04:49.450
This one good thing about web
development, everything is open.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.740
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.930
You can look at, if you find a cool
site or you found something really cool,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.150
local function, you just open up
your code and see what did they do.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.185
&gt;&gt; Now it's like, as long as you
attribute that code, making sure that,

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:08.855
okay, I just commented on it or
I found this little code here,

00:05:08.855 --> 00:05:10.755
this little snippet, this is what it is.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:13.735
People will usually find what that is.

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:17.225
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I usually do,
too, is when I find, a piece of

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:20.205
code online and I'm like, this
pretty much knows what I want to do.

00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:22.865
And I don't want to fight it too much.

00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:27.005
I always leave a little comment and
I put the url in the comments.

00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:28.060
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.060
&gt;&gt; Cite the person just like you would
if you're writing an essay, right?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.370
&gt;&gt; You mark it,
you put it in the footer.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.880
And that way if I'm looking, going
back and looking through my code and

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.200
I'm looking at, how did I figure
this out, where did I get this from?

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.510
It gives me a chance to go back and
look at, yeah, that's right,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.110
this person did this.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.770
And on top of that it also kind of gets
me to kind of look at the other things

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.674
that maybe that person has done too, and
it sort of opens my eyes to some other

00:05:55.674 --> 00:05:59.300
ways of solving some different
problems I may not have thought about.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.990
So it's a great way, I mean, looking for

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.790
ways that people have done certain
things online is a great way to learn.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.020
An easy way to do this, I mean,
is just to go to any website.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.710
And if you see something that is
really fascinating like I said,

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.078
maybe there's some moving part and
you're like, woah, how did they do that?

00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:20.530
You can usually go,
look at the dev tools,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.320
look at the source code for the page and

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.670
kind of figure out what they did there
and try to mimic that on your site.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.800
It's a really fun learning
experience doing that.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.970
The one thing I will say though is if
you do you use something, make sure

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.590
it's stylistically good like it's under
the style guide that we're providing.
