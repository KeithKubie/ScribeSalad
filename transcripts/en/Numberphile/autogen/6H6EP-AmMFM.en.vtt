I have here pipe of sorts i blowing here
 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.320
I have here pipe of sorts i blowing here
and a current comes out through this

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
and a current comes out through this
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.259

spout just so that you are convinced the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
spout just so that you are convinced the
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.570
spout just so that you are convinced the
air is coming out watch the air is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580
air is coming out watch the air is
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.970
air is coming out watch the air is
coming out okay now I'm going to put

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
coming out okay now I'm going to put
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.650
coming out okay now I'm going to put
this very light ball just above the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
this very light ball just above the
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.000
this very light ball just above the
spout okay

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
spout okay
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:37.370
spout okay
and blow on it the upward streaming is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
and blow on it the upward streaming is
 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.380
and blow on it the upward streaming is
supporting the weight of the ball so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
supporting the weight of the ball so
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420
supporting the weight of the ball so
that it's in deflation is floating in in

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
that it's in deflation is floating in in
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.490
that it's in deflation is floating in in
the middle of the air so far so good but

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
the middle of the air so far so good but
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.810
the middle of the air so far so good but
now

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
 
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:03.319
 
I can support it completely off the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
I can support it completely off the
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.320
I can support it completely off the
vertical let's see if I can do it in the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
vertical let's see if I can do it in the
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:17.760
vertical let's see if I can do it in the
other direction too

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770
 
 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.590
 
did you see that well it's of the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
did you see that well it's of the
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:36.040
did you see that well it's of the
vertical the ball is spinning

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050
 
 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.469
 
this phenomenon has to do with all sorts

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
this phenomenon has to do with all sorts
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.640
this phenomenon has to do with all sorts
of questions whole range of questions

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
of questions whole range of questions
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140
of questions whole range of questions
that are often discussed in popular

that are often discussed in popular
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700
that are often discussed in popular
literature and the technical literature

plane flies now the usual explanation is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
plane flies now the usual explanation is
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.999
plane flies now the usual explanation is
that its newest theorem that's the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
that its newest theorem that's the
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.770
that its newest theorem that's the
technical term that people always invoke

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
technical term that people always invoke
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.260
technical term that people always invoke
and it's supposed to say that if you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
and it's supposed to say that if you
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.710
and it's supposed to say that if you
have a flow of fluid water what have you

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720
have a flow of fluid water what have you
 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.820
have a flow of fluid water what have you
the sum of density times velocity

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830
the sum of density times velocity
 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.029
the sum of density times velocity
squared over two so speed squared plus

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
squared over two so speed squared plus
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.279
squared over two so speed squared plus
the pressure is supposed to be constant

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
the pressure is supposed to be constant
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.520
the pressure is supposed to be constant
so if there's a large speed there's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
so if there's a large speed there's
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.560
so if there's a large speed there's
small pressure and if there's a large

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570
small pressure and if there's a large
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.930
small pressure and if there's a large
pressure this small speed and they'll

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
pressure this small speed and they'll
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.790
pressure this small speed and they'll
say they'll have you believe that well

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
say they'll have you believe that well
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.190
say they'll have you believe that well
there's fast air flow on this side and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
there's fast air flow on this side and
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.620
there's fast air flow on this side and
there's slow air flow and decided so the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630
there's slow air flow and decided so the
 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.650
there's slow air flow and decided so the
fast side has a low pressure and this

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
fast side has a low pressure and this
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.960
fast side has a low pressure and this
low side has a high pressure so the high

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
low side has a high pressure so the high
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.220
low side has a high pressure so the high
pressure region is pushing the low

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
pressure region is pushing the low
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.350
pressure region is pushing the low
pressure region and so it's going to be

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
pressure region and so it's going to be
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.180
pressure region and so it's going to be
lifted in this direction fighting the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
lifted in this direction fighting the
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.160
lifted in this direction fighting the
gravitation of all and they will say

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
gravitation of all and they will say
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.920
gravitation of all and they will say
that that's the same thing why the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
that that's the same thing why the
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.500
that that's the same thing why the
airplane is flying now this is not quite

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
airplane is flying now this is not quite
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.350
airplane is flying now this is not quite
right because there is film if you read

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
right because there is film if you read
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.420
right because there is film if you read
the actual proof and the statement and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
the actual proof and the statement and
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.229
the actual proof and the statement and
so on says that for each streamline that

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
so on says that for each streamline that
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.060
so on says that for each streamline that
is the flow line of a fluid particle

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070
is the flow line of a fluid particle
 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.550
is the flow line of a fluid particle
that's true but you cannot apply it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
that's true but you cannot apply it
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.590
that's true but you cannot apply it
automatically to different stream lines

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600
automatically to different stream lines
 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.569
automatically to different stream lines
and in this case there is a stream line

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579
and in this case there is a stream line
 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.210
and in this case there is a stream line
coming above the ball and then stream

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220
coming above the ball and then stream
 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.560
coming above the ball and then stream
line below the ball but these are

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570
line below the ball but these are
 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.910
line below the ball but these are
different stream lines you can't apply

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
different stream lines you can't apply
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.530
different stream lines you can't apply
there no it both at the same time you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540
there no it both at the same time you
 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.600
there no it both at the same time you
can't say well this stream line in this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
can't say well this stream line in this
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.400
can't say well this stream line in this
stream line they have the same kind of

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
stream line they have the same kind of
 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.650
stream line they have the same kind of
constant no it's it's not the implied in

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
constant no it's it's not the implied in
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.080
constant no it's it's not the implied in
the theorem there is another version of

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090
the theorem there is another version of
 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.310
the theorem there is another version of
it which is called a time-dependent

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320
it which is called a time-dependent
 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.620
it which is called a time-dependent
Bernoulli for potential flow which means

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630
Bernoulli for potential flow which means
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.900
Bernoulli for potential flow which means
that if there is no vortex in the system

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910
that if there is no vortex in the system
 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.210
that if there is no vortex in the system
you can apply learn week to the entire

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
you can apply learn week to the entire
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.680
you can apply learn week to the entire
fluid region but in this case there's a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
fluid region but in this case there's a
 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.850
fluid region but in this case there's a
lot of vortex you saw the whole thing

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860
lot of vortex you saw the whole thing
 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.680
lot of vortex you saw the whole thing
spinning so you cannot apply the new

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
spinning so you cannot apply the new
 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:36.940
spinning so you cannot apply the new
either either

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950
 
 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.790
 
so it's actually a nonce application you

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800
so it's actually a nonce application you
 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.699
so it's actually a nonce application you
can't use ville-marie to explain this so

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709
can't use ville-marie to explain this so
 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.520
can't use ville-marie to explain this so
what is happening is the question what

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530
what is happening is the question what
 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.770
what is happening is the question what
is really happening has to do with

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
is really happening has to do with
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.020
is really happening has to do with
something that is subtle but in some

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030
something that is subtle but in some
 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.730
something that is subtle but in some
sense even more primitive than the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740
sense even more primitive than the
 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:04.699
sense even more primitive than the
renewal you see when we do this is

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709
renewal you see when we do this is
 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.270
renewal you see when we do this is
streaming above the ball and it's being

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
streaming above the ball and it's being
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.970
streaming above the ball and it's being
deflected along the ball like this why

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980
deflected along the ball like this why
 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.770
deflected along the ball like this why
does it deflect because the air has to

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
does it deflect because the air has to
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.470
does it deflect because the air has to
stick to the ball and in a fluid is a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
stick to the ball and in a fluid is a
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.220
stick to the ball and in a fluid is a
continuum

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230
continuum
 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.920
continuum
it doesn't want to so the snot snap out

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930
it doesn't want to so the snot snap out
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.349
it doesn't want to so the snot snap out
and create a vacuum so if there is a

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
and create a vacuum so if there is a
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.600
and create a vacuum so if there is a
solid boundary for example or some body

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610
solid boundary for example or some body
 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.909
solid boundary for example or some body
like this he wants to go along the

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
like this he wants to go along the
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:36.080
like this he wants to go along the
boundary of this thing and that's why it

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090
boundary of this thing and that's why it
 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.570
boundary of this thing and that's why it
gets deflected and underneath it kind of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580
gets deflected and underneath it kind of
 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.730
gets deflected and underneath it kind of
goes like that also so the long and

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740
goes like that also so the long and
 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.830
goes like that also so the long and
short of it is that the whole airflow

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840
short of it is that the whole airflow
 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.409
short of it is that the whole airflow
comes in like this but goes out like

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419
comes in like this but goes out like
 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.469
comes in like this but goes out like
this so it curved but whenever the

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479
this so it curved but whenever the
 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.630
this so it curved but whenever the
trajectory of a moving object curves for

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640
trajectory of a moving object curves for
 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.000
trajectory of a moving object curves for
example fluid curves there must be a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010
example fluid curves there must be a
 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.850
example fluid curves there must be a

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320
above it's pooling that's a figurative
 

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.409
above it's pooling that's a figurative
way of speaking but essentially again

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:35.419
way of speaking but essentially again
 

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.909
way of speaking but essentially again
what's going on is that pressure there

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919
what's going on is that pressure there
 

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.459
what's going on is that pressure there
is a pressure difference and you have an

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:39.469
is a pressure difference and you have an
 

00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:41.050
is a pressure difference and you have an
effect from high pressure region low

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:41.060
effect from high pressure region low
 

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.820
effect from high pressure region low
pressure region you are pushing against

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:42.830
pressure region you are pushing against
 

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.380
pressure region you are pushing against
each other by the way pressure is

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:44.390
each other by the way pressure is
 

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.540
each other by the way pressure is
everyone knows its force divided by area

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:46.550
everyone knows its force divided by area
 

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.200
everyone knows its force divided by area
if you multiply top and bottom numerator

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.210
if you multiply top and bottom numerator
 

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.000
if you multiply top and bottom numerator
and denominator by length you get Force

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.010
and denominator by length you get Force
 

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.560
and denominator by length you get Force
Times then that's called work that's a

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:53.570
Times then that's called work that's a
 

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.570
Times then that's called work that's a
form of energy and area times length

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:55.580
form of energy and area times length
 

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.570
form of energy and area times length
that's volume so it's actually energy

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:58.580
that's volume so it's actually energy
 

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.460
that's volume so it's actually energy
per volume the pressure is like

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:00.470
per volume the pressure is like
 

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.350
per volume the pressure is like
potential energy per volume and we are

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360
potential energy per volume and we are
 

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.820
potential energy per volume and we are
saying that if you have a high pressure

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:03.830
saying that if you have a high pressure
 

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.070
saying that if you have a high pressure
region that's high potential energy

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080
region that's high potential energy
 

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.990
region that's high potential energy
region and low potential energy region

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000
region and low potential energy region
 

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.850
region and low potential energy region
which is low put a low pressure region

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:09.860
which is low put a low pressure region
 

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.880
which is low put a low pressure region
then the stuff moves is pushed from high

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:12.890
then the stuff moves is pushed from high
 

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.620
then the stuff moves is pushed from high
pressure to low pressure which is

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:14.630
pressure to low pressure which is
 

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.030
pressure to low pressure which is
exactly the same thing as if you have a

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040
exactly the same thing as if you have a
 

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.900
exactly the same thing as if you have a
say a slope like this hill and a valley

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:19.910
say a slope like this hill and a valley
 

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.030
say a slope like this hill and a valley
where all the balls wants to roll from

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.040
where all the balls wants to roll from
 

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.610
where all the balls wants to roll from
high potential region to the low

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:24.620
high potential region to the low
 

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.320
high potential region to the low
potential region just rolls down and

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.330
potential region just rolls down and
 

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.810
potential region just rolls down and
gain some kinetic energy by doing this

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:28.820
gain some kinetic energy by doing this
 

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.520
gain some kinetic energy by doing this
so the pressure is acting like a

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:30.530
so the pressure is acting like a
 

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.410
so the pressure is acting like a
potential energy let's let's do the

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:32.420
potential energy let's let's do the
 

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.829
potential energy let's let's do the
spoon actually so let's go yeah let's do

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839
spoon actually so let's go yeah let's do
 

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.900
spoon actually so let's go yeah let's do
the spoon because I like your language

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:37.910
the spoon because I like your language
 

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.710
the spoon because I like your language
of the taking revenge

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720
of the taking revenge
 

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.689
of the taking revenge
that's great that's wonderful so you can

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:44.699
that's great that's wonderful so you can
 

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:47.300
that's great that's wonderful so you can
do another home extender to see that

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:47.310
do another home extender to see that
 

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.949
do another home extender to see that
whenever a fluid flow curves the

00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959
whenever a fluid flow curves the
 

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.720
whenever a fluid flow curves the
trajectory of the fluid curves it

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:53.730
trajectory of the fluid curves it
 

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.509
trajectory of the fluid curves it
creates a pressure gradient difference

00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519
creates a pressure gradient difference
 

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:58.160
creates a pressure gradient difference
in pressure which sucks

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.170
in pressure which sucks
 

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.900
in pressure which sucks
something in on one side and pushes

00:09:59.900 --> 00:09:59.910
something in on one side and pushes
 

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.429
something in on one side and pushes
something out on the other side as soon

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:01.439
something out on the other side as soon
 

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:03.769
something out on the other side as soon
as the spoon touches the water the water

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779
as the spoon touches the water the water
 

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:07.999
as the spoon touches the water the water
gets deflected you see from a straight

00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:08.009
gets deflected you see from a straight
 

00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:10.759
gets deflected you see from a straight
vertical down to the side and that has

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:10.769
vertical down to the side and that has
 

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:13.759
vertical down to the side and that has
the effect of pulling the spoon in you

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:13.769
the effect of pulling the spoon in you
 

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:17.540
the effect of pulling the spoon in you
see the poof and that's because if the

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:17.550
see the poof and that's because if the
 

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.600
see the poof and that's because if the
water momentum is changed from this to

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:20.610
water momentum is changed from this to
 

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.059
water momentum is changed from this to
this that means that somebody must be

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:23.069
this that means that somebody must be
 

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:25.759
this that means that somebody must be
providing the force from left to right

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:25.769
providing the force from left to right
 

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:28.189
providing the force from left to right
and the counter force is applied to the

00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:28.199
and the counter force is applied to the
 

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:31.309
and the counter force is applied to the
spoon from right to left and that sucks

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:31.319
spoon from right to left and that sucks
 

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:33.110
spoon from right to left and that sucks
in the spoon from this side and if I

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120
in the spoon from this side and if I
 

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.040
in the spoon from this side and if I
touch this spoon

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.050
touch this spoon
 

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.259
touch this spoon
the water would escape from this side

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:36.269
the water would escape from this side
 

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:41.880
the water would escape from this side
it's the opposite effect

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:41.890
 
 

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:58.560

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:58.570
[Music]
 

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.080
[Music]
yeah and that's essentially like that

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.090
yeah and that's essentially like that
 

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.330
yeah and that's essentially like that
you know they've datum Bowl but the

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:04.340
you know they've datum Bowl but the
 

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.810
you know they've datum Bowl but the
picture is seen sideways you see the

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:06.820
picture is seen sideways you see the
 

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.550
picture is seen sideways you see the
airflow who is coming in like this and

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560
airflow who is coming in like this and
 

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.010
airflow who is coming in like this and
going up like this and if you turn it by

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:12.020
going up like this and if you turn it by
 

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.980
going up like this and if you turn it by
90 degrees it's exactly the same picture

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:13.990
90 degrees it's exactly the same picture
 

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.620
90 degrees it's exactly the same picture
yeah and this is the ball which is

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:17.630
yeah and this is the ball which is
 

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.100
yeah and this is the ball which is
sucked in the direction opposite to the

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.110
sucked in the direction opposite to the
 

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.800
sucked in the direction opposite to the
direction of deviation of the fluid flow

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:25.810
 
 

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.300
 
and the challenge is to just tuck the

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:28.310
and the challenge is to just tuck the
 

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.310
and the challenge is to just tuck the
ball up and put it in a cup now that's

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320
ball up and put it in a cup now that's
 

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.020
ball up and put it in a cup now that's
of course very very difficult to do so

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.030
of course very very difficult to do so
 

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.900
of course very very difficult to do so
you shouldn't do this in public and

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:33.910
you shouldn't do this in public and
 

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.040
you shouldn't do this in public and
because the chances of success are very

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.050
because the chances of success are very
 

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.320
because the chances of success are very
small
