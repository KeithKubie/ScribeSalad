PIA SORENSEN: So welcome, everyone.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.060
So today is fermentation
day, fermentation week,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.440
which is one of my favorite
weeks in the semester.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.259
I also on the side teach a class
on fermentation, so I love this.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.950
And we're very excited to
have Tara Whitsitt here.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.010
And I'm going to introduce
her and leave over to her.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.794
I usually like to start with
this slide because it is such--

00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:45.460
and the question I ask, but you
already know the answer to this,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.890
is what do these foods have in common?

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.780
But even if you know
the answer, I think it's

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.460
worth it to just pause
and look at this and see

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.260
just how diverse these flavors are.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.470
I mean, everything from coffee,
chocolate, wine, olives, beer, miso,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.560
yogurt-- really diverse
foods, really diverse flavors.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.180
But they all come from fermentation.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.565
And soon, I think-- I
see some cabbage here.

00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:15.820
Soon we're going to turn cabbage
into something really flavorful.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.620
So they've all been produced with bugs.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.610
And I usually-- another
reason I like this lecture

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.700
is because so far in this
class, for those of you who

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.900
have been coming
earlier in the semester,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.430
so far we've basically cooked the egg.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.550
Sometimes we joke that every
concept that we cover in this class,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.440
you could only talk about eggs.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.150
This entire class is about eggs.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.714
And so so far, we've cooked the egg.

00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:49.380
And we've cooked other things than eggs.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.150
We've cooked steak and ceviche,
molten chocolate cake, pesto.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.530
We've whipped egg whites.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.170
And what these have in common
is that they are all ways

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.650
that we mess with proteins.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.570
And proteins are basically--
they're the basis of life.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.039
So here, we mess up proteins by heating.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.330
Here we mess up proteins
by adding ceviche,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.750
although this actually looks cooked.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.910
Here, we mess up proteins by
heating the molten chocolate cake.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.240
If we want to make sure that
pesto does not turn dark,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.970
then we want to make
sure that we mess up

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.280
the proteins that would turn it dark.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.330
So we would add some acid,
or we would blanch the pesto

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.290
before, the basil leaves before,
to make sure it stays green.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.610
Even when we whip egg whites,
we're kind of denaturing.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.870
By physical force, we're
denaturing the proteins.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.200
So we mess with proteins.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.580
What happens when you
mess with proteins?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.470
You kill things.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.310
So this class so far has
just been about death.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.830
It's just been about death.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.840
Now we've come to the
part of the class where

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.860
it's about life because now these bugs,
we want to make sure they stay alive.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.890
And we want to make
sure they're super happy

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.530
so that they can produce all
of these molecules for us.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.460
So when raise our dough,
when we start our sourdough,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.710
we want to make sure that the
bugs in there are super happy

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.840
and they're cranking out
lots of flavor molecules

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.690
and making the food delicious.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.290
So it's now about life.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.330
This is a greeting from Michael, who
sometimes does this introduction.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.580
You should look at this, Tara.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.760
He was very excited to
show you this picture.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.350
This is yeast.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.810
He made his own yeast.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.880
TARA WHITSITT: Lovely.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.755
PIA SORENSEN: Lovely.

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:40.350
No, I know.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.010
TARA WHITSITT: Yeah.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.009
PIA SORENSEN: Beautiful.

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.275
With bugs, we mean everything
from lactic acid bacteria

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:50.111
to baker's yeast to fungus, which
I know some people-- you know,

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:51.860
it's one of those words
that make you feel

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.240
like maybe things aren't so delicious.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.660
But we like to talk straight here.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.170
So these are the kinds of
bugs that we're talking about.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.590
And these are the kinds
of enzymatic reactions

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.020
that happen in the bugs that crank
out all these flavor molecules

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.640
and molecules that makes things savory
or acidic and makes the food preserve

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.640
or, like this picture,
makes us intoxicated.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.810
And basically, what all of these
bugs do is they turn long molecules,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.940
large molecules, into small molecules.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.750
So they take the long sugars, the
long proteins, the long lipids,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.260
and they turn it into ethanol,
gases, aromas, flavor molecules.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.470
They're all smaller molecules.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.122
And the reason they do this is basically
to beat out all the other microbes.

00:04:45.122 --> 00:04:46.830
So if you were sitting
here, and you were

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.975
producing all these molecules
that smell bad and stink,

00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:51.600
then you would want to get out of here.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.225
And maybe you would even, if you
were a microbe, you would die.

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:55.940
And so then all of you would take over.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.148
And you would-- I don't know.

00:04:57.148 --> 00:05:00.220
You would make cheese or sauerkraut.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.960
That's the basis of how it works.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.870
This is all part of the chemical
warfare between microbes.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.100
So by producing some of these molecules
which are toxic to other molecules,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.290
you're sort of making sure
your species survives,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.490
and that is ultimately
preserving the food.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.540
OK.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.910
So just quickly, alcohol
is an example of this.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.100
Once you increase the
ethanol concentration,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.730
you can't have so many other
kinds of bugs live there.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.790
Cheese is another example.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.000
It turns out cheese rinds
are these beautiful examples

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.760
of biofilms of bacteria.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.330
And Rachel Dutton, who used to
be at Harvard until recently

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.500
and is now at UC San Diego, she
actually used cheese as a way

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.630
to study and understand
microbial communities.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.610
So she went all other world,
took little cheese samples.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.250
It was a very delicious trip.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.110
And she then sequenced
all of the microbes.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.090
And this is a map of what she found.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.730
This is the amazing
diversity of microbes she

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.356
found in cheeses all over the world.

00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:12.568
OK.

00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:14.890
Fermentation is very close to rotting.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.580
If things go bad, then
you're spoiling the food.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.935
And here is some beautiful
artwork for this.

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:24.270
I'm just going to show you this.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.830
Lovely, beautiful.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.850
This is sort of the bad side.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.550
So real quick, the way this happens
is by exponential growth of bacteria.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.900
So you all know that the way life works
is that you start out with one person,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.870
and it divides and
turns into two people.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.540
And the first person dies.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.580
And then they turn into two
people each, and they die.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.860
And then it goes on like this.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.210
And this is how life works.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.484
So if you were to take this and you
would just turn it into an equation,

00:06:56.484 --> 00:06:57.650
you would get this equation.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.250
Thanks.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.170
Equation of the week.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.570
We clap for equations here.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.730
Yeah.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.292
So you could take this
equation, and you could turn it

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:12.750
into this equation, which is
a little more straightforward.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.270
So I like this one better.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.210
You don't have to clap again.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.870
So you could now look at this
equation, and you could plug things in.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.810
So you could say, OK.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.890
How about I have a piece of
cheese or I have some food.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.280
And there's one salmonella
bacteria on there.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.350
And then I let this thing
sit out for 12 hours.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.595
How many salmonella
bacteria would there be?

00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:36.815
So you would plug this
into the equation.

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:40.180
And you would get 7
to 10 to the 10 bugs.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.591
This is 10 zeros.

00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:43.260
It's a lot of bugs.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.080
If you did this for 7 grams of
bugs, in fact, that's a lot.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.030
If you did this for 24 hours, then you
would have 10 to the 11 grams of bugs.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.730
So lots of bugs.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.500
Why does that not happen when you
start out with one salmonella bacteria?

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.600
Why do not-- I mean, there's got to
be one salmonella bacteria out there

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.420
somewhere.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.775
Why is not the Earth taken
over by salmonella bacteria?

00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:12.727
AUDIENCE: Growth conditions?

00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:14.060
PIA SORENSEN: Growth conditions.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.919
I mean, at some point, they can
only divide as long as there's food.

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:19.960
And as soon as they run out of food,
they're not going to divide anymore.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.350
So lucky for us, usually
they run out of food faster.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.590
So even if the thing-- you know
that sandwich you had earlier today.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.850
Even if there was one
salmonella bacteria on there,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.980
you're probably fine.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.600
You're probably not going to get sick.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.063
And if you do, this is why.

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:34.563
OK.

00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:36.659
So that's all I have to say.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.850
So I'm now going to introduce
Tara Whitsitt, which

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.770
we're so excited to have her visit.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.214
Tara has a truck.

00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:46.910
She has a fermentation truck.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.550
I mean, do I need to say more?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.280
And I'm just gonna leave over to you.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.933
Please, let's welcome Tara.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:54.784
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:55.825
TARA WHITSITT: Thank you.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.360
Well, first of all, I want to thank
Harvard for having me here today.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:13.070
The last time I was in Boston, I was
here with my bus, my 40-foot bus.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:19.210
And I have a much more lavish
situation this time around being here,

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.980
which I never expected to be
in Boston, treated so well.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.400
So yeah, I'm really
grateful to not be parked

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.780
on a busy street in
Jamaica Plain getting

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:36.290
very little sleep before speaking
to people about the things I love.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.040
So yeah, thanks.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.410
In October 2013, I departed from
Eugene, Oregon, my home base,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.780
with a 1986 International
Harvester military bus

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.330
while slowly converting it to a
fermentation laboratory, library,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.230
and classroom.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.990
I didn't do the entire
installation on my own.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.370
I did it with the help of many
people throughout the United States

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.810
over the course of two years.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:12.630
In those two years, I held 156
events in 27 different states

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.630
and reached over 5,000 individuals.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.150
My original goal was to complete
a year-long tour of the United

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.830
States called Fermentation on Wheels, in
which I would work at farms in exchange

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.430
for food and educational
resources and visit cities

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.920
to hold free workshops on
fermentation methods using locally

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:40.030
harvested foods to give people the
tools to consume foods more thoughtfully

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:44.370
and also provide communities with
a direct line to their food source.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:51.480
It was also to inspire people
to get back into their Kitchens.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.150
It was a challenge.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:59.170
A lot of friends and family
thought I was kind of losing it.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.350
I was an inexperienced bus driver.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.330
The day I bought my bus was
the first day I drove it.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.120
I had a failed Kickstarter.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.240
My bus had no plumbing or
electricity when I took off.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.790
Over time, my bus has become one of
the most innovative and interesting

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.575
learning spaces, but it took
a lot of time and effort.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.750
The very gradual installation
of my solar system

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.380
is a good example of
this time and effort.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.460
I began installing my solar system
while I was in northern California

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.750
at the Solar Living Institute.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.700
The labor and installation
of fundamental parts

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.880
were offered in exchange for letting
a class demonstrate on my bus.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.550
Four months later, in
Mississippi, I made

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:56.120
$500 in donations, five
times the most I'd ever made

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.760
in donations teaching fermentation.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.270
So I bought a $250 solar panel.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.400
I had no skill to install
the panel on my bus.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.450
So that was kind of an
obstacle to actually getting

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.720
the system working right away.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.950
But nevertheless, I drove with
my panel on the floorboards.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.680
I was patient.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.230
When I parked and taught,
I would drag the panel

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.300
to the back of my bus in my
bedroom and hide it, and then

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.280
drag it back out when I drove again.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.550
And then a month later, in
Charlotte, North Carolina,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:40.050
I met two guys that installed
the panel on the roof of my bus

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.360
in exchange for sauerkraut.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.440
And this just really proved
the unprecedented generosity

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.380
of others and the constant community
of people who want to heal the world

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.240
and help others.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.130
And community has become
increasingly important to Americans

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.270
over the past decade.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.545
In a country where profit
over people has crept into

00:13:05.545 --> 00:13:09.440
and now defines aspects
of our culture, and we're

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.210
discovering we may leave the
Earth in worse condition than when

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.050
we came to it, we realize more
and more that the only way

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.780
to repair these damages
is to work together

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.810
for bigger and better outcomes.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:33.350
At a workshop in Philadelphia in
May, 2014, a local community gardener

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:39.130
and youth educator expressed she felt
the need to do all of the things.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.540
It was overwhelming-- how to
teach others to grow food;

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:50.460
how to get the most out of their food,
whether it be raw, cooked fermented;

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.520
and then educating on
thoughtful consumption.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.030
She didn't list these
details, but I knew

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:02.820
exactly what she meant when she felt it
was impossible to do all of the things.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:08.470
And her end point was, I'm really
glad that you're tackling this issue,

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.730
fermentation education, and that you're
making it more accessible to people

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.540
all over the nation.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.120
Like, oh, good.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.800
Someone's got that.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.440
And it's impossible to
constantly feel encouraged

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:30.210
when we don't work together to tackle
these massive issues in education,

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.480
food, and health.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.800
When I first entered the work world, I
got a corporate job in New York City,

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.420
not because I wanted to, but I
didn't think I had other choices.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.700
It had been ingrained in me to take care
of myself and let the rest of the world

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.860
take care of itself.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.530
But after five years,
it was a slow transition

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.320
leaving my consumer-driven and
small bubble of a lifestyle,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.510
but it began with the desire for change.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.510
Even if I haven't joined
a physical community

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.300
in making change in the
world, I was feeling synergy

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.900
with the active force of humans
advocating for better food.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.700
And I began that change
first by buying better food,

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.734
consuming more thoughtfully.

00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:21.900
And I'm not talking about
going to the grocery store

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:30.140
and looking for labels that say
non-GMO, organic, low fat, local.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.840
I'm talking more about actually
reading the back of a package

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.670
and seeing if you understand any of
the ingredients listed on the back,

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.472
or if you can pronounce
all the ingredients,

00:15:42.472 --> 00:15:44.430
which I'll admit there
are a lot of ingredients

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.720
I know I can't actually pronounce.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.640
Or you could also just
skip the grocery store

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.830
and go to the local farmers
market and buy raw ingredients

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.600
from a farmer that's
in the local vicinity.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.150
And so then my next step to fully engage
in a better, more sustainable food

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:13.590
system is to make my meals at
home, to preserve my food at home.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.190
It's empowering, and this
made me feel in unison

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:23.690
with a time passed, with the
original homesteaders of America.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.670
And in some ways, I felt
already for an apocalypse.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.760
And my bus has actually
survived two apocalypses.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:42.600
They each happened on
Halloween, 2013 and 2014.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:48.100
Fellow survivors packed into the
bus to admire my healthy compost

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:55.810
pile, clean water, vintage
bus-made wine, sauerkraut,

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.700
and a modest exhibit
of fresh vegetables.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:06.520
My post-apocalyptic bus larder
cleared the motto "YOLO-- You Only

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.329
Live Once, ferment your vegetables."

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:16.740
So today, as a 29-year-old who has
circumnavigated the country teaching

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.290
people of all ages and socioeconomic
levels in my 40-foot bus

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.609
turned laboratory and classroom, filled
with glass and bubbling concoctions,

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.720
I remind people
happiness and self-reward

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.620
doesn't come from a paycheck
at the end of two weeks.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.240
The most rewarding thing we
can do is follow our dreams,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.410
no matter how terrifying they are.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.460
And my hope is that most
of our fellow dreams

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.400
will align with changing the world we
live in now to a world with healthier

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:57.070
air, humans, soil, and water, to promote
a community of thriving organisms

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.550
on small and large scales.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.910
Something some of us don't
realize or maybe take for granted

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.240
is that all of these things in our
environment-- small and large--

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.640
depend on each other for survival.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.570
Understanding my environment and the
food within it as a community project

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.066
made fermentation a revelation for me.

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:23.790
I didn't grow up with fermented foods.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.100
The only thing that may have closely
resembled something fermented

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:33.560
from my youth was pasteurized yogurt,
which is not that tasty and lacks

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.170
in over half of the nutritional
content it once had.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:44.170
So why, for the past 60 years,
have we chosen food devoid of life

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.880
rather than the real deal?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.510
The true value of food isn't
realized, and it desensitizes us.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:57.210
Some of our palates don't
understand the real deal anymore.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.110
And luckily, in my
travels, I've now have

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.580
the pleasure of tasting dozens
of different yogurt cultures,

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:11.060
each with their own distinct flavor,
all in varying levels of mild to tangy,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.670
and each with their own story, too.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.153
So fermentation celebrates uniqueness.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.610
In addition to our palettes
newfound confusion to uniqueness,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.920
we've been told bacteria
isn't good for us,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.190
even though we're composed of
10 times more bacterial cells

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.370
than we are of human cells.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.255
We're 90% microbe.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.970
And good food is not expensive.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.690
In an agricultural system
that is mostly crop

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:52.740
dusted and/or genetically modified
and rotates only between corn, soy,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:58.830
and sugar beets, real food grown
in healthy soil is a rarity.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:05.090
The stuff that's widely available,
watered down, and subsidized is cheap.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.810
It's up to us to make positive
consumer decisions that

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.340
will ultimately discourage monoculture.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.600
So I urge you to consider
the importance of diversity.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.060
And this might seem super
obvious to a lot of us here.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.080
But access to good
food and food education

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.600
is still a huge struggle
for a lot of people,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:33.290
even for those in nearby
thriving food communities.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.800
For example, the average
household in Princeton,

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.140
New Jersey makes three times
that of the family household

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.770
in Trenton, New Jersey, where
less than 50% of students

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.310
graduate from high school.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.380
Both cities are located in the same
county, and they're 13 miles apart.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.490
Yet Princeton has
historically had access

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:04.060
to good food and top-notch education,
while Trenton falls far behind.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.010
That's changing, slowly but surely.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:14.080
And part of that is thanks
to a nonprofit called Isles.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.750
Isles, Inc helps members
of the communities

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.760
start their own cooperative
gardens and teaches

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.550
youth in public schools
about food through gardening.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.980
This is a small fraction of the work
they do to enrich their community.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.690
I was honored to collaborate
with Isles and share

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:40.120
my bus with near 100 students in the
Trenton public school system in 2014.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.100
And they've been a super
valuable partner of mine,

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.535
helping reach students who
might otherwise be overlooked.

00:21:49.466 --> 00:21:52.340
Isles, Inc is a great example of
the ways in which we can plant seeds

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.942
in our communities to make change.

00:21:54.942 --> 00:21:56.650
We can plant these
seeds in smaller ways,

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.320
too, by simply sharing
and empowering techniques

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.860
at home with our family and friends.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.920
Four years ago, a new friend
from my local Brooklyn farmer's

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.460
market brought cabbage
and salt to my apartment

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.355
and showed me how to make sauerkraut.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.740
I was at awe, not because I was
especially crazy about sauerkraut.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.500
I liked sauerkraut, but I
love meditations in food.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.640
And fermentation was still a
mysterious meditation to me.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.300
It was actually super easy, and it
didn't require a lot of kitchen tools.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.050
And, you know, something
about today's modern kitchen

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.890
is I think we feel we need this
overwhelming amount of tools

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.890
to actually make a
yummy meal or especially

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.880
to preserve something at home.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.010
But it wasn't immediate that
the revelation came when

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.690
I packed the sauerkraut into the jar.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.130
It was as the days passed, and I
watched the community of bacteria

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.540
in my sauerkraut bubble away.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:17.880
It's a super collaborative meditation
when sauerkraut begins its process

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.260
and you actually watch
the gases begin to rise.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.210
There's a color change, too.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.360
It's a very visual experience.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:37.070
And so at that point, sauerkraut became
this whole new force in my universe,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.440
and a delicious one, too.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.060
So fermentation has become
my protest to all the things

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.570
that disenchant me in the food system.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:56.540
So that's why I have this huge
monologue on my issues with food

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:02.130
and why it's important to
really recognize diversity

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.780
as something we need more of right now.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.200
Fermentation was the
next-level step for,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.990
I feel, changing the way that
we view food in collaboration

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.170
with those who tend
the soil it lives in.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.730
We need healthy soil
to get healthy plants

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:26.800
and have rich, awesome
bacteria thriving.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.700
And so I feel what better way to
protest this than to travel the country,

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.380
sharing this information for free.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.910
I'm a fermentation
enthusiast, a lover of food.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.470
Some people call me an expert.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.710
I wouldn't say I'm an expert.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.130
I'm an artist.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.840
Accessible education is my medium.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.040
Fermentation is my inspiration tool.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.373
And community is my motivation.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:05.040
I have been an introvert
most of my life,

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.120
but I'm really glad I've
never let that keep me

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.640
from standing up for what I believe in.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.130
I refuse to sit on the sidelines.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.735
So with that, let's
make some sauerkraut.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.440
Has anyone here fermented before?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.870
Are people fermenting in this crowd?

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.240
Some people.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.670
Who's fermenting vegetables?

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.150
Great.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:42.630
And who is fermenting with starter
cultures, such a sourdough, water

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.260
kefir, kombucha?

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.150
All right.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.130
Great.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:56.750
So fermentation is a simple,
naturally-occurring process

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:08.040
where there's a microbial transformation
in which unique flavors are produced,

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.010
super tangy flavors, especially.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.500
And what's actually
happening in the process

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:21.650
is sugars are being converted into
acids, gases, and sometimes alcohol.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.350
In this process, we are working
with lactic acid bacteria.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.760
We're making a simple sauerkraut today.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.476
There are three basic controls
when we work in fermentation.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.820
Temperature is big.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:53.180
So the kind of range at which we want
to ferment in, I say 68 to 76 degrees

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.800
is a really good, ideal range.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.820
Of course, you can give or
take a few on either end.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:03.270
But the main thing to remember is
that the cooler the temperature,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.260
the slower the fermentation
process will work.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:11.050
And the warmer it is, than the faster
the fermentation process should work.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:18.290
So it's good to have a kind of medium
range for fermentation to get it going.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:23.360
And something else about temperature
being a factor in that when it's cold

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.900
and things slow down, this is also
a way to hit the pause button.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.780
So when we get towards
the end of the lesson

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:38.120
and talk about packing the food
away, the way we do that is we

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.570
actually put it in a refrigerated place.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:50.310
Another control is salt. We use
salt in the fermentation process

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:56.250
to draw water from the
vegetables we're fermenting.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:06.440
We also use it to enhance the flavor
or impact the flavor in whatever way.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.610
Some people like less salt.
Some people like more.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.550
That's fine.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.330
But then, finally, salt
is also very important

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:17.950
because it promotes the growth of
lactic acid bacteria, also known

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.780
as lactobacillus.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.206
Time is another control
that we use in fermentation.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:35.220
The longer you ferment for, the more
development of these tangy flavors,

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.950
and the shorter you ferment for,
the milder your sauerkraut will be.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.480
So this is one of the beauties
of fermenting at home,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.320
is that you actually decide
when you take the sauerkraut

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.310
off of the fermenter, which
is like this ideal temperature

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.290
range is the fermenter, you could say.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.830
And yeah, some people like it
after one week, when it's mild.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.990
Some like it at three weeks.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.400
Then you're getting
a good, tangy flavor.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.860
I really like my sauerkraut
at four to five weeks.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.110
So I like it even a little more tangy.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:27.130
So pickles-- when we make pickles,
there are a few different ways

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.210
to make pickles.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:33.420
And something I think a lot of
people are a little confused about

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:40.260
is what is a fermented pickle
versus a canned pickle?

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:46.610
And canning is very
different from fermenting.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.900
So when we can foods, we're
heat processing the food.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:30:00.740
So obviously, no life can occur when
we heat process any of our vegetables.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.490
And in fermentation, it's
entirely the opposite.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.960
We're actually bringing
more life to the food.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.570
The idea is that you're
doubling the life,

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:22.990
and you're enhancing it, making
it a more microbially rich food.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:31.150
And so when you go to the grocery
store and you see sauerkraut sitting

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:35.950
on the shelf, that's a canned food.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.040
It's not fermented.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.080
If a fermented food were to sit
on a shelf in the grocery store,

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.810
it would rot.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:52.080
It can't sit for long in that state.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.380
It will keep fermenting.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.760
So when you go the refrigerated
section in your grocery store,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.010
that is an actual live, fermented food.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:05.040
That's the real deal sauerkraut.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.020
So bacteria is everywhere.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.930
What we're working with today, we
would refer to it as wild fermentation.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.180
We call it wild
fermentation because we're

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:21.300
relying on the bacteria that is actually
on the cabbage rather than a bacteria

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.820
that we introduce.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:28.230
There are times where we
introduce other organisms.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:34.260
We might say one of the
reasons I would culture

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:40.870
my sauerkraut-- let's say I made
a really great batch of sauerkraut

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.180
from scratch.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.600
And because any time you
make sauerkraut is completely

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.680
unpredictable from one batch to the
next-- conditions will never quite be

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.280
the same.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.670
So let's say I make this
really wonderful sauerkraut.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.080
And the only way I can really
get that flavor profile again

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:07.960
is if I transfer a little bit of the
brine from that kraut to my next kraut.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.900
So it's kind of a way
of transferring flavor

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.960
profile by grabbing
some of that bacteria

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.460
and bringing it over to your next batch.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:24.330
That's not the most typical
form of starter culture.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:32.330
Starter cultures are also like
sourdough, kombucha, water kefir,

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.780
anything that you use in
the process of inoculation.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.890
This is just another
form of inoculation.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:45.790
Some people like to culture
their vegetables with whey.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:50.060
I'm not an especially big fan of whey.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.410
I don't have a lot of whey
hanging out regularly.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:58.630
So I'm not psyched to
get whey into the mix.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:03.070
The one benefit if you use a starter
culture while fermenting cabbage is

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.840
it speeds up the process a bit.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:11.080
But wild fermentation, using
just the bacteria that is there,

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.330
is a beautiful thing.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:13.360
It's really easy.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:21.490
You don't need anything-- salt,
keep it anaerobic-- so omit oxygen--

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.440
and give it time.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:24.960
Yeah.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.770
So people always ask how
do you know you're not

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.570
getting undesirable bacteria?

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.110
Like, what is keeping it away?

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.610
All right.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.630
Yeah.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:43.610
So lactobacillus is this super
robust, competitive organism.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:48.000
And it's actually used
in so many of our--

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.310
it is present in so many of
our fermented foods-- cheese,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:34:00.010
yogurt, kefir especially,
fermented vegetables.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.330
All of these foods are very safe.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:06.060
Sometimes you'll get the
growth of white or blue mold.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.110
These molds are not toxic.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:13.560
You can simply scrape them
off, eat what's underneath.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:20.210
But a really, really great story I
like to tell in regards to lactic acid

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:25.090
bacteria is one of
Noella Marcellino, who

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:31.380
was a nun and a doctor in
microbiology in Connecticut.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.760
And she's a cheese maker
for many, many years.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.370
And she fermented in
a big, wooden barrel.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:45.350
And one day, the FDA came to her.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.360
This was, I think, in the '80s.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.670
And they said, this is unsanitary.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.424
You have to stop
fermenting in this barrel

00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:56.060
and start fermenting in stainless steel.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:00.710
And as a microbiologist, you can
imagine she was pretty outraged.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:04.665
Like, yeah, this barrel
has a lot of history.

00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:09.560
It's kind of responsible for the
taste and the uniqueness of my cheese.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.140
I definitely can't switch
over to a stainless steel

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.810
vessel for my cheese-making process.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.790
And this barrel was,
let's say, like 60 years

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.200
old into the cheese-making process.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.630
So she did this really wild thing.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:31.540
She made two batches, one in a stainless
steel, and the other in her barrel.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.900
And she inoculated
them both with E. coli.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.120
The batch in the stainless
steel was ruined,

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.960
and the batch in the
wooden barrel was fine.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.610
And that was because
the wooden barrel was

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:50.270
lined with lactobacilles
from years and years

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.180
and years of having
cheese be fermented in it.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:36:01.480
And so that really shows the robustness
of this organism we work with.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.790
There have been no recorded
cases of people getting

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.410
sick from vegetable fermentation.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:14.940
If anything, it's not going to
be good because it's not tasty.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.740
Maybe the ingredient combination
you used just wasn't a great one.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.820
And that's a simple part
of any cooking process.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:30.460
So that's the same deal.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.710
So we're going to go ahead and
move forward with the hands-on.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:46.610
So equipment we need--
a vessel is important.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:47.880
I like glass.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:52.140
I especially recommend glass if you're
getting started in fermentation.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.610
This is because of visibility.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:37:00.330
So you can actually see what's
going on within the jar.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:05.220
If you're getting a little bit of mold
action on the top of your sauerkraut,

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:09.190
then you know to
maintain, scrape it off.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:19.075
You can also use ceramic, food-grade
plastic, and stainless steel.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:27.360
So glass is great because, like I
said, visibility and quantities.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.280
So if you want to make just a quart
or kraut, that's really easy to do.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.100
Not everyone wants to
have a gallon of kraut

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:39.190
at home, especially if they live
alone and don't eat that much kraut.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.050
And then a weight is important.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:47.190
Today, we are simply saving
the leaves of these cabbages.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:54.860
And we're going to actually pack
the sauerkraut down with the leaves.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.890
So we won't need a weight.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:02.660
A weight I recommend more if
you have an even larger vessel,

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.480
like if you had a gallon.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:10.650
And also, my favorite
weights are river rocks.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:15.010
What I do with the river rocks,
I find the smoothest river rocks,

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:19.020
and I scrub them with water, and then
I boil them for 15 to 20 minutes.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.920
I found this to be the
best tool as a weight.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:30.170
You can also use a jar that will
fit into the mouth of your jar

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.710
and fill it with water.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.010
That's a great weight, too.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:38.590
Some people like to take a thick
plastic bag, put it over the kraut,

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.860
and then fill it with water, tie it up.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.778
That works quite fine, as well.

00:38:44.778 --> 00:38:55.100
And then you want something to keep dust
and bugs out-- tea towel, rubber band.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.900
There are these really fancy airlock
systems that you can find today,

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.860
and they're kind of like
these plastic twist-ons.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.110
And you have a little airlock.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:08.620
And what airlocks do is they
allow the CO2 to escape,

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.660
but no oxygen can come in.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:17.800
So that creates less
opportunity for mold growth.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.740
It's really not necessary.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.430
If you want to try it out,
you can find them easily.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.995
Maybe some of you are already
using airlock systems.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.720
And then salt-- I use
unrefined sea salt.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.610
I just get salt from the
bulk bin at my grocery store.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:46.410
I recommend staying away from salt that
has decaking agents or iodine, anything

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:52.410
that is not simply salt.
And that's part of quality

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:59.750
or using any extra type of ingredients
that could mess with your microbes.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.950
Although, I have used
iodized salt. It worked.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.630
Some people say it adds a
flavor that is unpleasant.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.140
I didn't notice that.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.360
But there are a lot of ways to do this.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:19.390
But obviously, it's easy to just
stick to pure, pure salt. You

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:25.130
can also experiment with smoked
salts-- pink Himalayan salt.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.980
There are these mineral-rich salts.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.333
They work just as well, too.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.885
So does anyone have questions so far?

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.440
Yes?

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.356
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:58.330
TARA WHITSITT: Yeah, so salt
promotes the growth of lactobacillus.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.540
Lactobacillus is special
in that it's a halophile.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.420
So it's a salt-loving organism.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.765
Most bacteria, especially
the undesirable guys

00:41:09.765 --> 00:41:12.760
that we don't want
hanging out in here, they

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:18.030
do not like salt, which
is what makes the salt

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.125
part of this process very safe.

00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:22.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.520
TARA WHITSITT: Yeah, it's
like the combination of salt

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:33.490
and acidity keeps the
undesirable organisms at bay.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.370
All right.

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.080
So we're going to chop some cabbages.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.470
We're saving these
leaves aside for later.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:48.520
So I always like to half my
cabbages, and then quarter them.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:54.645
I just find this is a much
easier way to handle them.

00:41:54.645 --> 00:42:01.900
And I'm going to go ahead and do
some chopping, too, because it's fun.

00:42:19.272 --> 00:42:20.822
Oh, there's just one knife.

00:42:20.822 --> 00:42:21.863
MELISSA: It's in the bag.

00:42:21.863 --> 00:42:22.613
TARA WHITSITT: Oh.

00:42:49.471 --> 00:42:52.990
PIA SORENSEN: If there are questions
while you guys are chopping,

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.904
I don't know if you can
do-- I can't chop and answer

00:42:55.904 --> 00:42:57.070
a question at the same time.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.110
But you seem so awesome.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.266
So yes?

00:43:04.206 --> 00:43:05.122
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:16.900
Once you have made fermented sauerkraut
and you put it in the refrigerator,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.760
will it be good for
indefinitely, basically?

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:29.255
TARA WHITSITT: I mean, over time, the
sauerkraut will be a little less tasty.

00:43:29.255 --> 00:43:32.460
And you also need to be careful
in how you're storing it.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.830
It's best to store it
under the brine if you're

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.730
storing it for very long periods.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.740
Generally, it will last anywhere
from six months to a year.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:47.520
But some sauerkrauts last
longer than that, even.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:54.040
When working with kimchi, which has
a lot of garlic and is antimicrobial,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.680
I find that garlic always slows
down the fermentation process.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.600
And I can keep it for much,
much longer in cold storage.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.200
Also, it probably has
something to do with the fish

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.500
sauce that's in the kimchi.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.230
I mean, fish sauce is kind
of its own different animal

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.830
in regards to fermentation.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.520
It's a year-long ferment.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:20.650
So that probably helps in preservation,
too, with kimchi, specifically.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:25.520
Because I can leave kimchi
in a refrigerator for years.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.140
And sometimes it's just better.

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.940
I mean, it's like the most amazing,
delicious ferment you'll ever have.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:36.100
TARA WHITSITT: You're welcome.

00:44:45.706 --> 00:44:49.830
AUDIENCE: How does the
bacteria in whatever you're

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.330
fermenting change day-by-day?

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.120
So right when you're starting,
what is that profile like?

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.250
And how is that on day three versus two
weeks later versus three weeks later?

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:02.470
I know you said lactobacillus really
battles for the space and takes over.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:06.990
But what's going on in the process?

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:11.080
TARA WHITSITT: Like, the ascent
of lactobacillus over time?

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:25.240
So the movement of lactobacillus,
it's said that at day 28,

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:30.570
that's where there's a kind of
explosion of these organisms.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:34.410
That's where they hit a climax.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:43.190
So if you were to have a kind of graph,
it'd be like week one, two, three.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:48.040
And somewhere between week
three and four, it's like, boom.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.250
And then four, five, six.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:56.650
And over time, it kind of dwindles.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.650
And I mean, of course that's going to
vary a lot based on temperature, too.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:09.480
But that's at the range between,
like, 68, 76 that I mentioned.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.030
It's around day 28,
give or take a few days.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:19.100
But it does move up into a climax,
and then it slowly kind of moves off.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.780
AUDIENCE: When you drive
your bus around, how do you--

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:32.672
TARA WHITSITT: Sorry?

00:46:32.672 --> 00:46:34.380
AUDIENCE: When you
drive your bus around,

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.770
how do you feel that the vibrations
of moving all of your cultures

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.597
around affects fermentation?

00:46:41.597 --> 00:46:42.430
TARA WHITSITT: Yeah.

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:45.150
So some of my cultures
don't like agitation.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.580
Some of them couldn't care less.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.340
Some of them like agitation.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.660
I mean, I'm fermenting anywhere
from 30 to 40 different gallons,

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:04.840
or 40 to 50 gallons of
fermented foods and beverages

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.820
at any given time on my bus.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:16.475
So that ranges from wine, beer, cider to
miso and sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha.

00:47:16.475 --> 00:47:20.510
Kombucha and vinegar,
I have the big problem

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.780
in that-- do you want me to pass that?

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.190
I have the big issue
that I can never form

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:34.510
a proper SCOBY, which is a Symbiotic
Colony of Bacteria and Yeast.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.390
It's the mother, like the
disc formation that you grow

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.350
and you use as the starter
culture for future batches.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:46.550
So yeah, in my bus, when
it's constantly moving,

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:52.640
I can never get a proper SCOBY, which is
not necessary for starting a new batch.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.180
But it does-- her nutritional
presence really speeds things up.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:03.770
And it makes the process
faster and easier.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:06.790
So I definitely missed
that when I was on the bus.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.950
And then also, just the
jostling around of kombucha,

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:13.630
given that it's an aerobic ferment.

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:17.434
That had its challenges, too.

00:48:17.434 --> 00:48:18.100
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:18.570
Thank you.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:20.820
AUDIENCE: If you were going
to make fermented pickles,

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.200
would you be going about it about the
same way as you're doing the sauerkraut

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.467
right now?

00:48:25.467 --> 00:48:26.300
TARA WHITSITT: Yeah.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:32.970
So with sauerkraut,
obviously, you can chop it.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:37.450
And you could have thin or thick
slices, and it would all kind of

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:42.730
ferment at the same rate because the
surface area is roughly the same.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:48.130
However, let's say we're
fermenting radishes or turnips.

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:53.420
If we were going to use the process
in which we're just adding salt,

00:48:53.420 --> 00:49:00.080
we would need to chop them very finely
and expose a lot of surface area.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:05.250
However, whole fermented
radishes are delicious.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.040
And whole fermented
cucumbers are delicious,

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:12.150
which is one of the more common
fermented foods we enjoy.

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.934
And in that case, rather
than just putting salt

00:49:15.934 --> 00:49:18.100
on the whole vegetable-- I
mean, that wouldn't work.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.808
You wouldn't be able
to actually permeate

00:49:19.808 --> 00:49:22.305
the walls of the
vegetables, the cell walls.

00:49:22.305 --> 00:49:28.120
So we would make a saltwater brine.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:33.440
And my ratio for the
saltwater brine, I use

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.830
1.5 tablespoons per one quart of water.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.930
And then I pour over the vegetables.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:46.190
This is not a hard number.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:50.390
Some people prefer two
tablespoons per one quart.

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:54.860
Some prefer one tablespoon per quart.

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:59.570
As you practice, you'll get to
know the salinity percentage

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.150
you like with your vegetables.

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:07.350
It took me a good year to figure out
that 1.5 tablespoons was my sweet spot.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.260
So yeah.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:18.000
And even the cabbage we're going to work
with now, we're going to salt to taste.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.400
The rough ratio when
we salt vegetables is

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.060
one tablespoon per two to three pounds.

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:30.080
That's one tablespoon of
salt per two to three pounds.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:38.540
But I always encourage people
to taste the sauerkraut,

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.390
the cabbage, the salty
cabbage before you pack it

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:48.840
because it's OK to
have less salt. If you

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:53.910
don't have a palette for
the super salty, that's OK.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:58.340
And even with less salt,
if you have enough brine

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:05.150
to push your vegetables underneath
the brine, then you're going to be OK.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:10.360
And then one thing to really
stay away from is too much salt.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:15.980
If you have an overwhelming amount
of salt-- while you're salting,

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.990
you taste, and you're like,
oh, that's really salty.

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.400
I guess I'll just pack it.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.470
Well, you know it's going to taste
way too salty afterwards, too.

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:31.090
So you'll want to figure out a
solution for making it less salty.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:35.440
You can dilute it by
adding more vegetables.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.920
You could also add some
water to dilute the salt.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.990
But it's always best to start
with less salt rather than more.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.665
Did I answer your question?

00:51:51.665 --> 00:51:52.165
Great.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:55.840
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.800
This is a two-part question.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.960
Can you explain the difference
between pickling and fermentation?

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.340
And then also, I don't know
if you've seen any Portlandia,

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.880
but there's a sketch called
"You Can Pickle That."

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.910
And they pickle all
sorts of normal things,

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:12.260
and then they start pickling,
like, bowling balls and remotes

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.280
and stuff like that.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.792
Has there ever been
any ingredient or group

00:52:15.792 --> 00:52:17.750
of ingredients that you
just would not ferment,

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:19.374
that just doesn't taste good fermented?

00:52:21.413 --> 00:52:22.246
TARA WHITSITT: Yeah.

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:35.090
Well, between pickling and fermenting--
so all fermented vegetables are

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.480
pickles.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.490
Not all pickles are fermented.

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:48.315
And that goes back to kind of the
heat processed, pickling process.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.790
You use a vinegar solution.

00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:00.060
Vinegar in itself is a
byproduct of fermentation.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.840
So you do get that tangy flavor.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.380
And that's why you
would call it a pickle.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:14.210
Pickle is kind of defined by
this tangy, unique flavor, right?

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.730
But the only difference is
that that kind of pickle

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:22.410
has no more life involved.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.160
There are a few other differences, too.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.500
But this is the primary difference.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.750
Fermented pickles are teeming with life.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:37.640
As far as-- I haven't seen Portlandia,
so I'm not sure about the sketch

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.960
you mentioned.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:46.410
But there are definitely some things
that are not so great to ferment.

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:51.130
I'll just say as some
advice to people, if you

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:56.070
want to ferment lettuce
or any other leafy greens,

00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:01.570
it will be like a green, mushy liquid.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:02.950
It's really unpleasant.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:15.220
Super starchy vegetables, the texture
gets really kind of like gritty,

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.470
also unpleasant.

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:22.280
I do one ferment with a
more starchy vegetable.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.180
And it's called sweet potato fly.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.840
It's actually a beverage.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:34.260
And I slice it up, and then
I wash it for five minutes.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.180
And that's, like, to
get the starchiness off.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:43.590
And then in that recipe, you end up
tossing the solids, the sweet potatoes.

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:48.950
So then the starchy, starchy stuff
is kind of taken out of the equation,

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:49.620
ultimately.

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.620
And it's a short ferment.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:59.090
But yeah, starchy foods, leafy
greens don't really work that well.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.850
I haven't had trouble with much else.

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:07.600
Of course, I've had a few experiments
that just didn't go that great.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.070
If you ferment with
super dark greens, they

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:16.020
have a kind of chlorophyll
flavor, which is not

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.000
super pleasant to a lot of people.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.830
Like, if you're doing just, like,
collards and dino kale and these really

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:27.900
dark greens, it's a flavor
that's hard for a lot of people.

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:33.610
PIA SORENSEN: So I have
a really quick question.

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:36.090
So Melissa is doing a lot of massaging.

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:38.350
What if I'm lazy and I
don't want to do that?

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:40.390
Does it still turn out OK?

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:41.210
Sorry.

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:43.080
TARA WHITSITT: No,
that's a great question.

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.630
So we are actually
massaging the vegetables

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:55.220
because we want to get this packed into
a jar, like, ASAP, As Soon As Possible.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:03.470
And another option would be to salt
the vegetables, walk away for an hour,

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:06.380
and come back to sweaty vegetables.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.480
And I do that.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.510
And then there's like
the other extreme, where

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:16.260
people are, like, using these
pounders to pound their kraut,

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:21.160
and it's super-- it's kind of violent.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.560
They're really getting at the cabbage.

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.790
But that's totally normal
in a lot of cultures.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:34.680
And then in eastern Europe, they make
huge barrels of sauerkraut every year.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:39.100
And my friends from eastern Europe
talk about how when they were children,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:45.510
they would jump into these barrels and
just jump on the kraut for a long time.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:50.580
And that was one of these
nostalgic things for them.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.740
So there are all kinds of ways
to get the job done, yeah.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.870
And then and then
ultimately there's a test.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:57:01.836
So Melissa, do you want
to kind of make it rain?

00:57:01.836 --> 00:57:02.610
MELISSA: I can't.

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:04.590
It's just getting [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:08.010
TARA WHITSITT: So this is a
test to kind of see if you're

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:13.250
getting a brine to come forth.

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:15.370
It looks good.

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:20.600
And then secondly, you
can kind of take the bowl,

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.260
turn it over to check
if there's a puddle.

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:28.550
And that's kind of the next--
yeah, and there's a little puddle.

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:34.760
So that's a good sign that we're
ready to pack into our jars.

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:40.150
And by the way, this is
a very simple sauerkraut.

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:44.420
Green cabbage, salt. It's great.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:50.470
But if you like chili,
caraway, say you want

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:54.680
to add even some turnips
into the mix, carrots,

00:57:54.680 --> 00:58:02.180
you can slice those up nice and fine
and throw them in and ferment those

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.275
with your cabbage, too.

00:58:03.275 --> 00:58:08.540
And that's one of my
favorite-- I love red cabbage

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:12.820
with thinly sliced
radishes and some chili.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:18.360
That's like my comfort
food-- after it's fermented.

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:24.530
So yeah, are we ready to pack it?

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:28.116
Are there any other questions
before we pack into the jars?

00:58:28.116 --> 00:58:29.740
PIA SORENSEN: Does anyone have the mic?

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.531
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:31.531 --> 00:58:32.030
Yeah.

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:37.280
I had a question about-- have you ever
used a pH meter to measure acidity?

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.510
Is there some kind of pH threshold
for, I guess, in this case,

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:45.110
sauerkraut or something?

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:49.540
TARA WHITSITT: The pH threshold
is-- you would know that.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.350
MELISSA: Well, there's an ideal.

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.890
I work for a commercial--
a small business that

00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:58.960
produces fermented foods commercially.

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.770
So there are some pH levels.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:05.400
For food safety, the pH has to be
below 4.6 because above that level

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.955
is a danger zone for pathogens.

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.960
I can't remember the
range for lactobacillus.

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.770
Our vegetable production manager
would know that question.

00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:22.359
But it's, I think, in the
high threes, I want to say.

00:59:22.359 --> 00:59:23.650
TARA WHITSITT: The high threes.

00:59:26.847 --> 00:59:27.347
Sorry.

00:59:31.163 --> 00:59:35.010
But yeah, and that's something, if you
do you want to produce commercially,

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:42.230
you'll definitely-- the regulatory
dudes will be like, get that pH.

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:49.180
And it has to be 3.8, between 3.8
and four point something, probably.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.317
That sounds, like, around--

00:59:50.317 --> 00:59:50.900
MELISSA: Sure.

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.785
TARA WHITSITT: Any other questions?

00:59:58.785 --> 01:00:01.118
PIA SORENSEN: You're going
to stay here all night, Tara.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.380
AUDIENCE: Follow up with the scaling up.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.220
If you wanted to
produce it commercially,

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.386
let's say you came up with this great
blend of vegetables that tasted great.

01:00:13.386 --> 01:00:16.720
And you wanted to produce it in bulk.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.910
Is there a challenge with
using larger vessels?

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.520
Does it scale well, the fermentation?

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.582
TARA WHITSITT: Is there a challenge
with using larger vessels?

01:00:25.582 --> 01:00:26.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:29.313
Like if you were just to use the same
recipe and just use a bigger vessel.

01:00:29.313 --> 01:00:32.300
Does that change the
fermentation usually?

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.710
TARA WHITSITT: I mean, there
are a lot of different ways

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:37.370
to produce on large scales.

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:40.480
I've visited a lot of
facilities all over the country,

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.200
and everyone has kind of their
different ways that they do it.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:50.300
But I mean, ultimately, if you
have enough cabbage and manpower,

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.000
the right tools- I mean,
obviously, you want something

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.035
to be able to really get in
and massage your cabbage.

01:00:57.035 --> 01:00:58.960
You usually want a big bucket.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.490
Some people use Hobarts.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:04.450
If you're familiar with the
Hobart, it's a baking tool.

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:10.090
So you actually have a big bucket,
and then-- it's for mixing dough.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:13.910
So you would put your cabbage in and
your salt in, and you would mix it up.

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:17.230
And then you can just pour
that into your barrel.

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:23.110
The most common barrel in
commercial fermentation

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:28.930
right now is food-grade
plastic, 55-gallon barrel.

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.250
Some people use stainless steel, too.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:35.710
Stainless steel is much more expensive.

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:38.480
And some smaller producers use crocs.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.390
And they're realizing
very quickly that they

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.120
want to get food-grade plastic barrels.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.690
So there are a lot of options.

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:49.530
But you have to consider
how big do you want to be?

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:55.880
How far do you want to
supply your food to?

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.603
Did that answer the-- cool.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.720
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious how much
of the massaging process that we're

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.740
observing now is just to extract
the water and how much of it

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:15.700
is-- are we also trying to break down
some of the cell structure or something

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.230
or tenderize it in a way?

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:21.300
Or is it just about
getting out the water?

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.010
TARA WHITSITT: You
know, it's really just

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:29.290
to extract the water, to
get the brine to come forth.

01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:34.220
The difference in, say,
texture that occurs

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:41.960
from how much massaging
happens-- you know, I actually

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.086
have never noticed a
difference in texture.

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:55.120
I've had some people who were,
like, really crazy, like rawr!

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.500
Just getting in there.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.442
And it was some of the
crispiest kraut I ever had.

01:03:01.442 --> 01:03:02.900
And I was really surprised by that.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.130
I thought it would be mushy
'cause he was, like, so into it.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.745
And I was like, whoa, buddy.

01:03:07.745 --> 01:03:11.350
You're like really squeezing that kraut.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:17.729
So, yeah, it's kind of just
to get the brine to come out.

01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:19.270
AUDIENCE: And then maybe a follow up.

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:22.816
Is there any danger of things exploding?

01:03:22.816 --> 01:03:24.327
Do you have to think about that?

01:03:24.327 --> 01:03:25.160
TARA WHITSITT: Yeah.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:30.220
So that is why my method for
keeping dust and bugs out

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.740
is the tea towel and rubber band.

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:38.230
If you were to keep
something on airtight,

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.670
there's the possibility of an explosion.

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:42.940
It would take a really long time.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.500
If you're working with
something like kombucha or water

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:52.010
kefir, which actually produces
CO2 at a much more rapid rate,

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:53.620
then you'd be in trouble.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:04:02.410
But sauerkraut, most vegetable ferments,
it's a very gradual CO2 buildup.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.900
So you'll rarely have
to worry about that.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:10.460
But you'll definitely-- if it's
airtight, you'll want to burp it.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:13.890
It's good to burp it
at least once a week.

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.260
So yeah.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.060
But this will help.

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:24.204
AUDIENCE: If you wanted to make kimchi,
what would you add to that mixture?

01:04:24.204 --> 01:04:25.120
TARA WHITSITT: Kimchi?

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:35.240
So kimchi is it's very similar
to the kraut-making process.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.960
However, you usually
integrate Asian cabbage

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:46.000
of some sort, usually bok choy or napa
cabbage, and then root vegetables,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.700
as well.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.740
Onion is popular as an addition.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.730
And then you make a paste.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:59.790
And that paste is ginger, garlic,
chili powder, and fish sauce.

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.520
This is the traditional style paste.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:07.210
Obviously, there are a lot of
vegetarian versions of kimchi.

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:14.250
And in that case, you can
substitute tamari for fish sauce.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.560
Or you could just omit the fish sauce.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.878
But it's mostly the paste
that makes it uniquely kimchi

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:24.378
and the addition of root vegetables.

01:05:27.801 --> 01:05:28.300
Great.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.730
So we packed this down.

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.710
Did everyone see on the screen
that it was below the brine?

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.180
Should we-- oh, yeah.

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:45.150
You can see it right there.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.780
So let's just do a little.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.395
I just want to show.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:15.425
I want the shot of-- it's hard
when you have to lean it over,

01:06:15.425 --> 01:06:19.630
because then all the brine
just runs to the underside.

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:20.950
So you can't see it.

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:26.770
And now, can anyone see from over there?

01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:27.920
Of course, you can't.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.975
That's way too far.

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:36.800
But anyway, these cabbage leaves are
really great for kind of-- I mean,

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:43.290
so one thing they do is they're durable.

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:49.300
So you can actually kind of
just push them down in there,

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:53.680
and they'll hold against
the walls of the jar.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.410
And the brine will stay
above the chopped cabbage.

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:09.035
And then, if any mold does grow, you can
simply take the moldy cabbage leaf off

01:07:09.035 --> 01:07:10.990
and compost it.

01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:15.770
And so that's one nice aspect of
using cabbage leaves as a top layer.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:19.840
I learned this from a
woman in Mississippi who

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.950
grew up making sauerkraut in Bavaria.

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:23.510
She's Bavarian.

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:24.790
And she was like, oh, yeah.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.706
This is the method we
used when we were young.

01:07:26.706 --> 01:07:28.970
And I've used it ever since.

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:32.651
And this was, like, February, 2014.

01:07:32.651 --> 01:07:34.650
So I've been doing it
like this for a long time.

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.790
And it's pretty no-fail.

01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:41.180
If you're concerned about
getting any mold growth,

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.670
those leaves will catch the mold
before your sauerkraut does.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:56.820
And again, how long do we leave it?

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.560
This is why it's great
to ferment at home.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.150
You can ferment it for a week if
that's how long you like it at.

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.980
It will be mild.

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:12.050
You can ferment it for three
weeks, and it will be tangier.

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.770
And if you like it that way, great.

01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:19.200
But it's really, really
good practice to,

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.200
in maintaining your
sauerkraut, just once a week,

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.713
take the leaves off, take a taste.

01:08:25.713 --> 01:08:30.490
If you're like, yeah, that's nice, but
not my thing, then pack it back in.

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:32.720
Let it sit longer.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.029
And then taste it the next
week, and then the next.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.990
So it's kind of nice
just to practice getting

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:45.790
to know your sauerkraut, its movements,
and at what stage you really like it.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:57.149
Another question I get a lot is how
much fermented food should I eat?

01:08:57.149 --> 01:09:04.190
And that question, I mean, it
really varies from person to person.

01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:09.689
I mean, if you've never eaten fermented
foods, if it's really new to your diet,

01:09:09.689 --> 01:09:14.630
I really recommend that people
just use it as a condiment,

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:17.380
like dress your foods with it.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:24.075
And it's not like you have to eat
kombucha and then sauerkraut and yogurt

01:09:24.075 --> 01:09:26.020
and kefir to make sure
that you're getting

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.276
this whole balance of microorganisms.

01:09:28.276 --> 01:09:31.660
It's kind of like,
yeah, you can mix it up.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:36.800
But it's not that you won't get
a full probiotic diet if you

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.710
omit one of those things one day.

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:47.700
It's totally about kind of trusting your
body, like anyone's journey with food

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:54.170
and becoming just aware of what
your body likes to consume.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:59.140
And I eat sauerkraut,
like, out of the jar,

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:03.940
as a large side with my eggs in
the morning or with everything.

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.330
Kimchi, too.

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.970
But I'm totally-- my
body is, like, really,

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:13.880
super adjusted to fermented vegetables.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.580
So, yeah.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.150
That's my spiel.

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:18.035
I hope you all like it.

01:10:18.035 --> 01:10:19.660
PIA SORENSEN: So how about we all clap?

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.760
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.110
TARA WHITSITT: Thanks.
