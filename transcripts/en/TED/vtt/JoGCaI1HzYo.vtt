00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.750
Imagine that you're a member of Congress.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.315
You've worked very hard.

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:22.188
You've knocked on thousands of doors,

00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:25.225
sweating and shivering,
depending on the season.

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:27.048
You've made hundreds,

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:31.668
maybe thousands of phone calls
to people you don't even know

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:33.840
asking for their support,

00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:35.159
begging for their money.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:38.055
And now you've got one of these.

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:40.815
It's hanging on a door in Washington, DC.

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:43.469
It says you're a member of Congress,

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:45.709
that you represent
the people of your state.

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:52.337
Now, imagine you're a conservative
member of Congress.

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:55.553
For some of you here
in Boston, Massachusetts,

00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:58.158
that's going to take
a powerful imagination, all right?

00:00:58.182 --> 00:00:59.238
(Laughter)

00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:02.032
But imagine with me

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:05.194
that you're a conservative
member of Congress.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.422
You grew up on Milton Friedman.

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:09.875
You love his free markets,

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.155
free enterprise and free trade.

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:18.213
You've watched Ronald Reagan's
farewell address over and over,

00:01:18.237 --> 00:01:20.527
and you cry every time --

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.672
(Laughter)

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:25.683
he gets to the part about
the shining city on the hill,

00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:28.684
and how if the city had to have walls,

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:30.890
the walls had doors --

00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:34.411
doors to let in those yearning
to breathe free.

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:40.242
You get goosebumps when you think
of him telling Mr. Gorbachev

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.646
to tear down his wall.

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:46.714
You're a conservative member of Congress,

00:01:46.738 --> 00:01:49.656
and you agree with President
John F. Kennedy

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.262
that America is an exceptional place.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:54.915
For inspiration,

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.060
you go to YouTube and you watch
his speech at Rice University,

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:01.553
September of 1962,

00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:03.002
the "moon shot" speech.

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:08.039
And you're amazed
that he admits in that speech --

00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:12.293
a speech of 17 minutes of pure
American exceptionalism --

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.442
that some of the materials
needed for the spacecraft

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.039
hadn't been invented yet.

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:21.084
No matter.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.673
We're going to the Moon
before the decade is out.

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:27.228
You agree with him

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:30.522
that the vows of this nation
can be fulfilled

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:33.750
only if we in this nation are first

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:37.202
and therefore we intend to be first.

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:42.270
You've taken as your own
the affect that he so embodied:

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:46.291
that when leaders are optimistic,

00:02:46.315 --> 00:02:50.320
they're saying they believe
in the people they represent.

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:54.612
You're a conservative member of Congress,

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:57.270
and you believe
in the precautionary principle.

00:02:58.084 --> 00:03:00.766
You believe in data-driven analysis.

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:05.504
You know that climate change is real
and human-caused,

00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:08.545
and you see in climate change

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.092
a silent and slow-moving Sputnik moment.

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:17.142
One that calls for
the greatness of your nation

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:20.441
as much as the original Sputnik moment.

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.822
You are a conservative member of Congress.

00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:28.923
You high-five the memory of Jack Kemp,

00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:31.014
and believe with him

00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:34.828
that the test of conservatism
is that it works for everyone,

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:36.468
regardless of skin color.

00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:39.885
You're appalled by the alt-right.

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:47.136
You want them to have nothing to do
with your brand, your party, your legacy.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.190
You utterly reject them.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.421
You --

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:56.501
(Applause)

00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:58.516
You're a conservative member of Congress.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.246
You rise with compassion
to protect the lives of the unborn,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.302
but otherwise you think
the bedroom of consenting adults

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:09.146
is a rather strange place
for the government to be.

00:04:09.677 --> 00:04:13.293
You are a conservative member of Congress.

00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:18.077
With John Adams,

00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:19.495
you fear the mob.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.434
Because you know, as he knew,

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:24.459
that a mob is not able to protect liberty,

00:04:24.483 --> 00:04:25.782
not even its own.

00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:30.458
And you're amazed at the wisdom
that he and other framers had

00:04:30.482 --> 00:04:35.035
in establishing a slow,
deliberative governing process --

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.427
an inherently conservative
governing process.

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:40.428
It would serve a country.

00:04:40.452 --> 00:04:44.511
It would grow far greater
than they could ever imagine.

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:48.114
You are a conservative member of Congress.

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:55.402
You fear the fire of populist nationalism,

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:58.141
because you know
that those who play with fire

00:04:58.165 --> 00:04:59.512
can't control it.

00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:02.401
You see their pitchforks and torches,

00:05:02.425 --> 00:05:05.889
and you know they're not
good building tools.

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:11.849
The pitchforks and torches can tear down
and burn up but they can't build up.

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:16.452
They can't build up
the institutions and the communities

00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:21.318
so necessary to a stable
and prosperous country.

00:05:22.496 --> 00:05:25.645
You're a conservative member of Congress,

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.470
and you fear the next
county party convention.

00:05:31.692 --> 00:05:36.137
You so wish for your party
to be the grand opportunity party,

00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.240
not the grumpy old party.

00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:39.644
(Laughter)

00:05:40.253 --> 00:05:45.809
You know that they want
to hear from you some old saw

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.754
about how a secret Muslim, non-American
socialist took over in the White House

00:05:49.778 --> 00:05:51.262
and destroyed the country,

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.598
and you know that none of that's true.

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:59.774
(Applause)

00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:06.499
You know that they want to hear your say
that you're OK with insults,

00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:10.325
OK with "lock her up" chants

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.844
and OK with policy pronouncements

00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:18.416
with all the sincerity and thoughtfulness
that 140 characters can muster.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.598
You are a conservative member of Congress.

00:06:22.968 --> 00:06:28.310
You realize that many in your party
look to some good old days

00:06:28.334 --> 00:06:30.122
that you know never existed.

00:06:31.102 --> 00:06:33.237
They hold on, for example,

00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:37.267
to the fossils that fueled
the last century of growth,

00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:42.833
but you know that better, cleaner
more abundant fuels await us,

00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:48.191
and you know that that abundance
can lead the world to more energy,

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:49.810
more mobility

00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:51.114
and more freedom.

00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:54.426
You're a conservative member of Congress.

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.863
You realize that many in your party
pine for the '50s and the '60s

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:03.399
because those were, after all,
the good old days.

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:08.226
But you know that the Cuyahoga River
was on fire back then.

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:11.222
You know that in Pittsburgh,

00:07:11.246 --> 00:07:15.508
street lights came on at noon
because of the soot in the air.

00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:17.641
The schools were segregated,

00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:19.285
neighborhoods redlined,

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:21.096
that communism threatened freedom,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.494
and if you got cancer,
you weren't likely to fight for long.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.949
You're a conservative member of Congress

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:33.946
and you want to sound like JFK at Rice,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.294
where JFK said, "It's understandable

00:07:38.318 --> 00:07:40.895
why some would have us stay where we are

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.355
a little bit longer,

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.371
to wait and to rest."

00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:48.962
But everything within you says with him,

00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:50.674
this city of Houston,

00:07:50.698 --> 00:07:52.313
this state of Texas,

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:57.886
this country of the United States
was not built by those who waited

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.787
and rested and wished to look behind them.

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:02.619
You are ready to lead.

00:08:03.012 --> 00:08:07.076
You are ready to prove
the power of free enterprise

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.426
to solve challenges like climate change.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.169
You are ready to lead.

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:16.977
So I've got a suggestion for you then:

00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:18.151
lead ...

00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:19.907
now.

00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:21.606
Step out,

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.836
step up.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.985
You know, we ask America's best

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:31.065
to die on literal hills

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:33.609
in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:40.131
Is it too much to ask you
to die a figurative death

00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:42.920
on a political hill in Washington, DC?

00:08:44.318 --> 00:08:47.605
You know, at the end
of your time in Washington,

00:08:47.629 --> 00:08:49.920
they're going to take
this plaque off the door.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.468
They're going to hand it to you;

00:08:52.492 --> 00:08:54.218
you're going to go home with it.

00:08:54.875 --> 00:09:00.447
Can you imagine the emptiness
of knowing that you stood for nothing,

00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:03.036
that you risk nothing,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.525
that all you did was follow fearful people
to where they were already going

00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:11.021
rather than trying to lead
them to a better place?

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:15.438
If you're not willing
to lose your seat in Congress,

00:09:15.462 --> 00:09:18.013
there's really very little
reason to be there.

00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:25.413
(Applause)

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.244
So here's the thing:

00:09:30.268 --> 00:09:32.183
it's not too late.

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.909
There's still time to lead.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.110
Speak out,

00:09:38.134 --> 00:09:39.539
speak up,

00:09:39.563 --> 00:09:42.248
call lunacy what it is:

00:09:42.272 --> 00:09:43.432
lunacy.

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:49.222
Tell the American people
that we still have moon shots in us.

00:09:50.098 --> 00:09:52.768
Tell the folks at the county
party convention,

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.804
"You bet free enterprise
can solve climate change."

00:09:55.828 --> 00:10:01.728
Tell them that Milton Friedman
would say to tax pollution

00:10:01.752 --> 00:10:03.365
rather than profits.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.632
Tell them that it's OK --

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:09.057
no, it's a good thing

00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:11.054
that progressives would agree.

00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:17.738
Tell them the very good news
that we can bring America together

00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:21.143
to solve these challenges
and to lead the world.

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:26.612
Tell them that free enterprise
can do these things.

00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:31.406
Tell them that America
must stop the dividing,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.157
and must start the uniting.

00:10:34.143 --> 00:10:35.409
Tell them.

00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:39.501
Play your part before it's too late.

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:42.056
(Applause)

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.231
Thank you very much.

00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:46.944
(Applause)
