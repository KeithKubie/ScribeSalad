GUY KAWASAKI: Good afternoon.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.290
My name is Guy
Kawasaki, and I am

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.210
a resident of Silicon Valley.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.010
I have a long history.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.940
I'm pretty old.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.610
Many of you may know of
me from this context.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.640
So I was Apple's second
software evangelist.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.880
So I am here today
to talk to you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.810
about the art of evangelism.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.150
It's something that I learned
in the Macintosh division,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.620
as well as an entrepreneur, and
as a chief evangelist of Canva.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.120
So these are the
skills that I would

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.100
like to pass on to
you so that you can,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.580
in the words of Steve
Jobs, "dent the universe,"

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.830
make the world a better place.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.830
For those of you who have seen
a lot of high tech speakers,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.230
I think you'll relate to this.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.910
There are two
fundamental qualities

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.360
of most high tech speakers.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.260
First, almost all of them suck.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.500
And second, almost
all of them go long.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.720
And that is a
deadly combination.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.810
If you suck, and
you go long, wow.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.790
If you suck, and
you're short, OK.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460
If you're great,
and you're long, OK.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.380
But sucking and going
long, bad combination.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.730
Double whammy.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.540
And so what I do is I use a
top 10 format for my speeches.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.550
So I have 10 key points for you.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.920
So in case you think I
suck, you know approximately

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.140
how much longer I'll suck
because I have exactly 10

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.670
points for you, OK?

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.240
So point number one,
and I think this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.600
is the key to marketing and
engineering, and therefore,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.860
evangelism.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.470
By the way, "evangelism"
comes from Greek terminology,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.640
or Greek words, meaning
"bringing the good news."

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.640
So as a Macintosh evangelist,
as a Canva evangelist,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.250
I was bringing the
good news of Macintosh,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.860
or Macintosh would make people
more creative and productive,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.710
Canva enables you to
create great graphics.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.060
And so by bringing
the good news,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.630
I learned that this is the most
important concept in marketing.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.630
If you can get this
concept, game over.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.660
It's all you need.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.880
So it is a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.789
The horizontal axis is
the value of your product.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.430
The vertical axis is
the uniqueness or degree

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.840
of differentiation
of your product.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.690
So we'll go through
all four corners.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.370
On the bottom right-hand
corner, that's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.130
where you have something that's
valuable, but it is not unique.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.440
So it's useful, it's
just not unique.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.100
It is Michael Dell slapping
the same version of Windows

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.420
on the same hardware.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.040
You can make a lot
of money there,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.010
but it's always about price.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.190
In the opposite corner, you have
something that's truly unique,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.930
but it is not valuable.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.800
It is useless.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.730
In that corner, you
are just plain stupid.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.950
In the bottom left-hand
corner, you are stupid,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.190
and it's crowded with
other stupid people.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.450
That bottom left corner, I
like to cite the dot-com days.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.490
In particular, pets.com.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.470
So pets.com, let's
reminisce about pets.com.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.680
In pets.com, you would
buy dog food online.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.890
And the proposition
of pets.com was

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.260
that now we can
sell you direct, we

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.750
can eliminate the
retail distribution

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.950
channel, discount dog food.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.060
So yes, you discount
dog food, but then you

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.530
have to add back
shipping and handling.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.470
So the reason why pets.com
wasn't that valuable

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.400
was because, yes, you
discounted it at the top line,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.900
but then you had to add
back shipping and handling,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.700
because you had to get
the dead cow in the can

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.170
to the dog owner.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.590
And also, somebody had to be
at home when UPS dropped off

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.703
the dead cow in the can.

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:37.620
If you weren't there,
it left you a little tag

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.170
that said, "We attempted to drop
off the dead cow in the can.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.800
No one was home.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.870
We're going to attempt to drop
off the dead cow in the can

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.590
tomorrow.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.048
If no one's home
again, we're going

00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:47.800
to send the dead cow in the
can back to the factory."

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.760
So it was inconvenient
and just as expensive.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.670
Why was pets.com in
such a crowded market?

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.470
It's because people
in Silicon Valley,

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.710
like me, fell for this pitch.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.937
Never use a pitch
along these lines, OK?

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:03.270
There are 300 million Americans.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.500
1 in 4 owns a dog.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.880
75 million dogs.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.310
Each dog eats two cans
of dog food per day.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.090
Total addressable market of
150 million cans of dog food

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.020
per day.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.670
And dog food is
not a B2B business.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.519
It's not a five day
a week business,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.779
Monday through Friday.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.730
Dogs eat every day.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.720
We're talking B2C, or
more accurately, B2D.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.160
Dogs eat everyday.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.490
So you take 150 million
cans of dog food per day,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.130
how hard could it be to
get 1% of that with my rock

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.050
star, programmer co-founder?

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.510
1% of 150 million cans
of dog food per day

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.130
is 1 and 1/2 million cans of
dog food per day, times 365.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.210
We're talking 500 or 600
million cans of dog food a year.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.620
That's why there was pets.com,
mypets.com, epets.com,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.920
peapodpets.com, webandpets.com.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.260
There were 16 ways to
buy dog food online.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.480
But the corner you
truly want to be in

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.190
is in the upper
right-hand corner.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.180
So whether you wear an
engineering hat or a marketing

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.420
hat, that's where the action is.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.980
With Canva, we're
trying to create

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.970
something that's powerful,
easy to use, and cheap--

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.610
the holy grail of
creating graphics.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.900
Macintosh was in that
upper right-hand corner.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.770
It was the first computer
that mere mortals could use.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.530
When iPod first came
out, it was the only way

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.120
you could get a lot of music
legally and inexpensively.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.730
Breitling makes a watch
called a Breitling Emergency.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.610
And if you unscrew the big
knob at the 5 o'clock position,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.040
it starts broadcasting
an emergency signal.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.920
That emergency signal
is caught by planes.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.963
If you pull that thing out,
and you set this alarm off,

00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:43.380
next thing you
know, Kevin Costner

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.360
is in the Coast Guard
helicopter in the basket,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.610
coming to rescue you.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.600
That's a watch that
can save your life.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.290
There are not many watches
that can save your life.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.330
Mercedes makes a smart car.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.420
All of us have cars that can
park parallel to the curb.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.750
How many of us have cars
that can park perpendicular

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.310
to the curb?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.910
So I think this explains most of
evangelism and marketing, which

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.770
is make a product that
is unique and valuable.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.650
If it's unique,
but not valuable,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.250
it'll always, always be stupid.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.620
If you are valuable,
but not unique,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.870
you always have to
compete on price.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.920
If you're not unique and not
valuable, you're just pathetic.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.260
You don't even
register on the radar.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.480
This is the holy
grail of evangelism--

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.110
getting in the upper right-hand
corner of this graph.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.920
Number two.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.220
Number two is my insight,
and it took me a long time

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.270
to figure this out--

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.952
you have to remove
all the speed bumps.

00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:43.410
I think that one
of the things that

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.150
gets in the way of
new product adoption

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.430
is that you get too
close to the product,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.300
and you think, oh, people won't
mind doing this kind of thing.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.690
They won't mind giving you their
credit card, even though you're

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.030
giving them a free account.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.990
They won't mind having to do
all kinds of rekeying of data

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.360
because our database
is so great.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.760
And these kinds of
speed bumps count.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.290
They are a terrible friction
upon new product adoption

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.510
and evangelism.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.570
A very good test for
this, by the way,

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.140
is not that you are willing
to go through with this.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.380
It's to give it to your
spouse or your parents,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.910
and say, sign up
for our service.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.760
See if you can do it.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.470
Remove the speed bumps.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.680
Number three.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.800
Number three is my
observation that if you

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.410
want to create a
great company today,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.620
you have to attack the
incumbents from below.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.900
For example, with Canva,
fundamentally, we're

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.940
competing with Adobe, right?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.670
So Adobe has Photoshop
and Illustrator.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.750
And so there are two strategies.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.600
One strategy would
be, well, you could

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.110
make something that's more
powerful than Photoshop,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.630
more powerful than Illustrator.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.270
That would be the go above them.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.190
I think the way to
attack an incumbent

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.860
is always to go
from beneath them--

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:08.430
so less powerful, simpler,
cheaper, easier to use.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.220
If you attack from below,
you can always move up.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.510
But if you attack from
above, you cannot move down.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:20.170
With Macintosh, we tried to
attack the IBM PC from below.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.200
We weren't trying to
make a computer more

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.050
powerful than the IBM PC.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.000
We were trying to make a
computer more easy, more

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.010
inexpensive, more fun to use.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.659
So my advice as you try
to attack the incumbents

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.780
is attack from below,
not from above.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.320
Number four.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.039
Number four is my
observation in evangelism

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.330
that you have to learn to ignore
people's titles and pedigrees.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.530
That just because they're
the CIO, CMO, CTO,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.510
CXO, just because they went to,
well, Yale in particular right

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.740
now, it doesn't mean that
they're competent or smart.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.020
And my observation
is that the higher

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.140
you go in most organizations,
the thinner the air.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.510
And the thinner the
air, the more difficult

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.340
it is to support
intelligent life.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.120
And so if you try to enter
an organization from the top,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.220
inevitably, you will be
dealing with the dumbest

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.650
people in the organization.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.050
Ignore people's
titles and pedigrees.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.330
When you are trying to
evangelize something,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.430
you don't care about their
titles and pedigrees.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.610
All you care about
is that they get it.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.080
There was no CIO or CTO
in a Fortune 500 company

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.390
that grokked Macintosh.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.570
It was always the graphic
designer, the artist,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.870
the photographer, the slide
maker, the presentation,

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.250
the newsletter maker.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.070
It was all the people at
the middles and the bottoms.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.570
Get in through the bottom.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.340
Get in through the middle.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.190
Ignore people's
titles and pedigrees.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.880
Number five.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.080
Number five is you have
to learn to suck up.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.680
It is a fact of life
that you have to suck up.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.390
Just deal with that.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.250
Don't be proud.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.960
You have to suck up to be in
the featured at the Play Store.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.980
You have to suck up to be
featured at the Apple Store.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.370
You have to be sucking
up to get in the Start

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.450
on Android program.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.730
It's a cost of doing business.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.050
Get over it.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.300
It's worth it.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.380
At one point, I was running
the Apple Developer channel,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.020
so I was on the opposite
side of this discussion.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.630
And we would run
co-marketing with developers.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.980
And you know what?

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.750
We worked with the
people that we liked.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.240
They had to have good
products, don't get me wrong.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.550
But it was people who wanted
our help, who were nice to us.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.810
It wasn't just because
they had a great product.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.500
And I learned a very
humbling and important lesson

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.460
that, sometimes, in life,
you just have to suck up.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.050
Because, man, being on the
front page of an app store

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.780
can make your product succeed.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.520
So get over it.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.590
Learn to suck up.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.820
Number six.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.180
Number six is to learn
to niche thyself.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.350
I think many people,
when they look

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.910
at a company, a
successful company,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.460
they forget the first
20 years of the company.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.360
So you look at something
like Microsoft or Apple,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.530
and you say, wow, look at Apple.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.330
They have hardware.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.122
They have software.

00:11:24.122 --> 00:11:25.760
They have applications.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.420
They have content.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.340
Look at Microsoft.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.370
They have hardware,
software, gaming.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.160
They have cloud.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.240
They have everything.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.950
And so we need a grand plan.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:34.670
Look at Google.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.080
They have Search.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.190
They have Analytics.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.480
They have cars.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.930
They have blocks of salt
that's going to store energy.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.090
They have ways to count
fish in fish farms.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.710
They have everything.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.330
And so there's
this grand scheme.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.270
So you're two guys in a garage,
two gals in a garage, a guy

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.920
and a gal in a
garage, and you think,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.500
we're going to be like Google,
and Microsoft, and Apple.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.305
So someday, we need
an operating system.

00:11:56.305 --> 00:11:56.930
We need an app.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:57.590
We need hardware.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:58.340
We need software.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.540
We need cloud.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.100
We need e-commerce.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.230
We need the whole thing.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.850
That's not how it works.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.920
I think the way it works is
you own one niche at a time.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.580
You get one niche, and
then you get another niche,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.230
and then you get another niche.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.290
And one day, you wake
up, and my god, you

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.600
have achieved
worldwide domination.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.960
It is not because you planned
for worldwide domination.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.430
It is because, to use
a bowling pin analogy,

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.970
you knocked over one pin, and
then another pin, and then

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.900
another pin.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.050
And then you turned around,
and one day, you had a strike.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.040
But it wasn't because you had
all those pins knocked down

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.300
on one ball.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.500
You took them down
one at a time.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.245
A very good academic
orientation for this,

00:12:47.245 --> 00:12:49.620
or explanation of this,
is "Crossing the Chasm"

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.090
by Geoffrey Moore.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.710
I highly recommend that book--

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.840
"Crossing the Chasm"
by Geoffrey Moore.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.090
The point here is niche thyself.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.460
Go after one niche, then
another, and another,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.390
and another.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.800
And wake up and declare victory
with worldwide domination.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.760
Number seven.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.550
Number seven is stolen
from Chairman Mao,

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.530
though I fail to see how he
ever implemented this, which is,

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.480
"Let 100 flowers blossom."

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.120
And by this, I mean
when you have innovated,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.330
when you have
shipped your product,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.930
you take your best shot at
positioning and branding.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.320
With Macintosh, we thought we
had a spreadsheet, database,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.000
and word processing machine.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.540
Basically, we were 0
for 3 in the mid-'80s.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.880
People weren't embracing
Macintosh for spreadsheet,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.650
database, or word processing.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:41.240
They embraced Macintosh
for desktop publishing.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.150
Desktop publishing was a
gift from God to Apple.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.350
It saved Apple.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.478
Without desktop publishing,
there would be no Apple today.

00:13:48.478 --> 00:13:51.020
I believe in God, and one of
the reasons why I believe in God

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.170
is there is no other explanation
for Apple's continued

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.040
survival than a benevolent God.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.890
So God gave Apple PageMaker.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.500
And PageMaker created
a field of flowers

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.300
called desktop publishing.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.530
But you know what?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:11.240
We were focusing on spreadsheet,
database, and word processor,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.370
not desktop publishing.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:15.600
A more analog example.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.117
Suppose you work for
Avon, the CMO of Avon.

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:20.200
And you have this product.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.110
It's called Skin So Soft.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.280
What's the purpose
of Skin So Soft?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.040
You don't need a PhD
to figure this out.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.840
Skin So Soft is about beauty,
and hope, and lusciousness,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.850
and all that good,
aesthetic stuff.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.880
And then you find out that
moms are buying Skin So

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.040
Soft as an insect repellent.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.500
OMG.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.210
This was not your intent.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:47.670
Your positioning was not "better
for your children than DDT."

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.350
That was not the plan.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.567
But I'll tell you something.

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:51.150
You know what?

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:57.870
If moms want to buy Skin So
Soft for their children's insect

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.280
repellent--

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.840
hallelujah.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.970
Declare victory.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.590
If people want to use Canva for
things that we never intended--

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.850
hallelujah.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.230
Declare victory.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.240
For those of you not
from Silicon Valley,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.690
let me explain something to you.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.240
The way it works
in Silicon Valley

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.260
is we throw a lot of
things against the wall.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.160
A very few number stick.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.870
Then we go up to
the wall, and we

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.540
paint the bullseye around
it, and we declare victory.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.970
We hit the bullseye.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.150
You can always hit the bullseye
if you paint the bullseye

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.930
after you see what sticks, OK?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.240
Let 100 flowers blossom.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.368
Don't be proud.

00:15:37.368 --> 00:15:39.160
You think you have a
spreadsheet, database,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.620
and word processing machine?

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.800
Come to find you have a
desktop publishing machine?

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.940
Hallelujah.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.140
Declare victory.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.790
We intended Macintosh to be
a desktop publishing machine.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.650
Let 100 flowers blossom.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.303
Number eight.

00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:55.720
Number eight is
the hardest lesson

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.840
to learn for any evangelist,
which is churn, baby, churn.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.060
It means that you take
version 1 of your product

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.810
and make it 1.1, 1.2,
1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.0.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.550
Oh my god.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.040
I used to think that a
revolution at innovation

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.440
was an event.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.540
It's not an event.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.800
It is a process.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.770
It's one of the hardest
things to learn.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.250
Because you think you ship, and
then your biggest problem will

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.400
be, can you scale fast enough?

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.350
A few times in my
career, I would like

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.930
to have that as my problem.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.140
Can we scale fast enough?

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.260
Scaling fast enough is
not usually the problem.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.220
The problem is usually,
can we get the dogs

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.210
to eat the food at all?

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.500
Churn, baby, churn.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.660
It's great discipline.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.620
Number nine.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.120
Number nine is that it is very
important to build an ecosystem

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.000
if you truly want
to achieve success,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.890
because an ecosystem will do
things that you don't want

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.870
to do, you cannot do, maybe
you shouldn't even do.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.840
Imagine Android without you.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.710
Imagine iOS without
the iOS developers.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.750
Imagine all the
software companies

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.250
without their dealers, and their
VARs, and their consultants,

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.319
and all that kind of stuff.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.240
If you're a restaurant,
is it just the food?

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.990
Or is it also the
relationship with the waiters

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.450
and the waitresses,
with the valet company,

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:28.860
with the organic farms, with
the totality of the community?

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.330
Build an ecosystem.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.980
An ecosystem will rescue you.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.370
An ecosystem will do
things that you cannot do,

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.190
you should not do,
you don't want to do.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.930
Part of the technical
ramifications

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.290
of building an ecosystem
is you always have APIs

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.630
and you have documentation.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.280
When Apple announced
the iPhone in 2007,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.640
the first version of the iPhone
was a closed architecture.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.280
You could only add
functionality to the iPhone

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.440
by creating Safari plugins.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.740
A year later, Apple
completely reversed itself

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.050
and made it possible
to make native apps,

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.540
and the rest is history.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.230
If we had stuck
with a closed system

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.760
and not had a iOS ecosystem, I
think iPhone would have failed.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.160
The key is to
build an ecosystem.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.710
You are part of the
Android ecosystem.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:26.050
Also, build an ecosystem
for your product.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.170
Number 10.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.230
Number 10 is you have to
learn to ignore naysayers.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.150
Evangelists selling
dreams are always

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.300
going to encounter naysayers.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.860
There are two kinds of
naysayers in the world.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.200
I call them bozos, OK?

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.780
There are two kinds
of bozos in the world.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.330
One kind of bozo is
slovenly, disgusting,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:51.310
pocket-protector, Japanese
watch, rusty car, a loser.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.890
You look at that person,
you say, you are a loser.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.190
That bozo is not dangerous
because only losers

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.620
listen to losers.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.040
The dangerous bozo
is the winner bozo.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.490
The winner bozo dresses
in all-black, which

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.040
I'm free to say that today.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.770
The winner bozo is
rich and famous.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.320
The winner bozo is well-known.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.860
And many people think that
rich and famous equals smart.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:24.040
Rich and famous, 50% of the
time, equals lucky, not smart.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.770
If rich and famous always
parsed to smart, arguably,

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.330
we would listen to Kanye West
about constitutional law, Tom

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.270
Cruise about spirituality,
Kim Kardashian about how

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.610
to travel in France safely.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.570
You cannot make this assumption
that rich and famous equals

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.680
smart.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.810
So I need to inoculate you
because I think that bozosity

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.430
is just like the flu.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.680
How do you fight
bozosity and naysaying?

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.530
You get a little bit
of it in your life

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.020
so that when you encounter it in
your career as an entrepreneur,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.910
as an employee,
when you encounter

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.390
big flu, big bozosity, big
saying, big negativity,

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.600
big stupidity, you've
built up the resistance.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.910
So I have one
example here for you.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.410
"There is no reason
why anyone would

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.870
want a computer in their home."

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.303
Ken Olsen, founder of DEC.

00:20:15.303 --> 00:20:16.720
Many of you are
too young to know,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.900
but DEC was an extremely
successful minicomputer

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.430
company.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:27.190
And so Ken Olsen was an
extremely successful innovator,

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.750
revolutionary.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.560
He changed the
face of computing.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.870
We went from mainframe to mini
because of Ken Olsen and DEC.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:42.790
So imagine you're Steve
and Woz, Larry and Sergey,

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.320
and someone says
to you, you know,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.970
you need some adult supervision.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.280
You need someone who's
been there and done

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.330
that, someone who's built a
hardware company, had to scale,

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.330
had to encounter all
these challenges.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.000
Someone like Ken
Olsen, Steve and Woz.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.800
Go talk to Ken Olsen.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.910
Get him to invest.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.280
Get him to be a director.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.220
Get him to be an advisor.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.090
So let's just say you get
in an elevator one day,

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.150
and there he is,
Ken freaking Olsen.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.190
And you say to Mr. Olsen,
you know, Mr. Olsen,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.010
we have a different
vision for computing.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.710
We think that computers
should be small, and cheap,

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.120
and easy to use.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.260
Small, and cheap, and easy.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.930
So small, so cheap,
so easy to use,

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.590
Mr. Olsen, that you could have
a computer in your house, Mr.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.110
Olsen.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:33.280
And Mr. Olsen says, son,
let me tell you something--

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.160
"There is no reason
why anyone would want

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.580
a computer in their house."

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.000
Let's say they wanted to
balance their checkbook.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.300
They will get in their car,
drive back to the office,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.200
and use Quicken, running
on a DEC minicomputer.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.850
What's the problem?

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:57.610
So before you ruin your
life, learn COBOL or FORTRAN,

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.890
and come work for DEC.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.310
And there would
be no Apple today.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:09.410
So I'm trying to tell you that
overcoming bozosity, overcoming

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.530
negativity, is a big
challenge, because it often

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.740
comes from people that you
think you should respect,

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.820
and they know what
they're doing.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.410
I'm not saying that everybody
who tells you you'll fail

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.970
is wrong.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.550
Frankly, most of the
time, they'll be right.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:30.080
But if you always listen to
those people and never try,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.500
you will never know.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.470
And that is the
worst outcome of all.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.040
"There's no reason
why anyone would

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.040
want a computer in their home."

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.050
And this is my last slide.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.500
This is my last slide
because I think that this

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.690
should be your mantra.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.850
This is how you should
approach your life

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.450
if you're an entrepreneur,
an innovator,

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.370
in the tech business.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.790
Most of the time, when you see
this, it's the opposite way.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:03.290
Some things need to be
seen to be believed.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:07.070
If you show me a Macintosh,
if you show me an Android,

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.600
if you show me iOS, if you
show me Canva, if you show me

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.600
Privy, when you have millions
of users of all these products,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.200
that's when I'll believe it.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.260
That's not how the world
works in innovation.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.370
The world works like this.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.430
If you believe in
Macintosh, if you

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.350
will create products
for Macintosh,

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.270
if you believe in
Android, and you'll

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:33.110
create products for Android,
if you believe in Canva

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.440
and start creating graphics,
if you believe in Privy

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.520
and start creating
a social network,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.380
because of the ecosystem,
because of the installed base,

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.340
because of the use of it,
then it'll become true,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.520
and you will truly,
truly see it.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.240
Some things need to be
believed to be seen.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.790
So the art of evangelism
is all about getting

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.640
into that upper
right-hand corner, right?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.240
You want something
unique and valuable.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.720
You're going to need to suck up.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.730
Come to grips with that.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.850
You're going to need to
reduce all the friction.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.970
Make it so easy to sign up.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:23.580
Imagine if you're an
evangelist for the environment.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.000
You have the Sierra Club.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.730
You're in charge of
Sierra Club membership.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.230
And you said to
people, well, if you

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.020
want to be an evangelist
for the environment,

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.950
you have to donate
$10,000, or you

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.740
have to chain yourself
to a tree as loggers

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.760
are about to cut it down.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.880
You probably won't
get a lot of members.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.740
You say to someone
who wants to become

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.700
an evangelist for
the environment,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.610
take a shorter shower.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.700
Recycle your cans, and
bottles, and newspapers.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.870
You want to give them
a slippery slope.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.710
Suck them into your cause.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.030
Just remember, OK?

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.710
When all things
are said and done,

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:05.640
it is all about
spreading the good news.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.530
Good news that you make
people more creative,

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.800
more productive, that
you're denting the universe,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.420
that you're changing the world.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.850
I like to call this
Guy's Golden Touch.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.140
So Guy's Golden Touch is not
whatever I touch turns to gold.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.060
Oh, god, I wish that were true.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.360
I wish that were true.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.810
Guy's Golden Touch is
whatever is gold, Guy touches.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.760
So find something great.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.170
Find something great.

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.090
Reduce the friction.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.710
Learn to suck up.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.410
Get it into that upper
right-hand corner.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.390
Build an ecosystem around it.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.210
Don't take negativity.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.540
And change the world.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.810
And that's the
art of evangelism.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.990
Thank you very much.
