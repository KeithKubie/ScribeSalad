00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 As we age, we usually lose the limits of hearing 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.740
 So, how many of the following sounds can you hear? 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.000
 How old are your ears? 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.000
 Well, if you can hear the frequency of 8000 Hertz, you are certainly alive and not hearing impaired. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 But, to keep raising frequency. 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.735
 How far have you been able to hear? (Uploading video via YouTube is not at this frequency). 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.220
 If you can hear all those frequencies, you are probably under 20 years of age. 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.678
 But this will not last forever. 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.720
 Unlike other organs such as liver or skin. 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.900
 The inner ear does not have the ability to regenerate. 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.900
 In your ear thousands of small neurons are called "hair cells". 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.520
 These cells are responsible for capturing different frequencies and sending a signal to the brain 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.540
 They are treated, but as you age your constant exposure to noise and loud sounds 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.200
 May interrupt, discourage and destroy these cells 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.700
 So, why lose the ability to hear high frequencies first? 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.500
 It turned out that the hairs tuned to the high tones are the first to face sound waves. 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.100
 As a result, they are more stressed and tend to spoil early. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.740
 So the older you get, the weaker your hearing of high tones. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.020
