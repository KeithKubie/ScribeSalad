00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.220
As the crew of Seeker progresses on their expedition on to raise awareness for ocean health,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.660
they must brave rough weather and long hours of strenuous duties in tight quarters.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.320
Being on this boat is a bit like being in
a spaceship.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.780
What I miss the most from land is all the
sounds, all the smells, music in the streets,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.940
cars, voices of people that you don't know,
the smell of good food.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.290
The smell of cheese.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.900
All the fresh products.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.760
Members of the crew keep themselves 
sane with strict routines, secret snack stashes,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880
books, movies and games.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.880
But the games swimmer Ben Lecomte has designed for himself are much more than entertainment.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.960
They help keep his mind occupied through eight hours of swimming.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.540
It's not a game that I can teach to a person. It's hard to explain but it's using pictures

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.720
that represent to me some certain numbers
and making a series of numbers

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.600
that I remember by the pictures.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.860
When Ben swam the Atlantic in 1998, solitude and exertion took such a toll on him that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.940
he took a 6-day hiatus in the Azores.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.120
Now, with a bigger support crew and a family waiting for him at home,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.320
he's learned to lay out his thoughts for the like an outfit.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.140
I go back to the previous day and try
to focus on what went well

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.700
and what I could improve.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.499
Then after that first hour, when I am warm, I am at the right pace, and I will pick another subject up.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:50.299
My son never windsurfed, so for me, one
activity I would like to do with him is to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.260
teach him how to windsurf.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.320
I go through all the detail that will bring
me there and try to live that moment with them.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.320
Not only does Ben have these mental games, but he's also being watched closely by

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.620
machine learning specialist Eduardo Marques.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.520
I was wondering if we are able to understand
the balance between fatigue and performance.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.000
I want to understand which kind of variables
in terms of sociological, in terms of physiological,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.140
psychological and environmental affects
Ben's performance and Ben's fatigue.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.000
To get a baseline reading of his personality and anxiety levels, Ben took some initial

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.600
evaluations where he scored high 
on visualization and resilience.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.080
You can see that the cognitive scale is 17,
the somatic scale is 9.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.860
And the self confidence is 27.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.840
So Ben has more or less high level confidence,
and a low anxiety level so far.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.460
Every day, the crew the crew captures videos and photographs of Ben after his swim to send to Eduardo.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.660
You need to take one image from Ben, the entire
body, just to analyze the posture, and another one,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.959
just the top view of Ben, to analyze the
facial expression.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.400
Also, a small video log where Ben is
able just to look at the camera and express

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.880
what he's feeling, what he's doing.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.100
The first step of this is to try to extract
meaningful information from all these sources.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.100
Human Activity Recognition, the idea
is to try to understand human behavior with

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.300
the different sources that you might have.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.020
For images and video, I'm using computer
vision techniques to extract Ben's emotions.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.960
We'll have data from his nutrition, from his
physiological condition, the interaction

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.940
between Ben and the crew.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.140
We'll have the weather conditions, the sea
conditions, the wind conditions.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.380
We will have also the logbook, the distance
that Ben was able to travel on that day.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.340
Eduardo's model will measure the relationships among these variables, and verify which

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.160
combinations affect Ben's mental health the most.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.550
He will work with psychological analysis expert Sébastien Montel to check if the model's

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.960
predictions are correct, allowing the program to learn and improve over time.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.280
For instance, does waiting out bad weather like a typhoon increase Ben's mental fatigue,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.180
or jumpstart his motivation?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.340
There was a little bit a few weeks ago, when
we had rough weather.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.960
And he just stayed here on deck screaming at the ocean,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.980
but this was very, very impressive, very powerful.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.420
It wasn't a depressed screaming,
it was really like “Yeah, we're gonna do it! Yeah!"

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.980
I've never felt depressed, or low.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.200
Of course there are moments that are very difficult and challenging but I look at it in a bigger picture.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.680
I think Ben holds himself really well together mentally.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.860
Swimming through all the plastic really motivates
Ben to keep going.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.320
The fact that since day one, we've been seeing trash
everywhere, every day, I think for him has

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.190
been very, very sobering. He knows that every
stroke he does, it's just one more step forward

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.100
to raise awareness on 
these issues.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.120
It's reinforced my determination and my conviction about

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.960
the problem that we have with marine plastic debris.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.080
