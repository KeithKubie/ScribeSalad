00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.320
"The only force strong enough to save our country--"

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.300
"Sometimes politics can seem very small--"

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.820
"Why does Al Gore say one thing when the truth--"

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.260
"...right to me and I'd gladly--"

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.520
"Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy for me!"

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.860
"Ike for president! Ike for President! You like Ike, I like Ike!"

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.680
This is one of the first televised political campaign ads.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.440
It’s so simple: It’s a catchy song, there’s an easy-to-remember rhyme and a man with a name like

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.640
Dwight Eisenhower – known for being a military giant – is immediately made personable, relatable.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:39.140
The “I Like Ike” ad really was the first campaign advertisement sent out in a mass-media form,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.760
designed to directly sort of introduce Ike and his supporters to the broader electorate.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.060
In 2018, political campaign ads have become major productions with complete narrative arcs – like films –

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.440
and can have a greater reach over social media than television.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.860
So how did the all-American political campaign ad come to be, and how has it evolved into a multibillion-dollar

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.540
industry that relies on knowing everything about you? Well, it’s a story about increased access to the everyday American citizen – and it starts with Ike.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.800
General Dwight D. Eisenhower wasn’t really a guy known for his charm.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.000
He was a decorated war hero who had brought the United States to victory during World War II.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.540
And when he decided to run for president in 1952, he wasn’t coming with much – or really any – experience with electoral politics.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.940
So the challenge he presented to those who were pushing for an Eisenhower presidency was:

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.300
How do we take someone so well known and liked, who has no political experience and has terrible oratory skills, and get him elected?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.100
Enter the television ad.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.000
A big advertising executive approached Eisenhower with a plan for a TV ad campaign called “Eisenhower Answers America.”

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.520
The campaign was run by a bunch of Hollywood and advertising bigwigs who wanted to capitalize

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.000
on the extreme growth of television in the U.S. during the 1940s and ’50s.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.360
Imagine: 40 million American households in 1952 had television sets.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.060
That’s 40 million households that weren’t available in previous election cycles.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.040
The advertising campaign was simple: several 20- or 30-second spots where Eisenhower was

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.080
answering questions about his vision and well, being sold as politically adept.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.380
Daniel Kreiss, an associate professor at UNC Chapel Hill

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.460
says that it’s the Eisenhower TV ad campaign that really changed, in a way, where priorities are for campaigning.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.700
Campaigns start to contest elections more through air wars than the ground wars, which is to say that instead

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.300
of going out knocking on doors, relying on strong political parties, campaigns and candidates

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.400
generally make their appeals to the electorate directly over the airwaves.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.680
Politics becomes much more about sending generally undifferentiated messages to a mass electorate.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.780
Now, Eisenhower won the presidential election in 1952 – and the personable ads had an impact on converting

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.640
Democratic voters and nonvoters to vote for him, the Republican candidate.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.560
Eisenhower’s political TV ad campaign success set the tone for how elections would be fought, going forward.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.000
And it continues through the election in 1960, with John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.920
"I want to talk to you for a moment."

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.880
"Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy..."

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.480
By that election, 90% of American households had a television set. Compare that to just 9% ten years earlier.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.820
And from there, the American political ad just continues to develop, with the infamous “Daisy ad” in 1964.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.800
It was run by the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential campaign and attacked the Republican candidate Barry Goldwater.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.740
"6...5...4...3...2...1"

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:52.860
The Daisy Ad was very unique in that it was a very direct fear appeal. The Daisy ad ushered in sort of a new

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.800
generation of much blunter messages.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.360
Starting in the ’80s and ’90s, overall spending on election campaigning blew up, with a pretty big focus on TV advertising.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.340
More than $300 million dollars were spent on political advertising in 1992 for both local and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.660
national elections, dwarfing the previous record of $230 million just four years earlier.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.780
"Government just isn't working for the hardworking families of America."

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.280
Now, we’re focusing a lot on presidential campaigns and political advertising, because it’s

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.560
those ads that have national reach and have impacted the growth of the political ad.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.980
In 2000, George W. Bush and Al Gore went head to head for the presidency in probably one of the most

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.660
consequential elections in American history.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.780
The Bush and Gore campaigns spent a combined $67.1 million dollars in TV ads,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.540
hitting almost 200,000 spots, collectively, that year.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.400
"Newspapers say Gore has a problem telling the truth."

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.320
And that trend of increasing funding for political advertising continued to grow, as more

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.340
and more people, especially those who were younger, started to live more and more online.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:05.260
Starting in the mid-1990s, campaigns began shifting from running relatively undifferentiated, broadcast

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.200
television or cable television ads, that was seen by large swaths of the American public to increasingly targeted

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.600
internet ads that would at first be run on like newspaper websites or AOL dialup internet.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.080
In the late ’90s, early 2000s and now to running ads on platforms like Facebook that allow

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.720
campaigns to buy particular audiences and show content in a hyper-targeted way.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.880
And it was the candidacy of Barack Obama that changed everything for political advertising – and not necessarily for the better.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.560
While previous presidential candidates, like Howard Dean in 2004, had used the internet for

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.580
campaign fundraising, it was the Obama campaign that used it to advertise, to mobilize voters and to push back against attacks from opponents.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.760
"At this defining moment in our history, the question's not 'are you better off than you were four years ago?'

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.780
"We all know the answer to that. The real question is 'will our country be better off four years from now?'"

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.940
While then-candidate Barack Obama outspent his opponent John McCain by $173 million dollars in

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:13.040
2008 on political advertising, his campaign also relied on YouTube, which was a free space.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.760
It’s hard to really figure out how much influence the Obama campaign’s focus on internet campaigning had on young voters.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.300
But the 2008 election saw the highest number of young voters come out for Obama

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.420
than for any other president since 1972, when exit polling first started.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.760
Oh, and get this – remember this viral YouTube video?

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.380
"It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed the trails for freedom."

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.760
That ad is the one that’s believed to have put Barack Obama on the map –

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.780
and it wasn’t created for television or by the Obama campaign, but by will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.240
But it totally became the Obama campaign’s anthem.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.780
"Yes we can."

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.420
"It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed the trails for freedom."

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:07.640
Obama’s 2012 campaign once again changed how the internet could and would be used for political advertising, anointing that election the first Big Data election.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.760
The Obama campaign went all-out when it came to collecting data to better target voters

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.240
advertising – and Facebook was a huge part of that push.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.040
The campaign collected and studied data on prospective voters, through public information,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.160
and catered messages for specific demographics, specific areas, even people.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:29.400
That tactic is known as “microtargeting” – and it was a big and controversial part of the 2016 presidential campaign.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.040
Now, let’s take a breather for a moment to recap where we are: We’ve gone from this ad that reached 40 million

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.420
American households to political campaign advertising that’s collecting your data and

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.700
customizing messaging that targets you, wherever you are.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.840
So broadly, the implication of that movement from mass to much more hyper-targeted publix

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.960
means that campaigns and other political actors are able to make increasingly narrow appeals

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.500
to very small slices of the electorate. And even more importantly, those people who are seeing an ad don't

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.800
necessarily know that they're seeing the same ads as other people. A candidate could say one thing

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:12.260
to one group of people, and another thing to another group of people, depending on what is strategically advantageous.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.500
And we see what Kreiss is talking about in the 2016 election campaigns.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.320
During that election cycle, then-candidate Donald Trump spent a fraction on political advertising

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.200
compared to his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was slated by many to become the 45th president.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:32.080
"Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment."

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.260
Trump was amazingly adept at earning free media coverage. By some academic estimates,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:46.020
over $2 billion of free media on platforms like CNN, Fox News, during the course of the election.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.540
The thing that the campaign then sought to do was to buy advertising around those themes and

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:59.080
target individuals on platforms, especially Facebook, in order to mobilize those voters further.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.700
And you can mobilize voters even more because digital advertising isn’t as passive as TV ads.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.140
Digital advertising is designed to mobilize.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.460
And what I think the Trump campaign did very effectively was reach out to people

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.800
who were Trump supporters or likely to be sympathizing with them and then asking them

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.400
to take action in some particular way.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.060
Now, while social media and the internet, overall, are powerful tools that can empower voters,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.020
political advertising online is not regulated, meaning there’s potential for “anything goes.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.320
And that “anything goes” caused a lot of outrage when it was revealed in 2017 that UK-based

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.260
Cambridge Analytica, a private consulting firm, had gained access to the private information of

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.080
almost 90 million Facebook users through an app.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:48.520
That access violated Facebook’s privacy rules and the trust of millions of users in the platform – but not any federal laws.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.500
One of the firm’s clients was the Trump campaign.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.520
It used data collected on a huge part of the American electorate to micro-target its message.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.180
*lets out a sigh of exhaustion*

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.520
So, again, we’ve gone from “I Like Ike” to … an invasion of privacy, *just* for political advertising.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.760
So what’s next?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.440
Where does political campaign advertising go in a world of Big Money and Big Surveillance?

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.420
Well, Naomi Burton and Nick Hayes – the people behind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s viral

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.560
"The Courage to Change” ad – think the future is principled advertising for principled politicians.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.540
Burton and Hayes are the founders of Means of Production, a socialist production company founded in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.060
election, working on ads for a group of relative newcomers to the mainstream:

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.100
The Democratic Socialists of America! And they’re not afraid of being very open about having an agenda.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:40.620
We really want to work with people that are pushing a politics, advancing an agenda, that benefits working-class people.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:46.280
We draw a line and we won't work with people who take corporate money, because there's no interesting stories

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:54.340
We also only work with people who have a socialist politics, because without an ideological foundation, progressivism is co-opted.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.500
And they found success with New York Democratic congressional nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.900
“Women like me aren’t supposed to run for office. I wasn’t born to a wealthy or powerful family.”

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.000
I reached out to her on Twitter. I explained who we were, as Means of Production. I said, we take no corporate

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.820
money, we’re socialists and we would really love to make a campaign video for you. She immediately responded.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.440
The next day we got on the phone and a month later, we were in New York.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.460
Think the thing that made us want to work with her was she was unapologetically socialist and she understood

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.720
how to articulate those ideas that met people where they were at.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.540
The final result was an ad that delivered a strong narrative that intertwined her own life with the

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.060
lives and experiences of so many of the people who would be her constituents.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.020
It wasn’t televised, and went viral online.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:49.120
“But after 20 years of the same representation, we have to ask: Who has New York been changing for?

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:56.000
Every day gets harder for working families like mine to get by. The rent gets higher.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.540
Healthcare covers less. And our income stays the same.”

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.200
Ocasio-Cortez defeated her opponent, 15-year incumbent candidate Joseph Crowley, in the Democratic primary.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.120
She is projected to be the next representative for New York’s 14th congressional district.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.520
The viral ad didn’t necessarily introduce her to the constituents she had been campaigning to for

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.700
months already, but it did introduce her and her politics to people well outside New York’s 14th district.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.000
So we’ve seen political advertising evolve a lot since “I Like Ike” first hit the airwaves in 1952.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.880
And that evolution has been connected to the evolution of how people stay connected to each other and to the world around them.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.480
But how much is political advertising really worth,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.020
if surveillance has become an inseparable part of it?
