00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:02.860
SUBJECT: Vladimir Putin, besides
being the leader of the largest

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.580
country in the world,
is a manly man,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.460
or at least that's
the vibe he gives off

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.950
by doing things like fishing
with no shirt, practicing Judo

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.810
with worthy opponents, or
by befriending the Night

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.210
Wolves, Russia's
biggest motorcycle gang.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.690
The night walls are led by this
guy, Alexander Zaldostanov,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.860
also known as The Surgeon.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.470
Now that seems kind
of intimidating

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.250
especially in the context
of a hulking tattooed leader

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.960
of a motorcycle gang.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.770
But apparently, Zaldostanov
was actually a surgeon,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.970
a literal licensed surgeon.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.550
These images of the
Night Wolves were

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.330
taken by Russian
photographer, Sergey Nikolaev

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.050
during the grand opening
of biker season, which

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.580
I assume is when the weather
gets warm enough for motorcycle

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.060
rides and not when hunters
can legal negotiating out

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.200
and capture and tame
wild motorcycle.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.100
Annual opening of the motorcycle
season in Saint Petersburg

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.460
begins in the heart of the
city at the Palace Square.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.400
Members of all motorcycle
clubs get together

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.320
where they go to a place
celebration as a united

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.365
great column.

00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:10.930
On this day, Zaldostanov
and the Night Wolves

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.470
were at the head of the column.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.170
He has come at the opening
of seasons in Saint

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.660
Petersburg for the first time.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.620
I felt compelled to
capture the event,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.175
because Zaldostanov
is a celebrity,

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:29.600
a major person and his
participation in the opening

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.910
was not typical for our city.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.660
And that seems to be
how a lot of Russians

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.930
perceived The Surgeon and
his gang, as celebrities.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.840
And they like what
they stand for.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.660
In my opinion, the
majority of Russians

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.640
suffered the ideas promoted
by the Night Wolves.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.670
Those Night Wolf endorsed
ideas are immense patriotism,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.300
a strong belief in the
Russian Orthodox Church,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.480
and also sentiments that are
anti-west, anti-feminism,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.640
anti-gay, and
anti-Ukrainian revolution.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.270
And because they're so
outspoken about these beliefs,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.410
others inside Russia don't see
them the celebrities at all.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.650
Other Russian motorcycle
gangs, in particular,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.080
aren't big fans of
the Night Wolves.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.050
Motorcycle gangs are famous
for having fierce rivalries.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.090
But this time, it's not because
of drugs, or territory rights,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.510
or someone's old lady.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.090
Russian gangs, like the
Dobermans and Russia's chapters

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.950
of Hell's Angels,
think that there's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.010
no place for
politics and religion

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.050
in the world of
motorcycle gangs.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.790
The Night Wolves
think otherwise.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.880
Not only do they make bike
pilgrimages to holy sites,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.600
but they're basically a Putin
PR department on two wheels.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.560
As a publicly
recognized close friend

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.430
of the gang, Putin
his gifted them

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.490
state land along
with government money

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.580
to help build a
new headquarters.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.820
And he sold land to
the gang in Crimea

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.800
for 0.1% of its actual
price so that they

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.830
could build a patriotic center
for entertainment and extreme

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.010
sports.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.740
One biker one as far as saying
that the Russian motorcycle

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.870
community is divided in two,
on the one side of the Night

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.140
Wolves, on the other
side, everybody else.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.010
Outside of Russia,
the night wolves

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.070
have been sanctioned
because of their close ties

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.320
to the Kremlin.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.170
The United States has barred the
gang from entering the country

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.820
or doing any financial
dealings with the US,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.300
because sub-members took
up arms in Russia's fight

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.540
against Ukraine.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.240
During the conflict they
stormed a natural gas facility

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.180
in Sebastopol,
which by the way, is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.460
the same town their new
sports center will be located.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.330
They have also been banned
from entering Canada, Germany,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.220
Poland, and the
entire European Union.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.790
But the Night Wolves consider
this an accomplishment

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.130
as international recognition
for their support

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.520
of their beloved home country,
a country where people will line

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.180
up just to watch them
ride down the street,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.260
a country where a
motorcycle gang can

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.200
be a national treasure,
and its leader, the best

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
friend of the President.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.790
The Cold War might
be over, but there

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.620
are few places left in Russia
that really don't act that way.

on Russia's secret cities.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.540
Throughout the Cold
War the Soviet Union

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.240
created 44 cities that were
kept secret from the world.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.290
These cities were dedicated to
making weaponry, specifically

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.940
nuclear bombs.
