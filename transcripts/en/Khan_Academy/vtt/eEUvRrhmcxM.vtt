00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.790
Well, before we even knew what
DNA was, much less how it was

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.160
structured or it was replicated
or even before we

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.020
could look in and see meiosis
happening in cells, we had the

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.700
general sense that offspring
were the products of some

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.480
traits that their parents had.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.170
That if I had a guy with blue
eyes-- let me say this is the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.430
blue-eyed guy right here --and
then if he were to marry a

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.800
brown-eyed girl-- Let's say this
is the brown-eyed girl.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.410
Maybe make it a little
bit more like a girl.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.450
If he were to marry the
brown-eyed girl there, that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.230
most of the time, or maybe in
all cases where we're dealing

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.030
with the brown-eyed girl,
maybe their kids are

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.870
brown-eyed.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.210
Let me do this so they have a
little brown-eyed baby here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.980
And this is just something--
I mean, there's obviously

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.420
thousands of generations of
human beings, and we've

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.180
observed this.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.590
We've observed that kids look
like their parents, that they

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.280
inherit some traits, and that
some traits seem to dominate

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.140
other traits.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.960
One example of that tends to
be a darker pigmentation in

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.570
maybe the hair or the eyes.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.710
Even if the other parent has
light pigmentation, the darker

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.900
one seems to dominate, or
sometimes, it actually ends up

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.420
being a mix, and we've seen
that all around us.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.410
Now, this study of what gets
passed on and how it gets

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.590
passed on, it's much older than
the study of DNA, which

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.840
was really kind of discovered
or became a big deal in the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.110
middle of the 20th century.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.820
This was studied a long time.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
And kind of the father of
classical genetics and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.455
heredity is Gregor Mendel.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.650
He was actually a monk, and he
would mess around with plants

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.795
and cross them and see which
traits got passed and which

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:51.230
traits didn't get passed and
tried to get an understanding

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.650
of how traits are passed from
one generation to another.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.090
So when we do this, when we
study this classical genetics,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.230
I'm going to make a bunch of
simplifying assumptions

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.080
because we know that most of
these don't hold for most of

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.140
our genes, but it'll give us a
little bit of sense of how to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.340
predict what might happen
in future generations.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.270
So the first simplifying
assumption I'll make is that

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.840
some traits have kind of this
all or nothing property.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.690
And we know that a lot
of traits don't.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.690
Let's say that there are in
the world-- and this is a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.220
gross oversimplification --let's
say for eye color,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.520
let's say that there
are two alleles.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.390
Now remember what
an allele was.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.030
An allele is a specific
version of a gene.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.400
So let's say that you could
have blue eye color or you

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.460
could have brown eye color.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.220
That we live in a universe where
someone could only have

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.320
one of these two versions
of the eye color gene.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.230
We know that eye color is far
more complex than that, so

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.970
this is just a simplification.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.340
And let me just make
up another one.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:14.110
Let me say that, I don't know,
maybe for tooth size, that's a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.590
trait you won't see in any
traditional biology textbook,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.470
and let's say that there's one
trait for big teeth and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.330
there's another allele
for small teeth.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.850
And I want to make very clear
this distinction between a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.100
gene and an allele.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.740
I talked about Gregor Mendel,
and he was doing this in the

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.890
1850s well before we knew what
DNA was or what even

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.590
chromosomes were and how DNA was
passed on, et cetera, but

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.060
let's go into the microbiology
of it to understand the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.840
difference.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.170
So I have a chromosome.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.710
Let's say on some chromosome--
let me pick

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.900
some chromosome here.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.930
Let's say this is
some chromosome.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.590
Let's say I got that
from my dad.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.130
And on this chromosome, there's
some location here--

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.550
we could call that the locus on
this chromosome where the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.330
eye color gene is --that's
the location of

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.579
the eye color gene.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.279
Now, I have two chromosomes,
one from my father and one

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.010
from my mother, so let's say
that this is the chromosome

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.260
from my mother.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.800
We know that when they're
normally in the cell, they

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.180
aren't nice and neatly organized
like this in the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.860
chromosome, but this is just to
kind of show you the idea.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.690
Let's say these are homologous
chromosomes so they code for

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.970
the same genes.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.460
So on this gene from my mother
on that same location or

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.710
locus, there's also the
eye color gene.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.020
Now, I might have the same
version of the gene and I'm

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.760
saying that there's only
two versions of

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.220
this gene in the world.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.690
Now, if I have the same version
of the gene-- I'm

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.510
going to make a little
shorthand notation.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.101
I'm going to write big B--
Actually, let me do

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.010
it the other way.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.040
I'm going to write little b
for blue and I'm going to

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.420
write big B for brown.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.210
There's a situation where this
could be a little b and this

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.800
could be a big B.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.010
And then I could write that my
genotype-- I have the allele,

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.320
I have one big B from my
mom and I have one

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.440
small b from my dad.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.120
Each of these instances, or
ways that this gene is

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.660
expressed, is an allele.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:40.360
So these are two different
alleles-- let me write that

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.880
--or versions of
the same gene.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.340
And when I have two different
versions like this, one

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.140
version from my mom, one version
from my dad, I'm

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.480
called a heterozygote, or
sometimes it's called a

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.730
heterozygous genotype.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.000
And the genotype is the exact
version of the alleles I have.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.170
Let's say I had the
lowercase b.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.690
I had the blue-eyed gene
from both parents.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.040
So let's say that I was
lowercase b, lowercase b, then

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.600
I would have two identical
alleles.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.840
Both of my parents gave me the
same version of the gene.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.930
And this case, this genotype
is homozygous, or this is a

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.900
homozygous genotype, or I'm a
homozygote for this trait.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.510
Now, you might say,
Sal, this is fine.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.400
These are the traits that you
have. I have a brown from

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.550
maybe my mom and a
blue from my dad.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.850
In this case, I have a blue
from both my mom and dad.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.590
How do we know whether my eyes
are going to be brown or blue?

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.900
And the reality is it's
very complex.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.410
It's a whole mixture
of things.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.830
But Mendel, he studied
things that showed

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.080
what we'll call dominance.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.930
And this is the idea that
one of these traits

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.090
dominates the other.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.160
So a lot of people originally
thought that eye color,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.490
especially blue eyes,
was always dominated

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.500
by the other traits.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.140
We'll assume that here,
but that's a gross

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.510
oversimplification.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:34.200
So let's say that brown
eyes are dominant

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.130
and blue are recessive.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.960
I wanted to do that in blue.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.560
Blue eyes are recessive.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.330
If this is the case, and this
is a-- As I've said

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.730
repeatedly, this is a gross
oversimplification.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.670
But if that is the case, then
if I were to inherit this

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.540
genotype, because brown eyes
are dominant-- remember, I

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:12.400
said the big B here represents
brown eye and the lowercase b

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.670
is recessive --all you're going
to see for the person

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.450
with this genotype
is brown eyes.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.880
So let me do this here.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.710
Let me write this here.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:27.680
So genotype, and then I'll
write phenotype.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.030
Genotype is the actual versions
of the gene you have

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.780
and then the phenotypes
are what's expressed

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.030
or what do you see.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.860
So if I get a brown-eyed gene
from my dad-- And I want to do

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.310
it in a big-- I want
to do it in brown.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.670
Let me do it in brown so
you don't get confused.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.490
So if I've have a brown-eyed
gene from my dad and a

00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:05.130
blue-eyed gene from my mom,
because the brown eye is

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.580
recessive, the brown-eyed allele
is recessive-- And I

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.370
just said a brown-eyed gene, but
what I should say is the

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.870
brown-eyed version of the
gene, which is the brown

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.820
allele, or the blue-eyed version
of the gene from my

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.890
mom, which is the blue allele.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.290
Since the brown allele is
dominant-- I wrote that up

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.410
here --what's going to be
expressed are brown eyes.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.450
Now, let's say I had
it the other way.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.850
Let's say I got a blue-eyed
allele from my dad and I get a

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.750
brown-eyed allele for my mom.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.490
Same thing.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.940
The phenotype is going
to be brown eyes.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.730
Now, what if I get a brown-eyed
allele from both my

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.470
mom and my dad?

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.930
Let me see, I keep changing
the shade of brown, but

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.960
they're all supposed
to be the same.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.130
So let's say I get two dominant
brown-eyed alleles

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.820
from my mom and my dad.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.770
Then what are you
going to see?

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.640
Well, you could guess that.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.280
I'm still going to
see brown eyes.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.570
So there's only one last
combination because these are

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.800
the only two types of alleles
we might see in our

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.510
population, although for
most genes, there's

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.710
more than two types.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.400
For example, there's
blood types.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.490
There's four types of blood.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.540
But let's say that I get two
blue, one blue allele from

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.400
each of my parents, one from
my dad, one from my mom.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.080
Then all of a sudden, this is a
recessive trait, but there's

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.550
nothing to dominate it.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.130
So, all of a sudden, the
phenotype will be blue eyes.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.380
And I want to repeat again, this
isn't necessarily how the

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.130
alleles for eye color work, but
it's a nice simplification

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.370
to maybe understand how
heredity works.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.040
There are some traits that can
be studied in this simple way.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.920
But what I wanted to do here
is to show you that many

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.970
different genotypes-- so these
are all different genotypes

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.090
--they all coded for
the same phenotype.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.000
So just by looking at someone's
eye color, you

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
didn't know exactly whether
they were homozygous

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.740
dominant-- this would be
homozygous dominant --or

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.080
whether they were
heterozygotes.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.350
This is heterozygous
right here.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.650
These two right here
are heterozygotes.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.680
These are also sometimes called
hybrids, but the word

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.600
hybrid is kind of overloaded.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.800
It's used a lot, but in this
context, it means that you got

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.940
different versions of the
allele for that gene.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.740
So let's think a little bit
about what's actually

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.155
happening when my mom and
my dad reproduced.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.100
Well, let's think of a couple
of different scenarios.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.630
Let's say that they're
both hybrids.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:03.470
My dad has the brown-eyed
dominant allele and he also

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:08.020
has the blue-eyed recessive
allele.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.560
Let's say my mom has the same
thing, so brown-eyed dominant,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.780
and she also has the blue-eyed
recessive allele.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.880
Now let's think about if these
two people, before you see

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.630
what my eye color is, if you
said, look, I'm giving you

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.760
what these two people's
genotypes are.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.010
Let me label them.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.790
Let me make this the mom.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.090
I think this is the standard
convention.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.730
And let's make this right
here, this is the dad.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.910
What are the different genotypes
that their children

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.490
could have?

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.630
So let's say they reproduce.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.090
I'm going to draw a
little grid here.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.660
So let me draw a grid.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:55.990
So we know from our study of
meiosis that, look, my mom has

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.870
this gene on-- Let me draw
the genes again.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.240
So there's a homologous
pair, right?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.880
This is one chromosome
right here.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.070
That's another chromosome
right there.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.130
On this chromosome in the
homologous pair, there might

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:16.760
be-- at the eye color locus
--there's the brown-eyed gene.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.470
And at this one, at the eye
color locus, there's a

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.890
blue-eyed gene.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.630
And similarly from my dad, when
you look at that same

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.310
chromosome in his cells-- Let
me do them like this.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.740
So this is one chromosome there
and this is the other

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.760
chromosome here.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.120
When you look at that locus
on this chromosome or that

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.870
location, it has the brown-eyed
allele for that

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.370
gene, and on this one,
it has the blue-eyed

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.590
allele on this gene.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.680
And we learn from meiosis when
the chromosomes-- Well, they

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.580
replicate first, and so you have
these two chromatids on a

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.140
chromosome.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.520
But they line up in meiosis
I during the metaphase.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.220
And we don't know which
way they line up.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.510
For example, my dad might give
me this chromosome or might

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.630
give me that chromosome.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.790
Or my mom might give me that
chromosome or might give me

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.820
that chromosome.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.760
So I could have any of
these combinations.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.540
So, for example, if I get this
chromosome from my mom and

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.760
this chromosome from my dad,
what is the genotype going to

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.000
be for eye color?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.770
Well, it's going to be capital
B and capital B.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.510
If I get this chromosome from
my mom and this chromosome

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.620
from my dad, what's
it going to be?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.330
Well, I'm going to get the big
B from my dad and then I'm

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.790
going to get the lowercase
b from my mom.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.790
So this is another
possibility.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.510
Now, this is another possibility
here where I get

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:42.490
the brown-eyed allele from my
mom and I get the blue eye

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.380
allele from my dad.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.350
And then there's a possibility
that I get this chromosome

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.260
from my dad and this chromosome
from my mom, so

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.520
it's this situation.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.700
Now, what are the phenotypes
going to be?

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.290
Well, we've already seen that
this one right here is going

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:03.080
to be brown, that one's going to
be brown, this one's going

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.250
to be brown, but this one
is going to be blue.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.860
I already showed you this.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.980
But if I were to tell you ahead
of time that, look, I

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.090
have two people.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.980
They're both hybrids, or they're
both heterozygotes for

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.610
eye color, and eye
color has this

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.335
recessive dominant situation.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:22.530
And they're both heterozygotes
where they each have one brown

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.980
allele and one blue allele, and
they're going to have a

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.835
child, what's the probability
that the child has brown eyes?

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.170
What's the probability?

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.720
Well, each of these scenarios
are equally likely, right?

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.400
There's four equal scenarios.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.130
So let's put that in
the denominator.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.950
Four equal scenarios.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.110
And how many of those
scenarios end

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.780
up with brown eyes?

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.110
Well, it's one, two, three.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:58.780
So the probability is 3/4, or
it's a 75% probability.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.830
Same logic, what's the
probability that these parents

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.650
produce an offspring
with blue eyes?

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.280
Well, that's only one of
the four equally likely

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:15.840
possibilities, so blue
eyes is only 25%.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.400
Now, what is the probability
that they produce a

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.390
heterozygote?

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.130
So what is the probability
that they produce a

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.425
heterozygous offspring?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.300
So now we're not looking at
the phenotype anymore.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.050
We're looking at the genotype.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.310
So of these combinations,
which are heterozygous?

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.570
Well, this one is, because
it has a mix.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.360
It's a hybrid.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.380
It has a mix of the
two alleles.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.170
And so is this one.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.220
So what's the probability?

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.050
Well, there's four different
combinations.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.020
All of those are equally likely,
and two of them result

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.200
in a heterozygote.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.580
So it's 2/4 or 1/2 or 50%.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.570
So using this Punnett square,
and, of course, we had to make

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.880
a lot of assumptions about the
genes and whether one's

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.050
dominant or one's a recessive,
we can start to make

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.880
predictions about the
probabilities

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.530
of different outcomes.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.300
And as we'll see in future
videos, you can actually even

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.970
go backwards.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.680
You can say, hey, given that
this couple had five kids with

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.160
brown eyes, what's the
probability that they're both

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.819
heterozygotes, or something
like that.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.000
So it's a really interesting
area, even though it is a bit

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.490
of oversimplification.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.760
But many traits, especially some
of the things that Gregor

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.190
Mendel studied, can be
studied in this way.
