1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
The Joe Rogan experience to bun. Boom. Hotep Jesus, how are you sir?

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.290
I always wanted to say that you wanted to call somebody that I need that drama.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.950
I haven't fucked to get a name like Hotep Jesus. How'd that come about?

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.880
It wasn't my idea. You know, I was uh, I had just went through my, uh,

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.870
spiritual awakening.

6
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.900
I just loved the hip hop industry and I went through like that mace thing,

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.790
you know, you go to [inaudible] are you doing with the headgear?

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.550
We got you a lot. A lot going on up there. I had to top my head down.

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.660
It's a black gay man.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.800
So you a spiritual awakening. I had this spiritual awakening and um, you know,

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.790
tweeting on Twitter like I do, right? And uh, somebody said,

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.020
what do you think you are some kind of Hotep Jesus. Ooh, that's good. Like Ooh,

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.360
yes, I do think I'm Hotep Jesus. That's perfect. And now you own it.

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.550
That person is probably like, fuck God damn it. That was a great name.

15
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.570
I gave that dude. Yeah.

16
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.110
I don't know who that person is or was or where they are. Now.

17
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.250
Shout out to whoever you are exactly and vibe. Hi, your Twitter.

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.580
Why didn't you switch it to Hotep? Jesus, can you switch it? Oh,

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.660
does anybody own Hotep? Jesus, I do you so you have Hotep Jesus on Twitter too.

20
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.660
Yeah, I reserved it. Oh dude. I think they could probably swap.

21
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.860
Do you have a cute little blue check marks yet? No. What the fuck is that?

22
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.780
How do you get one of those? I don't know. People,

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.420
there's some people that have those that have like a thousand followers know.

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.770
Yeah. How are you getting,

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.350
like if you worked for the New York times or some shit you had go,

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
I'll do Joe and then I get verified. I don't know how Twitter feels about me.

27
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.350
I mean I think Jack likes me. He's been in a couple of times,

28
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:37.710
but I think the whole, they're, they're weird man. They weren't,

29
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.600
I mean I think all social media,

30
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:42.720
all tech companies want you to tow a line right now.

31
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.920
And if you're not towing that line and you're bringing on forbidden guests and

32
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:49.800
you have people that have controversial ideas, you know,

33
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.410
they'll have that finger on the button of getting rid of you.

34
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.550
They don't know what to do.

35
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.590
<v 1>It's just like radio, you know, like radio.</v>

36
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.850
A lot of people don't know about a radio has to play happy songs cause happy

37
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:05.290
people buy things. Yeah, that's what, that's what the studies say. Allegedly.

38
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.320
The marketing studies and advertising studies say people who are in a good mood

39
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:09.280
tend to buy things. Right.

40
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.060
So the radio is supposed to play happy songs all day long and the radio works

41
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:18.250
for the advertisers, kind of like media and so on, so forth.

42
00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:20.980
So social media is no different. They have advertises.

43
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:25.930
So if there's people on the platform who are creating disgruntled crowds,

44
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.000
it could be hurting the bottom line.

45
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.110
<v 0>Yeah. But Facebook's algorithm actually favors that.</v>

46
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.350
The way Facebook has it set up. Like say if, if you, uh,

47
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.230
if you get into debates with people on abortion or something like very

48
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.550
controversial, they will start sending that shit to your feet. They will,

49
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.080
they will prop you. It will, it will,

50
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.010
they'll sort of steer it in your direction because the more you engage,

51
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:50.550
the more clicks they get, the more money they get, the more advertising dollars.

52
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:51.384
Again,

53
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.780
<v 1>truly. Absolutely. Uh,</v>

54
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:57.160
the Facebook algorithm is quite unique in the way that things can go viral

55
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.430
there. Um, Twitter, I feel like

56
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.940
that the Twitter safety and council, what do they call it? Trust and safety.

57
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.710
Is that what it's called? Something like that. Yeah.

58
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.640
So when I go and look at the entities that contribute to that board,

59
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:17.590
I kind of start saying, Oh, okay, I see why certain topics are taboo. You know?

60
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.220
Um, there's, when you, when there's a board,

61
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.500
those people on the board are the voice. They're the ones that have the opinion,

62
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.380
you know? So if your group isn't represented,

63
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.930
maybe you need to figure out how to get on that board. You know what I mean?

64
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.740
Right. I don't know.

65
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.610
Anybody's getting on that board not is not going to happen and you better be

66
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:39.760
left wing. You're going to get on that board. I don't think there's any. Right.

67
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.830
What do you think is, I think Jack's more like in the middle. Yes.

68
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.350
I think he's closer to the middle. I don't think it's Jack. I think it's,

69
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.210
you know, Jack's working on a bunch of different projects,

70
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.200
but I think it's probably, you know,

71
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:57.460
whoever else is in the office making the day to days decisions. Yeah,

72
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.540
I like Jack a lot,

73
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.960
but I think Jack is in the middle of a gigantic corporation and there's so many

74
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:06.850
people with so many ideas. Essentially

75
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.260
the founding fathers of our country had a great idea when it comes to freedom of

76
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.094
expression.

77
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.660
They felt like it was very important that you have free speech and the only,

78
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.610
you can't be silenced. You can't be,

79
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.510
you can't be undermined by people who disagree with you because it's dangerous.

80
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.680
It's dangerous when someone can just decide that you can't have a voice anymore

81
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.000
and only their voice can be heard.

82
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.470
And we're kind of seeing that with Twitter and we're kind of seeing that with

83
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.900
Facebook and with Google and they're,

84
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.280
they're deciding what can be heard and what not can be heard.

85
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.050
They think they're doing it for good reasons.

86
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:41.350
They think they're doing it to preserve our culture and our civilization and

87
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.310
they want to protect people from the election. Read it. Shut down the Donald,

88
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.500
the uh, the, the Donald Trump support a Reddit page. Yeah.

89
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.590
That's not a good idea. That right.

90
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.730
Right before the Dem Dem to be right before the democratic debate and you know,

91
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:02.590
that was like where all the funny memes come from and look man, this,

92
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.450
you can't do that. I mean,

93
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.680
just because if you have some people that are saying some shit that's bad on

94
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:10.810
there, get rid of those people. Get rid of that.

95
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.610
But you can't just shut down a whole forum. Like it seems, that seems insane.

96
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.590
Is there a reason for it? It's not shut down. It says it's quarantined. Fuck.

97
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:24.220
Does that mean is it have a disease for like temporary, it's got Ebola,

98
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.200
it's happens to people. They got to do something.

99
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.370
It says there's violent threats. I'm looking to see what repeated misbehavior.

100
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.110
Violent threats. Skeptical.

101
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.970
Very. Seems weird, right?

102
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I feel like all this stuff is like we're seeing what the first amendment is

103
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.910
really all about, why it exists.

104
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.510
We're seeing it play out with all these social media sites. I really think that,

105
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:51.610
you know, my thing is with like the right thing, right?

106
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.280
It's very easy to create an actor, right?

107
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.780
The left can create a right wing actor online to pretend like it's something,

108
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.730
and I'm sure it's something else. They can go in and read Reddit,

109
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.360
do something malicious to get the whole Reddit band right.

110
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.500
Or an agent provocateur. Exactly. And uh,

111
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.310
I never leave that off the table. When I look at instances like this,

112
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.340
when you say, Oh, somebody was, it's the internet, everybody's anonymous,

113
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.340
you know, you tracking this back to who it is, you know what I mean?

114
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:21.740
Or do you know what's conservative? Do you know? Is it Republican? Are you sure?

115
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.320
So, you know, I take these things,

116
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.980
these pieces of information with a grain of salt. Yeah, you should.

117
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.150
But is this election meddling? It kind of is, right?

118
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.050
Is what it feels like if you're killing a whole sub, what does it depends.

119
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.520
I mean, so if they're really,

120
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.820
that would be really interesting if it turns out that it was someone from the

121
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:45.140
left that was posing as someone from the right in order to shut down a forum and

122
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.770
pretend there's death threats or, I mean, you look at YouTube, right?

123
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.820
And what's been happening with YouTube? Uh, even just the algorithm, you know,

124
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.850
uh, I'm pretty good with keywords. I do SEO marketing,

125
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.840
so when I type in certain keywords or find certain things,

126
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.840
I know what's gonna come up or what type of content comes up.

127
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.430
Now when I type in those keywords, it's like ABC, NBC, ABC, CNN,

128
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:08.930
and I'm like, that's not what I wanted.

129
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:12.290
They don't even talk about these keywords. What are you talking about? You know?

130
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.360
So when you start seeing that,

131
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.840
you start thinking about ink sock in Orwell in 1984,

132
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.710
socialism and communism and fascism and, ah,

133
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.650
the degradation of society and, um,

134
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.230
a lot of control coming down. Um, you know, people,

135
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.200
you know, in some ways it's like,

136
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.590
was the internet created for freedom or was it country created for control?

137
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.340
Right? So it's two different pathways. You could probably look at that.

138
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.370
But it seems like in many ways they set us up to be controlled and they're doing

139
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:49.100
it through monopolies.

140
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.320
Google controls search through YouTube and Google.

141
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.850
And by what you search, you can think it's a truth. But what did Kanye say?

142
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.580
Kanye say Google lied to you. You know,

143
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:05.060
so Johnny says a lot of crazy shit though. You never really think about that.

144
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.950
He does. And I like crazy. I do too. I'm a big fan of crazy. I'm a little crazy.

145
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.570
A lot of crazy sometimes,

146
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.220
so I appreciate his crazy side more than his calm side. Hmm.

147
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.480
Well great things come from wild thoughts. Right? Exactly.

148
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.400
I think the internet was initially created to exchange information and then when

149
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:28.970
it got loose to the general public, they realize what a crazy idea that was.

150
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520
Well,

151
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.170
I think we're seeing right now with the algorithms is that these corporations

152
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:35.060
are influencing these companies to say, Hey,

153
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.450
when someone's looking for these things, how about you send them over to ABC?

154
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.700
How about you send them over to NBC? How about you? You know,

155
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:44.480
like we want to be able to get the first views on these things.

156
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.120
So if someone's searching for that, I don't know how they do it.

157
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:49.940
I dunno what they, whether they have agreements with them, maybe.

158
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.020
I mean there's also a lot of copywritten shit that's on there that could get

159
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:57.960
YouTube in some trouble if they ever really decided to pursue it. Right.

160
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.380
And how many videos are on YouTube that people have on their channel that are

161
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:06.270
just straight off of Fox news or NBC news or there's a lot of like copyright

162
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.590
protected content that YouTube is essentially profiting off of. Oh yeah,

163
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.830
yeah. They make a ton of money off that stuff. Um,

164
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.640
so they might have deals where they say, look, we'll send these people to,

165
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.820
you know, this first. Yeah. And that's why I say, you know,

166
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:23.310
and that's where the control comes in. You know, the advertisers,

167
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.320
advertisers are the ones paying, you know, for the platform to a thing.

168
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.430
It's not us to users that are paying for a YouTube spree. So who's paying,

169
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.660
right? They're there, they're monetizing us, they're monetizing us to users.

170
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.720
And the viewers. Yeah. That's where it gets tricky, right?

171
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.230
Because as soon as the advertisers get on board, they said, look, we, uh,

172
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.000
you know, we want to give you money,

173
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.990
but this content is not advertiser friendly. Right? Yeah.

174
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.620
And then they start moving stuff around and demonetizing things and,

175
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.490
and with demonetization, the real thing that they're doing and a lot of ways,

176
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:00.240
whether it's intentional or not, is you're influencing what people post.

177
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.560
You're kind of, you're asking them to self-censor cause if you say, Hey,

178
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.670
you guys want to discuss abortion rights or you know, like there's,

179
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:11.670
there's some things that you start discussing them and they will automatically

180
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.900
dump demonetize you. Yeah. Well who is the girl that put out the, uh,

181
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.010
abortion documentary? Right. And H girls snatched that down.

182
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.430
I forget what it's called. Um, I'm bad at memorizing these things,

183
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:24.980
but there was an, uh,

184
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.700
basically an anti abortion thing that exposed some things about abortion as a

185
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:32.250
documentary. And I believe that day it went up, it got shut down.

186
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:37.020
She had to re upload it. Um, what's that? Lauren? Southern might've been. Yeah.

187
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.650
There's those two cute white chicks that everybody thinks are super racist.

188
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.210
Lauren Southern and Tammy, Tammy, Lauren, Tomi Lahren, Tommy Lauren.

189
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.850
So she did a documentary, but then you have like a,

190
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:52.851
the James O'Keefe thing where he put up the exposing a YouTube and in that got,

191
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.203
you know,

192
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.660
obviously they're gonna take it down for the most recent one that exposed

193
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:01.410
Google. Right, right. Yeah. I've been asking people about that. I'm like, okay,

194
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.610
break this down for me.

195
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:06.030
Is there any way that this could have been deceptively advertised or deceptively

196
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.260
edited? Like it's,

197
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:12.261
it seems to me like they're saying that they're going to manipulate search

198
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:16.590
results and they're gonna manipulate the way people see things because of the

199
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:20.190
2016 election. They don't want that happening again in 2020.

200
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.160
That's what it seems when I'm looking at it. Absolutely. That's exactly,

201
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:25.980
it looks like could it be docked? Of course. Good. You know, that's, that's,

202
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.860
that's always possible. But, um,

203
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.300
when you go and experience it for yourself, like what I was talking about with,

204
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.350
you know, doing a keyword search, you start seeing the power willows.

205
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.200
Um, and then, you know, uncle Hotep, you know, he is, his channel was, you know,

206
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.740
doing great. And then the algorithm flipped and they see no,

207
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.630
like he wasn't making the same money anymore.

208
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.230
So it's like I don't have to go to some doctor video or whatever video to

209
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:57.370
understand his problem. The people around me are being affected by it. You know,

210
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.480
this is a primary source. I don't have to look at some money on internet. Um,

211
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.060
but I dunno, it's, it's

212
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.210
in a way I don't like playing victim with the topic, right.

213
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.470
Steer platform, do what you want with it. We choose to be there.

214
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.780
We don't have to be, there does not another game in town though. It's not,

215
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.770
it's weird, right?

216
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.890
When you think about how big the internet is and there's only one YouTube,

217
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.080
right? And Vimeo and all those other ones, they're great. But well, you know,

218
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.120
I always relate it to the black community. You know,

219
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.330
the black community always say, Oh, you know, white people,

220
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.290
this white people that white people just swipe it would ask,

221
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:37.960
they're not giving us opportunity. And it's always like, well,

222
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:41.230
is that the only opportunity? Can you not create your own opportunity?

223
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.550
You know what I mean? So I never want to take a victim mentality and say, Oh,

224
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.880
you know, let's take Google to court. You know, all this stuff. It's like,

225
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:52.090
if you want to do that, that's fine. That's not how I'm looking at this.

226
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.930
I'm looking at it longterm, like hooking up Andrew Torb over at gap,

227
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.620
you know what I mean? And building tools. So, you know, we do a,

228
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:04.570
the coin bits app.com and uh, creators can actually, um, it's,

229
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.100
it's based upon approval right now,

230
00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:09.730
but creators can go on there and receive Bitcoin as a donation, you know,

231
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:11.740
so we're circumventing the things that happen,

232
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:13.750
like with the de platforming at Patriot, right?

233
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.990
And the other payment platforms for creators.

234
00:13:16.991 --> 00:13:20.540
So we're creating tools to circumvent these things. So that's how I look at it.

235
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.300
I'm like, Oh, Google is doing this. Great. This is a great opportunity here.

236
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.040
Let me seize it and let me build it. And B, you know, the alternative, you know,

237
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.050
I love to see that. Um,

238
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.460
is the alternative going to be YouTube and as popular? Of course not,

239
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.450
it's just not, but it's still a viable option.

240
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:43.090
You can still communicate with your people.

241
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.850
The number one communication tool for an influencer, what their,

242
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.380
what their row community is. Email, build your email list, right?

243
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.220
People still subscribe to your email lists, right? That's not YouTube.

244
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:57.160
That's not Google. That's your email list. That's your contact list.

245
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.100
So it's like, you can complain about YouTube or Google,

246
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:02.860
but you can build your audience almost anywhere.

247
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.840
It depends on how powerful you are.

248
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:08.320
Are you powerful enough to convince people to come to this other platform or to

249
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:09.190
wherever you are?

250
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.820
A lot of people are powerful enough to pack a room at $2,000 a ticket.

251
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.910
You tell them you can't get somebody to go to another platform for free.

252
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.840
Who charges $2,000 a ticket. Uh, I mean, a lot of these speakers, you know,

253
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:24.430
like the Tony Robbins type cats, he charges 2000 bucks. I think Charles like 10.

254
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.460
Yeah. I think, I think some of his stuff is like 10,

255
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.770
but he's doing like these week long events where everybody gets together.

256
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:36.100
I'm going to turn your large doing karate kicks and shit

257
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.960
when you would ask how you get the biggest check,

258
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.330
you've got to create a bigger experience. So it's like, all right,

259
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:46.360
so we'll do a one day at two K right? It's like, well, how do I get 10 K?

260
00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:49.510
It's like, well, let's just extend it for the week and you know, add like,

261
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.340
you know, the kickboxing class and you know, we'll chat

262
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.100
<v 0>in a sauna. You just, you know, create that part of the marketing, you know?</v>

263
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.730
Yeah. Um, but yeah, I'm not complaining about these tech companies,

264
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.810
these tech companies. Man, I'm not scared of these dudes, man. He did.

265
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:05.540
The content is us. The content is certainly us.

266
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:10.541
And I get what I got from talking to Jack and Vigia was it's almost impossible

267
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:13.700
to manage a site like that.

268
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.940
The the just the influx of not like I used to have a message board or my website

269
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.810
and one of the things that I noticed before we shut it down was I was getting

270
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.200
thousands and thousands of Russian emails that were signing up for my website.

271
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.770
This is what you remember that Jamie [inaudible], this is years ago,

272
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:34.520
this is like three years ago. Okay. I mean fucking fat,

273
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.660
like tens of thousands of Russian email addresses.

274
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.590
We're signing up like similar addresses. It was something like the IRA,

275
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:44.120
something like the internet research agency,

276
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:48.080
which does that which is responsible for all those fake pages on Facebook and

277
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:49.610
Google and Instagram and all that shit.

278
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.910
And they were signing up for websites and that had message boards and then they

279
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:57.890
would jump on and pretend that they were whatever the fuck they were,

280
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.260
pretend that they were a social justice warrior,

281
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.560
pretend that there was black lives matter and they just start fights,

282
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.800
start arguments. And it was like, wow, this is fascinating. And then when it,

283
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.240
when it also happened,

284
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.600
and then it happened with Facebook and it became a big part of the election.

285
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.280
You realize like this is like concerted effort to use these platforms to wiggle.

286
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:20.030
So when your Jack or your, whoever runs goo, you have to look at that and go,

287
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:23.570
okay, hello. Fuck, do we manage that? I mean, if we're in a free speech,

288
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:26.990
we should just let these people manipulate everybody, right? Let it be wild,

289
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.033
wild West.

290
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.160
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
