ANN KIRSCHNER: Thank you.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.570
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.810
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.140
I'm here to talk about "Lady at
the O.K. Corral." And it's

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.970
wonderful to talk to the Google
audience, since who

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.560
could write a book today
without Google?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.730
And I was here with my first
book, "Sala's Gift."

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.370
I was first intrigued by the
story of Josephine Marcus Earp

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.250
when I learned that she'd been
a Jewish woman in Tombstone.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.000
A Jewish woman in Tombstone sort
of sounds like a joke you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.260
might read on "The Onion." And
I thought about how much I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.590
thought I knew about the Old
West, which turned out to be

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.880
mostly untrue.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.560
And so this became for me a
journey into the untold story

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.390
of the Old West.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.820
Like a lot of people who grew
up in the '50s, it was all

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.320
about watching Wyatt
Earp on television.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.670
That's actually a picture
of me as a baby.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.590
And the things that I thought
I didn't know began to

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.510
overwhelm the things
that I did know.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.570
For instance, where were
the women of the West?

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.910
When you read the early stories
about Tombstone and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.900
the frontier, it was is if there
were no wives, mothers,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.260
women, daughters of any kind.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.600
Because all you read
about was the men.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.250
And yet, I was finding out
that there was a woman in

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.000
Tombstone, a Jewish woman
in Tombstone,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.690
named Josephine Marcus.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.592
So that was enormously
intriguing to me.

00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:42.720
Then there was the idea of the
gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.100
So I have a Google Alert
on O.K. Corral.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.870
And every single day, there is
something in the news that

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.530
evokes the idea of
the O.K. Corral.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.660
It may be something totally
unrelated, something like a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.610
congressional showdown,
or an NBA game, or a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.760
teachers' union fight.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.810
I remember seeing that one.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.210
But every single day,
there's something.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.950
It is sunk so deeply into the
American psyche as the idea of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.350
confrontation.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.220
And yet, here was this woman,
this gutsy, busty broad, who

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.960
had a lover on both sides
of the O.K. Corral.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.530
So instead of the story of
politics and power that I

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.400
thought the O.K. Corral was all
about, it was also a tale

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.480
of jealousy and revenge.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.950
And then there's the story
of Wyatt Earp himself.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.870
We think of him as the law man,
wearing the white hat.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.110
Well, it turns out that the
story that we know was really

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.490
shaped by Josephine Marcus
Earp, his wife.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.000
This was a way for a good, clean
story to be told about

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.810
Wyatt, and Josephine was really
a master of celebrity

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.970
and image shaping.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.445
But let me take you back
to the beginning

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:03.350
of Josephine's life.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.580
What she told everybody was that
she was the daughter of a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.600
wealthy German merchant.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.780
None of that was true.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.860
Her family was not wealthy,
and they were not German.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.630
They were actually
from Prussia,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.390
or what is now Poland.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.630
And that's a very important
distinction, as it turns out.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.780
So her family came to the United
States around 1850.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.490
Josephine was born in 1860.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.180
They lived in New York.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.710
She lived in New York during
the Civil War.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.830
And then her family was
not doing pretty well

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.740
economically.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.550
Her dad was struggling to
make it as a baker.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.470
And everywhere in the New York
press, you would read about

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.920
San Francisco, and all the
wonderful things that were

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.470
happening in San Francisco.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.300
And that was even before
Silicon Valley.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.610
So Josephine's family picked up
again, and left New York,

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.375
and went out to San Francisco.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.050
And they would've arrive by
steamer through the Isthmus of

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.200
Panama, which had opened
fairly recently.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.720
The community that they arrived
in was a thriving

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.850
Jewish community, but it was a
highly stratified community.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.480
There were the German Jews,
who tended to be the more

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.230
affluent, educated, politically
involved Jews.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.980
And then there was
everybody else.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.060
And the Polish Jews were
at the bottom of

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.830
the everybody else.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.390
So Josephine grew up in a San
Francisco where her family was

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.050
on the wrong side
of the tracks.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.830
And Josephine was not a young
woman who wanted to be on the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.300
wrong side of anything.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.960
So she ran away from home.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.980
She was about 18 years old,
and the Pinafore craze was

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.710
sweeping America, to an
extent that you cannot

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.410
even imagine now.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.700
But every town seemed to have
a Pinafore company.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.880
Josephine wasn't much of a
singer, but she was kind of a

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.930
good dancer, and felt that she
could act her way through a

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.460
part on the Pinafore.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.110
And so she joined a touring
company that was going to the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.060
Arizona territory.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.840
She joined the Pauline Markham
touring company.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.880
And there's Ms. Markham lying
out on the couch there.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.450
And she danced the sailors
hornpipe, and was pretty

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.150
competent at it.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.370
But the important thing was
that while she was on tour

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.630
with the company, she caught the
eye of the man who would

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.870
soon become the first sheriff
of Cochise County.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.860
No, not Wyatt Earp.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.670
Johnny Behan.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.825
So she comes to--

00:05:39.825 --> 00:05:43.580
Ooh, you know what, let
me cover her up.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.480
And before I even get you to
Tombstone, let me tell you a

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.950
little bit about what Josephine
looked like.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.320
She was small.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.920
She was very curvy.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.400
And we don't really know
anything about authenticated

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.230
pictures of her as a young
woman, because she either

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.730
destroyed them or they were
lost, possibly in the 1906 San

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.110
Francisco earthquake.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.050
And most of the pictures
that you find online

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.910
today are not her.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.420
But I've done an extensive
amount of analysis with a

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.190
forensic artist who's a
professor at John Jay College

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.610
at the City University of New
York to take the authenticated

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.390
photographs that we have of
Josephine, which are mostly of

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.760
her in later life, and to do a
regression analysis to figure

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.710
out which of the photos that
had been put forth about

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.990
Josephine really might be her.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.400
So if you look at these
photographs here, the ones

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.440
along the top are ones that I
have some reason to believe

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.230
are Josephine, and have
been examined by

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.500
the forensic analyst.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.010
And the ones at the bottom
really are Josephine.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.000
And I've done an interview with
the artist, which you see

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.250
up at LadyattheOKCorral.com.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.870
I would give anything for a
picture that I was absolutely

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.280
certain was Josephine.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.820
But in the meantime, we
settle for these.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.830
OK, back to Tombstone.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:22.020
So in 1879, Wyatt Earp and his
brothers arrive in Tombstone.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.330
They all have wives,
common-law wives.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.100
And Wyatt is with Mattie
Blaylock, the woman here over

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.700
on the left.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.110
And that's Wyatt
in the middle.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.400
An incredibly handsome man
of uncommon charisma.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.240
Really quite striking.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.580
And as you'll see, he retains
those characteristics even as

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.720
an older man.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.210
The fellow on the right is
Johnny Behan, the first

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.910
sheriff of Cochise County.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.960
So the people on either side of
Wyatt, those are the people

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.820
that Josephine most didn't
want you to know about.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.300
Because for the rest of her
life, what she would be trying

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.380
to hide would be, first of
all, that she came to

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.240
Tombstone to be the common-law
wife of Johnny Behan.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.380
And second of all, that Wyatt
already had a wife in

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.300
Tombstone, and that was
Mattie Blaylock.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.900
I said she came to Tombstone
to be the common-law wife.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.790
That's not really true.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.710
She came to Tombstone to
marry Johnny Behan.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.530
But when she got there, the
situation was very different.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.220
It turns out that Johnny
had been married.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.270
He was now divorced.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.010
But he had a nine-year-old son,
and he expected Josephine

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.990
to take care of his
nine-year-old son.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.720
That was fine.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.980
Josephine and Albert became
very good friends, and

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.010
remained close for the
rest of her life.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.850
But she didn't count on
Johnny's total lack of

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.290
interest in actually
getting married.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.390
Nor did she count on the fact
that Johnny was a womanizer.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.510
So once she gets there, she
discovers that Johnny is not

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.190
the man she expected to be.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.210
She leaves him.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.270
And that's when she meets Wyatt
Earp, who's now the

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.176
Deputy U.S. Marshal
of Tombstone.

00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:09.430
The gunfight at the
O.K. Corral.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.400
If you want to be a real
insider, you should probably

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.270
raise your hand immediately
and say "but, but, but it

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.760
didn't really take place at
the O.K. Corral, did it?!

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.130
And the truth is,
no, it didn't.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.790
It took place on
Fremont Street,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.090
outside of the O.K. Corral.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.890
But certainly in common
parlance, we think of it as

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.010
the O.K. Corral.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.480
Josephine was in Tombstone.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.460
She heard the shots.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.230
She runs to the site of where
the O.K. Corral was, sees that

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.520
Wyatt, of all the people
involved in the

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.270
shootout, is unscathed.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.740
And she leaves.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.820
The events afterwards involved
Wyatt's brother being murdered

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.420
and his other brother being
severely injured.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:02.060
It's clear at this point that
there's no time anymore for

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.540
romance or love in Tombstone.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.720
Wyatt sends his common-law wife,
Mattie Blaylock, off to

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.640
his parents.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.370
I actually think this was the
most cowardly act that Wyatt

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.500
Earp ever did.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.320
He sends Mattie Blaylock off
to his parents with the

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.540
expectation that he
will come for her.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.870
She could have waited for the
rest of her life, because he

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.750
never was going to
come for her.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.980
Josephine realizes that it's
time for her to get out of

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.530
Tombstone as well, and
she goes back to her

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.720
long-suffering immigrant parents
in San Francisco.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.000
And she, too, is waiting
for Wyatt.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.190
Only Wyatt really does
come for Josephine.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.770
So this couple that met in
this tumultuous time in

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.480
Tombstone--

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.400
which was then the largest city
in Arizona, a bustling

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.840
silver mining town--

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.770
they end up spending the
next 47 years together.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.810
And it is a tale of remarkable
love of adventure.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.580
They were fortune seeking, but
they never really cared that

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.470
much about money.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.940
It was great when they
had it, and they made

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.730
do when they didn't.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.060
But the nonstop love
of adventure is

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.630
what always gets me.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.970
These were two people who
never really grew up.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.000
The greatest adventure that they
had-- or at least the one

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.930
that I think I'm fondest of--

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.440
is when they went to Alaska
for the gold rush.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.150
So when we think about the
Alaska gold rush, we think

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.590
about what it takes
to mine for gold.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.420
All of that was very
labor intensive.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.420
You needed a lot of equipment.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.400
Until 1899.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.870
And in 1899, gold was discovered
in Nome, Alaska.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.950
And it was not only that there
was gold in Nome, Alaska, but

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.340
it was on the public beach, on
the shore of the Bering Sea.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.120
You could go right out there
with a little pan, as you see

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.620
me there on the Bering Sea, and
just shuffle it around,

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.930
and gold would appear.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.260
Imagine.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.290
So you can see the crowds that
are massing, in the picture on

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.240
the upper left, on the
waterfront in Seattle.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.110
By the summer of 1900, when the
news swept America that

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:27.210
you could pan for gold right
on the surface of the sea,

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.930
there were just tens of
thousands of people who were

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.290
trying to get to Nome--

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:37.110
which, the summer before, had
a population of about 50.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.710
There were no hotels,
there was nothing.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.820
There was just these white tents
that you see in this

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.900
fuzzy picture on the
bottom left.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.000
Wyatt and Josephine made
a fortune there.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.380
It was a very difficult time for
Josephine, because she was

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.390
so far away from her family.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.530
She was still very close
to her relatives.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.860
But she stuck it out in Nome.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.440
She stuck it out in all the
places that they went to.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.870
And when they left Nome, they
really had enough money to

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.090
live comfortably for the
rest of their life,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.450
if they were careful.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.830
This was not a careful couple.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.920
Money tended to slip through
their fingers, probably the

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.520
way that those gold flecks went
through your fingers in

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.300
the Bering Sea.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.620
They spent most of the rest of
their life going in a circuit

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.050
between Los Angeles and San
Francisco, Oakland where her

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:37.085
family lived, and to the desert
right between Arizona

00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:39.010
and California.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.550
And this is a picture of them
in their desert camp.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.040
You can see Wyatt
there is feeding

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.350
their little dog, Earpie.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.660
And Josephine, who's gotten
a little portly, is

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.870
looking over them.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.050
Josephine was a woman
who loved luxury.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.910
She loved fancy hotels,
she loved clean

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.160
sheets and good food.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.920
But she also loved
the outdoors.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.340
She also loved living
out in the desert.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.680
And so there were these two
sides to her character.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.930
Similarly, when we think about
my title, "Lady at the O.K.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:18.380
Corral," Josephine's feeling
about being a lady also was

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.540
filled with conflict.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.600
On the one hand, she wanted
to be respectable,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.820
as her sister was.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:30.160
Her sister had become a
successful businesswomen and

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.840
pillar of society in Oakland,
San Francisco.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.390
And Josephine admired
her sister a lot.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.430
But there was a part of
Josephine that was remarkably

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.550
rebellious, and always searching
for adventure.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.040
So when you think of or a living
out and then in the

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.400
desert with Wyatt and their dog,
it was that adventuresome

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.030
side that was uppermost.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.450
As the years go by, Tombstone
is actually never far from

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.130
public consciousness.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:04.800
And in 1929, the first
Helldorado days were held in

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.510
Tombstone--

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.650
which, at this point all
the mines were gone.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.860
It was really just
a tourist town.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.830
But the most important thing
that happened, from Wyatt and

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.690
Josephine's point of view, was
that Hollywood had just come

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.880
to Los Angeles.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.790
And a lot of the early movies
were actually Westerns.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.230
And the two heroes you see here,
William S. Hart and Tom

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.750
Mix, were amongst the most
popular early cowboys.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.920
And they were both very, very
close friends of Wyatt's.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:46.120
And as stories began to appear,
Josephine's ability to

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.400
manage Wyatt's public relations
began to be her

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.980
driving compulsion.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.220
Wyatt was famous in his own
lifetime, but there was always

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.830
controversy about
the O.K. Corral.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.090
Who had shot first?

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:05.300
Was Wyatt a hero or, as I've
heard him described, a

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.430
homicidal maniac?

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.470
So this controversy
was always raging.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.290
Josephine attempted to squash
bad stories if she knew they

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.270
were going to occur.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.680
If they already had come out,
then she would mount a public

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.910
relations campaign.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.340
Again, very modern.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.270
She would reach out to Wyatt's
famous friends, the cowboys,

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:35.450
or people like Tasker Oddie,
the senator and governor of

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.680
Nevada, who was a big fan of
Wyatt's, and get them to write

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.210
stories on Wyatt's behalf.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.990
And then if all else failed,
she would try and get a

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.520
retraction.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.070
Wyatt had been friends in his
youth with the father of

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.870
William Randolph Hearst.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.810
And so Josephine would do things
like call up William

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.890
Randolph Hearst and say, Mr.
Hearst, there's this terrible

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.520
article in the Los
Angeles paper.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.376
You must kill it.

00:17:00.376 --> 00:17:03.080
And if it could be killed,
get me a retraction.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.190
And she would.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.180
She would occasionally
get a retraction.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.869
But that wasn't good enough.

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.810
What they really needed was
to tell their own story.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:18.450
And so when an enterprising
writer and press agent named

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.770
Stuart Lake approached Josephine
and Wyatt with the

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.540
idea of writing a biography,
Josephine thought, well, this

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.030
is the way actually to
get our story out.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.790
We will shape the story.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.570
And he sat with Wyatt
many, many times

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.910
throughout 1928 and '29.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.030
And as it turns out, these
were the last months of

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.360
Wyatt's life.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.360
Until the day he died, he
remained that incredibly

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.970
handsome, tall, strapping, six
foot two fellow that first

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.820
came in to Tombstone.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.270
Josephine, alas--

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.930
this is really not fair--

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.770
but she didn't age as
well as Wyatt did.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.070
And that's a picture of
her in later life.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:09.340
Wyatt died in January 1929.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.770
The scene from the pall
bearers at his funeral

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.260
included Tom Mix and William
S. Hart, as well as

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.700
playwrights like
William Eisner.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.260
And really began to take shape
in a national news story about

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.150
the death of the West, the death
of the Old Frontier,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.960
with Wyatt Earp as its
most famous symbol.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.040
Josephine wrote to Stuart Lake
and asked him to come to the

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.960
funeral, which he did.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.460
And then, in the year following
Wyatt's death,

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.070
finally that book
was published.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.000
And although it's now the height
of the Depression, it

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.100
was an immediate best seller.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.720
And to my knowledge,
has actually

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.730
never gone out of print.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:19:00.380
So Josephine is left alone, no
real means of support, except

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.710
that she does share in the
royalties from the book.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:10.350
And in 1932, 1933, Lincoln
Ellsworth, the famous Arctic

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:15.150
explorer, approaches Josephine
to say that he's going back to

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.240
the South Pole, and he'd like
to go and somehow honor his

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.880
hero, Wyatt Earp.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.220
And he comes up with the
idea of naming his

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.820
ship after Wyatt Earp.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.730
Well, how does Josephine
feel about that?

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.380
Well, we already know, Josephine
is a PR master.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.740
So she thinks this
is a great idea.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.610
And she supplies Lincoln
Ellsworth with Wyatt's last

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.490
pair of eyeglasses,
and she gives him

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.910
one of Wyatt's shotguns.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.340
And Lincoln Ellsworth creates a
little shrine in his cabin.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.735
And off goes the ship.

00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:52.850
And there's a photograph from
the L.A. Times of Josephine

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.590
and Lincoln Ellsworth.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.570
But what's really interesting
here is that it's hard for us

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:02.830
to imagine today how the public
was obsessed with

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.140
Lincoln Ellsworth and this
trip to the Arctic.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.310
Why it was in the
New York Times--

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.040
the name "Wyatt Earp," again,
following the Lincoln

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.100
Ellsworth ship--

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.520
at least once a month
for six years?

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.310
Because people were following
every step of Lincoln

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.210
Ellsworth's voyage.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.150
And when Lincoln Ellsworth was
lost at sea, then it was a

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.170
front page story for
weeks on end.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:34.710
If you look at the York Times
from January 22, 1936, here's

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.540
the day when Edward the Seventh
is proclaimed the new

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.100
leader of England.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.550
And there, over on the left-hand
side of the page, on

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.330
the front page of the New York
Times, is good old Wyatt Earp,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.270
because Lincoln Ellsworth
has been found.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.400
He had been lost at sea.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.370
Now he was found.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.650
And again, Wyatt Earp is
back on the front page.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.130
So in the mid '30s, after the
Stuart Lake biography, you get

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:06.220
this turbo charge of good
PR for Wyatt Earp.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.600
Josephine, I think, was
emboldened by this to think

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.800
that, maybe now it was the
time to tell her story.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.100
And of course, she's eager
for the money on top

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.760
of everything else.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.290
She sees an article in the
L.A. Times about an Earp

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.360
relative who happens
to be a writer.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.710
And she finds a family in
L.A., the Cason and the

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.350
Ackerman family, who
are Earp relatives.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.620
And she begins to work with
these two wonderful women

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.140
about writing her biography.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.860
And there she is over
on the left.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.580
You can see, she's slimmed
down a little bit.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.710
She kind of looks like
a Italian widow.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.940
And there she's with
the Cason family.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.920
They work intensively
together.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.020
They even go back
to Tombstone.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.270
They stop off at what has now
been renamed in honor of Wyatt

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.660
Earp, the town of Earp,
California.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.010
There's Josephine with one
of her biographers.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.300
She visits Tombstone for the
first time since 1882.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.550
That must've been an
incredible journey.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.510
And they write this
memoir together.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.740
I'll take you back here.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:21.260
Only the closer they get to the
truth, the closer they get

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.980
to finding out about Josephine's
relationship to

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.240
Johnny Behan and the story
of Mattie Blaylock.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.170
Josephine to began to get really
nervous about this.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.900
I told you that Mattie Blaylock
had gone back to

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.170
Wyatt's parents.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:43.510
When Wyatt never did show up for
her, Mattie finally read

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.460
the tea leaves, and left
his parents' house.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.820
She had no visible means of

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.650
support, very little education.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.880
She became a prostitute, a drug
addict, and eventually

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.430
committed suicide, telling
anybody who would listen that

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.020
this had all happened
because she had been

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.040
deserted by Wyatt Earp.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.050
That's the story that
Josephine didn't

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.220
want anyone to know.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.340
And so the more digging the
Cason family was doing into

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.080
Josephine's past, the more
nervous she became.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.370
Until she became so nervous that
she said, that's the end

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.170
of the biography.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.390
We're not going to
do this memoir.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:28.370
She forced them to burn the
manuscript, and she put a

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.440
curse on anyone who would
tell her story.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.980
Which I confess, sometimes
makes me nervous.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.450
But I figure there must
be a statute of

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.530
limitations on that.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.570
After that happened,
Josephine's life

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.890
spiraled down herself.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:51.120
She had very little money, and
she was increasingly paranoid,

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.340
and would go to visit some
of Wyatt's friends--

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.580
one in particular named
John Flood.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.230
Sort of stalking him.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.920
And he got nervous, and began to
record the things that she

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.410
would do, like the day that she
showed up at his door, put

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.330
her fist through the screen,
and said "I'll get back at

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:14.320
you, good and hard." And this is
from a manuscript page that

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.220
John Flood wrote, I guess
keeping track of Josephine's

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.940
activities.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.990
But she didn't have too
much longer to live.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.570
She died in 1944.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:30.730
When Wyatt died, Josephine,
whose feeling about being

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:35.830
Jewish was pretty much, well,
it's a fact about me, but--

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.570
as Nora Ephron said-- not
necessarily the most important

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.710
fact about me.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.160
She really had very little
relationship to any of the

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.600
Jewish communities that were
at the time in Tombstone or

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.920
Nome or any of those.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.660
And yet, when it came time to
figure out where to bury Wyatt

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.850
Earp, she did turn back
to her religion.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.700
And she buried him in the Jewish
cemetery outside of San

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.220
Francisco, where her parents
were buried.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.220
When she died in 1944,
destitute, and her funeral

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.000
expenses were paid by Sidney
Grauman, as of Grauman's

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.490
Theater, and William S. Hart.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.200
They had been friends of
Josephine's and Wyatt's.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.550
Her funeral was officiated over
by a rabbi, and then she

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.700
was buried in the
same cemetery.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:29.750
So the story of Josephine and
Wyatt, which stretches over

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:35.910
these 47 years, it took me to
a lot of different places.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:40.670
I didn't actually go everywhere
on this map.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.470
I think I missed El Paso.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.420
But there was a tremendous
amount of research

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.100
that went into it.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.480
And I thought you might want to
take a look at some of the

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.870
original letters that I used
to put the story together.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.980
Any time you assemble a story
like this, it's kind of like a

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.590
giant jigsaw puzzle.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.960
And Josephine's original
letters were very

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.980
much part of it.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.920
By the way, one of the things
I discovered in working with

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.170
some young college students at
Macaulay Honors College is

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.790
that they didn't know how to
read cursive handwriting.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.540
They kept wanting me to put it
through optical character

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.040
recognition, and it would
all come out great.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.310
I said, now, now, it doesn't
quite work that way yet.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.995
So we had a very interesting
time teaching 20-somethings

00:26:27.995 --> 00:26:29.660
how to read Josephine's
handwriting.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.020
Which I can read very well,
but that's because I'm a

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.330
little older.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.390
There was also a tremendous
amount of work to be done.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:44.910
The Cason family, I told you
they were ordered to burn that

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.645
manuscript by Josephine.

00:26:46.645 --> 00:26:48.250
They didn't do it.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.270
There was a copy that they
kept of the manuscript.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:56.120
And that manuscript sits today
in Dodge City, where I spent

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.000
many happy days working on it.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.850
Again, these are interesting
skills that are not

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.490
necessarily I'm going to be
around in the 22nd century.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.950
But in the 21st century, the
ability to look at a

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.580
handwritten, hand-edited
manuscript

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.940
is still very important.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.550
And I did work in many fine
libraries and archives.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:23.960
It was really a wonderful
research project for me.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.280
So that's the story of Josephine
Marcus Earp, the

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.270
untold story of Josephine
Marcus Earp.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.790
To my mind, you can't tell the
story of American history

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.720
without the story of the Old
West and the frontier.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.320
And you can't tell that story
without putting the women back

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.910
in the picture.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.020
And when it comes to putting
women back in the picture, I

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.620
don't think you get much more
interesting than Josephine

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.170
Marcus Earp.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.520
Thank you very much.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.730
Any questions for me?

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.250
You know, if you want to ask
me about the first time I

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.040
heard the word Google, I
could tell you that.

00:28:06.956 --> 00:28:07.442
Oh.

00:28:07.442 --> 00:28:08.414
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the photos.

00:28:08.414 --> 00:28:09.386
ANN KIRSCHNER: Yes.

00:28:09.386 --> 00:28:11.816
You say that you had
them verified.

00:28:11.816 --> 00:28:15.947
What was that process like, and
why did you decide to go

00:28:15.947 --> 00:28:18.160
through it?

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.320
ANN KIRSCHNER: The question was,
why did I feel that I had

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.890
to authenticate the photos
of Josephine Earp?

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:30.520
The world of what I call "Planet
Earp" is an extremely

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.420
contentious one.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.650
I did my last book on
Holocaust history.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.920
And I thought that was a
very complicated world.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.790
And it certainly is.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:46.540
But the contentiousness, the
quarrels, the feuds amongst

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.040
Earp historians--

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.230
and there are many amateur
Earp historians--

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.480
are unlike anything
I have ever seen.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.760
They are still fighting the
gunfight at the OK corral.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.020
As a result, there's a great
deal of skepticism.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.810
Well, you didn't really
find that.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.080
That's really not true.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.510
And so I knew that whatever I
did would be questioned and

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.560
questioned and questioned
again.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.200
So I felt that I had to take
the pictures that--

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.750
If you go on Wikipedia--

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.180
until I change it--

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.350
the picture that's up there
now is absolutely not

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.360
Josephine Marcus Earp.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.470
It makes no sense from
any analysis.

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.440
And yet, people have
put it forth.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.390
It's like the tale of the
Loch Ness Monster.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.070
If somebody's making money on
something, they have all the

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.190
reasons to keep that
legend up.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.180
And so that's why I went to
such great lengths to

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.430
authenticate the photographs.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.420
AUDIENCE: How many other women
did you find while you were

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.350
researching Josephine
Marcus Earp?

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.330
You said that there
were a lot.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.650
Can you name or offer
any other stories

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:57.690
about who you found?

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.360
ANN KIRSCHNER: There
were a lot.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.170
In the category of women of
the West and women in

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.020
Tombstone, there was some very
interesting characters.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.850
Like Nellie Cachman, who is a
very successful entrepreneur

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:12.710
in Tombstone.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.360
I thought she was absolutely
fascinating.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.140
And I was also interested in the
story of women like Addie

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.100
Borland, who was the milliner
in town, who was the only

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.020
woman to testify at the inquest
after the gunfight at

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.060
the O.K. Corral.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:36.410
But when you look at the
possible roles for women in

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.980
Tombstone, there really
weren't a

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.380
whole lot of choices.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.490
There was one woman
who ran a school.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.830
And there was one woman
who was there--

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.080
Actually, let me pause on her.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.520
Probably, to me,
one of the most

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.610
interesting women in Tombstone.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:00.020
She was a journalist.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.390
And for some reason, right now
because you've asked me, I'm

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:03.220
blanking on her name.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.590
But I'm going to come
up with in a second.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.050
She was from San Diego.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:12.630
And she wrote dispatches back
to the San Diego paper over

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.780
the course of a year and a
half, which included the

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.150
gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:24.520
And so many of the firsthand
impressions we have

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.710
come from her pen.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.440
And she had a career afterwards
as a successful

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.350
journalist.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:37.350
She was one of the examples
of professional women.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.420
But there were many other women
who were there as wives

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.780
and family people.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.530
John Clum, the mayor,
was married to a

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.820
very interesting woman.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.850
And there were an awful
lot of prostitutes in

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.150
Tombstone as well.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.720
The community that followed
the boom towns included

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.240
gamblers, saloon keepers,
and prostitutes.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.590
And as the next boom
town emerged, they

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.410
would come to the fore.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.950
So lots of interesting women.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.680
The other category of women
that I've now gotten

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.970
interested in is the category
of the woman behind the man,

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.350
the women who shapes
the man's story.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.010
I've told you that I
think this was a

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:27.100
burning passion for Josephine.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.390
Think about Nancy Reagan.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.090
How could you ever have a
biography of Ronald Reagan

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.240
that didn't talk about Nancy?

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.920
Or Libbie Custer, who spent most
of her life scrubbing out

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.640
the image of Custer, and making
sure that what he would

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.300
be remembered for is what
she thought he would

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.490
be remembered for.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.940
By the way, Josephine's efforts
to keep the story of

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.990
Johnny Behan and Mattie Blaylock
away from us was

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.890
really entirely successful
in her own lifetime.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:04.560
In 1955, the story of Mattie
Blaylock did emerge.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.950
But it hasn't been
widely told.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.000
It certainly hasn't overshadowed
the legend of

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.030
Wyatt Earp.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.500
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
there were Jewish communities

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.660
in Tombstone and Nome.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.680
How large were those
communities?

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.310
ANN KIRSCHNER: They
were pretty large.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:26.730
There was a Hebrew Benevolent
Association that had, I would

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.920
say, somewhere between 50
and 100 people who were

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.950
part of it in Tucson.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:36.140
There were Jews who served on
the jury for the inquest

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.530
following the gunfight.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:45.160
In Nome, Alaska, the story of
the first High Holy Days

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.270
services in September, 1900 was
a front page story in the

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.150
Nome newspapers.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.690
Today, they call them the
"frozen chosen." and there are

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.590
large Jewish communities
throughout--

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.930
well, large is probably
an exaggeration.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:08.290
There are sizable Jewish
communities throughout Alaska.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:12.540
Part of the story of the
economic settling of Alaska

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.800
was the Alaska Commercial
Company, which was started in

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.449
San Francisco--

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:22.699
actually, originally started by
the Russian government, but

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.969
was then bought by
a group of Jewish

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:28.630
businessmen in San Francisco.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:34.040
And was really the company store
in places like Nome Or

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.489
Rampart, Alaska, which
was another place

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.600
that the Earps were.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.940
And I often think, particularly
in Tombstone,

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:46.290
when Josephine left Johnny Behan
and was not publicly

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.730
together with Wyatt, those
must have been very

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.159
dark days for her.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:56.400
And yet, I never found any
evidence that she turned for

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.840
support or comfort to the
Jewish community.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.300
And that distinction I made
between the German and the

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.760
Polish Jews, which was so
important in San Francisco,

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.140
was really meaningless
in the frontier.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.140
No one really seemed to care
about that at all.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.060
Clara Brown.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.100
Clara Spalding Brown.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.490
Memory's a funny thing.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.740
But somewhere in that
last question, her

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.310
name came to my mind.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.780
Thank you very much.
