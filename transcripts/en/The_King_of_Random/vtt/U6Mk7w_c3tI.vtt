00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey, what's up guys? I'm hanging out today with Cody from Cody's lab

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.200
He's went down to the coin shop and bought some of these

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.300
90% junk Silver coins because we're gonna melt these things down and see if we can turn them into genuine silver bullets

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.059
What would you actually use a silver bullet for other than killing a werewolf? I don't know but that's what we're gonna do today

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.449
Let's get to it

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.429
Apparently there's a lot of different ways that you can melt down silver now if you're on Cody's channel

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.829
You can be using some weird experiment like making silver thermite to do this you use a chemical reaction about the silver

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.429
But since we're in my basement today. I'm going to be using the mini Arc furnace

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.398
It's very small very compact. We can get this thing to extreme temperatures . So there you go guys backyard bullet making 101

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.060
Here we go

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.219
Now to make an identical copy of our bullets in silver

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.809
I'm going to be using some of this petrobond sand it holds together extremely well, and I'll take the shape of our bullets

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.729
I'm going to put this wooden retaining wall around it and sprinkle some of the sand and pack it down nice and tight to create

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.200
our molds

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.659
All right, you can see how well that sand is packed in there now theoretically if we pull those plugs out

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.629
We should have little molds. Oh look. Did they come out? Yeah, and actually I'll stuck together brilliant heck

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.360
I wish I would have had this stuff when I was making my silver molds

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.379
All right guys the time has come we have got everything set up

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.610
We've got our molds here ready to go. We've got our Arc furnace carved out ready to go here

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.729
We've got our carbon electrodes ready to be fired up

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.570
Here's the coins

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.690
Think we're just gonna melt the coins right in there because that'll give us the option to pick this up and pour it exactly where we want it to go.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.719
So we've got our silver coins in the Arc furnace now

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.440
all we have to do is put on the lid and fire this thing up like so

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.280
Oops. It came off. It snapped. What's cool is those coins are almost melted already.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280
I don't know if you can see that

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.870
There you go, you can see that

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.080
My bad, that's metal

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.959
Here we go check that out guys

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.899
The coins are almost melted and that was only about 25 seconds

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.420
But unfortunately my carbon rod broke so we're going to do a quick repair and get back into it for a second try I might

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.459
be able to just melt this without the lid on it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.660
Check this out guys, so even without a lid we got this thing completely molten that is glowing orange, and it's ready to be poured

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.680
It's like the oil in the sand is burning

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.559
Here we go at least we got one more bullet out of that

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.369
Just give that a little bit of time to cool down, and then I guess we can chop those bullets out of there

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.549
What do you think of my Arc furnace? That, is hot.

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.999
This is cooled down enough to the point where I can touch it

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.519
so I think we can go ahead and dig these bullets out. Over here we've got Cody's bullet from his thermite reaction

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.828
Looks like we've got a couple of reasonable casts

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.720
Throw those in some water. Cody's is gonna be pure silver and that actually turned out really nice

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.509
Yeah, it's a little rough, but the gun will still fire

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.609
Here's how our silver coin bullets turned out you can see the shape is pretty good. They're a little bit crude

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.100
After sanding and polishing that's what we got cool little silver bullet, okay measuring the weight. We got our copper bullet weighs in at about

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.540
124 Grams

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.140
exactly our silver bullet weighs in at

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.720
94 Grains so it's a little bit lighter which means it's Gonna go a little bit faster check it out guys

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:57.700
This is the original

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.839
9-Millimeter bullet used for my glock 19 and these are our silver bullets reloaded into the same casings the bullets are a little bit lighter

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.500
weight than the lead

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.859
But they should work just fine

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:06.479
All right

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.529
Check it out check it out just to do things right we came out here with the silver bullet and a handgun and a werewolf

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.829
Target, we're gonna shoot this thing just to see if it actually works or not

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.759
Don't know if it's the safest idea, but we're going to give it a shot for your viewing entertainment

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.729
So check it out apparently our improvised silver rounds actually do work how cool is that let's check out the damage you hit him?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.130
I think a grazed his shoulder there

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.650
Questions if we can recover the bullet

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.289
Looks like it's wedged out in there a little ways didn't come out the back so cool. We may be able to recover that

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.060
That does have some kick to it

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:51.629
Actually made it through the woods yet. Oh, it came, right through oh dang our silver bullets are powerful. Where did it go?

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.229
There it is dude. No way check it out. That actually looks surprisingly intact

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.720
Yeah

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.449
Looks like it's got a little bit of riflings in it how cool is that guys we could almost take that back and reload it

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.349
And shoot it again

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.799
This is my favorite silver bullet it came out really you know it looks really shiny it is a little bit pocked

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.530
But is that Gonna make a difference to way it shoots and find out right now

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.399
Right through the face look at that right through the schnoz

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.068
Actually looks like his mouth is open now. That's cool

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.459
that was silver it would have got him all right Cody what you got? What are you doing here?

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.819
So this is the pure silver bullet short and stubby one should still work though

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.209
This is the one that we made with this thermite reaction eat precious metals

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.629
Check it out look at the damage

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.069
I think it'd be going down after a shot like that. Definitely went into the wood there cool

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.069
Let's split it open and see how they look

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.879
Doesn't get much better than that. I'll see you one there. Oh sweet. Sweet let me check it out

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:56.179
I went from here to here. That's a that's a reasonable distance. Yeah, it actually looks like it's in really good condition

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.250
the wood kind of polished it even

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.949
Because I shinier than when I went in yeah, it's the Shelby one. It's our pure silver yep, yay

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.069
precious Metal Bullet recovered

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.568
ok our several rounds worked and we were able to recover two of the bullets from inside of that stump

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.749
Which it's really impressive the condition that these things are in I mean

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.729
They're a little bit rough, but almost could just polish them up and reload them use them I didn't have like a red core

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.739
So they didn't mushroom or anything. They just went in and stopped. I think they'll do well for the purpose they were designed for

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:32.869
So we have had some success. We made silver bullets from nothing but some silver coins, mini Arc furnace

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.659
We melted them down used a sand mold they came out a little bit crude

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.019
But you know what we now have some fully functional werewolf deterrent

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.219
Which we may or may not ever have to use, but it was a lot of fun

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.809
It was so big thanks to cody for conan hanging out today. This is great cody's lab. Go check him out

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.349
He's got a lot of experiments with chemicals that I can't pronounce and also on his channel

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.019
You're gonna see the termite reaction heated with silver oxide

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.379
It is like pure silver is it not this would be fine silver fine silver, so that's awesome. Go check them out cody's lab

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.620
Thanks for joining us in this video guys when we looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.420
ah ha ha ha ha ha
