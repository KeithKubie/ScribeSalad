00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.425
Congratulations. You've completed this course.

00:00:02.425 --> 00:00:04.915
&gt;&gt; Thank you for taking the time and effort to do so.

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:07.939
&gt;&gt; And we hope you've appreciated taking this class as much as we have creating

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:08.918
it.

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:11.942
&gt;&gt; And we want to give a special thanks to everyone who made this possible, from

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:15.014
our guest experts to our team here at Udacity, with a special thanks to Calvin

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:19.135
and Kugory who helped us produce this course.

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.075
&gt;&gt; And now that we've come to a close in the course

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:24.671
&gt;&gt; We hope you can fully appreciate understanding psychology; that is human

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:29.396
thought and behavior. Both scientifically and clinically and about sometimes

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:33.101
how these processes can go wrong, but if they do there are treatment options to

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:35.165
help people.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.420
&gt;&gt; That's right. And we also hope you appreciate the complexity of our brains as

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.300
well as knowing that we need to have a healthy brain to function successfully

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.350
in our world. In addition, we hope that you appreciate the environment and how

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.600
that shapes our behavior, and how it's really a combination of both nature and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.298
nurture that makes you, you.

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:55.809
&gt;&gt; And because we're dedicated to making this the very best course we can make it.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.455
We hope that you can give us feedback on this anonymous survey to tell us what

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:02.972
you liked, what you loved, and what you thought needed improvement. And even

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:05.239
though you're done, check back in from time to time, because we're going to add

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.366
new material.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.331
&gt;&gt; And you can further your knowledge on Psychology.

00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.344
&gt;&gt; 'Kay, cut. That's a wrap.

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:11.885
&gt;&gt; It is a wrap.

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:12.596
&gt;&gt; Yay.

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:13.955
&gt;&gt; Woo. [clapping]
