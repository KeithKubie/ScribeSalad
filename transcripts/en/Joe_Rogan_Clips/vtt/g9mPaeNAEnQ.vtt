1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.220
I had a lunch with Erich von Daniken last week.
Oh my God.
Yes.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.690
Very interesting.
Very weird.
Yeah.
He's the guy who wrote chariots of the gods.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.250
Oh yeah,
yeah.
In his eighties now.
And uh,

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.160
he was showing us slides.
What's the real story there?

5
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.960
I was wondering mostly nonsense,
unfortunately.
Yeah.

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.820
Yeah.
Mostly.
Mostly what it is is evidence of lost civilizations,

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.310
ancient civilizations that were incredibly advanced.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.380
I follow the work of Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson and a few other people

9
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:38.190
that are being proven actually correct more and more,

10
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.410
almost on a daily basis by new discoveries that show that that civilization

11
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.410
predates what we initially thought.

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.480
[inaudible] the initial thought was that somewhere around the great pyramids,

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
which is like 2,500 BC,
that was about as good as anybody got.

14
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.500
And you go back to like ancient to mayor,

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.530
which is about 6,000 years ago and that,
that's basically it.

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.540
What they're saying is that no,
there was most likely a reset,

17
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.650
a global reset of civilization due to a cataclysmic disaster.

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.450
And there's a shit ton of evidence.

19
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
There's massive evidence in the form of this nuclear glass that exists when

20
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.590
there's asteroidal impacts.
And um,

21
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.770
also there was a guy named doctor Robert Schoch was one of the first guys to

22
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:25.470
propose this.
It's actually when he freaked me on the podcast,

23
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:29.130
he said there was a mass coronal ejection that most likely,

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.160
because lightning storms like rainstorm but lightning like that much light,

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.570
they're destroying the ground.

26
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.120
And that the only people that survive where people that could get under cover

27
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.120
that could get into a terrible yeah.

28
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:47.121
And the mass extinction of 60 plus percent of the large mammals in a very short

29
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:51.790
window of time,
almost instantaneously North America,
the,

30
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:55.710
the end of the Ice Age,
like 10,000 plus years ago,

31
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:59.460
there was a mile high ice in most of North America,

32
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.300
most of North America covered in ice and then gone and all these,

33
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.500
all these areas,
all of these points of interest point to this one,

34
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.270
one moment in time,

35
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:14.160
that's somewhere between 10 and 12,000 years ago that some big event happened

36
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.130
and that most likely just crippled civilization.

37
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.590
And then people had to rebuild whatever people were around that because it's

38
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:26.591
also that they found like just looking at DNA that all of humanity at one point

39
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.830
got wiped out except for like one village.
There was only that.
Everyone is,

40
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.780
everyone has descended from the same group of about 5,000 people as well.

41
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:41.710
There was a super volcano that erupted somewhere around 70,000 years ago that

42
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:46.550
they think this is predating this cataclysmic disaster of 12,000 years ago that

43
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.970
they are pretty sure wiped human beings down to a few thousand folks.
Yeah.

44
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.690
Where are these elders that turns that and like,
I want to say it's,
where's that?

45
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.980
That super volcano,
there's,
there's a super volcano that knocked everybody down.

46
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.100
We'll

47
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.540
<v 1>find it.
Yeah.
We've got one under Yosemite or Yellowstone.
Yellowstone.</v>

48
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.970
Yellowstone is going to get us all every six to 800,000 years.
It blows do right.

49
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.700
That's why I don't go camping.
Don't go.

50
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.760
That's might not be the worst place to go.
Like go camping.

51
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.670
They over it that way I can.
Yeah.
That way when it ends,
it ends quick.

52
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:21.830
You don't want to be living in New York now I'm just choking cloud.

53
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.300
Yeah.
That's the worst.
Watching people eat homeless folks in the street.
Yeah.

54
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.970
There's no,
uh,
there's not now in the place.
Yeah.
Well,
well,

55
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.550
there's also like things that fly through space and zip by,
you know,

56
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:38.530
like they're,
they're,
they're just constantly finding these things.

57
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.760
That's the lights,
things,
the air find Dan again,
thing I remember as a kid going,

58
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.110
my,

59
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.810
my problem is that they kept showing all these massive paintings that can only

60
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.290
be seen from the sky.
So therefore there must have been drawn for aliens.

61
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.750
And I can know if you believe God is looking down on you,

62
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.610
you're going to draw a big paintings for God to look at.
So you don't need that.

63
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.670
But now,
but now I'm more the,
uh,

64
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.730
thing I've become obsessed with lately.

65
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.200
Is this the skepticism about Ufos?
Yeah.

66
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.810
That's why I want to talk to you about this because you told me that you've

67
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.760
become obsessed with Ufos were silly.
Oh yeah.
Completely.
And it's like,
yeah,

68
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.600
totally.
Really?
Yeah.
Totally believe the UFO phenomenon is real.

69
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.860
I don't know what it is,
but it's totally,
it has to be real.
Some things happened.

70
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:25.840
Why is that?
Because there's just way too much evidence that it is real.

71
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.670
What evidence?
Uh,
well,
uh,
radar evidence,
uh,
that the,

72
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:35.650
the f 16 locked on a Ufo,
that footage and also just,
uh,

73
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.830
like I know that friend of ours,
I don't know if she wants to say it,

74
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:43.500
but her father was an air traffic controller and he told her,
they said,
yeah,

75
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.980
every air traffic controller has seen something.
Yeah.

76
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.840
And I had another friend whose father was in a commercial pilot and she said,

77
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.170
yeah,

78
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.980
my dad said every single pilot has seen something and they've all been told not

79
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:54.814
to say anything about it.

80
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.840
We have a couple of friends that say they were abducted.
Deducted.
Yeah.

81
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.520
The abducted one is a little easier to wrap your head around because when you're

82
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:07.360
sleeping,
your brain is producing all sorts of endogenous psychedelic chemicals.

83
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.690
Yeah.
Almost all of these experiences happen when you're sleeping.

84
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.940
Almost all these experience,
when these people were abducted,

85
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.650
they're taken from their beds,
which is when they're dreaming.
I mean,

86
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:17.500
it's like there's some real clear,

87
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:20.590
easy steps to follow if you want to fall Occam's razor and not,

88
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.290
you're not get crazy with it knocks those out,

89
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.880
but it doesn't knock out like Barney and Betty Hill and all the people that are

90
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:28.690
abducted will fully conscious and that and that remember it without
hypnotherapy.

91
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.840
I'm like,
I'm not sure about the abduction phenomenon,

92
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.800
but I don't know Barney and Betty Hill.
I know the story,
but I don't know them.

93
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.160
Yeah.

94
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.510
So I would have to know them because there's a lot of people that I've taught,

95
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:43.790
like I did a show for Scifi called Joe Rogan questions.
Everything.
Yeah.

96
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.520
I watch that show that cured me and show cured me of a lot of my nonsense with

97
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.060
with conspiracies when we used to talk about,
yes.
Yeah,

98
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.380
that's definitely the time.
All the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I,

99
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.460
I needed to actually study it.
So for six,
that's basically

100
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.240
<v 0>all I did.</v>

101
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.530
I interviewed people and I like big foot believers,

102
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.880
Ufo believers,

103
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.881
all and the one thing that they have in common is they all seem to be kind of

104
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:15.940
lost and dependent upon this thing being real instead of being objective.

105
00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:20.410
There was only one lady that I interviewed that saw bigfoot that really seemed

106
00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:21.410
to be telling the truth,

107
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.190
but I think she saw a bear bear's walk on two feet all the time.

108
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.160
They do it all the time as video footage.
You could find it all the time.

109
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.730
And she was in the Pacific northwest,
which is incredibly dense woods.

110
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.270
You see something,
you'd glimpse it.
Look I was hunting once in,

111
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.050
in in Canada and Alberta and I thought I saw a wolf for like two seconds.

112
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:42.980
It was a squirrel.
Okay.
Understand this.
This is fucking,

113
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.260
what does that not squirrel?
Yeah,
I just saw far right.

114
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.170
I saw her and I was cause it's really dense was cause I was looking for fucking

115
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.530
wolves.
Oh.
Cause I was like,
cause I know we did see one wolf.

116
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.670
It crossed the road is either wolf or coyote was hard to tell because it was at

117
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.900
dusk.
It was very dark out.
But um,
when you're looking for something,

118
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:05.050
you think everything is that thing you're looking for.
Yeah.

119
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.810
Sort of like a to thought that fucking squirrel was a wolf.
That's funny.
Yeah.

120
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.050
Well expectation and perception are very linked.
Yes.
Yes.
Well this also,

121
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.400
they found that uh,
that 50% of everything you see is a product of memory.

122
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.750
Yes.
That,
that when you observe something,
they've done f,

123
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.410
f Mris and that most of the activity in the brain is in the memory center is not

124
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:31.160
in the,
uh,
visual sensors.
Interesting.
Only about 50% of the activities,

125
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.410
individual centers of the brain.
That's crazy.

126
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.620
<v 1>Yeah.
The whole thing is very,
I,
when I was a kid,</v>

127
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.270
I went and saw Carl Sagan speak at u of t at the University of Toronto and I was

128
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:42.104
like,
you know,

129
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.200
14 but he did an equation on the board of the possibility of a alien life other

130
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.870
than us in the universe.
And it came to the smallest.
I mean,

131
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.680
he spent the whole time writing on this chalkboard.
It was fascinating,

132
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.960
but he actually came up with a number at the end and it was such a small,

133
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.980
he says there is,
there is something out there,

134
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.590
but they are so far away that they'll,

135
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.380
that unless they can go faster than the speed of light,

136
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.260
which he said was impossible at the time.
The Seventies.
Yeah.

137
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.020
Uh,
there's no way we've seen them.
That's what he said.

138
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:28.970
So of some other beings have conquered the speed of light thing,

139
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.110
then maybe we could see them.
Yeah.
But that's okay.

140
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.440
<v 0>Thing with the exact problem with this skepticism in general is like a that,</v>

141
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.200
you know,
like,
like the skeptics,
skeptics of the,
of the 19th century,

142
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.580
the ones you said germs don't exist.
Right.
Cause we can't see them.
And,

143
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.900
and people who said germs did exist were ridiculed and laughed out of the trade.

144
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.590
Right.
And um,
I agree with you completely.

145
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.140
Just cause you can't see it isn't happening.

146
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.650
<v 1>It doesn't mean it can't happen.
And even since Sagans Day,
it'd be,</v>

147
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.080
there had been no exoplanets discovered then.
Right.

148
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.490
We now know that there are literally trillions and trillions of sure planet

149
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.540
earth like planets.

150
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.160
<v 0>Yeah.
Well they did.</v>

151
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.170
They just speculated as to the existence of them outside of our solar system

152
00:09:11.171 --> 00:09:15.850
before the,
the real problem is that if some,
there's a leap and a leap,

153
00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:20.851
a technological leap that opens the doors to massive innovation that once this

154
00:09:21.521 --> 00:09:23.860
happens,
once this happens in this,

155
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.040
and then all this stuff sort of exponentially expands in terms of technological

156
00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:30.394
possibilities,

157
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.550
all you would need is a few hundred years and you have an unrecognizable set of

158
00:09:37.391 --> 00:09:40.000
technology.
Yeah,
sure.
You know,
I mean,
yeah.

159
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.220
<v 1>Well you were talking about certain,
I mean,
you know,</v>

160
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.730
anti matter idea that they're still trying to figure out,
yeah.
Uh,

161
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.070
that's an insane sorts of energy tomorrow.

162
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.600
I've never even experienced,
you know,

163
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.300
I've with them with a grain of sand that can run a city.
I mean,

164
00:09:58.301 --> 00:10:02.090
that's that big.
Yeah.
And then there's also the theory,
there's recent one,

165
00:10:02.091 --> 00:10:05.460
that space time itself doesn't exist.
So the,

166
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:10.400
the speed of light barrier becomes moot because that there's the guest,

167
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:13.370
it's the holographic quantum hologram theory,

168
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.600
quantum holographic theory of the universe,
Talbot's book.

169
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.470
I can't remember.
Holographic universe.
It's,
yeah,
I think so.

170
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.850
But the idea that the universe is basically just a geometry that,

171
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.250
that when you look at it from a certain angle seems three dimensional and it

172
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:33.230
folds on,
folds into itself so you could travel through the wormhole thing.

173
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.180
It's not even that is the idea that,
that,
that space time is an illusion is,

174
00:10:38.181 --> 00:10:42.760
uh,
and that,
that it doesn't really exist and that's why,
uh,
you know,
like,
uh,

175
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.820
uh,
entanglement is possible.
You know,
the idea that,
you know,

176
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.510
spooky spooky action at a distance.
Yes.
That a quantitative annulment.

177
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.210
Yeah.
The reason that,
you know,
you know,
uh,
these,
you know,

178
00:10:56.211 --> 00:11:00.320
Adam's on opposite ends of the universe can be affect each other instantaneously

179
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.500
is cause they're not really at opposite ends of the universe.

180
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:04.580
They're really right next to each other.

181
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.620
It just seems like they're at opposite ends of the universe.

182
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.900
<v 0>Cause our ability to perceive is basically based on what we have to do to stay</v>

183
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:16.590
alive on this planet.
So our meager little chimp brains.
Yeah.

184
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.670
Trying to,

185
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.510
trying to quantify all of these things that are around us all the time.

186
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:26.150
So we put them into this sort of three dimensional box of movement and distance

187
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.300
and,
and that the entire time,

188
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:32.160
the entire universe could be a compact thing that projects itself like a

189
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:34.200
hologram onto a screen.

190
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.960
I love these kinds of conversations because I'm clearly too stupid to really

191
00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:41.040
understand what I don't understand anything I just said and I don't understand

192
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:44.400
you too.
So how stupid does that make me?
Well we don't understand each other.

193
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.620
We're all the same.
Yeah.

194
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.643
<v 1>That's about like,</v>

195
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.810
I think it'd be interesting to do it like a documentary or something about,
uh,

196
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.670
from about UFO algae because if one thing is the assumption that they're extra

197
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:56.790
terrestrial is an assumption.
Uh,

198
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.520
but the thing that intrigues me is the power of ridicule to silence.

199
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:02.920
Yeah.

200
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.690
Even the most intelligent people in our community from examining something like

201
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.450
the ridicule kept doctors from accepting germs.
Sure.

202
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.950
Cause they didn't want to,
they didn't want to be ridiculed by their peers.

203
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.970
And even now you've got people that will like Michael Shermer will cling to the

204
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:23.971
most absurd explanations for phenomena like the [inaudible] a radar footage.

205
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.680
Uh,
what did he,
what was a Michael Shermer,
I can't even remember it,
but it was,

206
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.790
it was pretty,

207
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.810
it really went to great lengths that entailed having to basically,

208
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.280
uh,

209
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.450
diminish any respect you head for any of the people who reported on the events.

210
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.520
Mm.
It had gone to,

211
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:45.490
had to go into character assassination in order to eliminate it.

212
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.690
<v 0>Yeah.
Well that's the best way to kill an idea.</v>

213
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.930
He's a professional skeptic and I like Michael a lot and he's been on the

214
00:12:50.931 --> 00:12:55.550
podcast many times,
but I actually had him debate Randall Carlson and,
um,

215
00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.670
Graham Hancock about these ancient civilizations and it wasn't very good for

216
00:13:00.711 --> 00:13:04.970
them.
Like there was some clunky moments.
Skeptics are believers.
Well,

217
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:09.740
the problem is they're in believing that the problem is being a skeptic itself.

218
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.070
It's a stupid way to look at the world.
It's your actual,
yeah,
sure.

219
00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:17.180
About something.
I don't mean you should be objective.
No.
Be Skeptical.
Right?

220
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.820
Being skeptical is like,
ah,
I don't know.

221
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.220
But I know for sure that that's not true,

222
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.590
but it serves a massive purpose for people that really don't understand things

223
00:13:27.591 --> 00:13:29.990
and he can explain it to you.
And with actual science,

224
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.380
as long as the actual science is being used and it's not,

225
00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:37.070
character assassination is not mockery.
It's not,
it's not.

226
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.250
There's certain people that are just debunkers,

227
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.910
they can call themselves skeptics,
but they're not looking at things like,
oh,

228
00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:47.870
maybe that is effective.
Maybe that is healthy.
That is interesting.
And No,

229
00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:49.660
they don't look at it that way.
They're looking at,

230
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.320
they're trying to pick it apart and that's fine if you can pick it apart,

231
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.860
but if you cannot,
you have to be objective about the fact that,

232
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.550
oh well this is a very interesting phenomenon and this is what we know about

233
00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:05.220
science is that,
and this is what we know about this thing.
And right now we have,

234
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.740
we have a weird conundrum.
Did chariots of the gods?
Yeah.
And did he hurt fun?

235
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.130
Danica was he,
was he a believer?
Hundred percent.

236
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.060
He's all is still in all in.
I asked him,
the first thing I asked him,
I said,

237
00:14:17.061 --> 00:14:21.380
what is desperately have to go pee?
Go.
The first thing I,
uh,

238
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.200
asked him was what is the most compelling piece of evidence?
There's the,

239
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.300
you know,
and he pointed to this,
um,

240
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:34.560
a Mayan stone plaque that's in [inaudible].
I'm gonna have you ever,

241
00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:38.540
ever seen it?
It's a,
it's a book.
It's a god,

242
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.580
a one of their,
um,

243
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.720
one of their former kings that is lying on his back and he's,

244
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.560
looks like he's moving some,
Jamie,
see if you could find that thing.

245
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.010
It's just really cool,
uh,

246
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:56.140
carving that they found that looks like there's a guy who is in a seat and it

247
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.440
looks like there's fire behind his back.
And you could say,

248
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.420
you could say that he's manipulating controls on a ship and he's,
you know,

249
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:09.110
shooting a rocket into the heaven.
I would like to see what the s,

250
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.720
the mainstream version of that is.
Because it also,
it could just be art,
you know,

251
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:17.420
and imagine being,
yeah,
it could be that they,

252
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.100
they knew about certain things being propelled by fire.
There it is.
Yeah.

253
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.380
That's it.
So if you see this,

254
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.700
I mean that's a big ass stretch to say that guy's in a spaceship.

255
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.700
I don't know what the fuck that is.
He sitting down can alter kind of to me.

256
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.360
He could.
Yeah.
But it does look like he's looking through an ips.
Right.

257
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.480
What's true,
but what does that mean?
Is it a telescope?

258
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.080
Maybe he's just kind of telescope.
I mean that's just an astronomer.
Yeah,

259
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.570
it is possible.
I don't think they had telescopes.

260
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.800
I don't think it telescope was even invented till,
no.

261
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.860
Do they even have a glass at that point?
Oh No.
Well I dunno if the Mayans did.

262
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:56.700
Wow.
But,
but that was his number one piece of evidence was [inaudible].

263
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.270
I was like,
that's kind of silly when we were kids in the 70s the,
you know,

264
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.190
big foot,
you know,
and cherry to the gods and everything was so new.
It.

265
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:08.210
Look at this image,
look at the bottom of it.

266
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:10.880
Even the part where the flame is supposed to be coming out from below him.

267
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.840
Which Flint?
Yeah,
that's the,
where's the flame?
I guess the flames.
The Shit.

268
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:18.440
The very,
very bottom.
But I mean,
I'm not even sure I buy that.

269
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.560
If you were going to draw fire,
you do a really shitty job.
If that's your fire,

270
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:27.170
that doesn't really look like fire to me.
No.
Like could be anything.
Right?

271
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.190
Right.
If that's fire,
like what is all the stuff around them?

272
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.920
What's all that stuff that looked kind of mechanical though,
right?

273
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:36.800
It looks like there's bolts does that they have a fire.
God,

274
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:38.240
maybe they'd heard the fire.
God,

275
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.980
it looks like a monkey kind of face with titties.
Monkey's got some titties.
Oh,

276
00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.040
now I get it.
Right,
and then the monkeys.
Is that his teeth?

277
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.740
It's the first Hooters,
right?
It does.
It could be armed,
but the,

278
00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:53.990
that's the point is it's so open to interpretation.

279
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:57.140
There's so much that you could see if you're looking to see.
