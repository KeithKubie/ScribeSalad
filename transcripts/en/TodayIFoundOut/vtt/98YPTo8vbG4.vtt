00:00:17.860 --> 00:01:29.210
If you’re like, well, pretty much everyone,
at some point you’ve received an email claiming

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.150
you’ve inherited a large sum of money from
some person you’ve never heard of.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.880
All you have to do to get it is provide various
bits of personal data to verify you are who

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.030
they think you are and, of course, your bank
account information so the deceased’s crack

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.420
legal team can deposit money…

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.090
But has anyone ever actually received such
a missive noting they’ve inherited a large

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.210
sum from someone they don’t even know and
had it not be a scam?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.680
It turns out, yes.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680
Absolutely.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.640
In fact, while it’s certainly uncommon in
some sense, it doesn’t take much digging

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.869
at all to find a variety of known cases of
this happening, and presumably there are many,

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.810
many more instances that have never made the
newsreels.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.450
To start with we have the case of a man listed
in the newspaper clipping describing the event

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.490
called only Dr. Meszaros.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.770
The good doctor willed around $50,000 in 1930
(about $770,000 today) to an actress by the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.480
name of Corin Ward.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.290
This came as a rather large shock to the young
Miss Ward who Meszaros had never bothered

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.900
to even introduce himself to.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.040
Before receiving the windfall, she hadn’t
even known he existed.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.080
It was presumed in the news report that Meszaros
must have been in love with the beautiful

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080
actress.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.970
Apparently a good year for actresses, or at
least in this case a former actress, also

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.440
in 1930 we have the case of one Lillian Malrup.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.950
Five years previous, Malrup inherited $60,000
(approximately $872,000 today) from her uncle

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.950
George La’Lamontdier.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.640
Her uncle made his fortune, along with a business
partner named Henri de la Salle, during the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640
Alaskan gold rush.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.760
Five years later, Malrup would receive an
even greater windfall from her uncle’s former

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.320
business partner who she’d never met and
only knew of at all from a couple passing

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.160
references her uncle had made in letters to
her years before.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.450
How much did this mysterious business partner
leave this young woman he’d never met?

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.790
A whopping $700,000 (about $10.7 million today),
which was no doubt a welcome thing to deposit

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.640
into her account coming on the heels of the
1929 stock market crash.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.490
He left only one stipulation to her getting
the money- that she set aside $100,000 (about

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.019
$1.5 million today) in a trust and use the
interest from that fund for scholarships for

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.150
college students.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.350
In yet another case from the early 20th century,
we have the rather odd story of Archibald

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.379
McArthur- a man who deserves an article of
his own.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.879
But to sum up his life story for now, as a
young man he moved to Dodgeville, Wisconsin,

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.880
arriving with almost literally nothing but
the clothes on his back and a degree from

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.959
Lawrence college.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.659
On his first day in town, he worked sawing
logs in exchange for a bed to sleep in that

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.470
night and a hot meal.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.750
He subsequently spent the next couple decades
making a fortune, living lavishly and then,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.290
for reasons known only to him, very suddenly
liquidated all his assets, became a vegetarian,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.660
grew a rather Dumbledore-esk beard, and took
a vow of poverty.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.870
He lived in a shack from then on and mostly
just hung out in a nearby cemetery reading

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.870
philosophy books and poetry.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.530
According to a January 31, 1926 article from
the Milwaukee Journal, he told people who

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.370
asked that he preferred hanging out with the
dead more than the living.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.930
After a few decades living like this, at the
age of 78 he seems to have felt the call all

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.999
elderly feel at some point, and decided to
move to Florida.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:40.099
He thus bought a car, drove to Florida, sold
the car, and died a few years later.

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.060
Beyond a few other bequests, including randomly
leaving $15,000 (about $216,000 today) to

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.160
the son of a woman, Mrs. Jane Joyce, whose
family he’d been friends with when he was

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.360
young, he left the bulk of his estate, $300,000
(about $4 million today) to a young clerk

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.820
by the name of George Rafferty he once met
on a park bench in Jacksonville, Florida.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.410
Moving on we have the case of Wellington Burt,
who decided not to leave the majority of his

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.770
reasonably respectable fortune to his living
family members, but rather to his future family.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.580
He stipulated in his will that the majority
of his estate was not to be divided up until

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.950
21 years after his last grandchild died.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.340
Burt died all the way back in 1919, with his
last remaining grandchild dying in 1989.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.020
When the trust was cashed out in 2010, it
had grown to a whopping $110 million, which

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.080
was divided up between 12 of his descendants.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.760
In perhaps the largest sum ever inherited
by someone who did not know the person who

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.940
bequeathed it to them, we have the case of
Zsolt and Geza Peladi, who were literally

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.170
living in a cave near Budapest when they were
painstakingly tracked down and then, once

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.760
found, were informed they had inherited over
$6 billion- yes, billion- from a grandmother

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.760
they’d never met.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.589
Said Geza of this, “We knew our mother came
from a wealthy family, but she was a difficult

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.600
person and severed ties with them, and then
later abandoned us and we lost touch with

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.560
her and our father until she eventually died.”

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.479
In fact, according to Geza, the grandmother
had not even known the pair existed.

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.130
It was her lawyers that learned of their births
about four decades previous and hired someone

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.250
to track them down.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.930
Alright, so those are exceptional cases.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.320
What about for everyday Joe Shmows like you
and me?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.680
It turns out instances of unclaimed estates
of people who died without a will or an immediate

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.450
heir aren’t that uncommon.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.750
This is noted to be, in part, because people
are horrible at getting around to making wills.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.410
For example, in the UK, only about half of
the adults in the country have bothered to

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.410
do this.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.280
So how do you find out if you’re one such
lucky individual due an inheritance that you

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.280
don’t know about?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.290
When a person dies either without a will or
with a will that isn’t valid or applicable

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.060
for whatever reason, they’re classified
as dying “intestate”.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.860
In the UK, for example, this results in their
estate passing on to the Government Legal

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.360
Department- specifically to a department called,
Bona Vacantia which literally translates to

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.630
“vacant goods”.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.399
Bona Vacantia, who acts on behalf of the Crown,
will then make its best efforts to track down

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.040
the closest living kin of the deceased.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.279
If Bona Vacantia cannot find an entitled blood
relative, the onus then falls on the potential

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.340
heir of the deceased to make a claim.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.480
To assist this, Bona Vacantia maintains a
frequently updated, easily searchable list

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.490
of every unclaimed estate in the country.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.490
If a match is found, one of the first things
a potential claimant has to do is figure out

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.570
where they fall on the so called “order
of priority”, essentially a list detailing

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.880
who, in the eyes of the Crown, is entitled
to an unclaimed estate starting from husbands

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.070
and wives on down to half aunts and uncles
and their children.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.529
In essence, anyone who falls into one of these
categories can theoretically make a claim

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:41.930
on an unclaimed estate, though their claim
could be superseded by a counterclaim from

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.430
someone higher on the list.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.800
As for those who simply don’t even know
to check if they’re owed some inheritance,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.470
there are so-called heir hunters who make
their living tracking down the distant relatives

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.780
of people whose estates lie unclaimed and
charging a premium for bringing this knowledge

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.430
to a person’s attention- in the UK usually
a small percentage of the total estate’s

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.430
value.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.720
In any event, once a claim has been made and
Bona Vacantia is happy that a person’s status

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.229
as a legitimate heir is established through
genealogy records, the amount of the estate

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:10.690
they’re entitled to will be paid out.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.610
If after 30 years the estate remains unclaimed,
it will be dissolved and added to the Treasury.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.840
Exactly how much money this amounts to on
a given year is unclear, but it’s known

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.360
that in between 2013 and 2014, a cool £14million
in unclaimed money went to the Crown.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.630
As for making making a claim like this in
the United States and really in many nations,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.729
similar to the the UK, individual states maintain
lists of unclaimed property and estates that

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:39.870
can be accessed and searched by the public-
the scope and accuracy of which vary on a

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.390
state by state basis.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.910
Again, as with the UK, if a person in the
US dies without a will or with a will that

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.839
isn’t considered valid, the government will
take control of their estate.

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:51.129
However, there are some notable differences.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:55.410
For a start, while the Crown has a blanket
policy of holding estates for 30 years before

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.370
it goes to the Crown, some States, such as
Texas, will do the same after just 4 years.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.209
Again, the statute of limitations when it
comes to making a claim on an estate varies

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:06.690
depending on where you are.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.760
As for what happens to unclaimed money when
it is ultimately turned over to the state,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.269
that also depends with individual States being
largely free to choose what it does with the

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:15.269
money.

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:18.020
For example, Maryland gives the money from
unclaimed estates directly to the Board of

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.410
Education, unless the deceased died in the
care of Maryland Medical Assistance Program,

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.940
in which case the estate will go to the Maryland
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.699
Like in the UK, so-called heir hunters may
also track down distant relatives who have

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:33.370
a potential claim to an unclaimed estate.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.910
However, unlike in the UK, companies offering
such a service are usually (though not always)

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.680
acting on behalf of the government.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.019
As the Heir Hunters Association notes:

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:46.390
Most state organisations make every effort
to trace beneficiaries using probate researchers

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.460
(who may also be called probate detectives
or heir hunters).

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.540
Usually specialist firms are appointed on
a regular basis and may work on a fee basis

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.270
paid from the entire estate, or contingency
where tracing fees are deductible from a beneficiaries

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.270
share.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.810
Finally, while there are some cases of a Brewster’s
Millions type scenario involving someone inheriting

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.430
massive sums from an eccentric, long-lost
uncle they didn’t know about, most cases

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.550
we researched concerned far more modest estates,
more in the thousand of dollars range instead

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.529
of millions or billions.

00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:19.450
This kind of makes sense if you think about.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.949
Because, come on, when an obscenely rich person
dies, there are always people lying around

00:10:23.949 --> 00:11:18.939
who will be quick to try to claim a piece
of the pie, whether there is

00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:29.660
a

00:11:29.660 --> 00:12:22.370
will

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:38.890
or not.
