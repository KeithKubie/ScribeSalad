00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.360
[ Applause ]

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.940
&gt;&gt; James Billington:
Good evening everyone.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.280 position:56%
It's my great pleasure as
Librarian of Congress to welcome you

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.040 position:56%
to this presentation of the John W.
Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.790
in the Study of Humanity.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.350
This award has been created through
the generosity of John Kluge,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.440
who together with his wonderful
wife, is here with us tonight.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.450
It's for a prize that
we are grateful to him,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.780
but also for much else that he
has done for the nation's library

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.340 position:56%
as the founder and longtime chairman

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.630
of its principal private-sector
support group,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.290 position:56%
many of whose members are here also.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.910
The James Madison Council.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.510
So, John Kluge, on behalf
of all of us, thank you.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:11.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.140
This prize has been created in the
Library of Congress, so I also want

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.070
to thank at the outset, the
many members of Congress

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.070
who are here tonight,
especially Representative Ehlers

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.500
and Senator Stevens who are the
current chair and vice chair

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.910
of the Congress's oldest joint
committee of the two houses,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.800
The Joint Committee on
the Library of Congress.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.090
I also want to thank members
of the Madison Council

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.870
who will be meeting tomorrow

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.770
under its current distinguished
long longtime friend

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.130
of the library, Chairman Ed Cox.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.140
Now, the Kluge Prize is a
unique international award.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.830
It covers all languages, all
cultures and the broad fields

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.250
across cultures of the
humanities and social sciences.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.940
Disciplines conspicuously not
included in the Nobel Prizes.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.160
Tonight, we honor John Hope
Franklin, and Yu Ying-Shih,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.940
two scholars who have each produced
an enormous amount of scholarship

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.790
and presented it in a
wide variety of formats

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.400
to a wide variety of
grateful audiences.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.270
Each of these two has played a
leading and groundbreaking role

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.470
in bringing into the mainstream
of scholarship, important

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.990
and previously neglected
aspects of the history

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.490
of their respective native land.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.500
Moreover, the scholarship of each
has affected both the consciousness

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.310
and the conscience of a
broader public in a unique way

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.370
in both cultures during the
second half of the 20th century.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.650
They have both seen, in
addition that deep values lodged

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.760
at the very core of the respective
cultures, provide a basis

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.720
for understanding, correcting
and moving beyond past abuse

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.190 position:56%
and neglect towards a better future.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.930
Our first awardee this
evening is John Hope Franklin,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.720
who has been the leading scholar in
the second half of the 20th century

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.470
in establishing African American
history as an inescapably key area

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.210
in the study of the American past.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.110
He has been both a pathfinder
and a model for other scholars,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.290
for the broader public, a long
and complex history of race

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.680
in this country has been
opened up over the course

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.170
of 63 years by this amazing man.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.160
He has produced works
of many different types

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.510
and of consistent quality.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.240
He has reached a broader audience
with a celebrated textbook,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.700
a biography, an autobiography,
and his personal leadership

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.800
in a lengthy dialogue on race
that ranged all over America

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.090
in the final years
of the 20th century.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.480
He has broken all records
in honorary degrees.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.030
If chemists kept track of
this, they would take due note,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.430
and he is currently
emeritus professor of history

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.050
at Duke University, which was named
a center for interdisciplinary

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.200
and international studies
in his honor.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.660
He provided historical depth
for the argumentation used

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.170
in the landmark Supreme
Court ruling of Brown

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.870
versus the Board of Education.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.480
And he is an international
as well is a national hero,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.850
having played a leading role

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.120
in saving the world-wide Fulbright
Program while he was chairman

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.000
of its board during a period

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.220
when that programs budgetary
future seemed most endangered.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.510
Dr. Franklin, it is an honor to
confer on you the Kluge Prize

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.470
for lifetime achievement
in the study of humanity

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.510
and I respectfully request that you
come forward to receive this award.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:36.500
[ Applause ]

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.140
&gt;&gt; John Hope Franklin: Thank
you very much, Dr. Billington.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.820
I'm deeply honored by Mr.
Kluge, Dr. Billington,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.140
and all of my colleagues
whose confidence

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.470
in my efforts have
endured to the point

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.590
that they supported my
candidacy for this great honor.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.840
That the Library of Congress
played a significant role

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.990
in the entire process of
selecting the recipients

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.210
and administering the Kluge Award,
is not at all surprising to me.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.760
You see, I have a feeling
that the librarian of Congress

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.850
and his staff have
kept a wary eye on me

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.210
for the past 67 years [laugther].

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.950
I came to the Library of Congress
for the first time in 1939,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.540
with every intention of rewriting
the history of the United States

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.960
in a way that would
be palpably inclusive.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.270
It was not easy for a
24-year-old graduate student

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.170
to persuade Willard Webb, then
the study room supervisor,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.350
that I qualified for a study
room for whatever I was doing.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.260
I succeeded in persuading
him and almost every morning

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.810
for the next several months Mr.
Webb, as he made his rounds,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.950
would stop and have
a few words with me.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.600
He commented that I must be quite
interested in Thomas Jefferson

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.450
since I kept his notes
on Virginia on my desk,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.930
and it was frequently open.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.560
So, one day he asked me
if I found it helpful.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.440
And I told him that
it was invaluable

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.690
for what I was attempting to do.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.860
And that was to confront the
numerous missed constructions

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.020
of the history of the
United States by some

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.780
of the most influential
thinkers in our history.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.290
He wondered what role
Jefferson played

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.730
in what I was attempting to do.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.190
I merely replied that his negative
influence was enormous [laughter].

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.740 position:56%
Although the average observer did
not see beyond his obvious influence

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.390
as a founding father
and as the author

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.190
of the Declaration of Independence.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:57.090 position:56%
I was not yet prepared to share
with Mr. Webb, or indeed any others,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.740
my view of Jefferson's
enormous influence in arguing

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.990
that African-Americans were
inferior to whites in many ways.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.760
Jefferson insisted, for example,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.020
that since Blacks required
less sleep than whites even

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.600
after a hard day's work,
they could be induced

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.950
by the slightest amusement
to sit up until midnight.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.040
Yet, he continued, since
their existence appeared

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.640
to "participate more of sensation
than reflection" they were disposed

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.170
to sleep when abstracted from their
diversions or unemployed in labor

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.170
like an animal who is at rest.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.880
Thanks to Willard Webb
and his successors,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.370 position:56%
and thanks to Dr. Billington and his
predecessors, I've been permitted

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.940
to explore the wellspring
of American history

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.750
from the 17th century
to the present.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.490
Thanks also to the John W.
Kluge Center, I was able,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.410
as one of the first Kluge senior
fellows at the Library of Congress

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:03.060
to explore even more
intensively certain aspects

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.180
of recent American history.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.770
Meanwhile, I spent days at a
time, weeks at a time and months

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.850
at a time enjoying the resource
of what I call this eighth wonder

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.510
of the world, the Library
of Congress.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.730 position:56%
What I have found, among many other
things, has been a persistent effort

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.500
on the part of some
who should know better,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.270
to explain certain
developments in American history

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:35.070 position:56%
as the inevitable result of using,
say, Africans to play certain roles.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.400
Thus, the Jeffersonian
argument goes as follows.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:46.130
If a slave works hard under the
lash, he is quick to fall asleep

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.810
when the lights no
longer forces them

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.420
to perform certain
tasks, remarkable finding.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.740
Further, if he does not manifest
an attachment to a certain way

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.680
of doing things, he's likely
to become attached by instinct

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.180
to another way of doing things.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.830
Fantastic, even if elementary.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.570
Finally, since "blacks secrete
less by the kidneys and more

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:18.080 position:56%
by the glands of the skin, they have
a strong and disagreeable odor,"

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.620
to which I have added, especially

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.660
since in all likelihood they
are worked in the fields

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.800
or in the kitchen for 12, or
15 hours, or even more a day

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.910
without an opportunity to bathe.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.320
The more I have studied
the history of our country

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.500
over the last 70 years, the
clearer it has become to me,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.580
by now I have come to understand
the nature of American society,

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.750
and the certainty of
many of its participants

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.910
that their own position
is clear and correct.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.760
I have attempted to
re-examine the ideologies

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.440
that undergird our system.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.570
I've also struggled to understand
how it is that we seek a land

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.370
of freedom for the people of Europe

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.130
and at the same time establish
a social and economic system

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.580
that enslaved people who
happened not to be from Europe,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.760
or kept in that position.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.560
I've struggled to understand
how it is that we could fight

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.780
for independence and,
at the very same time,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.520
use that newly won independence
to enslave many who had joined

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.240
in the fight for independence.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.180
As a student of history,
I have attempted

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.190
to explain it historically.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.940
But that explanation has not
been at all satisfactory.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.230
That has left me no alternative
but to use my knowledge of history,

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.740
and whatever other knowledge and
skills I have, to present the case

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.710
for change in keeping
with the express purpose

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.030
of attaining the promised goals
of equality for all peoples.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.920
In this way, we can perhaps
realize the goals that grow

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.330 position:56%
out of the tenants to which we claim

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.050
to have been committed
from the beginning.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:05.410
It is a sad fact, that
it was in my generation

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.420
that one witnessed the first
African-Americans achieving some

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.620
recognition in the
field of scholarship.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.980
Until then, few white Americans,
even those who advocated a measure

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.190
of political equality,
subscribe to the view

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.110
that African-Americans had the
ability to think, either abstractly

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.870
or concurrently, or to
understand and assimilate ideas

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.000
that had been formulated by others.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.740
evidence. Much of the
20th century was spent

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.710
by African-American
scholars knocking on the door

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.570
of American scholarship
and seeking entry.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.690
Only here and there
did the door open,

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.210
and all too often it was
opened grudgingly, if at all.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.430
It was this inability to open wide
the door of American scholarship

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:55.770
that caused William E. B.
Du Bois to comment in 1903

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.590
on his own intellectual
loneliness when he said,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.420
"I sit with Shakespeare
and he winces not.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.200
Across the color line, I move
arm in arm with Balzac and Dumas,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.270
while smiling men and welcoming
women glide in gilded halls.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.290
From out the caves of evening,

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.750
the swing between the strong-limbed
earth and the tracery of starts,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.130
I summon Aristotle and
Aurelius and what soul I will,

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.650 position:56%
and they have come all graciously,
with no scorn, nor or condescension.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.680
So, wed with truth, I
dwell above the veil.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.720
Is this this life you grudge
me, oh nightly America?

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.340
Is this the life you long to change

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.420
into the dull red hideousness
of Georgia?

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.830 position:56%
Are you so afraid lest peering from
this high Pisgah, between Philistine

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.550
and Amalekite, we sight
the promised land?"

00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:00.470
But it is not enough merely to cite
the promised land in the distance.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.800
And Du Bois would be the first

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.230
to be dissatisfied with
such a modest goal.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.330
He insisted always that the people

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.150
from whom he spoke should never
be satisfied with something

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.630
so ephemeral as a promised land.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.730
And when he reached the
conclusion that the land

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:22.170
of his birth would never concede
full and equal citizenship for him,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:27.720 position:56%
he renounced it, the country, and
denounced it and retreated to Ghana,

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.910
where he spent the
remaining few years of life.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.420
But we, who are dissatisfied
with the present condition

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.880
in this country, should not
retreat to Ghana or somewhere else.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.700
Nor should we even desire to do so.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:48.070
Our past is here, our lord is
here, our presence is here.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.040
Our investment of more than
three centuries is here.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.910
Our future is here.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.660
Many years ago, I discovered
that there were various ways

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.190
that a historian could utilize
his training and talents

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.340
to move this nation closer
to the principles for which

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.860
so many have made the
supreme sacrifice to achieve.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.830
So, in 1948 Thurgood
Marshall, the Chief Counsel

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.510
for the NAACP legal defense fund,
sought my assistance in breaking

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.140
that color barrier at the
University of Kentucky.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.490 position:56%
A young African-American was seeking
admission to do graduate work

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.070
in history at the University
of Kentucky.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.700
When he was denied admission;
surprise, surprise, Marshall sued,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.280
and asked me to serve as an
expert witness in the effort

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.540
to establish the fact
that the University

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.970
of Kentucky was the only
publicly supported institution

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.580
where you could secure
graduate training in history.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.050
Before I could testify
regarding the inadequacy

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.330
of Kentucky's historically
black college

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.320
in training graduate
students in history,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.800
the federal judge had
ordered the admission

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.930
of the African-American
graduate student

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.390
to the University of Kentucky.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.930
Even without my public
participation in the argument,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.440
I discovered that my role as
an expert witness could assist

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.250
in bringing about change
and equity in our society.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.700 position:56%
And this will be done without
compromising my scholarship one wit.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.280
Some years later a variation
of the same was true in Brown

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.930
versus the Board of
Education, when I discovered

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:27.090
that I could use my training and
my knowledge to assist counsel

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.130
in gaining the admission of Linda
Brown and the other plaintiffs

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.340
to better schools that were
not segregated in 1954.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.940
Then, some years later,
in 1965 I discovered

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.980
in the Selma Montgomery march,
that I could be effective

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.170
in joining other historians as well
as crusaders of various stripes

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.730
in marching and working together
to impress high and arrogant powers

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.810
and to relent in their extreme
and excessive use of racial

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:58.080
and social bigotry in their
effort to maintain the status quo.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.540
I've been most fortunate in having
the opportunity to participate

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.590
in an exciting and rewarding
educational experience

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:06.800
over the past three
quarters of a century.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.760
At the same time, I've been able to
witness the partial transformation

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.900
of our society into
something more in keeping

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.690
with the expressed aspirations
of our founding fathers.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.300
I have been most fortunate in
having the support of scholars

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.390
and colleagues in many parts of
the country and of the world.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.020
I can only hope that my work
will be a part of the legacy,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:35.340
not only of my students, and others
who find it possible that we can,

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.300
under certain circumstances,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.620
do something that's
effective and supportable.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:45.640
But I also hope that one can find
something valuable in my words,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.620
but also those who have found
some validation of their own work

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.370
in what I have tried to say and do.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.170
Thank you.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:20.500
[ Applause ]

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.960
&gt;&gt; James Billington: Your applause
speaks louder than any words could

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.450
in saying thank you,
John Hope Franklin.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:39.720
Our second awardee, Yu Ying-Shih,
has been described by his peers

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.220 position:56%
as the most widely read contemporary
historian writing in Chinese.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.780
And these are quotes, "The greatest
Chinese intellectual historian

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.970
of our generation.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.270
Working deeply with original text,

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.800
he has rescued rich
Confucian heritage,

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:03.130
and much else in Chinese culture,
its ancient and rich culture

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:08.840
from caricature neglect
and has even beginning

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:16.640
with the original text following
Confucian thought in its own right,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.270
and its interaction with
other elements of Chinese."

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:25.220
And indeed, later of Western
thought and his experience.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:33.410
So, that he's really covered the
entire multi-millennial history

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:38.010
and range of Chinese
thought and experience.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.230
His scholarship has reached

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.850
across many disciplines,
time periods and issues.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:48.910
Examined in a profound way, major
questions and deeper truths,

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.830
not only about Chinese
culture but about human nature.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:20:01.350 position:56%
And has brought in, in his half a
century of teaching in this country,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:08.520
brought in elements and an
understanding of this rich heritage

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.290
that is quite remarkable.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.070
Although, perhaps not as yet
fully discovered because most

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.470
of his most important writing is
still available only in Chinese.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.830
But how widely available, more
than 30 books, which spanned more

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.600
than 2000 years of history.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.100
He has stimulated younger
scholars to rediscover,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.690
not just the richness,
but the variety

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.030
of Chinese intellectual tradition.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:41.370
Something which has been
seriously lost during the period

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.060
of the so-called cultural
Revolution in China.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.360
His work is widely read

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.420
and discussed throughout the
Chinese speaking world as much

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.610 position:56%
on the mainland as in Hong Kong,
Taiwan and other parts of East Asia.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:01.250
It's been translated into many of
the other languages of East Asia.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:08.690 position:56%
He has had four university
professorships at Michigan, Harvard,

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:15.020
Yale, and then mostly at Princeton
where he is the emeritus professor

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:21.960
of history and has been so, has
been teaching for nearly 2 decades.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.560
It gives me great pleasure
both to be honoring one

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.730 position:56%
of the world's most ancient
cultures, and one of its most modern

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:37.160
and forward-looking minds,
someone who has made a contribution

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.040
to the intellectual
traditions of China,

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.170
the kind of great awakening
contribution

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.890
that John Hope Franklin has
made to our own culture.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.700
It gives me great pleasure to
ask Professor Yu to come forward

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.510
to accept the John W. Kluge Award.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:22:25.500
[ Applause ]

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.490
&gt;&gt; Yu Ying-Shih: Thank
you very much,

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.270
Dr. Billington for your kind words.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:43.230
I feel enormously honored
to be a co-recipient

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:51.130
of the John W. Kluge Prize in
2006, for which I am grateful.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:57.700
After much reflection, however,
I have come to the realization

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.470
that the main justification
for my presence here tonight is

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.590
that both the Chinese
cultural tradition

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.220
and Chinese intellectual history

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:14.200
as a discipline are
being honored through me.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.650
The former has been the subject
of my lifetime scholarly pursuit,

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:25.240
and the latter my chosen
field of specialization.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.010
When I first became seriously
interested in the study

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:35.110
of Chinese history and
culture in the 1940s,

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.970
the Chinese historical
mind happened to be cast

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.770
in an anti-traditionalistic mold.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:49.710
The Chinese past as a whole,
was viewed negatively,

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:56.290
and whatever appeared to be
uniquely Chinese was interpreted

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:01.060
as a deviation from the norm
of civilization's progress

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:07.930
as exemplified in the historical
development of the West.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:12.650
Needless to say, I
was at a complete loss

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:17.430
as to the Chinese cultural
identity, and for that matter,

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.970
also my personal identity.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:26.850
It was my good fortune that I was
able to finish my college education

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:31.580
in Hong Kong and pursued
my graduate studies

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.970
in the United States,
now my adopted country.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:42.620
As my intellectual horizon
gradually widened over the years,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.960
the truth was beginning
to dawn on me

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.370
that the Chinese culture
must be clearly recognized

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:58.060
as an indigenous tradition with
characteristics distinctly its own.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.780
The crystallization
of Chinese culture

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.670
into its definitive shape
took place in the time

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:10.230
of Confucius a crucial moment in
the ancient world better known

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:15.210
in the West as the Axial Age.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:20.870
During this period, it has been
observed, a spiritual awakening

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:26.260
or breakthrough occurred in
several highly-developed cultures

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:31.440
in the ancient world
including China, India,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.660
Persia, Israel, and Greece.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.880
It took the form of either
philosophical reasoning

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.220
or post-mythical religious
imagination or, as in the case

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.390
of China, a mixed type
of moral, philosophic

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:55.250
and religious consciousness.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:00.440
The awakening led directly to
the emergence of the dichotomy

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.110
between the actual world
and the world beyond.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.960
The world beyond as a new vision,
provided the thinking individuals,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.630
be they philosophers,
prophets or sages

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.640
with the necessary
transcending point

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.470
from which the actual world
could be examined and questioned;

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.660
critically as well as reflectively.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.800
This is generally known

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.950
as the original transcendence
of the Axial Age.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:38.190
As a result of the Chinese
original transcendence in the time

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:45.410
of Confucius, the all-important
idea of Tao emerged as a symbol

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:52.050
of the world beyond vis-a-vis the
actual world of everyday life.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.790
But the Chinese transcendental
world of Tao and the actual world

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:03.890 position:56%
of everyday life were conceived from
the very beginning to be related

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.530
to each other in a way different

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:14.780
from other ancient cultures
undergoing the Axial breakthrough.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:20.760 position:56%
For example, there is nothing in the
early Chinese philosophical visions

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:27.500
that suggests Plato's conception
of an unseen eternal world

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.810
of which the actual world
is only a pale copy.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:38.210 position:56%
In the religious tradition, the
world of God and the world of humans

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:44.670
as demonstrated in the
Christian type, is also absent.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.620 position:56%
Nor, do we find in classical Chinese
thought, in all its varieties,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:56.850 position:56%
anything that closely resembles the
radical negativity of early Buddhism

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.650
with its insistence
on the un-realness

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.990
and worthlessness of this world.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:09.130
By contrast, the world
of Tao was not perceived

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.200
as very far from the human world.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:18.380
As best expressed by Confucius,
"The Tao is not far from man.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.930
When a man pursues the Tao
and remains away from man,

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.170
his course cannot be
considered the Tao."

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:33.350
The notion of Tao was also
shared by all the major thinkers

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:39.570
in the Chinese Axial Age, including
Lao Tzu, Mo Tzu and Chuang Tzu.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.050
It was their common belief
that Tao is hidden and

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:50.500
yet functions everywhere in the
human world; even men and women

00:28:50.500 --> 00:29:01.670
of simple intelligence can know
and practice it in everyday life

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.910
to a larger or lesser degree.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.640
Indeed, judging from
the ever-growing

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:14.610
and deepening influences of the
ideas originating in the Axial Age,

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:19.390
especially Confucian and
Taoist ideas, on all aspects

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.920
of Chinese life down
through the centuries.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.980
It may not be too much an
exaggeration to suggest that Tao

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.540
and history constitute the inside

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.980
and the outside of
Chinese civilization.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.000
Taking the Chinese cultural
tradition to be essentially one

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.280
of indigenous tradition
and independent growth,

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.440
I have tried over the decades

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.390
to study Chinese history
along two main lines.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:59.110
First, the Chinese culture must
be understood in its own terms,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:04.610
but at the time also in a
comparative perspective.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:12.290
By comparative perspective, I
refer to both Indian Buddhism

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.810
in the early imperial period

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.530
and Western culture
since the 16th century.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.420
Since the beginning
of the 20th century,

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:26.720
the Chinese mind has been largely
preoccupied with the problematique

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.460
of China-versus-the-West.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.900
To interpret the Chinese
past solely in its own terms

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:39.470
without a comparative perspective
would certainly run the risk

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:44.610
of falling into the age-old
trap of Sino centrism.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:49.680
Second, in my study of Chinese
history from classical antiquity

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:56.940
to the 20th century, my focus
has always been placed on periods

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:04.260
of change when one historical
stage moved to the next.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.150
Compared to other civilizations,
China's is particularly marked

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.220
by its long historical continuity.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:18.370
But continuity and change went
hand-in-hand in Chinese history.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:22.400
Therefore, the purpose I
have set myself is twofold.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.630
Firstly, to identify
the major intellectual,

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:29.590
social and culture changes
in the Chinese past.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:36.410
And, secondly, to discern if at
all possible, the unique pattern

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.230
of Chinese historical changes.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:44.050
More often than not, such
broad and profound changes

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:50.170
in Chinese history transcended the
rise and the fall of dynasties.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:55.730
Thus, the notion of dynastic cycle,
long held in traditional China,

00:31:55.730 --> 00:32:02.890
but also briefly in vogue in
the West, is highly misleading.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:07.570
In the early years of the 20th
century, Chinese historians began

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:12.030
to reconstruct and re-interpret
the Chinese past according

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.490 position:56%
to the historical model of the West.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.750
Since then, it has
been generally assumed

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:22.110
that China must have
undergone similar stages

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:27.460
of historical development as
shown in European history.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.010
In the first half of
the 20th century,

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.470
Chinese historians adopted
the earlier European schemes

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:39.470
of periodization by dividing
Chinese history into ancient,

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.900
medieval and modern periods.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.560
This has been replaced since 1949

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.510
by the Marxist-Stalinist
five-stage formulation.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:33:00.200
The latter remains the orthodox
in China up to this day,

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.470
at least in theory if
not always in practice.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:12.510
This Procrustean approach, whatever
merits it may have otherwise,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:17.110
cannot possibly do full
justice to Chinese culture

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.440
as an indigenous tradition.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.420
Only by focusing on the
unique course and shape

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.770
of Chinese historical
changes, I am convinced,

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:33.190
can we hope to see more clearly how
that great cultural tradition moved

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:38.730
from stage to stage driven,
mainly if not entirely,

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.800
by its internal dynamics.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.550
Now, let me turn to the question
of how, as two different systems

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:51.750
of values, does Chinese culture
stand vis-a-vis Western culture

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.740
in historical perspective?

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.680
My earliest exposure to this
question occurred in the late 1940s

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.190
when the problematique of China
versus-the-West, mentioned earlier,

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:06.890
dominated the Chinese
intellectual world.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:13.730
It has not been out of my
consciousness ever since.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:20.750
Living in the United
States for half a century,

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:26.510
the question has acquired a truly
existential meaning for my life

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:31.930
as I move between the two
cultures from moment to moment.

00:34:31.930 --> 00:34:36.600 position:56%
With some initial psychological
readjustments, I have long been able

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.010
to enjoy the American way

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:43.710
of life while still retaining
my Chinese cultural identity.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:47.270
However, the best guide with regard

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.090
to whether Chinese culture is
compatible with the core values

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:55.740
of the West can only be
provided by Chinese history.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:00.170
China first encountered the modern
West at the end of the 16th century

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.720
when the Jesuits came to do their
missionary work in East Asia.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:09.290
The culturally sensitive Matteo
Ricci was very quick to discover

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.600
that the Chinese religious
atmosphere

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:17.700
at that time was highly
tolerant; Confucianism, Buddhism

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:22.380
and Taoism were generally
regarded as one and the same thing.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.300
It was this period of religious
tolerance that accounted

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:32.300
for Ricci's extraordinary
success in his conversion

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.840
of many leading members
of the Confucian elite.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.630
The Confucian faith in
the sameness of human mind

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.390
and the universal accessibility
of Tao

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:49.230
to every human person anywhere
led some Chinese converts

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.940
to promote a synthesis of
Christianity with Confucianism.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:59.920
The Chinese Tao was now further
expanded to include Christianity.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:05.360
In the late 19th century, it was
also the open-minded Confucians

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.770 position:56%
who enthusiastically embraced values

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.450
and ideas dominant
in the modern West.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:18.250
Such as democracy, liberty,
equality, rule of law,

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:24.550
autonomy of the individual person,
and, above all, human rights.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:29.000
When some of them visited Europe
or America for the first time

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.580
and stayed there long enough to
make first-hand observations,

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.460
they were all deeply impressed,
first of all, by the ideals

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:45.080
and institutions of Western
constitutional democracy.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:51.350
At the turn of the century, there
were two rival Confucian schools

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:56.800
in China known as the New Text
and the Old Text, respectively.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:04.030
Both advocated democracy and
jointly began a systematic search

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.540
for the origins and the
evolution of democratic ideas

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.790
in early Confucian texts.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:15.580
In so doing, it is clear that
they took the compatibility

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.910
between Chinese culture
and Western culture

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.890
as two systems of values
for granted.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:28.030
Last but not least, I wish to
say a word about human rights.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:33.650
Like democracy, human rights as
a term is linguistically specific

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:40.260
to the West and nonexistent in
traditional Confucian discourse.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:46.330
However, if we agree that the
concept of human rights as defined

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:52.320
in the United Nations'
Universal Declaration of 1948,

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.870
is predicated on the
double recognition

00:37:55.870 --> 00:38:00.640
of a common humanity
and human dignity.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:07.570
Then we are also justified to speak
of a Confucian idea of human rights

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.930
without the Western terminology.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.200
Recognition of common
humanity and respect

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:22.570
for human dignity are both clearly
articulated in the Analects,

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.850
Mencius and other early texts.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:32.130
It is remarkable that by the first
century Common Era, at the latest,

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.270
the Confucian notion of human
dignity was openly referred

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:44.270 position:56%
to in imperial decrees as sufficient
grounds for the prohibition

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.920
of the sale or killing of slaves.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:59.310
Both imperial decrees, dated 9
and 35 Common Era, respectively,

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:02.920
cited the same famous
Confucian dictum,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:09.640
"Of all living things
produced by Heaven and Earth,

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:14.530
the human person is the noblest."

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.550
Slavery as an institution
was never accepted

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.280
by Confucianism as legitimate.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:28.960
It was the Confucian humanism that
predisposed late Ch'ing Confucians

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.720
to be so readily appreciative
of the Western theory

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.910
and practice of human rights.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:44.590
If history is any guide, then
there seems to be a great deal

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.520
of overlapping consensus
in basic values

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.050
between Chinese culture
and Western culture.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:57.250
After all, recognition
of common humanity

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:05.100
and human dignity is what the
Chinese Tao has been about.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:11.080
I am more convinced than ever
that once Chinese culture returns

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.670
to the main flow of
Tao, the problematique

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:21.070
of China-versus-the-West
will also come to an end.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.870
Thank you.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:51.610
[ Applause ]

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.940
&gt;&gt; James Billington: Thank
you very much, Professor Yu.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.750
We will print and mail to
each of you, in the audience,

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:03.860
the full text of both Dr.
Franklin's and Dr. Yu's remarks

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:09.560
so that you may read and re-read
them later at your leisure.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.680 position:56%
I must say you've sent us with
these reflections over a long period

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.840
of time into a higher realm.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.290
And we're about to go into another
realm in the universal language

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:24.400
of music as we welcome the
president of the Curtis Institute,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:30.880
Roberto Diaz, and the Curtis gifted
students from that Curtis Institute

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.660
who will perform tonight.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:37.970
And we also welcome Gerry Lenfest
who made tonight's performance

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.960
by the Curtis students possible.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.280
Gerry has been a great supporter
of the library, member of this

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.900
from 15 years of this
Madison Council

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.670
to which I've already
spoken is also Chairman

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.450
of the Curtis Institute's
board of trustees.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:56.700
And both the library and the
Curtis Institute owe much

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.720 position:56%
of their musical legacy, the place
we are in tonight, to the generosity

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.660
and commitment of extraordinary
women patrons.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.790
Mary Louise Curtis Bok established
the Curtis Institute in 1924.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.420
Later set up an endowment to pay

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.900
in full tuition expense
for all Curtis students.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.940
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge in
1925 paid for the construction

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.870
of this hall, set up an endowment
to support free public concerts

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.720
and commissions which
continue to this day.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.230
And Gertrude Clark Whittall
10 years later donated the set

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:37.290 position:56%
of Stradivarius instruments that the
Curtis musicians will play tonight.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:41.320
And also provided an endowment to
have them perpetually maintained

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.760
and specifically performed
in concerts.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.220 position:56%
So, we're grateful to the Curtis
Institute for helping us be faithful

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.650
to this bequest by playing
the Stradivarius instruments

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.720
that you will here shortly.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.830
I should say that Curtis also
trained many young composers

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.020
who then went on to receive Library
of Congress musical commissions,

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.940
whose works were premiered
here in this hall.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.290
First performance ever
of Aaron Copland's

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:17.270
"Appalachian Spring" was commission
by the library and performed here.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:21.360
And also, their distinguished
graduates

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.480
and friends have many personal
collections now residing

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.900
in the library.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.510
The collections of Samuel
Barber and Leonard Bernstein,

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.410
whose music will be
performed tonight.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:35.440
Manuscripts by Lukas Foss, Gian
Carlo Menotti, and Ned Rorem,

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.010
many others have found their
way to the Library of Congress

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:42.350 position:56%
to ride alongside original
manuscripts we have of Bach, Mozart,

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:46.260
Beethoven, Brahms,
Stravinsky, and many others.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.330
So, we welcome this opportunity
to further our connection

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:52.750 position:56%
to the Curtis Institute, its leaders

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.740
and its talented students
during tonight's performance.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.130
And we thank, once again,
the Kluge Center honorees,

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:07.520
the Kluge Prize winners for lifting
up our hearts, our imaginations,

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.910
and the continuing struggle
to understand in a context

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:16.270
that is moral, rather
than just moralistic,

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:20.470
and that it goes ever deeper into
the common study of humanity,

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:23.110
which we try to celebrate
in the Kluge Center,

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.990
which is just upstairs here.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.400
So, I thank Gerry Lenfest and
the Curtis Institute for coming

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:36.920
and we look forward to hearing
from these talented performers

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.970
who will bring to you the music
on Stradivarius instruments

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.370
with which they have
fallen, I gather,

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:45.670
in love in the few
days of performance.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.560
So, we share that love with you.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.260
We thank you, and we look
forward to lifting our hearts

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.510
with the sounds of music.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:45:12.500
[ Applause ]

00:45:52.510 --> 00:54:03.510
[ Music ]

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:11.500
[ Applause ]

00:54:12.510 --> 01:04:27.510
[ Music ]

01:04:27.510 --> 01:05:24.500
[ Applause ]

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:39.840
I won't hold up the progress
for dinner, but before we leave,

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.760
we not only have thanked
these marvelous artists,

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.400
but I want to make two quick
presentations, to Roberto Diaz,

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.530
the Curtis Institute and
the chairmen of its board,

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:52.240
Gerry Lenfest, for bringing
these amazing artists to us.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:59.030 position:56%
These are facsimiles of two of the
most cherished American compositions

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:01.120
of the 20th century,
of which we happen

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.840
to be the custodians
here at the library.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:11.800
Barber's Adagio for Mr. Diaz is in
charge of these wonderful artists

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:16.160
who brought them to this and has
made this whole thing possible,

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.460
[inaudible] for Gerry Lenfest.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.510
So, here we are thank you all.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:35.250
[ Applause ]

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:38.640
And we now proceed with thanks
once again to the musicians,

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:43.710
and praise once again for the Kluge
Prize winners this year upstairs,

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:48.750
now up for dinner on the Mezzanine
floor, which is two floors up.

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.550
We look forward to seeing you there

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:54.510
and continuing this
evening's celebration.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:59.720
[ Applause ]

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.360
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
