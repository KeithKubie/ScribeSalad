00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.710
We all know about oil drilling, but there
are way more ways to get fossil fuels.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:15.610
Let's DRINK THAT MILKSHAKE!

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.109
Fossil fuels are a worldwide essential resource.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.039
We use coal, petroleum, natural gas, propane,
diesel, kerosene and so on for manufacturing,

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.570
fuel, power, heat…

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.150
Honestly, they're part of almost everything
we do every day.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.930
Fossil fuels are made from the decomposed
remains of tiny plants and animals which died

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.149
hundreds of millions of years ago in ancient
oceans that covered our planet.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.800
These organisms sank to the bottom where anaerobic
bacteria digested the biomasses before the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.329
heat and pressure of Earth's crust[1] pressed
on them for millions of years.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.780
Today, we extract these substances in various
ways for so many uses, I can't even list them

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.390
all here -- plastics, shipping, construction,
power… they would take way too long.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.340
The most popular fossil fuel used today is
oil.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.760
The first oil well was drilled in 1859, and
could extract 800 gallons[a] of crude a day[2],

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.750
waaay more than anyone saw need for at the
time; in January 2015 humans produced about

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.070
94 million barrels of oil // every // day[3],[4].

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.650
Most of U.S. oil doesn't come from the Middle
East, but from homegrown production!

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.920
We only imported 27 percent of our overall
usage in 2014, the lowest since 1985[5]; what

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.040
we DO import comes from Latin America and
Canada[6].

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.670
The reason we've become an oil producer and
not a sole oil consumer, is hydraulic fracturing

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.740
in North Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma, and New
Mexico[7].

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.610
This controversial fossil fuel extraction
practice uses lots of water and fluid to fracture

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.060
the earth's crust, releasing the oil and natural
gas trapped in the ground[8].

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.810
Fracking accounted for 49 percent of oil and
54 percent of natural gas production in February

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.939
2015[9].

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.659
As oil barrel prices drop profitability decreases[10],
and fewer rigs are constructed.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.860
Whether that's good or bad depends on your
perspective; but if you think it sounds like

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.790
a complicated process, check out tar sands
and shale.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.770
Tar sands aren't like tar pits from the Flintstones
or the Land Before Time; but rather they're

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.110
90 percent clay, sand and water.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.820
They're often called oil sands or bituminous
sands -- for the other 10 percent is valuable

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.830
bitumen -- a natural form of petroleum hydrocarbons.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.290
Normally, petroleum is a liquid, but this
isn't only because it's mixed in with the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.400
clay and sand.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.250
In warm weather, a "tar" sand is semi-solid,
and the color of good gardening soil, and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.160
it can freeze with cold temperatures[11] just
like regular earth.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.720
HowStuffWorks says Alberta, Canada, may contain
as many as 300 BILLION barrels of oil trapped

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.860
in the sands -- but once it's separated, it
burns the same as oil from anywhere else.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.920
Shale oil is the name for a sedimentary rock
with kerogen trapped inside it.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.370
Kerogen is a hydrocarbon rich fuel source
alternative to petroleum or natural gas[12].

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.890
Kerogen is like fossil fuels, but it can also
be the result of ancient land plants or the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.040
undersea plankton fossils I mentioned.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.060
If we left shale oil alone for millions more
years of geologic pressure and temperature[13];

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.190
the oil shale would eventually become simply,
oil which we could drill out of the ground!

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.010
No one is that patient though, so instead,
we've learned to extract, refined and turn

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.630
shale oil into many petroleum products.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.600
Obviously, from a business perspective, the
more traditional forms of extraction are best.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.420
Drilling and mining are still very popular[14].

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.170
Drilling involves finding a pocket of oil
and natural gas, drilling into it, and extracting

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.090
it for refining and processing.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.580
it's not as difficult to extract as fracking,
sands, or shale.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.650
According to the World Coal Association, we
mine over six billion metric tonnes of coal

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.780
annually; mostly in China, the USA, India,
Australia and South Africa[15].

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.100
Many people and governments around the world
object to the burning of fossil fuels because

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.150
hydrocarbons release carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gasses, which contribute to climate

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.620
change and global warming.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.040
Some countries, like Costa Rica, have completely
forsaken fossil fuels for renewable energy

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.170
like wind and solar[16].

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.590
But how to do you feel about it?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.200
Do you want to know more about any of these
technologies?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.590
None of these fossil fuels happen in a vacuum
though.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.430
Remember that saying when a butterfly in flaps
it's wings... it causes a hurricane where

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.430
ever?

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.870
That's true when it comes to pollution.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.790
China's pollution is affecting more than just
China.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:27.620
