00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.050
 
let's do some scale and indirect

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060
let's do some scale and indirect
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.960
let's do some scale and indirect
measurement problems so they say use a

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970
measurement problems so they say use a
 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.379
measurement problems so they say use a
scale diagram to the right to determine

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389
scale diagram to the right to determine
 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.150
scale diagram to the right to determine
I think this is the scale diagram that

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
I think this is the scale diagram that
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.830
I think this is the scale diagram that
they're talking it's really above the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
they're talking it's really above the
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.270
they're talking it's really above the
question and they want to determine

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
question and they want to determine
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.890
question and they want to determine
let's see the first the length of the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
let's see the first the length of the
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.180
let's see the first the length of the
helicopter when they say the scale

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
helicopter when they say the scale
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.849
helicopter when they say the scale
diagram notice this helicopter it looks

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
diagram notice this helicopter it looks
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.260
diagram notice this helicopter it looks
pretty small I don't know how big your

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
pretty small I don't know how big your
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.849
pretty small I don't know how big your
screen is but you know looks a couple of

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
screen is but you know looks a couple of
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.470
screen is but you know looks a couple of
maybe one or two inches depending on

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
maybe one or two inches depending on
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.120
maybe one or two inches depending on
what resolution you're watching this

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
what resolution you're watching this
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740
what resolution you're watching this
video on but they're saying this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
video on but they're saying this
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.000
video on but they're saying this
helicopter is much bigger than that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
helicopter is much bigger than that
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.800
helicopter is much bigger than that
they're saying just this little distance

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
they're saying just this little distance
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.420
they're saying just this little distance
right here just that little distance

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
right here just that little distance
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.010
right here just that little distance
that little white box there that's

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
that little white box there that's
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.650
that little white box there that's
actually a foot in the on the real

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
actually a foot in the on the real
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.630
actually a foot in the on the real
helicopter so what they're able to do is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
helicopter so what they're able to do is
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.030
helicopter so what they're able to do is
draw a small version of the helicopter

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
draw a small version of the helicopter
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799
draw a small version of the helicopter
and essentially give us a ruler to tell

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
and essentially give us a ruler to tell
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030
and essentially give us a ruler to tell
us that that little distance is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
us that that little distance is
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610
us that that little distance is
equivalent to a foot and this whole

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
equivalent to a foot and this whole
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160
equivalent to a foot and this whole
distance right here that whole distance

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
distance right here that whole distance
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930
distance right here that whole distance
right there is equivalent to one two

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
right there is equivalent to one two
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.470
right there is equivalent to one two
three four five six seven feet did I get

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
three four five six seven feet did I get
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.650
three four five six seven feet did I get
that right one two three four five six

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
that right one two three four five six
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.920
that right one two three four five six
seven so this thing is equal to seven

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
seven so this thing is equal to seven
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959
seven so this thing is equal to seven
feet so given that let's try to answer

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
feet so given that let's try to answer
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.950
feet so given that let's try to answer
their questions

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
their questions
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.630
their questions
so the first one the length of the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
so the first one the length of the
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.620
so the first one the length of the
helicopter so that's from cabin to tail

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
helicopter so that's from cabin to tail
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.190
helicopter so that's from cabin to tail
is that distance right there let's see

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
is that distance right there let's see
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.859
is that distance right there let's see
how many of these things it is so if I

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
how many of these things it is so if I
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.390
how many of these things it is so if I
take that right there let me see if I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
take that right there let me see if I
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.649
take that right there let me see if I
can copy and paste that so if I see if I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
can copy and paste that so if I see if I
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.640
can copy and paste that so if I see if I
copy it then I paste it there's one

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
copy it then I paste it there's one
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.600
copy it then I paste it there's one
right there

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
right there
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.620
right there
one edit paste two right there then edit

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
one edit paste two right there then edit
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.319
one edit paste two right there then edit
paste and then we get not quite three

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329
paste and then we get not quite three
 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.080
paste and then we get not quite three
almost three but not quite we get about

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
almost three but not quite we get about
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.800
almost three but not quite we get about
that far so it looks like about two so

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
that far so it looks like about two so
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.730
that far so it looks like about two so
this right here is that's right here is

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
this right here is that's right here is
 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.830
this right here is that's right here is
seven feet that right there is another

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
seven feet that right there is another
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539
seven feet that right there is another
seven feet and I know that because that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
seven feet and I know that because that
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370
seven feet and I know that because that
is seven feet according to the scale and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
is seven feet according to the scale and
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.530
is seven feet according to the scale and
then this looks like we got about that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
then this looks like we got about that
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.209
then this looks like we got about that
far so looks like this is maybe not

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219
far so looks like this is maybe not
 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.999
far so looks like this is maybe not
another five feet if I were to estimate

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
another five feet if I were to estimate
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950
another five feet if I were to estimate
actually we went to go all the way to

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
actually we went to go all the way to
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.359
actually we went to go all the way to
the end of the tail if we went to the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
the end of the tail if we went to the
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.289
the end of the tail if we went to the
end of here it actually looks like

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
end of here it actually looks like
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.169
end of here it actually looks like
another seven feet we actually complete

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
another seven feet we actually complete
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.270
another seven feet we actually complete
three seven feet so I would say that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
three seven feet so I would say that
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.660
three seven feet so I would say that
Part A I would go it to 27

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670
Part A I would go it to 27
 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.550
Part A I would go it to 27
feet sorry not 2721 feet seven feet

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560
feet sorry not 2721 feet seven feet
 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.960
feet sorry not 2721 feet seven feet
times three is equal to 21 feet

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970
times three is equal to 21 feet
 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.580
times three is equal to 21 feet
I'd go part one because if you go all

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590
I'd go part one because if you go all
 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.920
I'd go part one because if you go all
the way to this tippy tippy of the rear

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930
the way to this tippy tippy of the rear
 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.500
the way to this tippy tippy of the rear
rotor of the right there then you're

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
rotor of the right there then you're
 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.060
rotor of the right there then you're
going to get 21 you're gonna get three

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070
going to get 21 you're gonna get three
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.300
going to get 21 you're gonna get three
of these lengths let's do Part B the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
of these lengths let's do Part B the
 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.670
of these lengths let's do Part B the
height of the helicopter floor two

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680
height of the helicopter floor two
 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.020
height of the helicopter floor two
rotors so from here from floor two

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030
rotors so from here from floor two
 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.750
rotors so from here from floor two
rotors well I'll go from down here to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
rotors well I'll go from down here to
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.770
rotors well I'll go from down here to
the rotors they might be talking about

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780
the rotors they might be talking about
 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.750
the rotors they might be talking about
this floor but who knows I think this

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760
this floor but who knows I think this
 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.460
this floor but who knows I think this
little so what is this distance right

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470
little so what is this distance right
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.970
little so what is this distance right
here in feet what is that distance so we

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
here in feet what is that distance so we
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.650
here in feet what is that distance so we
could just eyeball a little bit they

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660
could just eyeball a little bit they
 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.210
could just eyeball a little bit they
didn't give us a vertical scale we could

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220
didn't give us a vertical scale we could
 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.780
didn't give us a vertical scale we could
just this scale looks like about that

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
just this scale looks like about that
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.229
just this scale looks like about that
high it looks about that high so that

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239
high it looks about that high so that
 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.080
high it looks about that high so that
looks that would be about seven feet so

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
looks that would be about seven feet so
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.070
looks that would be about seven feet so
let me copy and paste that so let me

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080
let me copy and paste that so let me
 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.570
let me copy and paste that so let me
copy it let me paste it so that would be

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580
copy it let me paste it so that would be
 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.300
copy it let me paste it so that would be
seven feet right there and then if I

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310
seven feet right there and then if I
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.410
seven feet right there and then if I
were to do another one we're getting

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420
were to do another one we're getting
 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.420
were to do another one we're getting
about another half of seven feet so that

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430
about another half of seven feet so that
 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.400
about another half of seven feet so that
would be another three and a half feet

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410
would be another three and a half feet
 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.750
would be another three and a half feet
so I would say it is I would say that is

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760
so I would say it is I would say that is
 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.270
so I would say it is I would say that is
this is seven right there and then we

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280
this is seven right there and then we
 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.000
this is seven right there and then we
get about three and a half so seven plus

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010
get about three and a half so seven plus
 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.120
get about three and a half so seven plus
three and a half is ten point five ten

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130
three and a half is ten point five ten
 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.630
three and a half is ten point five ten
point five feet the length of one main

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640
point five feet the length of one main
 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.539
point five feet the length of one main
rotor I think the main rotor they're

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549
rotor I think the main rotor they're
 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.789
rotor I think the main rotor they're
talking about they're talking about this

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799
talking about they're talking about this
 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.210
talking about they're talking about this
length right there that length right

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220
length right there that length right
 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.250
length right there that length right
there that is the length of one main

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260
there that is the length of one main
 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.100
there that is the length of one main
rotor or actually this length right here

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110
rotor or actually this length right here
 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.100
rotor or actually this length right here
that is the length of one main rotor and

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
that is the length of one main rotor and
 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.400
that is the length of one main rotor and
let's compare it to this scale over here

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410
let's compare it to this scale over here
 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.330
let's compare it to this scale over here
so let's compare it that's seven feet so

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340
so let's compare it that's seven feet so
 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.600
so let's compare it that's seven feet so
let's copy it and then let's paste it so

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610
let's copy it and then let's paste it so
 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.380
let's copy it and then let's paste it so
that is I know you can't I lost it so

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390
that is I know you can't I lost it so
 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.890
that is I know you can't I lost it so
let me copy it let me

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900
 
 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.569
 
copy and then paste so that's one length

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579
copy and then paste so that's one length
 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.700
copy and then paste so that's one length
so we want one rear rotor so that's

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710
so we want one rear rotor so that's
 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.150
so we want one rear rotor so that's
seven feet right there seven feet right

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160
seven feet right there seven feet right
 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.439
seven feet right there seven feet right
there and then we could do another one

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449
there and then we could do another one
 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.360
there and then we could do another one
the important thing is to get the idea

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370
the important thing is to get the idea
 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.890
the important thing is to get the idea
of it you don't have to get the exact

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900
of it you don't have to get the exact
 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.420
of it you don't have to get the exact
measurement we're not about to go out

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
measurement we're not about to go out
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.570
measurement we're not about to go out
there and build a helicopter so what is

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580
there and build a helicopter so what is
 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.390
there and build a helicopter so what is
this linked we have seven feet and then

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400
this linked we have seven feet and then
 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.030
this linked we have seven feet and then
we have one two three about another four

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040
we have one two three about another four
 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.129
we have one two three about another four
feet so I would go with Part C I'd go

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139
feet so I would go with Part C I'd go
 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.860
feet so I would go with Part C I'd go
with eleven feet for one rotor if this

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870
with eleven feet for one rotor if this
 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.540
with eleven feet for one rotor if this
is if we're getting to see this actually

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550
is if we're getting to see this actually
 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.890
is if we're getting to see this actually
head on maybe it's a little bit longer

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900
head on maybe it's a little bit longer
 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.810
head on maybe it's a little bit longer
if it's an angle but that gives us our

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820
if it's an angle but that gives us our
 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.520
if it's an angle but that gives us our
general idea actually looks a little bit

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530
general idea actually looks a little bit
 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.620
general idea actually looks a little bit
longer than that but yeah as long as you

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630
longer than that but yeah as long as you
 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.480
longer than that but yeah as long as you
understand how I'm using the scale is

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490
understand how I'm using the scale is
 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.300
understand how I'm using the scale is
the main thing the width of the cabin so

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310
the main thing the width of the cabin so
 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.969
the main thing the width of the cabin so
here that's the cabin with right there

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979
here that's the cabin with right there
 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.360
here that's the cabin with right there
this distance that distance right there

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370
this distance that distance right there
 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.909
this distance that distance right there
is the cabin width and if we compare it

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919
is the cabin width and if we compare it
 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.340
is the cabin width and if we compare it
to this right here we already said we

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350
to this right here we already said we
 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.420
to this right here we already said we
already said that this right here is

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430
already said that this right here is
 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.719
already said that this right here is
seven feet roughly edit copy paste so

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729
seven feet roughly edit copy paste so
 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.670
seven feet roughly edit copy paste so
that is seven feet that looks like about

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680
that is seven feet that looks like about
 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.650
that is seven feet that looks like about
the width of the cabin that's a good

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660
the width of the cabin that's a good
 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.290
the width of the cabin that's a good
estimate so the width of the cabin I

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300
estimate so the width of the cabin I
 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.690
estimate so the width of the cabin I
would say is seven feet and then finding

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700
would say is seven feet and then finding
 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.790
would say is seven feet and then finding
the diameter of the rear rotor system

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800
the diameter of the rear rotor system
 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.770
the diameter of the rear rotor system
the rear rotor system is this right here

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780
the rear rotor system is this right here
 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.010
the rear rotor system is this right here
that is the rear rotor system so if we

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020
that is the rear rotor system so if we
 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.440
that is the rear rotor system so if we
were to copy and paste our seven foot

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450
were to copy and paste our seven foot
 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.960
were to copy and paste our seven foot
length she let me copy and paste the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970
length she let me copy and paste the
 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.400
length she let me copy and paste the
actual ruler so this is our actual ruler

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410
 
 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.710
 
so how long is the rear rotor system

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720
so how long is the rear rotor system
 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.969
so how long is the rear rotor system
let's look at our roller it looks like

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979
let's look at our roller it looks like
 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.920
let's look at our roller it looks like
one two three four feet is my best

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930
one two three four feet is my best
 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.330
one two three four feet is my best
estimate so I'd say the diameter of the

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340
estimate so I'd say the diameter of the
 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.000
estimate so I'd say the diameter of the
three rotor system is four feet so you

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010
three rotor system is four feet so you
 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.290
three rotor system is four feet so you
might have already known how to do this

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300
might have already known how to do this
 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.909
might have already known how to do this
but now you have a good sense look you

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919
but now you have a good sense look you
 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.040
but now you have a good sense look you
just what this there's this is telling

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050
just what this there's this is telling
 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.150
just what this there's this is telling
us that this little distance on the

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160
us that this little distance on the
 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.980
us that this little distance on the
picture is actually equivalent to a foot

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990
picture is actually equivalent to a foot
 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.629
picture is actually equivalent to a foot
and you just compare it to the actual

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639
and you just compare it to the actual
 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.279
and you just compare it to the actual
picture and you know how big the actual

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289
picture and you know how big the actual
 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.560
picture and you know how big the actual
helicopter is that's all that's going on

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570
helicopter is that's all that's going on
 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.830
helicopter is that's all that's going on
there let's do another scale and

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840
there let's do another scale and
 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.350
there let's do another scale and
indirect measurement problem so it says

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360
indirect measurement problem so it says
 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.510
indirect measurement problem so it says
on a Sunday morning the shadow of the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520
on a Sunday morning the shadow of the
 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.610
on a Sunday morning the shadow of the
Empire State Building is 600 feet long

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620
Empire State Building is 600 feet long
 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.700
Empire State Building is 600 feet long
at the same time the shadow of a

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710
at the same time the shadow of a
 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.719
at the same time the shadow of a
yardstick which is

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729
yardstick which is
 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.760
yardstick which is
three feet long is one foot five and a

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770
three feet long is one foot five and a
 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.980
three feet long is one foot five and a
quarter inches how high is the Empire

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990
quarter inches how high is the Empire
 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.790
quarter inches how high is the Empire
State Building

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800
State Building
 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:43.879
State Building
so we could say height of Empire two

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889
so we could say height of Empire two
 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:52.279
so we could say height of Empire two
length of shadow so length of a shadow

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289
length of shadow so length of a shadow
 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.749
length of shadow so length of a shadow
should of empire of Empire should be

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759
should of empire of Empire should be
 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.079
should of empire of Empire should be
equal to taking the length of a

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:01.089
equal to taking the length of a
 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:01.890
equal to taking the length of a
yardstick

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900
yardstick
 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.059
yardstick
so height height of yardstick I'm

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:06.069
so height height of yardstick I'm
 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.379
so height height of yardstick I'm
assuming that they're pointing up the

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:07.389
assuming that they're pointing up the
 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.869
assuming that they're pointing up the
yardstick like a skyscraper height of

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:09.879
yardstick like a skyscraper height of
 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:20.029
yardstick like a skyscraper height of
yardstick divided by length of shadow of

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039
yardstick divided by length of shadow of
 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.429
yardstick divided by length of shadow of
yardstick now this problem looks a

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:23.439
yardstick now this problem looks a
 

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.230
yardstick now this problem looks a
little bit hairier because we have feet

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240
little bit hairier because we have feet
 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.179
little bit hairier because we have feet
here then we have one foot five and a

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:27.189
here then we have one foot five and a
 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:28.950
here then we have one foot five and a
quarter inches and you do everything in

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960
quarter inches and you do everything in
 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.959
quarter inches and you do everything in
inches and do everything in feet and the

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:30.969
inches and do everything in feet and the
 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:32.219
inches and do everything in feet and the
interesting thing is here you can look

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:32.229
interesting thing is here you can look
 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:34.709
interesting thing is here you can look
at the units as long as we calculate

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:34.719
at the units as long as we calculate
 

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:38.070
at the units as long as we calculate
this in feet and we calculate this in

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080
this in feet and we calculate this in
 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.379
this in feet and we calculate this in
feet down here these units are going to

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:40.389
feet down here these units are going to
 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.110
feet down here these units are going to
cancel out if you have you know X feet

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120
cancel out if you have you know X feet
 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.589
cancel out if you have you know X feet
divided by 600 feet in this case the

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599
divided by 600 feet in this case the
 

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:47.670
divided by 600 feet in this case the
feet are going to cancel out you'll have

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680
feet are going to cancel out you'll have
 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.920
feet are going to cancel out you'll have
a unit list quantity so it's really just

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:49.930
a unit list quantity so it's really just
 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.260
a unit list quantity so it's really just
going to be a pure ratio same thing here

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270
going to be a pure ratio same thing here
 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.119
going to be a pure ratio same thing here
and you could do it in feet or you could

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:54.129
and you could do it in feet or you could
 

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:55.559
and you could do it in feet or you could
do it in inches and you could actually

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:55.569
do it in inches and you could actually
 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:57.659
do it in inches and you could actually
do this in feet and do this side and

00:07:57.659 --> 00:07:57.669
do this in feet and do this side and
 

00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:59.730
do this in feet and do this side and
inches because you get feet divided by

00:07:59.730 --> 00:07:59.740
inches because you get feet divided by
 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.559
inches because you get feet divided by
feet the feet cancel out the inches

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:01.569
feet the feet cancel out the inches
 

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:03.839
feet the feet cancel out the inches
cancel out so they stay unitless so it

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:03.849
cancel out so they stay unitless so it
 

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:05.159
cancel out so they stay unitless so it
actually becomes a lot easier when you

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:05.169
actually becomes a lot easier when you
 

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:07.409
actually becomes a lot easier when you
can keep the right side in inches and

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:07.419
can keep the right side in inches and
 

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:09.959
can keep the right side in inches and
you can keep the left side and feet so

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:09.969
you can keep the left side and feet so
 

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:11.369
you can keep the left side and feet so
let's say the height of the Empire State

00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:11.379
let's say the height of the Empire State
 

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.809
let's say the height of the Empire State
Building is X so we could say X feet

00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819
Building is X so we could say X feet
 

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:18.420
Building is X so we could say X feet
over the length of the shadow the shadow

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:18.430
over the length of the shadow the shadow

over 600 feet is equal to the length of

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:25.149
over 600 feet is equal to the length of
 

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:27.629
over 600 feet is equal to the length of
a yardstick standing up with a height of

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639
a yardstick standing up with a height of
 

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.489
a yardstick standing up with a height of
a yardstick let's do it inches three

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:29.499
a yardstick let's do it inches three
 

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:33.240
a yardstick let's do it inches three
feet long it's 36 inches 36 inches and I

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.250
feet long it's 36 inches 36 inches and I
 

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.790
feet long it's 36 inches 36 inches and I
want to show you that the units work out

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800
want to show you that the units work out
 

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.829
want to show you that the units work out
36 inches divided by the length of its

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839
36 inches divided by the length of its
 

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:40.769
36 inches divided by the length of its
shadow one foot five and a quarter

00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:40.779
shadow one foot five and a quarter
 

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:43.139
shadow one foot five and a quarter
inches what's that one foot is 12 inches

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:43.149
inches what's that one foot is 12 inches
 

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:44.159
inches what's that one foot is 12 inches
two

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:44.169
two
 

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.069

plus five and a quarter is 17 and a

00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:47.079
plus five and a quarter is 17 and a
 

00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:53.699
plus five and a quarter is 17 and a
quarter or 17 0.25 inches and notice the

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:53.709
quarter or 17 0.25 inches and notice the
 

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:56.250
quarter or 17 0.25 inches and notice the
units cancel out feet divided by feet

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.260
units cancel out feet divided by feet
 

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.470
units cancel out feet divided by feet
inches divided by inches so they just

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480
inches divided by inches so they just
 

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.920
inches divided by inches so they just
become pure ratios x over 600 is equal

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:01.930
become pure ratios x over 600 is equal
 

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.000
become pure ratios x over 600 is equal
to 36 over 17 0.25 the reason why I

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.010
to 36 over 17 0.25 the reason why I
 

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.680
to 36 over 17 0.25 the reason why I
could use feet here and inches here is

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:07.690
could use feet here and inches here is
 

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.150
could use feet here and inches here is
because the unit's cancel I don't want

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160
because the unit's cancel I don't want
 

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.519
because the unit's cancel I don't want
to make that very very very clear now we

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:11.529
to make that very very very clear now we
 

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:14.850
to make that very very very clear now we
can just cross the multiply which is

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:14.860
can just cross the multiply which is
 

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.930
can just cross the multiply which is
essentially just multiplying both sides

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:15.940
essentially just multiplying both sides
 

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.379
essentially just multiplying both sides
of the equation by 617 point two five so

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:19.389
of the equation by 617 point two five so
 

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:22.530

17 point two five times X 17 point two

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:22.540
17 point two five times X 17 point two
 

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.879
17 point two five times X 17 point two
two five times X is going to be equal to

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:28.889
two five times X is going to be equal to
 

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:36.540
two five times X is going to be equal to
36 times 600 times 600 and then we can

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:36.550
36 times 600 times 600 and then we can
 

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.740
36 times 600 times 600 and then we can
divide both sides by 17 0.25 divided

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:40.750
divide both sides by 17 0.25 divided
 

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.980

let's just round it so X is equal to

00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079
let's just round it so X is equal to
 

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:12.810
let's just round it so X is equal to
1250 2.2 feet which is almost a quarter

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:12.820
1250 2.2 feet which is almost a quarter
 

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.310
1250 2.2 feet which is almost a quarter
of a mile so the Empire State Building

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320
of a mile so the Empire State Building
 

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.350
of a mile so the Empire State Building
is pretty high but this was pretty neat

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360
is pretty high but this was pretty neat
 

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.449
is pretty high but this was pretty neat
because this is something that you could

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:18.459
because this is something that you could
 

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.910
because this is something that you could
actually do you could actually measure

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920
actually do you could actually measure
 

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.449
actually do you could actually measure
the shadow of a skyscraper and then you

00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:24.459
the shadow of a skyscraper and then you
 

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:27.720
the shadow of a skyscraper and then you
could actually measure the shadow of a

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:27.730
could actually measure the shadow of a
 

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.420
could actually measure the shadow of a
yardstick and then doing that you can

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:30.430
yardstick and then doing that you can
 

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.819
yardstick and then doing that you can
actually figure out the height of a

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:32.829
actually figure out the height of a
 

00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:35.370
actually figure out the height of a
skyscraper which is pretty neat because

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:35.380
skyscraper which is pretty neat because
 

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.660
skyscraper which is pretty neat because
other way you know if you didn't do know

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:36.670
other way you know if you didn't do know
 

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.740
other way you know if you didn't do know
how to do this math you'd have to get

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:37.750
how to do this math you'd have to get
 

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.360
how to do this math you'd have to get
into a helicopter and drop a huge I mean

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.370
into a helicopter and drop a huge I mean
 

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.100
into a helicopter and drop a huge I mean
it'd be a much harder thing to do so

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.110
it'd be a much harder thing to do so
 

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.329
it'd be a much harder thing to do so
hopefully you found that pretty

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:42.339
hopefully you found that pretty
 

00:10:42.339 --> 00:10:44.940
hopefully you found that pretty
interesting
