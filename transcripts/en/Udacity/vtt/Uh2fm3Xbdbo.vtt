00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.360
All right. This is what I'm going to do.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.840
I'm guessing it's just like any other field, except

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.500
it's called formula. going to call it Total Tickets Sold.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.450
Okay, return type. I'm guessing, since I'm just adding

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.700
numbers together, I'm not going to get a date or

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.120
anything, I'm going to get a number. I don't really

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.460
know what this checkbox business is, but I'm not

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.610
going to worry about it. options, decimal places. I don't

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.530
want any decimal places. These are integers,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.390
my friend. 'Kay. 'Kay, this is a little

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.680
tricky. okay. General admission, tickets sold. And then

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.390
I'm going to add it. And just write plus.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.420
&gt;&gt; You can. So if you didn't know what kind of operators you could

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.070
use, that insert operator there tells you

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.250
exactly the simple operations you can do.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
&gt;&gt; Add, subtract, yeah makes sense. Okay. So general admission tickets

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.670
sold and it's using the Code E version, but we're okay with

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.520
that. I'm going to add that to VIP tickets sold. And I think that's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.240
what I want. I'm just going to try this and see if it

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.730
works. Should I hit this check syntax? no syntax errors found, excellent, next.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.860
&gt;&gt; So you made it visible to everyone, you're going to automatically

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.930
add it to the page and let's go look at a record.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.000
&gt;&gt; This is the moment of truth.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.200
When I click, on Cloudstock

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.260
hey, hey, alright. That's pretty cool.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.810
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.540
&gt;&gt; It's really getting smarter.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.540
&gt;&gt;

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.285
[LAUGH]

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:28.950
&gt;&gt; Okay. an I'm going to just delete this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.910
field as well, cause it's annoying me now.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.910
&gt;&gt;

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.501
