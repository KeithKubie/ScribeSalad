basically the world is this incredibly

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
basically the world is this incredibly
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.299
basically the world is this incredibly
rich and complex place with all sorts of

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
rich and complex place with all sorts of
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.700
rich and complex place with all sorts of
very very interesting complicated things

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
very very interesting complicated things
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.400
very very interesting complicated things
happening around us skin folding

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
happening around us skin folding
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.800

clothing folding hair flowing in the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
clothing folding hair flowing in the
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.560
clothing folding hair flowing in the
wind and my research attempts to capture

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
wind and my research attempts to capture
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.450
wind and my research attempts to capture
these phenomena and simulate them in

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
these phenomena and simulate them in
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120
these phenomena and simulate them in
real time on commodity hardware and the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
real time on commodity hardware and the
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.040
real time on commodity hardware and the
way that we're doing that is by studying

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
way that we're doing that is by studying
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380
way that we're doing that is by studying
these types of phenomena and trying to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
these types of phenomena and trying to
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020
these types of phenomena and trying to
distill in some sense the simplest model

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
distill in some sense the simplest model
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.670
distill in some sense the simplest model
which will simulate them and it turns

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
which will simulate them and it turns
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.810
which will simulate them and it turns
out that you can sort of find

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
out that you can sort of find
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.420
out that you can sort of find
astonishingly simple models and then

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
astonishingly simple models and then
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610
astonishingly simple models and then
allow people not only to see we also to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
allow people not only to see we also to
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.050
allow people not only to see we also to
interact with these kinds of phenomenon

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060
interact with these kinds of phenomenon
 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.700
interact with these kinds of phenomenon
in real time these kinds of simulations

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
in real time these kinds of simulations
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.970
in real time these kinds of simulations
are used all the time in things like for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
are used all the time in things like for
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310
are used all the time in things like for
designing new airplane wings or for

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
designing new airplane wings or for
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.600
designing new airplane wings or for
figuring out what the weather will be

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
figuring out what the weather will be
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610
figuring out what the weather will be
tomorrow but they're sort of locked away

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
tomorrow but they're sort of locked away
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.040
tomorrow but they're sort of locked away
at in these like super computers and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
at in these like super computers and
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.540
at in these like super computers and
we're trying to take those exact

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
we're trying to take those exact
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.100
we're trying to take those exact
algorithms and put them in the hands of

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110
algorithms and put them in the hands of
 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.200
algorithms and put them in the hands of
like a five-year-old and be like what

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
like a five-year-old and be like what
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630
like a five-year-old and be like what
can you do with this right in the case

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
can you do with this right in the case
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.609
can you do with this right in the case
of the protein folding game what we're

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
of the protein folding game what we're
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.410
of the protein folding game what we're
doing is we're saying help us solve

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
doing is we're saying help us solve
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539
doing is we're saying help us solve
scientific problems by interacting with

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
scientific problems by interacting with
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429
scientific problems by interacting with
complex physical systems on your

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
complex physical systems on your
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410
complex physical systems on your
computer so we're sort of opening up

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
computer so we're sort of opening up
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.809
computer so we're sort of opening up
this world to ordinary people where they

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:14.819
this world to ordinary people where they
 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.969
this world to ordinary people where they
can like cooperate together and try to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
can like cooperate together and try to
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859
can like cooperate together and try to
figure out how can we build new drugs

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
figure out how can we build new drugs
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.480
figure out how can we build new drugs
and how can we you know sort of better

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
and how can we you know sort of better
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.520
and how can we you know sort of better
humanity in some sense so we have like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
humanity in some sense so we have like
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190
humanity in some sense so we have like
90 thousand users and thousand players

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
90 thousand users and thousand players
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.980
90 thousand users and thousand players
and they fold proteins and they compete

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
and they fold proteins and they compete
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.389
and they fold proteins and they compete
with one another and the interesting

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399
with one another and the interesting
 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:33.379
with one another and the interesting
thing is that the proteins they're

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:33.389
thing is that the proteins they're
 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:36.050
thing is that the proteins they're
folding are hopefully actually medically

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
folding are hopefully actually medically
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120
folding are hopefully actually medically
useful so we take the results of what

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
useful so we take the results of what
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469
useful so we take the results of what
the top players are doing and actually

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
the top players are doing and actually
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719
the top players are doing and actually
study what they're doing and see if we

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
study what they're doing and see if we
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.099
study what they're doing and see if we
can actually synthesize those proteins

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109
can actually synthesize those proteins
 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.529
can actually synthesize those proteins
and use them to make new enzymes or

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539
and use them to make new enzymes or
 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.699
and use them to make new enzymes or
interesting that yeah antigens and stuff

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709
interesting that yeah antigens and stuff
 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.769
interesting that yeah antigens and stuff
like that so yeah it's pretty cool we're

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:51.779
like that so yeah it's pretty cool we're
 

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.599
like that so yeah it's pretty cool we're
basically asking ordinary people to help

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609
basically asking ordinary people to help
 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.699
basically asking ordinary people to help
us do science by playing a video game

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709
us do science by playing a video game
 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.219
us do science by playing a video game
one of the really inspiring things that

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
one of the really inspiring things that
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.870
one of the really inspiring things that
I felt immediately when I came here and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
I felt immediately when I came here and
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.129
I felt immediately when I came here and
that I feel every day when I walk

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139
that I feel every day when I walk
 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.539
that I feel every day when I walk
through the halls is just how good

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
through the halls is just how good
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.059
through the halls is just how good
everyone here is and it's just an

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069
everyone here is and it's just an
 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.469
everyone here is and it's just an
amazing thing to be able to work with

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
amazing thing to be able to work with
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.389
amazing thing to be able to work with
these people who all sort of have like a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
these people who all sort of have like a
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.270
these people who all sort of have like a
superpower and to want to have a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
superpower and to want to have a
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.040
superpower and to want to have a
superpower to and and sort of join

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
superpower to and and sort of join
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.110
superpower to and and sort of join
forces with them and fight evil as it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
forces with them and fight evil as it
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.320
forces with them and fight evil as it
were

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
were
 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.590
were
scientifically and and that's just

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
scientifically and and that's just
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.900
scientifically and and that's just
really really exciting place to be and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
really really exciting place to be and
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940
really really exciting place to be and
you just want to work with all these

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
you just want to work with all these
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.550
you just want to work with all these
people and be as good as them and and do

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
people and be as good as them and and do
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.900
people and be as good as them and and do
as good work as everyone else is doing

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910
as good work as everyone else is doing
 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.380
as good work as everyone else is doing
so it's really inspiring that way
