00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.502
Uh, we were in the middle
of a training exercise

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.771
this morning, and, uh...

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:07.340
Sonny here ate about
2 1/2 pounds

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.109
of C4 plastic explosive.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.511
If this dog moves too suddenly

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.313
he's gonna go up like Nagasaki.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.516
So hopefully pretty soon

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.551
the C4 will mix
with the manwiches

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:19.786
I've been feeding
with him all morning

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.055
and nature will
run its course

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.823
and I will be able
to retrieve--

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.996
You can do it.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.966
You can do it.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.337
Jesus [bleep].

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.006
- Hi, my favorite.
- Hi. Yeah.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.741
Hi, my favorite.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:45.178
I'm gonna get this belly.
I'm gonna get this belly, belly.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.280
I'm gonna get your belly,
belly, belly.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.749
Yeah, you got his belly,
belly, belly, alright.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.317
He gets the [bleep] point.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.752
You got his belly, belly, belly.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.220
Now back the [bleep] off.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.823
- Hey! Hey!
- No. No.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.958
- He's my friend.
- No, no, no, no.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.260
No, no, no.
No, no, no--

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:02.662
That's a little too friendly.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.163
I'll see you later.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.731
Please don't hump
the nice officer.

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:07.433
Here, come on.
Hey, hey. Hey.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.868
Hey. How about right here?

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.036
Hey, how about right here?

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.204
Yeah.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:14.941
Mission accomplished.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.177
Ew!

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.079
You know, that's 90%
of law enforcement

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.381
is just perseverance--
Stick to the task.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:23.449
- Hi, Travis.
- Right, sonny?

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:24.951
Hey, how you doing?
