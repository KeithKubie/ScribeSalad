00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.000
I’m Luyen, CEO and founder of DivMob.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.960
I have a small team of game developers in Ho Chi Minh City.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.980
We started our company three years ago with only five people.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.000
Today, we have a team of 40

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.080
and our games have been downloaded more than 40 million times. 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.760
Our current big game is Epic Heroes War.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.000
(In Vietnamese)&lt;i&gt; I'm Minh, game designer at DivMob.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.000
Epic Heroes War is so popular because it's easy to play. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.760
Users can have a big collection of gods from many cultures

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.240
and you can have online battles with other players across the world.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.460
Earlier, majority of our paid users came from the US and European countries.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.360
They will pay a dollar or more on gems and upgrades within the game.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.000
But in emerging markets such as Vietnam, one dollar is a lot of money. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.680
One dollar in Vietnam, you can buy lunch.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.200
We have always wanted to experiment with the pricing in markets like Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.720
I’m Phuc, Chief Technology Officer at DivMob.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.160
We are very happy with the results of Google introducing sub-dollar pricing. 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.560
We reduced our prices in markets where we thought people weren't buying due to price.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.820
To support the new pricing, all we had to do was configure the in-app product price

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.120
on the Google Developer Console. It’s very easy to manage.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.460
To highlight the new pricing, we created a new boss fighting feature

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.480
and offered it to users in sub-dollar pricing.

and offered it to users in sub-dollar pricing. 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.680
It helped us convert a lot of free users to paid users.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.400
We saw instant success.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.280
Our daily transactions have grown by 300%.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.680
We have also seen our number of paying users multiply three times.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.720
This is very important. Paying users are more engaged and you can monetize them over a lifetime.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.500
Today six of our top 10 markets in number of transactions

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.520
are from markets where we have introduced sub-dollar pricing.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.920
I always try to give my team freedom to be creative.  

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.880
We work together. We eat together. We play football together.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.080
We succeed together.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.640
What do I want to do next? It's easy.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.120
Make the best game we can.
