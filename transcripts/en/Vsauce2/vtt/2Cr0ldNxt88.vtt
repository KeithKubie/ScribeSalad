00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.860
Say goodbye to drills as a new cavity-filling
technique that uses electrical current could

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.210
be available to the public in three years.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.760
And a fungus in the soil of Nova Scotia has
been found to help combat antibiotic-resistant

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.970
superbugs.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.779
So on behalf of the rest of the world - thank
you Canadian dirt!

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.589
Vsauce, Kevin here.....This is Mind Blow.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.499
The Cruise RP-1 is the first highway autopilot
for your car.

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.820
The device keeps your car in its lane a safe
distance from the car in front of you and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.100
is always watching the road even if you aren't.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.620
It can be installed on your existing vehicle
so you can sit back and let the car do the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.680
work by controlling the steering, throttle
and braking.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.170
And they're taking pre-orders for 2015 right
now.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.280
The Cozy Room lets you hide from everything.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.680
The Japanese relaxation room comes with space
for a TV or computer, shelves to display collections,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.769
and a personal desk.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.050
It costs $8,000 but unfortunately doesn't
come with plumbing, a refrigerator, or air

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.050
conditioning.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.590
Pelty is a high quality speaker that runs
off of the power from a single wax candle.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.120
It turns the thermal energy from the candle
into enough electric energy to power the speaker

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.790
and amplify the music.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.050
And it has no wires and connects via bluetooth
making it eco-friendly and easy to transport.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.630
A group of chimps have created a fashion trend.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.750
When popular chimp Julie stuck a piece of
grass in her ear back in 2010 it caught on

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990
with all the other chimps..... now they're
all doing it.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.990
So yeah.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.960
The ReWalk is the first FDA approved exoskeleton
for use in the home and in the community.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.390
The robotic device enables hip and knee motion
allowing those with spinal cord injuries to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.390
stand.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.040
When the user tilts forward the walking motion
is activated and repeated shifting creates

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.740
a sequence of steps.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.920
The Rewalk has the ability to sit, stand,
turn, and climb stairs giving paraplegics

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.930
extensive mobility options to explore.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.170
Eta is a human-powered bike capable of going
133.8 km/hour.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.860
And it looks like a giant bullet on wheels.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.690
The rider sits comfortably inside and uses
displays from cameras to see the road.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.240
It won't be able to be used on highways any
time soon due to its inability to survive

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.590
a collision and low visibility.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.970
But they hope that in the future this technology
could be used for a cleaner alternative to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.970
driving.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.700
Engineers at the University of Illinois are
creating biobots.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.010
These biological robots are powered by muscle
cells and controlled with electrical impulses.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.700
They're using skeletal muscle cells because
of their ability to be controlled, making

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.170
it possible to customize each bot for a specific
task or application.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.520
This is the first step in developing biological
machines that can be programmed and trained

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.620
to do work.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.080
Luke Butcher of Cambridge believes skinny
wormholes could be kept stable long enough

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.250
to send a beam of light carrying a message
anywhere in the universe or throughout time

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.250
itself.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.700
This is theoretical but awesome.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.920
Smart Bricks are like giant Lego for building
houses, bridges and sidewalks.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.690
The large concrete Kite Bricks are designed
to be easily joined together and the company

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.250
claims these building materials provide a
50% reduction in building costs and they hope

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.860
to implement the technology everywhere from
Africa to Manhattan.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.710
British airways created a happiness blanket.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.250
It changes color to reflect the mood of the
wearer by measuring electrical fluctuations

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.620
with a headband and sending the information
to fibre optic lights woven into the fabric.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.180
With red means stressed and blue meaning relaxed.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.000
They used the information to test changes
they had made onboard, such as entertainment

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.640
and sleeping options, so they could see the
actual physical effects these had on passengers.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.880
The EKOCYCLE is a 3D printer that uses post
consumer waste as printing material.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.550
Each cartridge turns three 20oz plastic bottles
into anything from accessories to decorations.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.190
And they say it's not just a tool for making
but remaking things and changing the way people

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.599
think about recycling.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.130
Finally, Confluence is a short film using
macro and microscopes shot in 4k with a red

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.130
camera

00:04:08.130 --> 00:05:08.239
I'm gonna leave you with a crash-proof drone
and as always.... thanks for watching.
