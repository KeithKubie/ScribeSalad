1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,870
You are listening to radio lab radio

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,710
from W N y.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,320
S. T. E. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad
Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

4
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,900
The podcasts podcast.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,820
Will we should just say as a sort
of set the set the ground here,

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,120
set the ground, does that
table table, whatever, uh,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,000
that we are on the cusp of delivering
five really fantastic shows right now.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,360
So we're busy, busy, busy, very busy.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,350
Which got us thinking about a
conversation that I had a few years ago,

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,010
which was conveniently, they're
waiting with Malcolm Gladwell,

11
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,600
the author of outliers and blink.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,870
I was over at the 92nd street
y in New York City. Okay.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,310
Just pull it to your mouth there.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,260
The subject was how do you explain people
of really unusual, exceptional talent?

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,620
Like why are they so good here? What
is the nature of being exceptional?

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,070
Is this, you know, working hard or
need ability? Is it an accident?

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,720
And as we all know in America,

18
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:02,520
there's a real hunt on from a very early
age to find the gifted and talented

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,383
children.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,810
And we have programs in our schools
all over the country trying to identify

21
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:11,340
exceptional kids. Malcolm Gladwell
hates gifted and talented program.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,280
Yeah, it's ridiculous. Why do you decide,

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,310
so a gifted program says that we identify
a child and call that child gifted

24
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:25,260
because of their performance at the age
of whatever, nine or 10 or 11 years old.

25
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,970
Why do we care?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,990
Particularly how well a child performs
at nine or 10 or 11 years old,

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,280
they're nine or 10 or 11 there are
good 25 years to making any kind of

28
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:39,780
substantial contribution to the world.
Why don't we wait? What's the hurry?

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,140
And also how do you
know? So like you know,

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,640
so one child learns to
read it for one child,

31
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:52,560
learns to read it, two and a half.
Right. So what, why does it matter?

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,920
Are the things that are being read
between two and a half and four of such

33
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,120
incalculable?

34
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,820
No, no, no. [inaudible] normal
parents response to, Oh,

35
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,580
if he's reading it two and a half,
think of the things he'll do.

36
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,080
And it's just an extrapolation

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,520
like reading is reading. Once
you can read, we're done. I mean,

38
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,270
it's not like there's an,

39
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,530
there's an infinite scale and so-and-so
reads better and better and better.

40
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:16,490
And I can say,

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,720
we can say today of Gladwell that he
reads so much better than Krulwich.

42
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,770
And that this is like what separates the
two of us. It's speeding. I mean like,

43
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,930
well there is also among your, you
use the phrase the Matthew effect.

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,850
What does that Matthew fact is?

45
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,250
I'm a phrase coined by Robert K Merton,

46
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,700
the great genius sociologist of Columbia.

47
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,270
He's the guy who says in the verse in
Matthew which says that I'm to him who has

48
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,540
much more will be given. Um, and he
uses this to describe the Matthew FAQ,

49
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,610
which is this notion that a
small initial advantage, um,

50
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,830
difference in a small initial difference
in the performance of any two people

51
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,990
will inevitably grow.

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,680
Because the person who is a little bit
ahead will get so many more advantages

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,070
that they will end up being
far ahead. So a good example,

54
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,760
there's all kinds of great Matthew
effects. So if you're born,

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,710
if you're a young boy
born in October, November,

56
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,580
or December,

57
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,410
who has designs on being a professional
soccer or hockey player, um,

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,670
the deck is stacked against you. There's
not much you can do. You, you, um,

59
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,320
you should probably give out

60
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,790
but not, but here's why we
don't. Why exactly. Well,

61
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:38,230
it's really an accident of birth thing.
The month you were born in Malcolm,

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,790
things might make a huge, huge
difference in their life here.

63
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,060
Here's his way of describing this.

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,320
I'm going to read here a
passage from his book outliers.

65
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,040
On page 23 of your book. You do a
play by play and every way to do this,

66
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,660
we're at the Memorial Cup
hockey championship and I
want to read what you wrote.

67
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,290
March 11 starts around one
side of the Tigers Net,

68
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,460
leaving the puck for his team. May
January 4th, he passes it to January 22,

69
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:07,030
flips it back to March 12th who shoots
point blank at the Tigers goalie.

70
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:08,050
April 27th,

71
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:12,780
April 27th blocks to shot reed mounted
by Vancouver's march 60 shoots medicine

72
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,780
half defenseman, February 9th and
February 14th dive to block the puck.

73
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:20,290
January 10th looks on
helplessly March 6th scores.

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,640
Question is why did you choose
this peculiar kind of nomenclature?

75
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,090
Because I wanted to make this point that
all an extraordinary number of hockey

76
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,620
players, um,

77
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,190
and are born in the first three
or four months of the year.

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,720
17 of the 25 players on the medicine
hat team were born in those first few

79
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:44,150
months. Why? Because, uh, uh,

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,280
the eligibility cutoff date for four age
class hockey in Canada in the world is

81
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:54,651
January 1st and we start recruiting
allstar squads in hockey and Canada when

82
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,130
peep kids are nine and 10 years old. But
of course when you're nine years old,

83
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,530
the best one is the oldest one, right?

84
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,680
So all you do is you choose the kids who
are born closest to the cutoff date and

85
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:09,420
then you give them special coaching and
put them on all star squads until nine

86
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:13,020
and extra games and extra practice
until eight and nine years later.

87
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,030
They really are the best. And by the way,

88
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,940
we see exactly the same effects in
school systems, right? The kid, the,

89
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,670
the, the relatively youngest
kids in the class, um,

90
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,970
a underperformed the
relatively oldest, um, uh,

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,530
kids and that underperformance
last into the college years,

92
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,980
the kid born, the youngest
kid born the last, you know,

93
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,450
three months of the youngest,

94
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,510
three months of their age cohort
in school or something like,

95
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:40,470
I forget the exact number,

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,630
nine or 10% less likely to go to
college than those born in the are the,

97
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,520
in the three oldest months and
we can fix it really easily.

98
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,810
You've got three classes in
an elementary school, right?

99
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,560
Typical elementary schools go up,
divide them up by birthday, right?

100
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,290
Doesn't that mean though
that that you have get,

101
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,920
you had to like a half dozen soccer
moms to work out the logistical problems

102
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,000
because you've now got four leads?

103
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,660
We used to have one and someone has to
be in the Seward park on Mondays and

104
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,550
Wednesdays, but who's going to be inserted
fucking Thursdays and Fridays. Okay.

105
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,670
So you would just for the sake of
efficiency, you'd know, I was very happy.

106
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,510
I was shocked. I was to know two thirds
of them. Know what I'm saying? No,

107
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:18,540
but your, this is exactly why
I brought this up with, um,

108
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,430
I had a conversation with this hockey
guy in Canada. Big Deal hockey.

109
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,030
Mocker I dunno whether they call them
markers. You can go and Matthews here,

110
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,560
but absolutely. And I say to him, look,

111
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,410
you're Canada, you want to be the
best hockey country in the world.

112
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,110
Why don't you have the three
parallel leaks? How hard is that?

113
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,210
Every single town in Canada has
like 25 different hockey teams.

114
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,850
Just divide them up. How hard is this?
He, he's like, oh, it's too difficult.

115
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,730
Well, let me make it, let me give
you a harder one because cause uh,

116
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,600
just another success puzzle from the
book. This is off to set up for you.

117
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,510
It's um, it's about the Janklow
family. So there's two gang close.

118
00:06:57,511 --> 00:07:00,700
We're gonna talk about more and Mort,
but since those are names are socially,

119
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,980
we caught one daddy Janklow
and one Sonny Genco. Yeah.

120
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,200
So daddy goes to Brooklyn law school
class in 1919 sets up a practice in

121
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:13,340
Brooklyn, elegant fellow dresses in
a Homburg Bruce brother's clothes,

122
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,610
drives a big car and we was the queens,
married the right girl, worked hard,

123
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:20,690
hard, hard, hard sets of the
business, goes nowhere. The

124
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,370
Sun Baby Janklow when 30 years
later it gets a law degree,

125
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,490
marries nicely to works hard to
put together a cable franchise,

126
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,700
sells it to Cox Broadcasting, makes
a fortune, creates a literary agency.

127
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,180
Janklow and Nesbitt signs you
now he lives on Park Avenue.

128
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:39,620
He has an Anselm Kiefer painting on
his own airplane. So the question is,

129
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:43,010
is the son succeeds? The
father fails. Why is this

130
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,670
that definitely that part. The
book I'm really interested in, um,

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
generational effects, uh,

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,640
the worst year to be born in the
20th century is you can all kinds of

133
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,000
sociologists figure these things out.

134
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,270
It's between 1900 and 1907 or maybe at
1,919 10 that decade because you get out

135
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:08,670
of college and the, just as you're
getting going to depression hits, yeah,

136
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,890
you have nine years of depression.

137
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,250
And just as you're emerging out the
depression, trying to make a go of it,

138
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,890
you're shipped off to
war for six years. Right?

139
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:20,070
And so by the time you come back,
I want to start your business.

140
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,770
You're in your late forties
right? So it's really,

141
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:26,280
really hard for where is the best
year to be born in the 20th century.

142
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,200
If you live in, grew up in New York
City, actually I think anywhere,

143
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,230
but particularly in New York City is
1935 because it's perfect because you,

144
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,810
it's the smallest birth
year of the 20th century.

145
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,440
You always want to be part of a really
small birth cohort because no one's

146
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,420
competing with you. Right? Think about it.

147
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,460
So the difference between being a part
of the smallest postcard and the largest

148
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:56,250
one, the differences between
the smallest one is enormous.

149
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,360
It's like per capita twice as
many babies are born in, you know,

150
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:05,361
1920 is 1935 so if you're a nursing 35
there's this huge generation before you.

151
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,090
So what do they do for that
generation? They build big, huge,

152
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:13,800
shiny schools and hire tons of teachers.
Right? Then there's no more kids.

153
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,980
So you sail in and all of a sudden your
older brother had 35 kids in this class,

154
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:25,251
you have 18 your older brother competed
against a zillion people to get into

155
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:29,600
city college. You competed against no
one you wanted to join the debate team.

156
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,320
No one went out for the debate team.
You are captain of the base team.

157
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,090
Like I always, you know it's funny,

158
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,170
you always talk to people well in this
forum itch small cohorts and they always

159
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:43,460
think you're talking to
some guy accomplished old
guy, grew up in the Bronx,

160
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,290
white hair and he'll tell you about his
extraordinary high school experiences.

161
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,390
And so you know, I was captain of
the basketball team and you look at,

162
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,590
this guy is five foot two
and you say to yourself,

163
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,710
this is a man who belonged
to a small generation, right?

164
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,400
Nobody was going out for
basketball. So these guys,

165
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,890
they haven't made in the shade and
then they come into the workforce. No,

166
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,960
they go to a Harvard law school. Of course
they go to Harvard law school, right?

167
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,670
No one's applying to Harvard law school.
And they get out in the workforce,

168
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,350
do they get a job? Of course they do.

169
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,660
Everyone's desperate for work
because there's no one out there.

170
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,040
And then what's behind them? The
biggest generation of 20th century.

171
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,300
So they sail in the positions of authority
and they have in front of them this

172
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:24,910
enormous market to serve,
right? It's just genius.

173
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,300
You can even go more specifically,
this is great thing that happens.

174
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:32,890
Great in quotation marks in New
York City, in the depression,

175
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,010
which is that a whole bunch
of very, very, very able,

176
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,890
people can't get jobs
in the private sector.

177
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,270
There are no jobs in private sectors. So
what do they do? They become teachers,

178
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,290
right?

179
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,070
And you talked to this generation born
in 35 about their high school experience.

180
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,420
And I lost count and the number of people
of that generation who went to public

181
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,670
schools in New York who
told me, for example,

182
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:57,280
that their math teacher had a phd in math.

183
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,510
And so here's the generation who not
only could they be kept on the basketball

184
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:05,950
team, but their teachers were these
extraordinary people who you know, were,

185
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,170
um, by virtue of a lack of opportunity
ended up in the public school system.

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,980
So is that the difference then
between Janklow Dan and Genco son?

187
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,580
That is just the beginning of the
explanation. I mean, I never met Jankel.

188
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,200
I mean, you can only go so far with this,

189
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:24,880
but it helps you to sort of set
the stage to understand his shoe.

190
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:28,060
You've got these two very capable people,

191
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,790
one of whom achieved extraordinary
success and one didn't. And you,

192
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,320
I think you have to go beyond the
individual to make sense of them, right?

193
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,840
I mean,

194
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,530
so there is such a thing as getting an
accidental boost and I mean, you know,

195
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,350
nobody chooses when they're going to be
born. It's always mom and dad's fault,

196
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,040
but there's something even bigger and
even more important than good luck with

197
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,870
your birthday. And you illustrate this.

198
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:51,290
Malcolm cites the example of bill gates,

199
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,460
he so-called genius behind Microsoft.

200
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,940
When you say so-called, you'll see
here's the luckiest guy in the world.

201
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,830
And he's the first to tell
you that, um, he goes to, uh,

202
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,730
he shows up for eighth grade in
1968 or nine at a lakeside academy.

203
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,080
And for reasons no one can remember,

204
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:16,081
somebody on the parent's committee bought
a computer for the kids and a little

205
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,950
teletype hooked into the main
mainframe in downtown Seattle.

206
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,590
And Gates has essentially now what
that allows you is to do realtime

207
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,040
programming. Everyone, everyone's
programmed with cards back then, right?

208
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,880
Which is incredibly
laborious, time consuming.

209
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,100
And you don't really learn at a
program cause it just takes too long.

210
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,240
He can do real time programming the way
we program now on this little teletype.

211
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,720
And he does that starting in 1968
basically for his entire teenage life.

212
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,790
Um, and you mean that almost
literally. Yeah. You tell him,

213
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,950
he told me this one story about,

214
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,250
he then goes to these whole series
of things of finding other computers.

215
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,810
And at one point, Paul Allen is
Pat's paid at this school, um,

216
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,800
discovers that there's a mainframe that's
free at the University of Washington

217
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,600
Medical Center between,

218
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,780
it's free between two and six
in the morning on weeknights,

219
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,340
and he's now 15 years old.

220
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,110
And so he sets his alarm for one 30 in
the morning and he crawls out the window,

221
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:11,440
right?

222
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,710
Because someone's parents know at two
in the morning walks two miles to the

223
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:19,360
arrest of Washington programs from two
til six walks home and goes back to bed.

224
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,270
And his mom, upon discovering
this years later says,

225
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,860
I was wondering why it was so hard
to get bill up in the morning. Um,

226
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,650
so the question is, he's
clearly a brilliant guy.

227
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,980
No one's taking that away from him,
but he has this other thing which he,

228
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,470
by the way, what's really
remarkable about that,

229
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:39,670
but the story to me is
when he does that, he's 15.

230
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,170
So he's a teenage boy. And then all of
us here know about teenage boys, right?

231
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,680
Or what did he need to do? I want to do
what is the tangible I want to do? Well,

232
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,900
what does one of the things that
teenage boy wants to do? Sleep right?

233
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,360
Here's a kid, here's a teenage boy who
was willing to surrender his sleep,

234
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,860
you know, five nights a week to
program from two, six in the morning.

235
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,020
That is what's special about Bill Gates.

236
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,510
And it accumulates,
right? It gets, it's out.

237
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,620
It's three hours or four hours a day and
then five hours a day whenever you can

238
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:11,880
make it six hours a day. It's for
years and years and years until he,

239
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,040
a lot of hours. Yeah. Uh,

240
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,370
and Mozart I guess play the piano for
lawful hours and tiger woods just plays

241
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,250
out. People are all examples of
what's called the 10,000 hour rule,

242
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,920
which is this notion that, um,

243
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,360
Scott of brilliant kind of Ericsson a
psychologist has kind of formulated this

244
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:35,500
principle that if you look at any kind
of cognitively complex discipline,

245
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,360
it seems almost without exception,
that in order to be good,

246
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,770
you must practice at least 10,000
hours. What sort of surprised me?

247
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,640
You put the Beatles on this list. Why
are the Beatles? Because they go to, um,

248
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,920
Humberg, uh, before they
come to America as teenagers,

249
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:54,160
they go to Hamburg and they play a,

250
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,400
they're the house band in a strip
club and they play eight hour sets,

251
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,390
seven days a week for months at a
stretch. I mean, it's incredible. I mean,

252
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,853
you know,

253
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,740
paranthetically one cannot imagine a
more dismal experience than playing first

254
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,450
of all, playing in a strip club. Secondly,

255
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:16,040
playing at a strip club in Hamburg and
30 playing in a strip club in Hamburg in

256
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,890
the 50s. I mean, can you
imagine? It's just again,

257
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,730
so they learned in those hours and
hours and hours of playing every night.

258
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:27,510
They learned just to play and play and
play and play whatever. And somehow,

259
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,500
because I mean there is in
the book you're arguing,

260
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:34,290
I think that, I mean you
could say by the way,

261
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,670
that the rolling stones I don't
think went to Han Borg and uh,

262
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,610
there probably were other Liverpool bands
that did go to Hamburg and played in

263
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:44,440
the same strip clubs and you do not
know their names. I don't know how you,

264
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,680
it's a, isn't necessarily not
sufficient as sufficient on a, sorry,

265
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,110
I forget which way it goes, but whatever
way it goes, if that is that okay.

266
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,591
But now,

267
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:57,570
so what we got here then is you have
this talent plus the persistence versus

268
00:15:57,571 --> 00:16:00,360
this Matthew effect that
is the Matthew effect.

269
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:04,290
You start out with these little accidental
differences and then coaches and

270
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,920
situations magnify them so they get
bigger and bigger. But with persistence,

271
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:12,240
what seems to be happening here is the
accidental differences that that may have

272
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:16,530
given you. Advantages get narrowed when
you add the practice and the practice.

273
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,520
Add the practice. Mozart at 13, you know,

274
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,120
copying other people's work. Practice,
practice, practice, practice,

275
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,770
Mozart 17 better. Mozart
2124. Oh my God. All right,

276
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,630
so, um, Lennon and
McCartney at 15, 16, 17.

277
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:37,680
But when they make their jumps,
they make leaps of a genius.

278
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:41,460
Nature leaves that are not available
to other people. Isaac Newton,

279
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:44,160
he goes home for vacation, thinks
about, oh, how am I gonna measure this?

280
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,750
He invented calculus.

281
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,850
So you are being accused of
being a genius denier. Yes.

282
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Are you a genius denier or are
you simply a genius disliked her?

283
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,330
Um, well, so, uh, this career,

284
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:08,990
this thing called talent,
right? Great. Um, and it's this,

285
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,950
it's this, it's the, it's the,
it's the magic dust, right?

286
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,530
That gets sprinkled onto persistence.

287
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:19,970
It turns a lot of hard work into
something great. Um, and the question is,

288
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,860
how larger role does it play
and what does it consist of?

289
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,040
Municipal piece, I wrote
years ago for the New Yorker,

290
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:32,840
I remember writing about Wayne Gretzky
and reading a biography of Wayne Gretzky

291
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,620
and he's a keys as an educated
hockey player, great hockey player,

292
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,340
greatest hockey player of all time
as a kid when he's two years old,

293
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,310
his parents would sit up in front of
the television, he would watch, um,

294
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,900
uh, hockey games on, on Saturday nights.

295
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,560
And when the game he would
burst into tears, right?

296
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,010
And it was this little glimpse into his
future greatness because here he was at

297
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,840
two and he loved this, that he was,
he could imply hockey's too. I mean,

298
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,480
you can barely walk, but
he already is understood.

299
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,510
He loves this thing so much that for
it to end is an unconscionable burden.

300
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,660
Right. And it just, it's like the world
is ending and he's, he's just consulate.

301
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,540
So what is Wayne Gretzky's talent? Well,

302
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,980
part of it is his extraordinary,
you know, uh, vision,

303
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:22,140
his coordination, his,
whatever, his, this,

304
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,470
but a lot of it is this guy loves this
game so much that he would do nothing but

305
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:32,010
do it and think about it and engage
it and do all those things. Now,

306
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,900
if is this magic dust called
talent, is that all it is?

307
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,030
Maybe. I don't think fun is that,
I don't think that's a, that's um,

308
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,580
denying or hating genius. No,

309
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,820
I think that that definition
of genius is far more, um,

310
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,360
appealing to me. Then the
notion that it's this,

311
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,440
it's simply some sky high IQ or some,

312
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,540
well this is the genius, which just won't
quit and you can't eat, it won't quit.

313
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,050
You sort of like break the movie, but
the two guys on the mountain, I mean,

314
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,240
I'm recasting it sort of like what

315
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,060
I just broke back, break
back, you know, I go put you.

316
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,320
So it's the love of hockey.

317
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,173
Yeah.

318
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,790
That will not speak its name. That
they're not taking his name. Yes.

319
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:25,710
I suppose that's it. I'm not a, a good
analogy that would have occurred to me.

320
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,870
Maybe a what?

321
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,330
One of the things that I detect is that
it's not that you don't like geniuses is

322
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:37,480
that maybe you don't think we need
them and maybe ought to be for money.

323
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,593
Okay. Your watching.

324
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,690
Why are people so hostile to the notion
that what genius is is an extraordinary

325
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,940
love for a particular, um, thing.

326
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,380
Why is the love so we look,
we're, we're, you know,

327
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,170
we hear the ability, definition of genius,

328
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,290
the rare ability definition and we
think, oh, that's so plausible. Totally.

329
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,060
That's what it is. But then we hear the,

330
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,800
the extraordinary love definition of
genius and we say he's a genius denier.

331
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,300
Why? Why is,

332
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,350
why are we so hostile to the notion that
what separates the genius and the rest

333
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:13,010
of us is the genius loves what
he or she does more than we do.

334
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,630
But we have no problem at all.

335
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:18,260
But what separates the genius is
that they have some, you know,

336
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,110
well, because it misses the point. I mean,

337
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,860
there are YPO like Paul McCartney
and you hostile, the notion of love,

338
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,250
Robert, is that what that is?

339
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,040
No, I just want to make an
obvious point here that you know,

340
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,970
Harry Smith, no, that's a real person. Uh,

341
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,150
Harry x could love, uh, um,

342
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,440
my writing songs, but Paul McCarthy
for the way you say love though,

343
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:47,070
is so you really have, you,
have you thought about this to

344
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:47,580
others?

345
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,413
Yes.

346
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,730
Your Harry x could love, yeah,
that's better writing songs.

347
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,210
[inaudible] loves writing songs
so much that he can't stop,

348
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:59,790
but for lunch and dinner and
sometimes not even those,

349
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,850
but next door is, um,

350
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,630
is a Richard Rogers little
be tree. Ricky Rogers.

351
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,240
He loves writing songs too.

352
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,660
But for some reason Harry reits loves
writing Ricky whites and love writing and

353
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,160
how he writes a, a memorable song called
the babbling book. Those two in flow.

354
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,700
And Richard Wright's
Shannon chanted evening.

355
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,700
Well, no. So, um, your,
there's a difference there.
No, well, hold on, hold on.

356
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,600
No love doesn't get you. No, no,
no. The love, but the love does.

357
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:37,160
So think about this. Love is not the
complete explanation. Love is the way in,

358
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,570
because Wayne Gretzky
loves hockey so much.

359
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,480
He thinks about it all the
time and does more than that.

360
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,860
He engages the sport in a way that
no one else had ever engaged in.

361
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,310
So there's this wonderful, um, that,
remember in I running a fresco,

362
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,730
this is thing that he
famously did ones where he um,

363
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,970
scored a goal from behind the net and
he flips the puck over the net like,

364
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:03,470
and it kind of does a little
thing and goes in. Um,

365
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,850
and the reason no one had ever done that
before was not just that no one could

366
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:10,850
do it. Lots of good do it. It had
never occurred to anyone else before.

367
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,310
No one had engaged the
sport on that level.

368
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,440
So why is Gretzky engaging in that way?

369
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,750
Why is he thinking about it
that deeply and creatively?

370
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,990
Because he can't get hockey
out of his head. Right.

371
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,630
Whenever I encounter someone like that,

372
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:28,550
I cannot get past that sense.
They give off that they have.

373
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,750
They have,

374
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,750
they have found their calling that they
are in actively in love and almost in a

375
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:38,270
romantic way with this
thing that they do. Right.

376
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,270
Absent that you can't be
a genius. I'm sorry Ken,

377
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,630
are you convinced yet? Hi.

378
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,710
Still holding up for some really abstract

379
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,730
Nietzschean notion of,

380
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,220
no, I'm going to pull back
for a minute here. Oh,

381
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,080
we remodeled a little bit longer,
but I think they come to shove.

382
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,830
Oh Malcolm. That's what I say. I say go
Malcolm right there. Hello. You know,

383
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,690
I would say he might be shortchanging
the idea that there's a diversity of

384
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,110
ability out there. Innate talent. Yeah.

385
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,930
But I do agree with him though
that the idea of genius,

386
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:22,210
that old 19th century
stupid idea, uh, you know,

387
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,260
the eye does contain within it
are a really dangerous thought,

388
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:28,690
which is that our abilities are just
sort of God given. And so they're fixed.

389
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,260
So nobody but so, but his
argument would be, you know,

390
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,730
you need some talent and you need
certainly a little bit of good luck,

391
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:40,731
but what you really need is this
strange love of the thing you're doing.

392
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,920
And it's the love or the determination
to succeed. If what? Love equals,

393
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,930
it makes you just want to do it and then
do it, and then do it some more. Amen.

394
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,150
Yeah. We should thank the 92nd street
y and then get the hell out of here.

395
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,260
It's them and you to Malcolm
Gladwell and to you for listening.

396
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,970
I'm Jad Abumrad [inaudible] all
new episode in two weeks. See them.
