00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Folks, you're looking at the Babbage engine.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It does what Charles Babbage envisioned it would do--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
produce mathematical tables without any human intervention

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
all the way over to the print shop.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It produces a stereotype try, which then goes to a printer to print a book

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of logarithmic tables for example.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This was envisioned by Charles Babbage 1849 but never built in Charles Babbage's lifetime.
