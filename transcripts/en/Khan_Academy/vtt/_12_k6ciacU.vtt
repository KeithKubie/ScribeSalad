00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.460
- [Narrator] In other videos,
we have already talked about

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.800
the Law of Demand, which tells us,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.900
and this is probably already
somewhat intuitive for you,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.359
that if a certain good is
currently at a higher price,

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.730
that the quantity demanded
will be quite low,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.260
and then as the price were to decrease,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.060
the quantity demanded would increase.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.110
So if we were to graph demand,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.520
and so this right over
here is our demand curve,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.330
where price is on our vertical axis

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.130
and quantity is on our horizontal axis,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.260
which is the standard
convention for most economists,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.439
you would have a
downward-sloping demand curve.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:36.960
Well, what we're gonna do in this video

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.530
is dig a little bit deeper

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.510
into why we have that
downward-sloping demand curve,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.467
and I know what some of y'all are saying.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.287
"Well, it kind of makes common sense.

00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:48.247
"As the price goes down,
I would want more of that,

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.848
"and so would everyone else."

00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:53.700
But let's dig into why you
would want more of something

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.940
as the price goes down.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.210
So one category of reasons
why you might want more of it

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.540
as the price goes down,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.820
economists will call
the substitution effect.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.787
Substitution, substitution effect.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.860
And this is the idea that

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.940
if we're looking at the
price versus quantity,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.280
say, of candy, and let's say at first,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.280
the price is right over
here at $4, and at $4,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.090
the quantity demanded
in the market would be,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.480
let's say that is 100 units of the candy,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.840
maybe it's 100 pounds of the candy,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.320
that if the price were to
then go to $2 for some reason,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.030
so let's say the price is at $2,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.157
well, then, a lot of folks could say,

00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:45.767
"Gee, that candy is looking a lot better

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.317
"relative to other things that I might buy

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:49.710
"with my money."

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.990
So, for example, people
might be picking between

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.890
candy and fruit, and maybe, at first,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.230
they were both $4 a pound,
but now all of a sudden,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.580
if the candy is $2 a
pound, or $2 per unit,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.180
well, then, it's looking a lot better

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.860
relative to the fruit.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.010
So some of that quantity of
fruit people would have bought,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.957
they'll say, "Hey, now
candy is a better deal.

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:12.040
"I'm going to substitute
the fruit with candy."

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.046
And so that's why you
have a higher quantity

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:17.020
of candy demanded.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.720
This might maybe be now 250 units.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.610
Another major category
why you would expect

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.610
this downward-sloping demand
curve for normal goods,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.840
and we'll talk about
things like inferior goods

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.660
in future videos, is the
income effect, income effect.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.590
And in some ways, this
might be the most intuitive.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.094
Well, if the price went from $4 to $2,

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.970
well, the cost of those 100
units would now be half as much.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.050
It would go from $400 to $200.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.630
And so the market would
have an extra $200 to use

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.460
to buy things with, and
some of that extra $200,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.177
they'll buy more candy with.

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:59.161
But then they might also
buy other things with that.

00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:02.640
Now the last dimension that
economists will often talk about

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.960
for why the Law of Demand is
downward-sloping like this,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.020
and we talk about this in other videos,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.020
is this idea of decreasing,
decreasing marginal utility,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.872
and that's that idea that that first,

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.861
if you're just that first amount of candy,

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:21.690
there's gonna be people the market

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.670
who take a lot of value from it.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.780
They are just addicted to candy.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.499
Their bodies are dependent on that candy.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.911
But as soon as folks are satiated,

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.953
that next incremental amount,
that next marginal amount,

00:03:33.953 --> 00:03:36.880
the utility might be a little bit lower.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.730
And so as you have more and more candy,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.010
the marginal utility goes down.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.960
And so that's another
way of thinking about

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.463
why we have a
downward-sloping demand curve.
