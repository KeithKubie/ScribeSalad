00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:17.151
Do you ever find yourself
referencing a study in conversation

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.547
that you didn't actually read?

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:22.609
(Laughter)

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.306
I was having coffee
with a friend of mine the other day,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.985
and I said, "You know, I read a new study

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.178
that says coffee reduces
the risk of depression in women."

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:37.135
But really, what I read was a tweet.

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:39.104
(Laughter)

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:40.307
That said --

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.498
(Laughter)

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:45.678
"A new study says drinking coffee
may decrease depression risk in women."

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:47.188
(Laughter)

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:51.672
And that tweet had a link
to the "New York Times" blog,

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:54.403
where a guest blogger translated
the study findings

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:56.609
from a "Live Science" article,

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.569
which got its original information

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:02.037
from the Harvard School
of Public Health news site,

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:05.355
which cited the actual study abstract,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.764
which summarized the actual study
published in an academic journal.

00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:11.553
(Laughter)

00:01:11.577 --> 00:01:14.172
It's like the six degrees of separation,

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:15.506
but with research.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.679
(Laughter)

00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:20.006
So, when I said I read a study,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.198
what I actually read was 59 characters
that summarized 10 years of research.

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:28.155
(Laughter)

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.942
So, when I said I read a study,

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.054
I was reading fractions of the study

00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:36.799
that were put together
by four different writers

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:38.720
that were not the author,

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:40.077
before it got to me.

00:01:40.823 --> 00:01:42.387
That doesn't seem right.

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:46.045
But accessing original
research is difficult,

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.965
because academics aren't regularly
engaging with popular media.

00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:52.728
And you might be asking yourself,

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:55.561
why aren't academics engaging
with popular media?

00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:58.553
It seems like they'd be
a more legitimate source of information

00:01:58.577 --> 00:01:59.910
than the media pundits.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.910
Right?

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:03.085
(Laughter)

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.680
In a country with over
4,100 colleges and universities,

00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:08.656
it feels like this should be the norm.

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:10.663
But it's not.

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.934
So, how did we get here?

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:17.903
To understand why scholars
aren't engaging with popular media,

00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:20.720
you first have to understand
how universities work.

00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:22.814
Now, in the last six years,

00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:25.458
I've taught at seven
different colleges and universities

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:26.743
in four different states.

00:02:27.473 --> 00:02:29.355
I'm a bit of an adjunct extraordinaire.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.417
(Laughter)

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.028
And at the same time, I'm pursuing my PhD.

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.807
In all of these different institutions,

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:38.866
the research and publication process
works the same way.

00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:42.533
First, scholars produce
research in their fields.

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:46.708
To fund their research,
they apply for public and private grants

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.410
and after the research is finished,

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.569
they write a paper about their findings.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.855
Then they submit that paper
to relevant academic journals.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.180
Then it goes through a process
called peer review,

00:02:57.204 --> 00:02:59.204
which essentially means that other experts

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:01.324
are checking it
for accuracy and credibility.

00:03:02.553 --> 00:03:04.886
And then, once it's published,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.006
for-profit companies
resell that information

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.998
back to universities and public libraries

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:12.223
through journal
and database subscriptions.

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:15.301
So, that's the system.

00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:20.417
Research, write, peer-review,
publish, repeat.

00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:24.394
My friends and I call it
feeding the monster.

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:28.243
And you can see how this
might create some problems.

00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:34.379
The first problem is that most
academic research is publicly funded

00:03:34.403 --> 00:03:36.136
but privately distributed.

00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:41.605
Every year, the federal government
spends 60 billion dollars on research.

00:03:42.498 --> 00:03:44.617
According to the National
Science Foundation,

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.783
29 percent of that
goes to public research universities.

00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:53.045
So, if you're quick at math,
that's 17.4 billion dollars.

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:54.873
Tax dollars.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:58.001
And just five corporations are responsible

00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:00.619
for distributing most
publicly funded research.

00:04:00.643 --> 00:04:06.881
In 2014, just one of those companies
made 1.5 billion dollars in profit.

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:08.838
It's a big business.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.346
And I bet you can see the irony here.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.403
If the public is funding
academics' research,

00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:18.399
but then we have to pay again
to access the results,

00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:21.648
it's like we're paying for it twice.

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.164
And the other major problem

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:26.911
is that most academics
don't have a whole lot of incentive

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:30.207
to publish outside of these prestigious
subscription-based journals.

00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:33.569
Universities build their tenure
and promotion systems

00:04:33.593 --> 00:04:35.993
around the number of times
scholars publish.

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:40.593
So, books and journal articles are kind of
like a form of currency for scholars.

00:04:40.617 --> 00:04:44.807
Publishing articles helps you get tenure
and more research grants down the road.

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:49.677
But academics are not rewarded
for publishing with popular media.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.422
So, this is the status quo.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.069
The current academic ecosystem.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.033
But I don't think it has to be this way.

00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:02.839
We can make some simple changes
to flip the script.

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:07.093
So, first, let's start
by discussing access.

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.037
Universities can begin
to challenge the status quo

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.102
by rewarding scholars for publishing

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:16.895
not just in these
subscription-based journals

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.847
but in open-access journals
as well as on popular media.

00:05:21.673 --> 00:05:24.633
Now, the open-access movement
is starting to make some progress

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.982
in many disciplines,

00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:29.037
and fortunately, some other
big players have started to notice.

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:33.934
Google Scholar has made
open-access research

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958
searchable and easier to find.

00:05:37.077 --> 00:05:40.291
Congress, last year, introduced a bill

00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:43.754
that suggests that academic
research projects

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:46.831
with over 100 million or more in funding

00:05:46.855 --> 00:05:48.847
should develop an open-access policy.

00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:54.484
And this year, NASA opened up
its entire research library to the public.

00:05:55.353 --> 00:05:58.614
So, you can see this idea
is beginning to catch on.

00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:02.006
But access isn't just about being able

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.647
to get your hands
on a document or a study.

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.799
It's also about making sure

00:06:06.823 --> 00:06:09.374
that that document or study
is easily understood.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.520
So, let's talk about translation.

00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:20.847
I don't envision this translation to look
like the six degrees of separation

00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.394
that I illustrated earlier.

00:06:23.847 --> 00:06:27.935
Instead, what if scholars were able
to take the research that they're doing

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.800
and translate it on popular media

00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:32.357
and be able to engage with the public?

00:06:33.672 --> 00:06:35.037
If scholars did this,

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.315
the degrees of separation
between the public and research

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:39.806
would shrink by a lot.

00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:44.212
So, you see, I'm not suggesting
a dumbing-down of the research.

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:47.443
I'm just suggesting that we give
the public access to that research

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:51.403
and that we shift the venue
and focus on using plain language

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:54.117
so that the public
who's paying for the research

00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:55.942
can also consume it.

00:06:57.395 --> 00:07:00.026
And there are some other benefits
to this approach.

00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:04.290
By showing the public
how their tax dollars

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:06.458
are being used to fund research,

00:07:06.482 --> 00:07:09.736
they can begin to redefine
universities' identities

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.720
so that universities' identities
are not just based on a football team

00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:15.839
or the degrees they grant

00:07:15.863 --> 00:07:18.358
but on the research
that's being produced there.

00:07:19.157 --> 00:07:24.141
And when there's a healthy relationship
between the public and scholars,

00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:27.365
it encourages public
participation in research.

00:07:28.673 --> 00:07:31.214
Can you imagine what that might look like?

00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:33.823
What if social scientists

00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:37.474
helped local police redesign
their sensitivity trainings

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:41.660
and then collaboratively wrote
a manual to model future trainings?

00:07:42.924 --> 00:07:48.687
Or what if our education professors
consulted with our local public schools

00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:51.807
to decide how we're going to intervene
with our at-risk students

00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:54.160
and then wrote about it
in a local newspaper?

00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:58.649
Because a functioning democracy

00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:02.234
requires that the public be
well-educated and well-informed.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.339
Instead of research happening
behind paywalls and bureaucracy,

00:08:07.363 --> 00:08:10.624
wouldn't it be better
if it was unfolding right in front of us?

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.109
Now, as a PhD student,

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:18.366
I realize I'm critiquing
the club I want to join.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.649
(Laughter)

00:08:19.673 --> 00:08:21.276
Which is a dangerous thing to do,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.674
since I'm going to be on the academic
job market in a couple of years.

00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:28.809
But if the status quo in academic research

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:31.657
is to publish in the echo chambers
of for-profit journals

00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:34.053
that never reach the public,

00:08:34.077 --> 00:08:37.014
you better believe
my answer is going to be "nope."

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:41.514
I believe in inclusive,
democratic research

00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:45.203
that works in the community
and talks with the public.

00:08:45.727 --> 00:08:48.235
I want to work in research
and in an academic culture

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:51.903
where the public is not only seen
as a valuable audience,

00:08:51.927 --> 00:08:54.385
but a constituent, a participant.

00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:58.462
And in some cases even the expert.

00:09:00.852 --> 00:09:04.506
And this isn't just about

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.926
giving you guys access to information.

00:09:08.768 --> 00:09:13.807
It's about shifting academic culture
from publishing to practice

00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.521
and from talking to doing.

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:21.188
And you should know
that this idea, this hope --

00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:23.146
it doesn't just belong to me.

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:27.672
I'm standing on the shoulders
of many scholars, teachers,

00:09:27.696 --> 00:09:30.672
librarians and community members

00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:34.117
who also advocate for including
more people in the conversation.

00:09:34.912 --> 00:09:37.516
I hope you join our conversation, too.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.706
Thank you.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.182
(Applause)
