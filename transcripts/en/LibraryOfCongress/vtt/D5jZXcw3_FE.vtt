&gt;&gt; Lola Pyne: Hello and welcome

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.210
to our program honoring
young writers of the A Book

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.980
That Shaped Me summer
writing contest.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.280
I'm Lola Pyne.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.270
And I work in the
Office of Communications

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.150
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.430
One of my favorite projects
here at the largest library

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.860
in the world is managing the
A Book That Shaped Me program

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.910
which gives area young
people a unique opportunity

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.630
to participate in the
National Book Festival,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.330
which is the library's premier
outreach event celebrating books

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.770
and reading.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.720
We're delighted that today's
contest presentation will be

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.080
emceed by Eun Yang,
who is no stranger

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.510
to the National Book Festival.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.300
[ Applause ]

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.140
Eun is an Emmy Award
winning television anchor

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.390
for NBC4 Washington.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.760
In addition in anchoring
News4 Today,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.890
she files compelling
community stories about people

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.220
and organizations important
to the Washington area

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.760
and has been an author
introducer for the book festival

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.400
for the past eight years.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.230
She is also the mother of
three and a proponent of books

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.090
and reading for young people.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.500
I'm pleased to turn the
program over to Eun.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.350
&gt;&gt; Eun Yang: Thank you Lola.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.840
Lola, thank you so much.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.610
Good morning everyone
and welcome

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.110
to the National Book Festival.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.600
It is one of my favorite
events of the whole year.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.420
I clear my calendar
for this event.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.380
I have three kids,
as Lola mentioned.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.680
Two of them are playing soccer.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.070
I brought one of them with me.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.480
And she's right.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.070
I am such a huge fan
of books and reading.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.380
Books take you on adventures.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.110
They help you see the world

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630
through so many different
perspectives.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.980
You don't even have to
leave your house to go

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.360
and meet new people
and interesting things.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.320
And one of the best things
about books is they teach you

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.380
so much more about other
people and more about yourself,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.220
which is what this essay
contest is all about.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.130
I'm so serious about reading
and I'm such a mean mom that,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.370
of course, there's a
lot of reading to do

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.100
at my house over the summer.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.300
And, in fact, I made my
kids write a book report.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.130
No, it was not required by the
school but I wanted to know

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.200
that my kids not only
are reading the words,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.240
because they're all voracious
readers and they can eat

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.230
up the books, but that
they have an understanding

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.530
of what they're reading.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.680
So, sorry guys, it's what I do.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.900
It's because I love you and
it's because I love books

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.200
and I know you do too.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.500
So welcome.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.800
It's going to be
such a great day.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.920
Today, Lola and I are joined
on the stage by Jamie Uphold

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.810
from the Mensa Education
and Research Foundation,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.650
who also served as one
of the grand prize judges

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.800
of this year's contest,
a big job I know.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.100
Very tough.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.530
So many good essays out there.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.040
A Book That Shaped Me was
launched by the Library

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.380
of Congress in 2012 with the
DC Public Library and has

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.090
since expanded through
the mid-Atlantic region.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.280
The contest asks rising fifth
and sixth graders to reflect

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.730
on a book that has
shaped their lives,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.320
influencing the way
they see themselves,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.550
their community, or their world.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.250
Students enter by
writing a one-page essay

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.320
that then they submit in person

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.370
to a participating public
library in Washington DC,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.220
Maryland, Virginia, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, or West Virginia.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.430
The essays are first
judged by members

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.970
of the American Association
of School Librarians,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.580
so these are very
important judges.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.950
Then, the 30 finalists being
honored today were selected

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.930
by that panel that
represent these five states

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.240
that received essays
over the summer.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.670
I will now go ahead and read the
names of the finalists by state

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.810
and then Lola and Jamie
will hand their certificates

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.110
as they come up on stage.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.870
And stay up here,
all the finalists,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.460
so we can take a picture
and all that good stuff.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.190
So we're going to start
right here in Washington DC

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.930
through the DC public
libraries location.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.230
Those are my libraries.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.530
I love them.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.100
They're just this great resource
of books and information.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.080
And if I mispronounce your name,
please forgive me in advance.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.970
My name is Eun Yang,
so I know what it's

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.290
like to have your
name mispronounced

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.510

so please bear with me.

to our finalists
and state winners?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.140
An amazing job to spend your
time reflecting on a book

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.820
that shaped your life, to write
about it, take the initiative

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.520
to turn it in, to
be here up on stage.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.820
A big congratulations.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.340
Keep reading those
books and keep writing.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.640
It's so important.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.720
And I will tell you right now,
as a journalist who's been

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.730
in this business for a long
time, writing is a part

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.830
of every profession
and dream you pursue.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.880
And I know it's tough
but keep that writing up.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.180
I know it's not your favorite.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.000
Reading is so much easier
but keep on that writing.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.300
All right.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.690
So next we're going to hear
from Jamie Uphold, one of A Book

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.990
That Shaped Me judges

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.390
to introduce the grand
prize winners today.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.970
She is the gifted youth programs
manager for the Mensa Education

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.760

National Book Festival

So ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jamie Uphold.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.680
[ Applause ]

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.980
&gt;&gt; Jamie Uphold: Thank you, Eun.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.280
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.580
To say that books have
been an important part

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.370
of my life would be a
grave understatement.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.020
When I was a child growing

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.420
up in a low socioeconomic
home, books were my escape.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.990
They were proof that there
was a world -- thank you.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.450
I'm short, sorry.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.410
There was proof that there was
a world out there that was big

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.280
and broad and it was full of
hope and people doing things

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.980
that didn't happen
where I came from.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.580
So books were my escape.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.470
And because of them and the
love of literature that I grew

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.780
from my local library, because
we certainly didn't have money

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.120
to go to Barnes &amp; Noble, I
became the person I am today

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.510
which loves books and loves
literature and is so proud

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.170
and honored to be a part of
the National Book Festival

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.500
and the Library of Congress.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.010
It truly is one of
the highlights

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.490
of the great things I get to
do for kids all year long.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.120
Being a judge for the Book

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.690
That Shaped Me contest is
a nerd's greatest goal.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.380
It truly is.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.050
When they asked me to be a
judge, I thought seriously me?

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.710
Do they know who I am?

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:02.730
It has been so fun to watch your
kids express on paper of the joy

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.790
and the life changing
moments that they've gotten

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.810
from literature of
any type in nature.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.850
And we have a wide and
varied selection of books

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.480
that your children choose.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.660
Please take a moment and
join me in giving our thanks

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.800
and appreciation to
the other judges.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.110
If you would stand for
the judges of A Book

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.910
That Shaped Me contest.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.390
[ Applause ]

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.890
As Eun said, it is a tough
job but it's well worth

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.770
that struggle to
be able to share

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.080
with you today the top three
award winners of the 2018 Book

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.920
That Shaped Me contest.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.940
First up, I would like to
welcome Zuri Kenyatte who wrote

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.600
about "Lucky Broken
Girl" by Ruth Behar.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.900
Please come on up, Zuri.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.080
Zuri is our third prize --
third place grand prize winner

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.130
and the winner from the
District of Columbia.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.060
Zuri is going to share with
us her essay that she wrote

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.370
about "Lucky Broken Girl".

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.660
Can we borrow a program?

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.960
Thank you.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.440
So Zuri wrote a very
personal essay

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.510
and it was really very moving.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.140
She'll be sharing that
with us in just a moment.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.730
One of the things that I
loved about her essay is

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.930
that she talked so
much about hope.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.720
Miss Zuri, whenever you're
ready to share with us.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.020
&gt;&gt; Zuri Kenyatte: Okay.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.440
So have you ever considered

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.200
that one bad decision could
change your life forever?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.090
The book "Lucky Broken Girl"

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.220
by Ruth Behar taught
me this lesson.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.510
In the book, an immigrant
Jewish family is involved

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.090
in a car accident and
the daughter Ruthie is

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.720
severely injured.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.310
Bedridden, Ruthie is
forced to stay in her room,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.870
strung to the ceiling in
a body cast for a year.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.020
She is dependent on
her mom for everything,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.630
even every day necessities like
using the bathroom and bathing.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.000
Even her meals, which had
to be smaller than usual

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.210
so she would not outgrow her
body cast, are brought to her.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.280
She is no longer physically
able to go to school,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.340
so the school sends a tutor
to her house to help her keep

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.140
up with her classwork.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.800
Life for 10-year-old
Ruthie has changed,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.440
and there isn't much
she could do about it.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.660
This book has many morals and
lessons that stuck with me long

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.740
after I finished reading.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.830
The one that had the
greatest impact is

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.950
that one bad decision could
change a person's life.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.650
The boys who injured
Ruthie chose to be reckless

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.400
and drive drunk, without
considering the lives

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.090
of others on the road.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.920
As a result, they not only
severely wounded Ruthie,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.730
but they killed other
drivers and themselves.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.930
This one poor choice
changed a community

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.850
of people's lives forever.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.670
A woman is paralyzed for
the rest of her life,

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.260
Ruthie loses her independence
and is disabled for a year,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.880
and the boys don't get to
see the other side of 16.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.320
This had a life-long
effect on the families too.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.810
This is tragic, something I
would never want to experience.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.660
"Lucky Broken Girl" taught me
to think about the consequences

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.920
of my actions before doing them.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.510
This book also encouraged me

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.650
to find a new perspective
when I'm feeling sad.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.270
When Ruthie is depressed
and starts painting the boys

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.830
as ghosts, her new neighbor,
Chico, turned her bed

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.110
around towards the window to
give her an optimistic view.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.690
Ruthie begins to feel
better instantly.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.490
Instead of being preoccupied
with negative thoughts,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.320
she starts painting
butterflies and flowers.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.170
This taught me that sometimes
all it takes is a different

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.850
point of view to
change the scenario.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.310
"Lucky Broken Girl" taught
me that I am in control.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.510
I have the power to determine
my actions and my life.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:17.180
[ Applause ]

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.560
&gt;&gt; Jamie Uphold:
Congratulations, Zuri.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.950
You can certainly see why
she's our third place winner.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.010
I love her comment about one
choice can alter the lives

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.520
of a whole community.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.070
Great job, Zuri.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.740
Next up, I'm happy to
introduce our second place --

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.800
second place grand prize winner

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.540
and the Virginia State
winner Miss Aria Patnaik.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.270
She wrote about "One
for the Murphys".

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.920
And I tell you, after
reading her essay,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.860
it made me want to
read this book.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.580
This young lady managed to tell
quite the story with her words

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.120
and we'll be happy to hear that
from her in just a few moments.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.770
&gt;&gt; Aria Patnaik: "One for the
Murphys" is a book about family,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.580
strength, heroes,
and most of all,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.700
what it feels like to be loved.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.840
Carley Connors has a
mother who throws parties,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.840
drinks too much alcohol,
and can't bear to say

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.180
"I love you" to her
own daughter.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.990
When Carley's abusive stepdad
hurts her and her mother,

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.110
Carley is forced into foster
care with the Murphy's,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.140
an affectionate family with a
mother who gives Carley a voice

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.240
and makes her realize
what she's been missing.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.750
This book has left an impact
on me for multiple reasons.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.300
First, it taught me that there
is no need to try to be tough

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.120
because a little
sensitivity is only natural.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.970
Second, it made me realize
the true value of family

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.270
and the love they provide.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.120
And lastly, I learned
what it feels

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.010
like to be a castaway
or apart from normal.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.500
This beautiful story provides
a behind the scenes look

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.630
at a strong girl with
a sensitive heart.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.390
Growing up with two
older brothers,

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.530
people expect me to be tough.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.250
They expect tears to
be a foreign language.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.380
Carley has taught me that
being tough is different

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.820
than being strong.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.440
The exact definition of tough
is not easily broken or cut,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.860
while the definition of strong
is accompanied by great power.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.740
This means physically
but also mentally.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.350
You go forth and
face your obstacles.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.020
As Julie Murphy says, "It's
easier to lock yourself away.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.480
It takes strength to face
things that scare you."

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.750
I no longer feel like if
I have feelings, I'm weak.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.430
I finally feel free and human.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.490
I've discovered my emotions
and a whole new side of myself.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.710
"One for the Murphys"
left me feeling lucky,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.850
blessed, and thankful.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.740
Oftentimes, I find
myself complaining

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.630
about my annoying brothers
or whining to my parents

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.520
because something isn't fair.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.010
But after reading this book, I
realized that it's all just part

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.500
of the definition of family.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.150
One line from the
book caught my eye.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.350
"The way she reached in,
pulled me out, dusted me off,

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.660
and said that I only needed
to be the great person I am."

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.010
I realized that that's
exactly what family does.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.370
They take you under their
wing when you're broken,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.040
heal your wound,
and tell you to fly.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.160
So many people don't
get tucked in at night,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:21.320
so many people don't get to
eat dinner with their family,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.940
and so many people don't get to
play catch with their brothers.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.270
A family is something you
can lean on in times of worry

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.220
or sadness, and yet so many
people don't have that.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.420
Carley really highlighted
all the perks of a family

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.310
that I see every day
yet take for granted.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.740
All my life, I've
never been the new kid.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.820
I've never felt different
or an outcast.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.730
My whole life is familiar.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.490
I've never moved schools
or houses and that's why

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.790
when my parents told me
that for seventh grade,

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.720
I'm going to a private school
where I don't know anybody

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.510
and where there are
probably some mean girls,

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.590
I have to admit I was scared.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.890
This wonderful look

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.730
into Carley's thoughts
have shown me what it feels

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.460
like to stand apart
from everyone else.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.560
An example from the book is
when Carley says, "I was right

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.220
about being a foster kid.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.870
It is humiliating."

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.080
When people put labels on
you, it's hard to escape them.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.890
It's hard to know that you're
not like everyone else.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.900
And it takes time to
realize that that's okay.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.380
Carley has taught me that change
is okay and it happens fast,

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.790
and though it may be difficult,
you just have to adjust.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.110
Carley is always strong and
stays confident no matter

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.580
where she is, and I think
everyone can learn from that.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.190
I've read this book three
times, each at different stages

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.270
of my life and each time
this book has helped me

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.070
for different reasons.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.890
It has taught me valuable
lessons that help me every day.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.650
Just like Julie Murphy
stuck with Carley,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.220
"One for the Murphys"
stuck with me

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.580
and will always stick with me.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.810
When I finished "One for the
Murphys," new thoughts sprung

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.410
into my head that I'd
never thought of before.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.320
I thought about why some
parents can handle kids

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.620
and some parents can't.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.130
I thought about what I
would do if I had to choose

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.290
between a loving and
supportive family

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.280
and a neglectful but fun mom.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.530
"One for the Murphys" is about
what strong really means,

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.690
always staying confident
and the importance

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.510
and many forms of family.

Thank you, Aria.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.100
Wonderful job.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.670
And last but not least,
we are happy to welcome

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.290
to the stage Mr. Tyler
Williams who wrote

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.750
about the Harry Potter
series by J.K. Rowling.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.290
Will you please come
on up Tyler?

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.500
Tyler is our first
place grand prize winner

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.510
and the Pennsylvania
State winner.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.480
&gt;&gt; Tyler Williams: Dear
librarian, let me tell you

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.920
about how the Harry Potter
series gave me the strength

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.220
to be happy again.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.220
A few years ago I was bullied
in school by my best friends,

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.300
and I was too afraid
to tell an adult.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.080
I eventually told
my parents about it

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.540
and the threat was gone.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.590
It's a well-known
fact among Potterheads

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.870
that Harry Potter
overcame Voldemort.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.790
I kind of thought of it like
this; Harry as the schoolboy

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.680
and Voldemort as the bully.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.800
Harry overcame Voldemort
and became a hero.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.110
Albus Dumbledore said in
the book "Harry Potter

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.940
and the Sorcerer's Stone, It
takes a great deal of bravery

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.970
to stand up to our
enemies, but just as much

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.640
to stand up to our friends."

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.160
I can relate to this quote
because my bully pretended

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.560
to be my friends by
playing games with me

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.710
and letting me come
over for a sleepover

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.740
but he was a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.640
The way I was treated
left me in the darkness.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.450
Dumbledore in "Harry
Potter and the Prisoner

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.760
of Azkaban" also said,
"Happiness can be found even

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.180
in the darkest of times
if one only remembers

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.590
to turn on the light."

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.080
I needed to get out of the dark,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.650
so I turned on the light
and told my parents.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.330
I was happy again because
I was free from my bully.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.630
By defeating the threat,

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.240
I made sure that other
kids didn't share my fate.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.110
The Harry Potter series
helped me find light

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.860
in my darkest of times.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.040
It gave me courage to
overcome a bully just

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.920
like Harry defeated Voldemort.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.600
My hope is that other kids get
the same courage I did while

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.240
reading this amazing series.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.550
&gt;&gt; Jamie Uphold:
Congratulations, Tyler.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.170

our finalists and all

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.700

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.150
Thank you, Jamie.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.450
Thank you, Lola.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.750
Thank you to the winners.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.320
Thank you for sharing
your stories.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.390
I know that when you write
an essay about a book

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.860
that shaped you, you're sharing

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.810
such a personal part
of who you are.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.360
And to provide these
beautiful words to share

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.290
with everyone else,
it will touch us

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.190
and leave us with a gift.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.490
So thank you for doing that.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.980
Thank you for everyone
who contributed.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.210
And I hope you will continue
to write and continue

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.490
to enter this essay contest.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.180
Can we just -- one
more round of applause

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.960
to indulge me before
you move onto their day.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.800
There are so many
fun things to do here

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.010
at the National Book Festival.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.270
To all of you this afternoon,
to all the parents out here

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.200
who are supporting your
children in their writing,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.330
to the wonderful families,
the teachers, librarians,

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.590
educators who make
this program possible,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.900
thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.220
I know how hard it is.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.840
It takes a village to foster
these children and raise

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.870
up good children, good people
who love to read and write.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.510
Thank you for joining
the Library of Congress

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.800
in nurturing the culture
of reading and writing

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.780
and treating authors
like they should,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.910
as rock stars in this place.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.260
We honor you and all
your accomplishments

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.610
and are really grateful
for your scholarship.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.500
A job well done to
you once again.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.800
Thank you so much.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.100
I love this festival.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.400
I love this event.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.700

all these wonderful resources

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.880

the book festival.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.180
Have a great day.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.480
We'll see you next year.
