00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.982
Let's try another problem Lucy and Javier can mow their lawn in 1.2 hours time

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:09.186
if they work together. If it takes Javier one hour longer than Lucy, how long

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:14.085
would it take them to mow the yard alone? Now, we want to use our same approach

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:19.600
from before. We're going to use our 1 over a plus 1 over b equals 1 over x.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.475
Where x is the total amount of time it takes them to do a job together. We know

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:30.030
that total time is 1.2 hours. So we can replace x with 1.2. Now we don't know

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.604
how long it took Javier or how long it took Lucy. Those are both unknowns. So

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:38.082
what do you think we could write here and here, in order to finish out our

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:42.188
equation? You'll need to think about how Lucy's time to mow the yard and how

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:46.990
Javier's time to mow the yard alone relate to one another. When you think you

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.410
know what should go in this denominator, and what should go in this

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.120
denominator, type them in here. As a hint, you'll have to use a variable, and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.074
for this one I want you to use the variable t.
