00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:02.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Hello.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.940
This is Google I/O. And this
is "Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.789
I am sitting on a chair.

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:09.080
But that doesn't really matter.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.470
Because on the sofa next
to me is Alex Komoroske.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.280
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yep.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.890
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Are
you having a good time?

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.190
Enjoying--

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.670
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I'm
having an amazing time.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.370
There's all kinds of--
every year it's different.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.210
And so they have all these
interesting swing sets

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.810
and stuff.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.750
It's pretty cool.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So what's
your job title then?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.699
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I am the
Product Management Lead

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.520
on Chrome's web platform team.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
That's quite long.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.010
So I would shorten that.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.990
I kind of think of you as a
sort of Web Hero or Champion

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.930
of the Web.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.306
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Oh, OK.

00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:34.500
Sure.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.890
I like that.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.410
That sounds good.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.330
Let's go with that.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.621
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So why the web?

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.742
What is the web to you?

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:40.950
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So I-- I
think like a lot of people--

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.910
have had this long, deep
connection with the web.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.080
So I shared yesterday
this embarrassing story

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.620
about the Real Ultimate
Power and actually

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.130
how we uploaded a picture of
our crew team posing for that.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.400
But for me, it
actually really became

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.660
sort of an important moral
issue for me in college,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.930
when I read this book,
"The Wealth of Networks,"

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.000
by Yochai Benkler, who's a
professor at Yale or something.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.430
And it totally sold
me on the power

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.010
for society of these
open systems or whatever.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.070
But all of this, I guess,
is really abstract.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.260
And so I think
one of the reasons

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.620
I love the web is that it
makes it really easy for you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.510
to reach a lot of
people with your stuff,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.970
and get your ideas out there.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.210
And part of it for
me as well, I guess,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.864
is that, and the openness of it.

00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:26.905
One of the things that
really got me into the web

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:28.230
was View Source.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.340
I was able to go and see, wow.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.690
This is a thing on
the web-- View Source.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.190
Wow.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.685
That's how it's
being put together.

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:35.560
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.820
And it's great for tinkerers.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.020
Because you don't need to
get anyone's permission.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.430
You don't need to buy anything.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.050
You can just use a text editor
that comes onto your computer,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.602
and get into it that way.

00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:45.810
That's totally how I started.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.690
That's how I bet a lot
of us started on it.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.565
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:52.100
I know we have a bit of a
back and forth or banter

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.360
with the Android guys.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.089
And the Hello World for
Android comes in at like 800k.

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:59.630
I think they've got it down to
whereas Hello World on the web

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.380
is Hello World, right?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.070
It's just a text
bubble with that.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.195
Upload that somewhere
and off you go.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:06.070
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So you gave
a talk yesterday morning

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.982
on the next generation
of the mobile web.

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:13.190
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's right.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And I remember
Web 2.0 from a few years ago.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.595
It was a kind of marketing
thing with no substance.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:22.970
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
So actually, I've

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.700
found that for those kinds
of things, the terms, when

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.410
they're really successfu-- some
things are just always hot air.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.910
Right?

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.826
They start as hot air.

00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:31.670
They end as hot air.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.753
But some things that are
actually really something

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.512
meaningful then
become so meaningful

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:37.220
that everyone who
doesn't understand them

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.170
starts using those words.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.830
So like AJAX--

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.240
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh my god, yes.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.990
ALEX KOMOROSKE: AJAX
was totally a thing.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.490
Right?

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.630
It totally meant
something very specific.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.380
And then all these CEOs
and marketing people said,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.120
oh yeah, AJAX.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Can
we make it AJAX?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.580
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Like,
cool web things.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.190
And so it lost its meaning.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.897
And meanwhile, we're sitting
here like, that's not AJAX.

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:55.730
What does that mean?

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.480
That's silly.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes
it's asynchronous.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.430
Yes, it's JavaScript.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.910
We can go with that.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.410
What is it?

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.785
I think it's not XML.

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:04.584
It's very rarely XML.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.250
And it all sort of
fell down from there.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.766
It just came to mean anything
vaguely asynchronous.

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:10.890
ALEX KOMOROSKE: But to me,
Web 2.0 is the same way.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.620
Yeah, it's a buzzword.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.140
It totally has
become a buzz word.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.870
But the fact of the
matter is there's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.020
a number of amazingly
successful companies

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.249
that got their start
during that time.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.290
And so now, we look back.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.390
And we're like, oh,
yeah, Web 2.0, whatever.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.760
But it actually was-- all
of these really successful

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920
companies that we totally
take for granted today

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.135
totally got their start
because of the web.

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:31.010
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.622
And because companies are asking
for, can we make this, uh,

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:36.757
the second web rather
than the first web?

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:37.590
It's like, oh, yeah.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.090
Yeah.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.840
So what you essentially
mean there is you

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.725
want it to be a bit
faster and a bit simpler.

00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:44.100
And that was a good excuse,
I think, for us as developers

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.390
to sort of crowbar
some of what we wanted.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.610
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.840
Because I think with
the earlier web,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.410
everyone had this,
like, oh, what?

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.220
Static sites-- things are slow.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.720
You click.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.049
It takes a while to load.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.090
And there really wasn't
any reason at that point,

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.520
because techniques like
AJAX and XMLHttpRequest

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.530
allowed you to build
these immersive things.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.100
And so actually,
a new label really

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.530
helped developers go
with it and find that.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.710
And the same way, I think,
is what we're at now.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.050
People say, oh my gosh.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.890
Look, this native app
loads so much faster.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.080
It's like, well, look
at the web's version!

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.079
They just took this huge 25
megs required to download it.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.940
It's got 13 different third
party scripts, many of which

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.710
are calculating the same
stuff with synchronous layouts

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.077
on every scroll event.

00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:27.160
Of course that's not fast.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.451
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So how's the
next generation of the web

00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:29.960
different?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.300
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I think
it's people really learning

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.050
how to use some of
these new technologies,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.570
and how to build things
that feel at home on mobile.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.986
So using the
[INAUDIBLE] framework

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.080
that we talked about,
to help understand

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.550
when you have good
performance, and when

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.110
you should be optimizing, and
when you add an extra script

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.680
to your site.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.370
And you go, no.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.953
You know what?

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.364
That made my site load too
slow or scroll too slowly.

00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:50.280
I'm not to include it.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.720
It's not worth it.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
one of the things

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.120
I'm hearing sort of becoming
more and more popular.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.203
And it's music to my ears.

00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:57.330
It's the idea of having
a performance budget

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.770
as part of your design process.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.060
And that's a big
part of [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.500
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It truly is.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.200
Because if you
wait until the end

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.630
and try to make it highly
performant, it's too late.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.630
So what you really want
to do is build something

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.000
fast from the beginning.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.470
And as you layer in things,
make sure you don't ever

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.512
regress your performance.

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:13.011
That's one of the
reasons that we're

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.810
looking forward to doing things
in DevTools, to make it easier.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.476
So right now, when
you open up DevTools,

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:18.980
you're like, overwhelmed.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.480
Right?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.050
And there's so much there.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.370
And that's why we're
looking into tools that

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.910
will make it much more-- hey.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.350
We looked at your page.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.200
Your reaction time
is pretty good.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.340
Load time could be better.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.250
Animation speed-- terrible.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.140
You were missing.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.570
You were always janking.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.160
This third party
script right here

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.850
is doing way too much work
on every scroll event.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.069
Take it out.

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.443
And that would make it much
easier for you to go, oh, OK.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:43.650
Take it out.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.690
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
because this is the thing.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.400
The web is fast
by default. Right?

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.030
If you have a blank
page-- pretty fast.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.311
It's all regression.

00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:51.310
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.092
And I think also, by the
way, everyone goes, well,

00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:55.300
native apps flow much faster.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.440
Well, again, well-made
native apps definitely

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.910
can load very quickly.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.870
Well-made web apps can as well.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.130
But remember, you're comparing
the first visit to a website--

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.800
you're downloading all of
the images and resources

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800
to display this on the
screen-- versus a thing

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.360
where, when you
installed the native app,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.600
it did take a while to download.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.808
In fact, it probably took
a minute or so to download.

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:16.600
It's just that you did
it at install time.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.710
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.600
Many megabytes.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.500
And if you're on
3G, it's normally

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.810
like, ah, I'm going to have
to download this later.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.858
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right.

00:06:21.858 --> 00:06:23.399
And it gets past
that 10-second mark.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.440
So you say, yeah,
I'll install this.

00:06:27.562 --> 00:06:30.020
You know what, I'm going to go
over and play some solitaire

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.880
or something.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.220
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm data
roaming at the moment.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.490
And I'm locked down to 3G.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.310
So I'm completely aware
of that right now.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.965
So it's not just
about the improvements

00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:39.090
in the next generation web.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.740
We're getting new
features, as well, right?

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.170
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.336
So things-- one of the ones
we're most excited about

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.720
is push notifications.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.010
So on mobile in
particular, increasingly

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.050
we're moving from
this world where

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.050
it's driven by the grid of
apps and into more things that

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.080
happen in context.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.788
So actually, just
before we started this,

00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:57.630
I got a notification on my
watch about some breaking news

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.970
that happened from [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.740
And I was able to interject it
in conversation, because I just

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.890
glanced at it on my watch.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.540
That actually came from our
website, which is really cool.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But even
though it's on your watch--

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.590
and we don't run
Chrome on the watches.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.430
But it's--

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.305
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:14.210
So Chrome running on my Android
device got the notification.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.350
And then it's just a
normal system notification.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.760
So it showed up on my watch.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
That's brilliant.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.961
So if I visit-- I get
sent a link by someone.

00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:24.960
I'll go to that website.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.709
And one of the things
I like about the web

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:28.200
is I don't have to think, ooh.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.920
Do I trust this website
before clicking the link?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.340
But to be able to do
notifications and things,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.190
there's code running
in the background.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.672
So what kind of
protection-- is there

00:07:37.672 --> 00:07:39.370
a break in the security
of the web here?

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.370
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That is
a really critical point.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.990
And everyone goes, ah, you
should just copy native apps.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.900
Native apps do some
things extremely well.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.960
The web-- one of its biggest
and most important strengths

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.880
is how easy it is for
people to navigate

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.440
to a diverse collection
of stuff so easily.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.790
So if you are
afraid to tap links,

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.090
that would be a total failure.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.590
Right?

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.173
Because that's the
benefit of the web.

00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:02.760
In fact, yesterday we
shared that on average,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.270
Chrome for Android users visit
100 distinct domains a month

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.700
on average, which is crazy.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Which is more
than most people have apps.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.300
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Oh, way over.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.117
And it's because
it's so easy for you

00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:14.200
to dive into these things.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.590
So that's incredibly
important for us to maintain.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.910
So the way that it works
is you visit a site.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.900
And what we encourage
developers to do

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.896
is, in context,
explain to the users

00:08:23.896 --> 00:08:25.520
why they might want
push notifications.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.260
So say for example you
visit "The Guardian."

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.810
You've read multiple
articles on a given topic.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.140
And they say, hey, at the
end, you like this topic.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.669
Would you like to be
notified when there's

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.020
more articles on this topic?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.870
Well, yes.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:38.890
Yes I would.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.631
You tap that on.

00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:41.130
And then of course,
Chrome verifies.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.640
Hey, "Guardian" would love
to send you notifications.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.970
Just to make sure that you
knew what you were doing.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.430
And at that point,
if you say yes,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.695
they'll allow them to
register for notifications.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.360
But there's an
important bit to this.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.490
Then say you register.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.740
And it says, this sounds good.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.550
You register.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.420
And they send you a
notification every minute.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.660
We also make it very easy.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.830
In each notification we show,
there's a prominent site

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.980
settings button.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.050
You tap that.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.850
It's just a couple
more taps to turn off

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.210
notifications for that domain.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.220
So we make it very easy for
you to revoke that permission

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.216
if you decide that that
site wasn't using it

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:15.270
in a respectful way.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
excellent, as well.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.503
Because we've been
building a few test

00:09:17.503 --> 00:09:19.090
apps with this technology.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.959
And just because there's just
a button that sends a push

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:24.500
message to someone else, I've
sort of woken up in the morning

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.547
with like 100 of these.

00:09:26.547 --> 00:09:28.380
And it's just so good
that it's like, right.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.150
Actually, I'm done with this.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.830
We've had our fun.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.360
Yeah.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.550
So back to safety, you're
able to just revoke

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.527
those permissions.

00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:38.860
And you're back to it just
being like any other website.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:38.920
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.390
And again, I think
that's what's so

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.220
important about this feature.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.297
It's everyone goes, yeah.

00:09:43.297 --> 00:09:44.880
You've got push
notifications in apps.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.490
But remember, websites--
you visit so many of them.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.310
It's so easy to stumble
across other things.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.296
And instead of having
this all or nothing-- do

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:53.920
you want to fully
commit to this thing?

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.390
Give it space on
your home screen?

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.450
Give it all these
powerful permissions?

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:57.950
Nah.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.810
I just want push notifications.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.404
You know, I check
into this airline.

00:10:02.404 --> 00:10:03.570
I don't fly them very often.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.028
I don't want their
app necessarily.

00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:06.319
I don't fly them that often.

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:08.860
But it says, do you want to be
notified if your gate changes?

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.620
Why, yes.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.337
Yes I would.

00:10:10.337 --> 00:10:11.170
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.317
Because exactly that case.

00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:14.150
It's not something that
you visit every day.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.285
But that notification
is so important to you.

00:10:16.285 --> 00:10:16.570
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Exactly.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.340
It's critical.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.730
And so I think we're
combining this amazing reach,

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.410
this no-commitment for
the web, and allowing you

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.280
as a user to sort of
escalate, on your own terms,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.320
as you feel comfortable.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.550
You pick and choose which
aspects of the experience

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.250
you want.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.380
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So the
whole push messaging thing

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.269
is one of the features
that's from native, right?

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.060
When I think of the
apps on my home screen,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.329
the native apps, the reason
they-- well, previously

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:42.120
to now-- couldn't have
been done on the web

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.736
is because of push
notifications.

00:10:43.736 --> 00:10:45.110
ALEX KOMOROSKE:
That's a big one.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: As the web,
are we just copying native?

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.420
Are we always going to be behind
and just picking and choosing

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.170
their innovations?

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.426
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I
don't think that would

00:10:53.426 --> 00:10:54.620
be a good way for us to go.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.460
And so, yes.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.940
We look at the
features, the things

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.530
that people are relying
on on these devices.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.190
And we figure out a way to
bring it responsibly to the web.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.150
But at every point, we're trying
to marry these capabilities

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.830
with the power of
the web-- this reach.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.630
And so for example,
background sync

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.449
is a functionality that
native apps often have.

00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:14.240
They can sort of wake
up in the background,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.694
refreshen their resources.

00:11:15.694 --> 00:11:17.360
Why don't we just
bring this to the web?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.693
Well, it's actually really hard.

00:11:18.693 --> 00:11:21.580
So imagine that you
visit a site every day

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.520
on your personal computer.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.271
It's an embarrassing
celebrity gossip site

00:11:25.271 --> 00:11:27.561
that you don't want to admit
to anybody that you visit.

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:28.210
You go often.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.668
You never would
visit that at work,

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:31.260
because you're
supposed to be working.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:31.480
Right?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.350
So you visit it.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.434
And then we say, OK, cool.

00:11:33.434 --> 00:11:34.599
You visit this pretty often.

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:36.090
Let's let you
background sync that.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.619
Well, now you go to
your work network.

00:11:38.619 --> 00:11:39.910
And it syncs in the background.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.784
And your boss goes,
Jake, what are you doing?

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:43.950
Why are you wasting time
on the company network?

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.000
So that's just-- we have
to think very carefully

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.490
about these things, to
make sure that users have

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.410
the right expectations
about what's happening,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.320
so the right things can happen,
and they don't inadvertently

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.385
waste the battery or leak
personal information,

00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:55.620
or what have you.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.036
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And it made
me really happy in the keynote

00:11:58.036 --> 00:12:00.046
to hear that Android's
permissioning model--

00:12:00.046 --> 00:12:02.170
that they're changing to
what you mentioned before,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.139
this kind of just-in-time
contextual permissioning model.

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:07.180
So I've kind of thought
that's a case where, hey.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.336
They've kind of copied the
success of the web, which

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:11.219
I thought was great.

00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:12.760
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I
think there's a lot

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.449
of great properties of apps
and the way the web works.

00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:17.990
And I think it's great for them
to be inspired by one another

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.610
to try to figure
out how to bring

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.360
these lessons from the
other realm into the other,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.025
and just make it
better for everybody.

00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:25.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.840
I think it's great to see the
web progressing and getting

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.550
all of these new
features, but still

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.520
staying true to the
benefits of the web.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.950
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right, right.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.408
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
Mr. Alex Komoroske,

00:12:35.408 --> 00:12:37.350
talking about the next
generation mobile web.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.410
Thank you very
much for watching.
