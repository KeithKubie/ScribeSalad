00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.050
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.050
In lecture you've been computing
derivatives of functions

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.000
from the limit
definition of derivative.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.210
So today we're going to
do another example of that

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.330
and do some graphing, as well.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.745
So I've got a problem
written here on the board.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.980
So we're defining
a function f of x

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.296
to be 1 over the quantity
1 plus x squared.

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:27.780
So what I'd like
you to do is graph

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.640
the function of
the curve y equals

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.830
f of x and to compute
the derivative f

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.582
prime of x from the definition.

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:35.290
So why don't you take
a couple of minutes

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.399
to do that yourself,
then come back,

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.690
and we'll work it out together.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.660
All right.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.460
Welcome back.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.000
So to start off, let's try
graphing this function f of x.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.830
So one thing you
can always do when

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.270
you start out
graphing a function,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.840
is to just plot a few points.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.850
And that'll give you
a very rough sense

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.230
of where the function is, at
least around those points.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.610
So, for example,
when x is equal to 0

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.470
we have f of 0 is 1 over 1.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.300
So that's just 1.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.760
So we've got this
point here, (0, 1).

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.140
And when x is equal
to 1, well, x squared

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.910
is 1, so the denominator is 2,
so the function value is 1/2.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.140
So, all right I'm not going
to draw this to scale.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.800
I'm going to put
x equals 1 here.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:38.470
And the function value is 1/2,
so this is the point (1, 1/2).

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.515
And, OK.

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:40.390
We could do one more.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.730
When x is equal to 2, this
function-- 2 squared is 4,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.644
so that's 5-- so it's 1/5.

00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:48.310
So I don't know.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.350
1/5 is smaller than 1/2, right?

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.980
So that's maybe down
here-- so this is something

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.020
like the point (2, 1/5).

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.520
All right.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.020
But this is a very rough
idea we're getting,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.070
so we can use some more
sophisticated analysis

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.890
to get a better idea
of what this graph is

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.830
going to look like.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.090
So the first thing we
could notice, for example,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.997
is that this is
an even function.

00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:14.790
Right?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.320
If I change the sign of x,
if I replace x by minus x,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.280
well, x squared
and minus x squared

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.780
are both equal to x squared.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.340
So if you replace x by
minus x, the function value

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.220
doesn't change.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.570
So this is an even function that
has symmetry across the axis

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.850
here.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.840
So, you know, for
example, I could just

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.280
mirror image these points.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.000
So these points also have to
be on the graph, the points

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.130
minus 1, 1/2 and minus 2, 1/5.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.800
And any other part of
the curve that I draw

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.130
will be perfectly mirror imaged.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.020
Another thing to observe
is that x squared is always

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.580
greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.260
So 1 plus x squared
is always positive.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.670
So 1 over 1 plus x squared
is also always positive.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.930
Also, 1 plus x squared,
it reaches its minimum

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.210
when x is equal to 0 and
then as x gets large,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.020
either in the positive direction
or in the negative direction,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.590
this gets larger and larger.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.610
This, just the 1
plus x squared part.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.150
So the denominator is
getting larger and larger,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.350
while the numerator
stays constant.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.940
The whole fraction gets
smaller and smaller.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.410
So as x gets bigger, either
bigger positive or bigger

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.720
negative, the function value
will diminish off to 0,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.630
and it has its maximum
value here at 0.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.150
Because that's when 1 plus
x squared has its minimum.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.520
So the function sort of
has its maximum here at 0,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.450
and then it flattens out.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.520
And as x gets larger
and larger and larger,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.939
this goes to infinity, so the
whole fraction goes down to 0.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.230
But it never reaches it, right?

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.771
Because we said it's
always positive.

00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:00.830
And similarly on the other side.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.330
OK.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.830
So that's the graph
of the curve y

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.250
equals 1 over 1 plus x squared.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.380
Roughly speaking.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.540
OK.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.320
So now let's talk about
computing the derivative.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.260
So right now, to
compute a derivative,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.180
all you have is the limit
definition of the derivative.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.260
So when I ask you to
compute the derivative what

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.430
you've got to do is write down
what that definition says.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.610
That's the limit of a
difference quotient.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.050
So we have, by definition,
that f prime of x

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.770
is equal to-- well,
it's the limit as delta

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.050
x goes to 0 of some
difference quotient.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.200
So on the bottom of
the difference quotient

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.880
we just have delta
x, and on the top

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.340
we have f of x plus
delta x minus f of x.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.270
In our case, we have a
nice formula for f of x.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:09.320
So this is equal to the limit
as delta x goes to 0 of 1

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:18.220
over the quantity 1 plus
x plus delta x quantity

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.020
squared-- oh, I guess I didn't
need that parenthesis there--

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.600
minus 1 over 1 plus x
squared, and the whole thing

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.940
is over delta x.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.789
So, what would be
really nice, of course,

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.580
is if this were a limit
where we could just

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.330
plug in the value delta x
equals 0 and evaluate it.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.090
But the way the definition
of a derivative works,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.290
that never works, right?

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.410
You're always left
with the numerator.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.670
As delta x goes to
0, that top is always

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.210
going to be f of x minus f
of x and it's going to be 0.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.560
And the bottom is
always going to be

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.449
delta x going to 0, which is 0.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.740
So you always, when you have
a differentiable function,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.470
you always have a
derivative that's

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.940
going to be a limit
of a 0 over 0 form.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.290
So you need to do some sort
of manipulation in order

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.960
to, in order to get into a
form you can evaluate it.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.250
What we'd really
like is to manipulate

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.380
this numerator somehow and pull
out, say, a factor of delta x.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.160
And then that could
cancel with the delta

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.207
x we have in the denominator.

00:06:17.207 --> 00:06:18.540
Something, some trick like that.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.800
Some algebraic or
other manipulation

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.770
to make this into a form where
we can plug in and evaluate.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.266
So all right, so
right here there's

00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:33.600
sort of only one manipulation
that's natural to do,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.000
which is we can add these
two fractions together.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.390
So let's do that, and we
can rewrite this limit.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.220
The limit is delta x goes to 0.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.780
All right, I'm going to
pull this 1 over delta x

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.900
out front just to
make everything

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.780
look a little bit nicer.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.480
It's 1 over delta x times-- OK.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.810
I want to, you know,
subtract these two fractions.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.730
I want to put them over
a common denominator,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.980
so the denominator
is just going to be

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.010
the product of the denominator.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:11.980
So that's 1 plus x plus
delta x quantity squared,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.600
times 1 plus x squared.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.100
OK.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.255
And so this fraction is 1 plus
x squared over that denominator.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:32.320
And the second one is 1
plus x plus delta x quantity

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.340
squared over that
common denominator.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.840
OK.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.490
So we still haven't
got where we want

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.280
to be yet because we still have
this 1 over delta x hanging

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.930
out.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.320
So OK, so we have to,
you know, keep going.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.800
And so here, I guess
there's a-- this

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.700
is sort of a problem
that forces us

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.172
a little bit in one direction.

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.630
You, know, there's not much we
can do with the denominator,

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.410
but here in the numerator we
can expand this out and start

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.462
combining stuff.

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:02.170
So let's do that.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.070
So this is equal to-- all right,
well, the limit hangs out--

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.600
the limit as delta
x goes to 0 of 1

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.400
over delta x times--
OK, so 1 plus x squared

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.085
minus-- all right, so if
you expand out x plus delta

00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:24.170
x quantity squared, using
your favorite, either FOIL

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.940
or the binomial theorem
or just whatever you like,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.990
however you like to multiply two
binomials-- so we get a minus 1

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:42.470
minus x squared minus 2x times
delta x minus delta x squared.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.237
That's the top.

00:08:44.237 --> 00:08:45.820
OK, and we haven't
changed the bottom.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:56.440
It's still 1 plus x plus delta x
squared times 1 plus x squared.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.000
OK.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.619
Well, so what?

00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:03.660
OK, so now some nice stuff
is starting to happen,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.590
which is this 1 and this
minus 1 are going to cancel,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.677
and this x squared and
this minus x squared

00:09:08.677 --> 00:09:09.510
are going to cancel.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.580
And then after we
cancel those terms

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.609
we see that in the
numerator here,

00:09:13.609 --> 00:09:15.900
everything is going to have
a factor of delta x, right?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.816
These four are going to
cancel, and we'll just

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:19.680
be left with these two
terms, both of which

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.056
are divisible by delta x.

00:09:21.056 --> 00:09:22.430
So that's where
this cancellation

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.330
we've been looking for
is going to come from.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.640
So let's keep going.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.570
So we cancel those, they
subtract, give us 0.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:39.400
This limit is equal to the
limit delta x goes to 0-- OK.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.960
And then we can divide this
delta x from the denominator

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.540
in, and what we're
left with upstairs

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:51.260
is minus 2x minus delta
x, the whole thing

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.420
over the same
denominator, still.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:03.810
1 plus x plus delta x squared
times 1 plus x squared.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.310
All right.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.810
Great.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.660
So we've done this manipulation.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.440
We finally found a delta x that
we could cancel with that delta

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.110
x we started with
in the denominator.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.960
And now this limit is no longer
this 0 over 0 form, right?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.090
When delta x goes to 0,
the top goes to minus 2x.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.240
And the bottom-- well let's see,
this delta x just goes to 0,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.880
so it's 1 plus x squared
times 1 plus x squared.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.580
So that's not 0 over 0.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.370
We can just plug in to evaluate.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:38.430
So this is, just works out
to a minus 2x over-- OK,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.900
1 plus x squared times 1 plus
x squared is 1 plus x squared,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.480
quantity squared.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.710
And so this is the derivative
that we were looking for.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.030
This is, just to remind you what
that was, that's d over dx of 1

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.450
over the quantity
1 plus x squared.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.670
Now, if you wanted, you
could check this a little bit

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.240
by looking at the graph and
looking at this function

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.630
and just making sure
that it makes sense.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.260
So for example, this
function, this derivative

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.480
has the property that
it's 0 when x is 0.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.416
And that's the only time it's 0.

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:18.040
And if we go back
and look at the graph

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.020
that we drew over here, we
see that's also a property

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.500
that this graph has, right?

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.570
It has this horizontal
tangent line there,

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.020
and then it diminishes
off to the right and it,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.440
on the left side it
increases, then it

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.775
has that horizontal tangent
line, and then it decreases.

00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:39.150
And so if we go back to this
function we see, yes indeed,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.880
when x is negative, this
whole thing is positive.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.730
And then at 0 it's 0, and
then it's negative thereafter.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.835
And similarly, you could
note that this function here

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.310
is an odd function.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.710
If you change the
sign of x, that

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.574
changes the sign of this
whole expression, and so OK,

00:11:59.574 --> 00:12:01.940
and so that makes
perfect sense back here.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.910
The symmetry of this curve
is such that, you know,

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.220
if we look at a tangent
line to the left of 0

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.010
and the symmetric tangent
line to the right of 0,

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.570
they're mirror
images of each other.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.090
So their slopes are exactly
negatives of each other.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.310
So that's a nice way you
can sort of put the two

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.640
different pieces of this
problem together in order

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.230
to double check your work.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.981
So that's that.
