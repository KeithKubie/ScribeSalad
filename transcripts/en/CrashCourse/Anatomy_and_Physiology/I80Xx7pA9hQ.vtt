00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
You’ve probably heard somebody refer to a
really difficult, onerous task as “the heavy lifting.”

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.560
Or maybe when someone else tells you that
you have to do hard work on your own, they’ll

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.980
say: “You can’t have somebody else do
your pushups for you.”

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.400
So, yeah, often when we’re talking about
hard work that we just don’t want to do,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.160
we use metaphors that involve the skeletal
muscles.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.820
And yeah that’s their reputation. They're what you use to
perform all of the necessary-but-sometimes-unpleasant,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.300
brute-force exertions that life requires of us.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.260
But they do a lot more than just heavy lifting.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.020
Your skeletal muscles, 640 in all, come in
all different shapes and sizes, from the longest

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.820
(the sartorius in your upper thigh) to the
biggest (the gluteus maximus in your butt),

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.400
to the tiniest (the stapedius in your middle
ear -- which I’ve been doing my best to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.760
work out lately, but I just can’t get any
definition).

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.740
These organs are capable of a whole range of power
and duration, as well as surprising and delicate subtlety.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.780
The same muscles you might use to pluck an
eyebrow, or catch a firefly, or cuddle a kitten,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.560
can, in other circumstances, crush cans, punch
holes in walls, or do a bunch of push-ups.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.820
Which, by the way, are not really a thing,
and she’s gonna prove it.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.300
That’s right -- I’m gonna have somebody
do my pushups for me.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.240
Now when you look at how the muscular system
moves, you gotta keep two things in mind:

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.060
First, muscles never push. They always pull.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.540
Now, how can that be, since Claire here is
obviously pushing herself up?

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.590
Well, remember that most skeletal muscles
extend over joints to connect to at least

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.910
two different bones. That’s why they’re
skeletal.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.940
When a muscle contracts, the bone that moves
is called the muscle’s insertion point.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.520
And the muscle brings the insertion closer
to the bone that doesn’t move -- or at least

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.240
moves less -- and that’s called the muscle’s
origin.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.980
And that movement is always a pull -- with the
insertion bone being drawn toward the origin bone.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.940
And when you think about it, it has to be
this way. Muscles can’t, like, extend themselves

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.090
beyond their resting state to push a bone
away from it.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.660
So even though Claire’s pushing herself up
off the ground in an exercise we call push ups,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.659
her muscles are actually pulling their
insertions toward their origins.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.450
When she pushes herself up, her pectoralis
major is contracting, pulling its insertion

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.660
point -- which in this case is the top of her humerus --
toward the immobile origin, which is her sternum.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.480
Every single movement that your skeleton makes
uses the very same principle -- whether you’re

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.590
hammering on on anvil or lifting your pinky
to sip a cup of tea.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.840
So that’s the first thing. The second big
thing to remember about skeletal muscles is

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.390
that whatever one muscle does, another muscle
can undo.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.960
You can generally classify skeletal muscles into four
functional groups depending on the movement being

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.440
performed. For example, the muscles that are mainly
responsible for producing a certain movement are

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.200
called that motion’s prime movers, or agonist muscles.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.190
So, when Claire does jumping jacks, she’s
using those pectorals in her chest and latissimus

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.980
dorsi on her back to adduct her arms back
down to her sides.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.380
Put another way, those are her prime mover
muscles for adduction. At the same time,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.600
there are antagonist muscles that are working in
reverse of that particular movement, by staying

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.380
relaxed, or stretching, or contracting just enough
to keep those prime movers from over-extending.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.980
So, in this case, the antagonists of the jumping
jacks would include the deltoids on top of her

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.740
shoulders, which among other things help her slow her
down arms so that she doesn’t slap her thighs too hard.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.500
But when it’s time to start abducting her
arms from her side to over her head, those

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.550
deltoids now become the primary movers, while
the pecs and lats switch to being antagonists.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.409
The third functional muscle group is your
synergists, and they help the prime movers

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.319
usually by either lending them a little extra
oomph, or by stabilizing joints against dislocation.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.709
With all these arm movements, most of the
rotator cuff muscles -- like the teres minor

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.409
or the infraspinatus -- are acting like synergists.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.879
So this is how skeletal muscles are functionally
grouped. But what about their actual functions?

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.219
As individual organs, how do they contract
to create both quick and sustained movements,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.780
and to regulate force?

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.340
How can Claire’s hands gently pet this corgi
in one moment, and then crush a can in another?

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.549
I’ve got two words for you: motor units.

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.020
A motor unit is a group of muscle fibers that all get
their signals from the same, single motor neuron.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.360
Since all those fibers listen to only one
neuron, they act together as a unit.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.140
In a big power-generating muscle like your
rectus femoris in your quad, each of a thousand

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.370
or so motor neurons may synapse with, and
innervate, a thousand muscle fibers.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.300
Those thousand fibers together form a large motor unit.
And big units are typically found in muscles that

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.680
perform big, not-very-delicate movements,
like walking, and squatting, and drop-kicking.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.869
But other muscles -- like the ones that control
your eyes and fingers, which exert fine motor

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:30.269
control -- may have just a handful of muscle
fibers connected to a single motor neuron.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.669
Those relationships are small motor units.

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.629
And when a motor unit, no matter how large
or small, responds to a single action potential,

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:42.980
those fibers quickly contract and release,
in what we call a twitch. And every tiny twitch

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.860
has three distinct phases.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.770
To understand which happens when, we gotta
go back to the sliding filament model.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.169
Immediately after a muscle fiber is stimulated
by a nerve -- when calcium ions are flooding

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.800
into the sarcomeres to pull away those two
protein bodyguards of tropomyosin and troponin

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.499
from the actin -- that’s called the latent
period.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:04.339
The stimulus has arrived, but no force is being
produced. That’s when the action is just starting.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.920
Then comes a brief period of contraction,
when the myosin heads are binding, and pulling,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.080
and releasing, over and over, and the muscle
fibers contract.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.259
But soon the fiber slides back down into the
relaxation period, when the calcium gets pumped

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.779
back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and
the actin and myosin stop the binding cycle,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.960
and the muscle relaxes.

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.349
Each phase consists of a lot of little steps,
and while you couldn’t tell by watching

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.710
my brother dance, the fact is that our muscular
movements are pretty smooth.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.260
That’s because one muscle can produce a
variation of smooth forces, called graded muscle

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.720
responses. And they’re generally affected by both the
frequency and strength with which they’re stimulated.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.260
So say Claire’s trying to lift something
heavy, like a paint can.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.201
Just as the volume of a sound corresponds
to the frequency of action potentials from

00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:49.739
your ear to your brain, her brain gets her
muscles to increase their force, by increasing

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.539
the frequency with which her motor neurons
are firing -- it’s like pushing a button

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.259
over and over again really fast.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.210
Lift! You can do it! Feel the burn .. or whatever!

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.169
And the faster these nerve impulses fire,
the stronger each successive twitch gets,

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.499
since the muscle doesn’t get a chance to
relax in between.

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.860
Because, remember, the relaxation period of
a twitch is when all the calcium is being

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.169
pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.689
If another action potential travels down before
that can happen, even more calcium gets released,

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:19.620
which ends up exposing more actin for myosin
to bind to, and that means more force in that fiber.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.380
In this way, twitches end up adding to each
other as they get closer together in time.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.520
And that’s what we call that temporal summation.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.100
At some point, though, almost all actin binding
sites are exposed, so all of the myosin heads

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.080
can work through their cycles of ATP and ADP,
and the muscle force can’t increase any

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.440
more, even with faster action potentials and
more calcium.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.580
When all those little twitches blend together until they
feel like one gigantic contraction, that’s called tetanus.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.619
At that point, any person on the planet will
hit a ceiling of maximum tension.

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:51.779
That tension means myosin and the calcium
pumps are burning up the muscle cells’ ATP,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.780
and the finite supply of ATP is what makes it impossible
to maintain vigorous muscle activity indefinitely.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.619
Prolonged contraction leads to muscle fatigue,
and when your muscles just can’t take it

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:03.360
anymore all that tension crashes to zero.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.259
And remember, all of this twitching happens
in individual motor units.

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.849
Since twitches are driven by action potentials,
and action potentials only have one intensity,

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.110
frequency is the only way to create a grade
of force.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.300
But when we zoom out to the complete muscle
of maybe a thousand motor units, we can increase

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.610
the strength of the stimulus by sending action
potentials to more motor units.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.369
If amping up frequency is like hitting a button
again and again, then increasing the signal

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:31.110
strength is like smashing the whole keyboard
… with your forehead.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.649
Since multiple action potentials don’t travel
down all the motor neurons at exactly the

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:40.529
same time, each motor unit twitches at slightly different
times, which helps smooth out the … twitchiness.

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:44.879
So, contractions intensify as your motor neurons
stimulate more and more muscle fibers. This

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.660
is a process called recruitment, or multiple
motor unit summation. And it’s where some

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.869
of your muscles’ more nuanced abilities
come in.

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:55.749
So let’s say Claire is holding Abby. She
wants to hold onto her tight, so that Abby

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:58.149
doesn’t fall, but you know not too tight,
right?

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:02.929
So to increase the contraction force and tighten
her grip, she can recruit another motor unit.

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:07.599
Recruiting one with 20 fibers will firm her
grasp, but calling on one with 1000 fibers

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:10.300
might … well, let’s not think about that
too much.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.229
Lucky for our corgi friend, this recruitment
doesn’t escalate at random -- it follows

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:16.280
what’s known as a size principle. It starts

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.420
when the smallest motor units with the smallest
fibers are activated by your most excitable neurons.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.340
Then some larger motor units with larger fibers
are enlisted, increasing the strength of contraction.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.620
And finally, if you want to give it all you’ve
got -- which you don’t in Abby’s case

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:33.419
-- your largest motor units, with your biggest
muscle fibers will get involved.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.669
These big guns are the last to join up, in
part because they’re controlled by your

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.579
largest and least excitable motor neurons.
But when they’re in, they are all in -- packing

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:44.399
fifty times the force of those smaller fibers.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.319
So the basic rule is: the more motor units
recruited, the greater the force that’s generated.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.960
Now that we know how muscle contractions happen,
let’s look at our two main flavors:

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.860
isotonic and isometric.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.339
Say I want to pick up my Crash Course mug.
I can do this workout myself.

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:01.199
If the temporal and recruitment summation
triggers enough muscle tension in my arm to

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:06.149
overcome the weight of the load and lift the
mug, changing the length of the muscles involved

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.410
during contraction, than that is an isotonic
movement.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.589
Now if I want to pick up a building, I could
contract my muscles all I wanted, and develop

00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:17.860
a lot of tension without actually changing
the muscle’s length -- in which case, I’d

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.480
be experiencing isometric contractions.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.920
And possibly a hernia.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.779
Which is why I asked Claire to do all the
heavy lifting in this episode.

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:30.019
Today you learned how skeletal muscles work
together to create and reverse movements.

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:34.589
We also talked about the role size plays in
motor units, the three phase cycle of muscle

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:38.829
twitches, and how the strength and frequency
of an impulse affects the strength and duration

00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:43.519
of a contraction. Finally, we discussed twitch
summation versus tetanus, and isotonic vs.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:47.240
isometric movements. No corgis were harmed
in the making of this video.
