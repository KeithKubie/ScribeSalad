00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.009
Have you thought any more
about offline access?

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:03.920
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.410
&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking about the gift
shopping I'll be doing during my

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.950
vacation in Hawaii.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.310
I'm not sure how my cell network
access is going to be out there and

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.220
it'd be really good to not lose
all my shopping list data when

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.510
the internet connection is flaky.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.711
&gt;&gt; Well.
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:22.157
I guess it's a fair point but,
I don't know the more you think about it

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:24.880
the more tricky it sounds
like it be to set up.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.598
So first of all you need to be caching
the data locally somewhere which would

00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:32.210
necessitate using maybe a SQL-like
database or something like that.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.255
You'd also be needing to cache kind
of the stuff that the user does when

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:37.900
the app is offline.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.790
So say you were to buy.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.378
I don't know some tiki masks or
something offline.

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:45.410
You would then need to send
that data that you bought that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.340
to the phone when you reconnect.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.770
And frankly, we just don't have the
engineering resources right now to even

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.660
start implementing that.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.660
&gt;&gt; Firebase is actually doing some
caching by default as well as

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.940
queuing any actions your
user makes offline.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.720
&gt;&gt; Well, actually that's awesome.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.450
In that case don't we just
get offline access for free?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.460
&gt;&gt; Some of the time.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, well.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.990
I'm wrapped up in important
business decisions.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.790
So maybe you can talk to the developer
about all that offline stuff.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.500
&gt;&gt; Sure.
You do know your camera is on right now?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.090
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes it is
&gt;&gt; Okay let's talk a little

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.030
about how Firebase deals with offline
access and data in general and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.890
what you get for free.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.540
We have two clients your phone
in my phone for example.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.120
And let's say my phone isn't connected.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.760
Maybe I put my phone into airplane mode.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.880
But I still have shopping list
plus plus up on my device.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.450
In this situation,
my client keeps a local cache.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.570
This includes all the data that was in
the app the last time I had access.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.330
I can keep making changes and
see them immediately.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.540
In actuality,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.250
every client of Firebase app maintains
its own version of active data.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.310
And changes made for
this local copy of the database trigger

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.860
actions locally first before
data gets written to the server.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.570
So it's not just a matter
of it works offline.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.860
It's actually by design.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.940
Anyway when I'm connected again,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.720
the app will get updated based
on the changes I made offline.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.680
In that situation my client will push
the correct events to the server,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.360
the ones I made offline, and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.150
I will get the changes from the server
based on the changes you made.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.720
This is what you get for
free with Firebase.
