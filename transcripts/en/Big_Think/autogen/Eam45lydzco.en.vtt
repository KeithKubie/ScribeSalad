it's such a huge question I mean I

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850
it's such a huge question I mean I
 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.990
it's such a huge question I mean I
really literally could could talk all

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000
really literally could could talk all
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.920
really literally could could talk all
day and barely scratch the surface and I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
day and barely scratch the surface and I
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950
day and barely scratch the surface and I
think it would interest as many as four

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
think it would interest as many as four
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.030
think it would interest as many as four
or five other people how that works I

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040
or five other people how that works I
 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.569
or five other people how that works I
will say that it's always about tone and

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579
will say that it's always about tone and
 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.190
will say that it's always about tone and
if the tone is not there then there is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
if the tone is not there then there is
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.900
if the tone is not there then there is
no there is no writing and so to get

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
no there is no writing and so to get
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.729
no there is no writing and so to get
anything done I need a tone and I need

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
anything done I need a tone and I need
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.529
anything done I need a tone and I need
some sense of outline and the outline is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
some sense of outline and the outline is
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.250
some sense of outline and the outline is
usually much easier to get to the tone I

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260
usually much easier to get to the tone I
 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.630
usually much easier to get to the tone I
don't have the heart to try to make an

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
don't have the heart to try to make an
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.790
don't have the heart to try to make an
outline until I believe that there is a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
outline until I believe that there is a
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.290
outline until I believe that there is a
piece of writing to be done and the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
piece of writing to be done and the
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.369
piece of writing to be done and the
piece of writing will exist as soon as I

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
piece of writing will exist as soon as I
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.750
piece of writing will exist as soon as I
believe that there's a tone to write it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
believe that there's a tone to write it
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.300
believe that there's a tone to write it
in so I made the mistake this fall of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
in so I made the mistake this fall of
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.930
in so I made the mistake this fall of
spending a lot of time trying to outline

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940
spending a lot of time trying to outline
 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.120
spending a lot of time trying to outline
a piece I wrote about in New York State

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
a piece I wrote about in New York State
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310
a piece I wrote about in New York State
I thought I'd come up with the tone but

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
I thought I'd come up with the tone but
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.319
I thought I'd come up with the tone but
I hadn't looked at those pages when I

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329
I hadn't looked at those pages when I
 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.840
I hadn't looked at those pages when I
went ahead and spent a lot of time not

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
went ahead and spent a lot of time not
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.100
went ahead and spent a lot of time not
only making an outline but doing

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
only making an outline but doing
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.800
only making an outline but doing
research based on that outline and then

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
research based on that outline and then
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.889
research based on that outline and then
went back and the pages were horrid just

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899
went back and the pages were horrid just
 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.050
went back and the pages were horrid just
terrible and I hated them and I hated

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
terrible and I hated them and I hated
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.749
terrible and I hated them and I hated

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.819
the person who wrote them I mean I'm in
a relatively luxurious position at this

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
a relatively luxurious position at this
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.550
a relatively luxurious position at this
point in my writing life where I don't

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

writing is not interesting or worth
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.380
writing is not interesting or worth
doing if there's not some personal risk

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
doing if there's not some personal risk
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.959
doing if there's not some personal risk
if there is not if it's not dangerous in

trying to be sincere about something
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.060
trying to be sincere about something
that would be much more comfortable to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
that would be much more comfortable to
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.910

today just some of the obvious ways in
 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690
today just some of the obvious ways in
which writing can can have an element of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
which writing can can have an element of
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.380
which writing can can have an element of
risk in it there can also be some kind

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
risk in it there can also be some kind
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.010
risk in it there can also be some kind
of content risks you don't want to be

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
of content risks you don't want to be
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.990
of content risks you don't want to be

somewhat dangerous to do for a
 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.520
somewhat dangerous to do for a
journalist but particularly when there's

when they read it and that distance is
 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.040
when they read it and that distance is
always navigated by way of the pieces

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050

thing in that voice and it will be okay
at which point it's safe to create an

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490
at which point it's safe to create an
 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.210
at which point it's safe to create an
outline and go on so that's that's my

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220
outline and go on so that's that's my
 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.120
outline and go on so that's that's my
process answer
