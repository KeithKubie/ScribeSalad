1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,920
Cancer cells are not only like pathogens
in that they can evade and suppress the

2
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:06,914
immune system.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,030
They're also white pathogens in
that they rapidly evolve resistance.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,200
That is a serious problem
for cancer therapy,

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,230
so we will now discuss how to manage
the evolve resistance of cancer cells.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:23,350
Okay.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,350
Chemotherapy selects for rapid
evolution of resistant clones.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,450
This is the same principle that we
saw with the evolution of antibiotic

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,800
resistance in bacteria.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,270
Strong selection is producing
a rapid resistance response.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,550
There are some alternatives to chemo
chemotherapy that are being explored.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,430
There's targeted immunotherapy,

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,540
there is adaptive therapy where
the motto is Pharma don't know it,

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,230
and then there is targeting public goods,

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,860
so the same range of options that we
can think of in trying to control.

16
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:07,651
The evolution of antibiotic resistance
is also being examined for controlling

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,800
the resistance that
evolves with chemotherapy.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,170
It's pretty hard to kill the
cancer without killing the patient.

19
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:21,250
After all the sales that were trying
to kill our cells that are very closely

20
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:25,960
related to the healthy cells in
the patient, they're human cells.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,180
The more drug we use, the stronger the
effect is. That's the dose response curve.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,130
Usually there's a phase one clinical
trial to see what the tolerable dose might

23
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:36,964
be.

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,020
Then there's a phase two clinical trial
that gives evidence that the treatment

25
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:46,021
is effective and then there's a phase
three clinical trial which is randomized

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,800
and placebo controlled,
uh, and it's expensive.

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,890
So normally by the time a drug has
proceeded through these three different

28
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,210
levels of trial,

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,660
success at the end is defined now as
extending the life by an average of a few

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,680
months.
So it's a frustrating situation.

31
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,410
We aren't really helping the
patients as much as we would like to.

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,630
Yeah.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,900
Here's the typical clinical
experience for a patient with cancer.

34
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,680
Patient arrives in the clinic
with the late stage cancer.

35
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,100
That means it has already metastasized.
It's throughout the body.

36
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,690
Surgery is therefore considered
ineffective. Not all of them.

37
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:33,640
Metasticies could be found.
A cytotoxic chemotherapy is started.

38
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,830
Usually it's once a week for three weeks.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,550
It attacks all of the
proliferating cells in the body.

40
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,410
The patient's hair falls out,
the gut lining sloughs off,

41
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,271
the tumor,

42
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:50,950
shrinks or even disappears
from an Mri or an X. Ray.

43
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,380
However, please note, a mass of a
million cells is not visible on an MRI.

44
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,730
So there could be a lot of metastasis in
the body of the patient and they would

45
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:04,900
be invisible after chemotherapy.
A few months later,

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,930
the tumor reappears APP application
of the same drug has no effect.

47
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,140
So the doctors tried different drug
and that's exactly how we would select

48
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,330
resistance in the lab if we were trying
to select resistance to the sell wine or

49
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:21,430
a bacterial culture.

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,480
So the standard way of using chemotherapy
is the most effective way to rapidly

51
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,620
select resistance.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,320
Yeah,

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,910
there are different kinds of chemotherapy.
There are cytotoxins that kill cells.

54
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,970
So five f you have blocks.

55
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:43,560
DNA synthesis is plat and buys the DNA
and causes problems that trigger a pop

56
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:48,270
ptosis. They both kill cells. There
are targeted therapies like Gleevec.

57
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:51,260
It fits into the brick abl cancer genes.

58
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:53,670
So that's a breast cancer gene.

59
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:56,620
Tamoxifen blocks the estrogen receptors.

60
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,480
So for the estrogen sensitive,
uh,

61
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,960
breast cancer's Tomoxifin is used.
You're fit an,

62
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:05,670
it blocks the epithelial
growth factor receptor.

63
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,460
Yeah.

64
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,140
These therapies have been shown to select
for cells with resistance mutations.

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,840
Gleevec resistance comes
from point mutations in the
pocket where Gleevec vines

66
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,690
to brick abl or doing its amplification.

67
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,680
And the mutation is often
present before therapy.

68
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:30,570
So it's in that diverse genetically
heterogeneous set of clones

69
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,851
get fit.

70
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:37,851
A nub resistance is in a
mutation to Egf are five,

71
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:38,821
four years or so.

72
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:43,821
Resistance is in mutations and extra
copies of t y m s and the result is the

73
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:48,510
treatment fails especially it feels,

74
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,080
especially in smokers and in
people with late stage tumors.

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,820
Now what about targeted immunotherapy?

76
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,080
The immune system can be
used to target cancer cells.

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,400
It stimulates cytotoxic t cells and it
suppresses the immunosuppressive cells

78
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:13,480
that increase up to 10 fold
in cancer patients. So there,

79
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,770
so this is the enemy of
my enemy is my friend.

80
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,660
There have been some dramatic successes
and some disappointing failures with

81
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:25,190
extremely, very lung cancers including
ovarian cancer and melanomas.

82
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,410
In some cases with Melanomas,

83
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,230
targeted immunotherapy has cleared
the cancer out of the body,

84
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,090
the patient completely and others
it hasn't worked and it's uh,

85
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,100
it's about a 50% success rate.

86
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,600
There are multiple immune pathways in
the tumor microenvironment that are both

87
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:49,250
inhibitory and costimulatory and
they can be targets of therapeutic

88
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:52,100
manipulation. So when
this diagram, but the,

89
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,700
the pathways are indicated here
by the arrows. Here is the tumor,

90
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,910
here is an cell or a macrophage.

91
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,820
Here is the t regulatory cell,

92
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,200
here is a tumor specific cytotoxic cell.

93
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,210
Okay.
So it's a cytotoxic t lymphocyte.

94
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,170
The MDS sees those are myeloid
immunosuppressive cells that increase that

95
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,830
increase up to tenfold in
the cancer patients. So

96
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,740
these need to be suppressed to allow
there to be effective antitumor activity

97
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,363
from,

98
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,840
okay,

99
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,840
the cytotoxic t cells and the particular
approaches that seem most promising are

100
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:43,480
those that block these inhibitory
receptors here on the t reg cells.

101
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,280
So this particular receptor here
and this particular receptor here,

102
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,320
PD one and Ctla four,

103
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,210
there are also evolutionary
approaches. We can, we could use,

104
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:02,680
for example, drug cocktails that require
different mechanisms for resistance,

105
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:07,681
where each drug is targeting a different
resistance mechanism that makes the,

106
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,140
uh, evolution of resistance
highly improbable. However,

107
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,530
the combined side effects of multiple
components of a cocktail could be

108
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,150
unsupportable or even fatal.

109
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,780
So even one chemotherapeutic drug often
is causing extreme discomfort to the

110
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:34,510
patient and two, three or four of them
together could actually kill the patient.

111
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:35,980
Okay.

112
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,990
Secondly,
there's adaptive therapy,

113
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,980
which uses lower doses to control cancer
growth while slowing the evolution of

114
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:42,814
resistance.

115
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,980
We've seen a similar idea
with a anti microbial therapy.

116
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:49,890
Yeah.

117
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,780
And then it's also possible to target
public goods to disrupt cooperation within

118
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:59,781
a tumor because tumor cells actually
cooperate with each other in a way that's

119
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,190
rather like the social life of bacteria.

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,280
Yeah.

121
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,280
So here are a couple of replicates of
the same experiment in which adaptive

122
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,260
therapy was tried in mice.

123
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,930
And so in both of these,
the standard treatment,

124
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,740
which is in red results in just as heavy
a tumor burden is no treatment at all,

125
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:27,100
but with some delay. So no treatment at
all is the control. That's the black,

126
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,520
the standard therapy,
which is a strong dose,

127
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,510
causes the evolution of
resistance and with some delay,

128
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:39,511
the tumor burden then rises up to the
same level is if there were no therapy at

129
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:44,920
all, but adaptive therapy, which
is in green and the two replicates,

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,490
keeps the tumor burden low.
It doesn't wipe it out,

131
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:53,110
but it keeps it low and that could
extend life and reduce suffering.

132
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,030
It won't eliminate the cancer,
but it could buy time for the patient.

133
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,960
The final option is the
target public goods.

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,610
We saw that as one of the options being
pursued with antimicrobial therapy.

135
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,690
Yeah.

136
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,800
Cancer cells produce growth factors
that suppress the immune system and that

137
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,200
stimulate angiogenesis.
They are public goods.

138
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,670
A cell that did not produce those
growth factors could grow faster,

139
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,980
so it could be a cheater.

140
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,770
Growth factors are a public good and
cells that produce them are susceptible to

141
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,020
invasion by cells that
do not produce them.

142
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,610
So the therapy would be to
remove cells from the tumor,

143
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,280
knock out the genes for the
growth factor and then reinserted,

144
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,300
actually put the modified cancer cells
back into the patient to compete in the

145
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,780
colon competition with the ones that
are producing the growth factors.

146
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,790
So they have everything that made that
a good clone except the growth factors.

147
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,050
The modified cells then
spread the concentration of
growth factors falls and the

148
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:03,240
tumor collapses.
For lack of communication.

149
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,870
Evolving countermeasure
is quite difficult.

150
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,540
Anytime there is a mutation
in a public good gene.

151
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,030
So there have been tested this idea in
cell culture and then they have been

152
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,750
promising, but tests that in
Vivo have not yet been done.

153
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,930
So to summarize,
resistance to chemotherapy,

154
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,160
just like resistance to
antibiotics evolves rapidly.

155
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Life lifespan in cancer patients could
be extended with alternative therapies.

156
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,660
Immunotherapy shows a lot of promise.

157
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,140
It's not cheap and that has
implications for health policy.

158
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,450
Immunotherapies is rather expensive,

159
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,130
but it has been effective in some
previously untreatable cancers.

160
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Adaptive therapy does work in mice
and in is now being tested in clinical

161
00:10:57,201 --> 00:11:00,830
trials. So we can see in the
coming years where that goes.

162
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,110
Targeting public goods, such as
growth factors, shows promise,

163
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,290
but it does need additional tests.
It's a good idea.

164
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,060
But at this point is preliminary.
