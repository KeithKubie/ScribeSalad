00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is that all three of these are reasons to repeat measurements--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
take more than one measurement.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, just by itself taking repeated measurements won't solve all these problems.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you have a systematic error, then repeating them will just repeat

00:00:12.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the same systematic error, but they certainly are required, although we may need more.
