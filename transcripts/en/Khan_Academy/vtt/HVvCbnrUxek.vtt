00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:01.671
- [Instructor] What we
have written here are two

00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:05.587
of the most useful derivatives
to know in calculus.

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:07.722
If you know that the
derivative of sine of x

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:09.683
with respect to x is cosine of x

00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:11.521
and the derivative of cosine of x

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:14.824
with respect to x is negative sine of x,

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:17.359
that can empower you to do many more,

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.051
far more complicated derivatives.

00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:21.380
But what we're going to do in this video

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.859
is dig a little bit deeper

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.001
and actually prove this first derivative.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.319
I'm not gonna prove the second one.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.671
You can actually use it,

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.357
using the information we're
going to do in this one,

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:34.207
but it's just to make you feel good that

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:35.917
someone's just not making this up,

00:00:35.917 --> 00:00:37.772
that there is a little bit of mathematical

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:39.534
rigor behind it all.

00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:41.277
So let's try to calculate it.

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:46.030
So the derivative with
respect to x of sine of x,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.115
by definition, this is
going to be the limit

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.532
as delta x approaches zero

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:54.028
of sine

00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:55.028
of x plus

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:57.456
delta x minus

00:00:58.396 --> 00:00:59.229
sine of x,

00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:02.219
all of that over delta,

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:05.487
all of that over delta x.

00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:09.046
This is really just the slope
of the line between the point

00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:12.650
x comma sine of x and x plus delta x

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.118
comma sine of x plus delta x.

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:19.080
So how can we evaluate this?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.561
Well, we can rewrite
sine of x plus delta x

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:26.489
using our angle addition formulas

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.181
that we learned during
our trig identities.

00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:31.440
So this is going to be the same thing

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.139
as the limit

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.639
as delta x approaches zero.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.747
I'll write, rewrite this using
our trig identity as cosine,

00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:50.364
as cosine

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.995
of x

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:53.828
times sine

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.862
of delta x

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:57.907
plus sine

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:00.551
of x

00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:02.177
times cosine

00:02:02.177 --> 00:02:03.697
of delta x.

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:07.000
And then we're going to
subtract this sine of x up here

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.333
minus sine of x,

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:11.016
all of that over,

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.385
let me see if I can draw a
relatively straight line,

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:14.718
all of that over

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:17.308
delta x.

00:02:17.308 --> 00:02:21.269
So this can be rewritten
as being equal to the limit

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.019
as delta x approaches zero of,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.390
let me write this part in red,

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:32.550
so that would be cosine of x, sine

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:35.268
of delta x,

00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:37.351
all of that over delta x.

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.280
And then that's going to be plus,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.780
I'll do all of this in orange,

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:45.057
all I'm doing is

00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:47.578
I have the sum of things
up here divided by delta x,

00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:51.816
I'm just breaking it up
a little bit, plus sine

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.649
of x,

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.892
cosine of delta x

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:56.225
minus sine of x,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.530
all of that over delta x.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.954
And remember, I'm taking the limit

00:03:01.954 --> 00:03:04.033
of this entire expression.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.357
Well, the limit of a sum is
equal to the sum of the limits.

00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:10.056
So this is going to be equal to,

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.943
I'll do this first part in red,

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:13.040
the limit

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.790
as delta x approaches zero of,

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:20.344
let's see I can rewrite
this as cosine of x

00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:22.190
times sine

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.957
of delta x

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:25.957
over delta x

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.103
plus

00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:30.521
the limit

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.710
as delta x approaches zero

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.230
of, and let's see I can
factor out a sine of x here.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.145
So it's times

00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:40.438
sine

00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:41.739
of x.

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:42.979
I factor that out,

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.824
and I'll be left with a cosine

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:48.645
of delta x minus one,

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.764
all of that over

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:51.597
delta x.

00:03:52.724 --> 00:03:54.082
So that's this limit.

00:03:54.082 --> 00:03:56.959
And let's see if I can
simplify this even more.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.312
Let me scroll down a bit.

00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:02.028
So this left-hand
expression I can rewrite.

00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:04.167
This cosine of x has nothing to do with

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:06.067
the limit as delta x approaches zero,

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:08.760
so we can actually take
that outside of the limit.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.436
So we have the cosine of x times the limit

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:15.386
as delta x approaches zero

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:16.886
of sine of delta x

00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:19.526
over delta x.

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:22.790
And now we need to add this thing,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.234
and let's see how I could write this.

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:26.254
So I have a sine of x here.

00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:28.109
But actually, let me rewrite
this a little bit differently.

00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:30.383
Cosine of delta x minus one,

00:04:30.383 --> 00:04:34.550
that's the same thing as
one minus cosine of delta x

00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:37.937
times negative one.

00:04:37.937 --> 00:04:40.546
And so you have a sine of
x times a negative one.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:43.937
And since the delta x has
nothing to do with the sine of x,

00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:46.798
let me take that out, the
negative and the sine of x.

00:04:46.798 --> 00:04:48.965
So we have minus sine of x

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:51.993
times the limit

00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:55.094
as delta x approaches zero of,

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:59.961
what we have left over is
one minus cosine of delta x

00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:01.146
over

00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:01.979
delta x.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.216
Now, I'm not gonna do it in this video.

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:06.575
In other videos, we will
actually do the proof.

00:05:06.575 --> 00:05:08.059
But in other videos we have shown,

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:09.617
using the squeeze theorem,

00:05:09.617 --> 00:05:11.730
or sometimes known as
the sandwich theorem,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.914
that the limit is delta x approaches zero

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.002
of sine of delta x over delta x,

00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:18.144
that this is equal to one.

00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:19.602
And we also show in another video,

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:21.121
and that's based on the idea

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.334
that this limit is equal to one,

00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:27.927
that this limit right over
here is equal to zero.

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:30.194
And so what we are then left with,

00:05:30.194 --> 00:05:31.979
and I encourage you to watch the videos

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.670
that prove this and this,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.247
although these are really useful limits

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:37.102
to know in general in calculus,

00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:39.511
that what you're gonna be
left with is just cosine of x

00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:41.925
times one minus sine of x times zero.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.773
Well, all of this is just gonna go away,

00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:44.841
and you're gonna have,

00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:48.574
that is going to be equal to cosine of x.

00:05:48.574 --> 00:05:49.991
And you are done.
