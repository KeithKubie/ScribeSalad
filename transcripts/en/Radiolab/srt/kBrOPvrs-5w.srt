1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,930
You're listening to
radiolab, I'm Jad Abumrad,

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,310
this is Radiolab and I am Robert Krulwich
and let's begin today with something

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:12,780
deceptively familiar. Fireflies are
something that we all been of those kids,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,270
right? Catching them in the backyard,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,700
putting them in a jar and watching them
glow so we don't tend to think of them

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:21,870
as anything. All that mysterious.
Well, they do one thing very nicely,

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,370
which is flash on and off.
That's all fireflies do flash,

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,430
but what interests Steve Strogatz,

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,100
a mathematician at Cornell University
is that there are places in the world in

10
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:35,460
not here, but in in Southeast
Asia, in Malaysia or Thailand,

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,730
where fireflies don't just flash
randomly like we're used to.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,040
They somehow flashed together.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,120
There are enormous congregations of
fireflies along riverbanks. How many,

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,190
it could be tens of thousands,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,970
tree after tree extending for
literally miles along the rivers,

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,470
all flashing in sync like a Christmas
tree rows and rows of Christmas trees all

17
00:00:55,471 --> 00:01:00,360
wired together going off and it's one
of the most hypnotic and spellbinding

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,740
spectacles in nature because you have
to keep in mind it is absolutely silent.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,100
I can picture it. There's
a riverbank in Thailand,

20
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:12,390
in the remote part of the jungle. You're
in a canoe slipping down the river.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,740
There's no sound of anything,
maybe the occasional, you know,

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,100
exotic jungle bird or something and
you're looking and you just see route

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,510
with thousands of Mites on
and then off, all in sync.

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:36,890
[inaudible]

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,890
imagine all the cheese as far as you
can see are all brilliantly lit and then

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,780
totally dark, brilliantly
lit, total darkness,

27
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,770
all of them in sync. Yeah, and no
Wessler had ever seen this site.

28
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:53,960
There was folklore, there's
the stories about it,

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,830
but nobody had gone in and
photographed and captured samples.

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,720
Well not until 1965 and this was
done by John Bark. John Bark,

31
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,130
the see one of the great
researchers or his other records.

32
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,890
I'm 92 buck and his wife Elizabeth,

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,490
mass buck went to Thailand and
captured bags full of mail.

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,490
Firefly catched. We checked
them, shaking the branches,

35
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,500
firefly rained out and brought them back
to their hotel room and we turned off

36
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,334
the lights.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,710
We turned them loose and saw that the
fireflies flittered around on the walls

38
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:33,690
and ceiling flew back and
forth flashing random.

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,150
He Elizabeth layer on the floor
of the room. I was just tired.

40
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,230
John stayed away and he was the one who
saw within a few minutes little groups

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
duos and trios formed and after a while
fourth one would join in a closer,

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,520
closer together. Then finally
they were synchronized.

43
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,040
The whole room was blinking in perfect
harmony. He was excited. The next they

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,100
told me outlet.

45
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,440
20 years later John Buck is still asking
this question, Oh what is going on?

46
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,190
Because no one knows. There are literally
10 theories. What seems to be clear,

47
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,340
so Steve is there is no one
firefly that makes it all happen.

48
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,220
It just happens on its own order,

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,290
materializes out of nothing and that
hasn't puzzled how can order come out of

50
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,340
out of disorder and this is what the
creation has loved to talk about and it's

51
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,520
because they don't understand and
neither do we this, this is the big,

52
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,510
big mystery of science.

53
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,660
I think bigger than plaque holes are
bigger than super strings. I mean,

54
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,170
science has had hundreds of years of
success since the time of Galileo and

55
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:41,110
Newton from reductionism, from
looking at the smallest parts,

56
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,990
whether they're jeans or
Adam's, whatever. That's great.

57
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,140
We need to understand the
individuals, but that's not enough.

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,110
Obviously we're not just talking about
fireflies anymore. Today on Radiolab,

59
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,130
we will do as Steve Urges and step away
from the individual to find mystery,

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,830
beauty and order in the
group, not fireflies.

61
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,070
They are groups of city dwellers. Groups
have Internet, surfers, stock traders,

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,650
even the group of neurons
that are inside your head.

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,910
This is a science called
emergence. So let's begin.

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,120
In the beginning, God created

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,170
heaven and earth. That's the King
James Bible. That's how it starts.

66
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,930
The ultimate expression of the boss,

67
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:27,780
God telling everything else what to
be, how to be. It's a top down kind of

68
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,770
what about midway through the
Bible contains another passage,

69
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,080
more of a bottom up
thing from King Solomon,

70
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,990
the wisest of the kings where
he says, look to the ants.

71
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,730
Consider her ways and be wise. Yes.

72
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,170
So we start in California,

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,860
the office of an ant
expert. I'm Deborah Gordon,

74
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,590
professor of biology at Stanford.

75
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,230
Hi Deborah Gordon has been
studying ants for over two decades.

76
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,370
It's because such mindless individuals
collectively can do so much that I'm

77
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,190
interested in.

78
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,060
His might say she's the reigning ant
Queen as long as you bring up the reigning

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
part. When we went there
I thought, well what's,

80
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,670
she has a lot of answers but I wanted to
see what the Boston looked like so she

81
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,980
led us to our lab and going
into the secret and place

82
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,610
where we found to our disappointment that
she keeps the ants and big Tupperware

83
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,420
container.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,420
This is the foraging area of a colony
that's stuck living in the lab instead of

85
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:33,331
out in the desert where it would probably
rather be and plastic box with plastic

86
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:36,160
around it and little bits of sand on it.

87
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,410
That's right and so I'm
going to take off the top.

88
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,660
Maybe we can see the queen better, but
like this, I've never seen it before.

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,910
When I'm looking for the clean
one. What am I looking for?

90
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,240
Just the ant and the center of the
biggest crunch of other hand. Well,

91
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,040
usually there are a lot
of other ants around her.

92
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,930
She doesn't look much
different, but she's bigger.

93
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,480
Does the ants know that she's special?

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,920
I think the ants know
that she's the queen.

95
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,270
Okay,

96
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,680
and does it, what does that mean? Well,

97
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,960
the queen in the way we
think about clicks. Yeah.

98
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,890
I mean that they know grows mommy
or not even? I don't think so. No.

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,720
Uh,

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,530
I don't think they know anybody. Has
Anybody. And remember she's not in charge.

101
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,060
She's not telling anybody what to do.
Wait a second. Wait a second. Yeah.

102
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,700
This is different than
I had actually imagined.

103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,470
I thought that Queens gave command.
Like, you know an Alice in wonderland.

104
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,750
Bob, what? Bare hands kind of thing,

105
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,180
da. She says no, she's just a big hand
that lays the eggs. That's it. That's it.

106
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,410
Every year there's a meeting flight
and all of the colonies send out their

107
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:48,700
virgin queens who have wings and nails
who also have wings and they all go to

108
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:53,380
one place and they gather and they meet
and the newly mated queens fly off and

109
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:57,040
start new colonies. That's how it
starts. Queen scanner make babies,

110
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,550
but that's all

111
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,700
they do. They're just
the colonies, ovaries.

112
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,500
They don't sit on a throne and decree
anything nor are their generals or even

113
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,410
bosses. The colony somehow
gets by without any of that,

114
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,880
which is especially hard to believe
when you watch these ants. Ooh,

115
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:16,510
tell us what's happening here. This
is [inaudible] carrying a dead hat.

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I remember there was this one little EDBD
and carrying a big fat dead and on her

117
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:24,490
back and look at this.
She seems to be gradually,

118
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:28,660
although with some difficulty
living twice my elbow.

119
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,870
Then she dropped it. Then she picked
it up again and she dropped it.

120
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,720
You that up again. Now she's
turning in the other direction.

121
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,820
All the while carrying this heavy corpse.

122
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,900
She made like it back and forth like
that for hours sometimes can leave some

123
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,000
objects we'll get in there that they
can't all carry and they can spend months

124
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,250
tagging it one way and
tagging it the other way.

125
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,330
Month tugging back and forth on either
side of one seed. It wasn't a seed,

126
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:56,710
it was a little twig. One of them is
thinking this way and I was thinking, oh,

127
00:07:56,711 --> 00:08:00,370
this way, going this way, this way.
And that's all that's going on. Well,

128
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:02,740
I don't know what they're thinking.
Right. I know. I know that a fan,

129
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,810
one of them is pulling one way because
the stick feels like something that needs

130
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:10,310
to be pulled and the
other also feels right.

131
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,380
The stick needs to be
pulled and they just pull.

132
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,720
It must be frustrating watching
these mindless exchanges. It is.

133
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:22,670
It can be very frustrating. I don't
have very much empathy for apps.

134
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,390
They're so, um, the
more you watch the ants,

135
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,750
the more weird it seems, the
way they never get discouraged.

136
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,860
They don't care if they do something well.

137
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,130
Um, it's very alien. I
think she hates them.

138
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,770
Not really because here's the thing.
You can make an argument that,

139
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,280
so the most successful
species on the planet,

140
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,020
they thrive in places that are
too hot for us to dry for us.

141
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:55,050
Even too cold for us. They
outnumber us by a factor,

142
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,090
many thousand in pure evolutionary
math terms. They're winning,

143
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,813
which intrigues her

144
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,330
and also forces you to think
about them differently.

145
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,930
I think about what the colony is doing
and then I tried to think how it would

146
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:13,800
work. If you do it like that,
she says answer actually amazing,

147
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,930
but you have to ignore the
individual individually.

148
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:19,560
They're totally incompetent and
keep your focus big as colonies.

149
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,200
They do great things. It's
kind of a constant whiplash,

150
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,130
zoom in stupid two and spoil a
twig back and forth for months.

151
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,850
You zoom out smart. I'm
impressed that it works at all.

152
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,300
It's somewhere between the zooming in
and zooming out and bizarre intelligence

153
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,890
appears almost like a phantom.

154
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,820
I think the most intelligent thing I've
ever seen harvester ants do is to build

155
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:42,450
a little turret around
the opening of the nest,

156
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,780
just as the summer monsoons are gathering
and then when it rains and floods,

157
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,390
it's raised up so that
the water doesn't go in.

158
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,620
So when I see the first few ads coming
out with their little twigs and I look up

159
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:58,980
in the sky and I see a few clouds in
the distance and I realized that there's

160
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,340
some link between the change in the
barometric pressure or something,

161
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:06,570
and it really is a very tidy and
effective little construction.

162
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,950
And what else do ans do? Well, let
me just count them for you. Shall I?

163
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,650
Aunts farm, they have livestock,
aunts make garden pants,

164
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,690
organize wars, have genitals and
soldiers and things take slaves.

165
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,770
There's the young man's tunnel involved.

166
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,710
Incredibly good and
sophisticated climate control.

167
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:29,550
You can start from two opposite directions
and meet precisely midway answer

168
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,720
engineered hats,

169
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,530
orchestrate massive public work
projects that puts FTRs new deal.

170
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,290
I'm talking about Tennessee Valley
Authority from your homes. Hey,

171
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,900
that's as nothing compared
to what hands could do.

172
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,023
Alright.

173
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,240
Hello, which raises the question
at the center of this program,

174
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:55,241
which is how do so many very stupid
creatures with no boss add up to be so

175
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,354
smart?

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,590
The scientist who first really tackled
this idea with some success in the mid

177
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:05,550
1950s was e o Wilson from
Harvard University because
he made one of the great

178
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,050
discoveries in all the
science of communication.

179
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,950
Certainly we know that creatures
make noises to each other,

180
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:13,530
sometimes touch each other,
but he figured out pheromones.

181
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,680
Pheromones are the key to understand the
communication of the vast majority of

182
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,690
animals species. We didn't know
it then. It's a neat story.

183
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:24,630
He told me that a few years back up
at 92nd street y in New York City.

184
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,030
One day I shut out, I was

185
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,820
culturing fire ranch then in the
laboratory at Harvard and I said,

186
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

187
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,190
And the way I did it was to, uh,

188
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,010
dissect these tiny, tiny, it's very
difficult to do, but I just checked them.

189
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,970
And under magnification I can
see that it's sticking out,

190
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,050
sting and dragging the Stinger.
Something's coming out of that sting.

191
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,670
Kind of like a fountain pen or
something's too bit like that. Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,960
So a I proceed to, um, believe me, folks,

193
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,170
this was the way science because
I mean it really is simple minded.

194
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,310
It's only later when you're doing
the technical paper, you know,

195
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,640
when you're producing the mathematical
models and that it looks tough.

196
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,970
It's really, this is the way
you're thinking when you're
doing shots. So I said,

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,970
I'm going to find out what
the organs are inside this.

198
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,040
And so what I did was
to do anatomy and then,

199
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:21,671
uh, you know,

200
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:25,390
just the sect that I knew approximately
what the different glands were in

201
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,520
showing you snipped off the part where
the glands were you suited or while you

202
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:33,790
just distract open. Oh, you
opened it. Right. You know, and,

203
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,200
and just the way you would any animal
alerts exceedingly difficult when it's

204
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:43,690
about the size of greater salt.
That's the tough part. But anyway,

205
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,430
I took out the various organs one after
the other and I made a preparation and I

206
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,350
made an artificial trail,

207
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,260
smeared out one Oregon
after another no effect. Oh,

208
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,710
so their aunts over here and you're
drawing lines, right? Oh, gut stuff.

209
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,340
I guess basically what it is,
Yo Justin or different organs.

210
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:08,341
I've watched each one in churn and then
smeared it out and finally I came to a

211
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:12,160
little finger shaped organ,
which we didn't know.

212
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:15,670
The function of it is just a tiny little
thing talk down there and I mirrored

213
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:19,180
that out and incredible. It wasn't,

214
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,490
I didn't have to tell
them to follow that trail.

215
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:24,100
They exploded out of the nest
running along that thing.

216
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,840
I started playing around with this. It
was sure effective for demonstrations.

217
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,980
I would write my name,

218
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,790
a column of 102 hundred three a hundred
ads would come pouring out back and

219
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,920
forth and they'd actually
write my name and I am

220
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,090
so that was the first clue. Smell.
Ants may not take orders from above,

221
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,640
but they can exchange information. See
this one with the abdomen bent under?

222
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,760
Yeah. That one is somehow reacted to us.

223
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,030
Oh really strange smells that we're
making that could Deborah Gordon's lab.

224
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,110
As we watch the colony,

225
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,260
one of the aunts even stopped
what it was doing to smell us.

226
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,510
When they wave their antennae in the air,

227
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:15,511
they're looking around because their
antennae or their periscopes sounds simple

228
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,010
enough. Ants follow scent
trails sorta like dogs.

229
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,100
But if you stare at them long enough,

230
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,460
you will see that when these
ants get together, lots of them,

231
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,710
these simple sniffing talents,

232
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,700
they have add up to solve
pretty amazing problems.

233
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,200
Here's a forage or coming back. What's
it in her mouth? It's a seed like this.

234
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:41,260
Suppose there are a bunch of forged your
ANZ in one part of town and something

235
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:43,990
good to eat in another part of
town. Like if there's a picnic,

236
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,900
how does the colony get
more ants to your picnic?

237
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,050
They're blind and virtually
brainless. So how do they do it?

238
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,280
That's the question.
How they do it. Hello,

239
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,080
I'm ABCDF G with that question in mind.
We visited up Princeton biologist,

240
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,360
Ian Kusan. This one
here? Yeah. What is this?

241
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,220
Now you pops open his laptop to
show us a beautiful map he's made.

242
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,490
So here on the on the screen you can see
the individual paths coded by color and

243
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,570
ant map.

244
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,810
It's as if you gave a few hundred aunts
a paintbrush and then let them wander

245
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:12,770
over on canvas.

246
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,500
On the computer has software which
tracks the motion of each of these

247
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,740
individuals. The resulting picture
is vintage Jackson Pollock,

248
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,120
lots and lots and lots of layers of
squiggly lines so you can put the food in

249
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,990
here. For example,

250
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,320
I've got droplets of sugar water here
that the ans love the feed on the end

251
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,840
points to a splotch of white
in the upper right hand corner.

252
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,320
Then flips in the next image
jumping forward in time.

253
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,630
What what I've actually shown with this
is that the ants have begun forming a

254
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:43,620
chemical trail and you can actually
show how they've laid a trail to this,

255
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:44,870
this, this good food source.

256
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,090
This is the type of image that makes
you want to stare at static on your TV

257
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:51,760
screen and look for patterns.
It's downright eerie.

258
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,490
One minute the screen is a mass chaos
of squiggles overlapping no patterns at

259
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:58,180
all.

260
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,180
The next is if by magic the squiggles
of snap together to form a vein leading

261
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:06,220
directly to the sugar.
It happens every time.

262
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,220
And what's weirder says Ian
is every time it happens,

263
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,590
it happens by accident error. Really.

264
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:14,500
I mean this is really what we're talking
about is these ants probably just made

265
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:19,120
a mistake. Error is
architecture. Imagine 500 answer,

266
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:24,121
exploring a space number 411 finds the
sugar completely by accident except it's

267
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:30,190
not an accident because the aunt
has left a sent trail in there.

268
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:34,660
500 other answers, surely one other will
come along and make the same mistake.

269
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,570
Suddenly you've got two chemical
trails on top of each other,

270
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,160
double e hot tracking a third
which makes the trail triple hot,

271
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,310
attracting five more,

272
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:46,240
which makes it [inaudible] hot and soon
what you've got as a blazing pheromone

273
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:47,950
highway of bumper to bumper and

274
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,050
[inaudible]

275
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,970
none. I'm like mid town during rush hour.

276
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,753
[inaudible]

277
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,770
when I first saw the ants, uh, in person,

278
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,640
one of the first thoughts I had was
this looks like a small little city.

279
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,620
Steven Johnson noticed this connection
and wrote about it in a book called

280
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:12,030
emergence. The connected lives of
ants, brains, cities and software.

281
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,400
A lot of what the ants do is positive
feedback loops where they lay down a kind

282
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:21,030
of pheromone chemical signal to recruit
other ants to do something that they're

283
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:24,450
working on and those ants lay
down more of the same signal can.

284
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,750
So very quickly you can get a whole bunch
of ants working on a single problem.

285
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,190
That's the similar effect that you get
in a way that city neighborhoods form

286
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,390
accidents that always happen.

287
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,500
That is how ants find food and he
says how cities find their shape.

288
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,080
It gets to what I said
was called the swirl

289
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,770
that comes with this

290
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,550
gun. When you're walking down the
sidewalk going from point x to point y,

291
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:50,280
you're going from subway
back to your house

292
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,430
and you pass by completely
accidentally point Z,

293
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:54,990
which is a new boutique
or a new restaurant,

294
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,030
something that catches
your eye and you swerve.

295
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,310
You see this thing you've never
seen before and you're like, hey,

296
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,144
I want to check that out.

297
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,890
The whole business in a sense of sidewalks
and thriving urban centers revolves

298
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:09,891
around the idea that somebody coming to
see boutique a is going to be swerving

299
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:13,650
into Boutique B or Boutique c just because
they're near each other and because

300
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:14,550
they're kind of window shopping.

301
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,280
What a neat idea. Yeah. Right?
You wake up thinking, well,

302
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,630
here's what I'm going to do in the city.

303
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:23,400
I'm going to walk my daughter to school.

304
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,670
I'm going to go to the new standard
by a paper, and then on your way,

305
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:30,870
something that you didn't expect,
something new catches your eye.

306
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,770
Begonias I will always want that. And
Sally, that's the big Onia she wants,

307
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,650
right? So you swerve, which
begins as an accident,

308
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,860
but all these kind of local unplanned
decisions all add up into this larger

309
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,910
macro unit that does have a distinct
personality and that crucially can

310
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,580
last for hundreds of years,

311
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,040
which does make you wonder because
the personalities of cities,

312
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,701
we know about that.

313
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,670
You know how come there are distinct
neighborhoods for rich people?

314
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,760
There are neighborhoods in
some cities for artists, slums.

315
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,040
Consider a 28th street in [inaudible]

316
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,960
today in the flower market
we have hydrangeas and uh,

317
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,590
some flowers from Florida. How many
flowers, doors are on this block?

318
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,480
If I had to guess, I'd probably say about
25 there are flower stores all around.

319
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,220
It's like a Walmart for flowers in a week.

320
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,420
How did this begin?

321
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,950
Let's propose that someone for some reason
came here and set up the flower shop,

322
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,530
which picked up a few customers.
So then a second flower merchant.

323
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,840
Since he's getting the traffic,
maybe if I opened a store,

324
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,400
like the head of he is on the block,

325
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,900
maybe I'll be able to pull some people
away from him having swerve into my

326
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:39,080
store. Location, location, location,
and let's say that gets more traffic.

327
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:41,270
You've got to be with the traffic,
so then you get the third store.

328
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,600
That works too. You could sell pencils
that look like ducks and nothing else,

329
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,130
and if you're writing them all
time square, you know what?

330
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,970
You'll probably make money. That's
the key. Traffic is everything.

331
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,530
Once a neighborhood becomes the place
for duck shape pencils or the place for

332
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:59,000
flowers, what began as an accident
then becomes a neighborhood. So much.

333
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:02,780
So if I blindfolded a flower salesman
and dropped him onto a hundred blocks,

334
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:05,970
would he know which one was 28th
street? Oh, absolutely. Yes. Shit.

335
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,020
Why have I just died now my street
man, I just smelled the flower.

336
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,390
Highest Sense. You just build the highest
as soon as you walk in there. I mean,

337
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,590
of course I, I've, ah, it's all under
the heading. Trucks. Rephrase, screaming,

338
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:19,790
yelling. I mean please.

339
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,370
It's a quasi mystical concept.

340
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:29,250
I really do think of it when you think
about a neighborhood in a great city,

341
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,230
whether it's New York and the West village
or Paris in the Latin quarter of the

342
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,590
middle class, you know, ask the question
like, who created this neighborhood,

343
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,360
right? Who created the things
we love about this neighborhood?

344
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,830
Who creates that kind of life force?

345
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,500
And the answer is everybody
and nobody at the same time.

346
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,360
Okay. [inaudible]

347
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,580
so that brings us again to the
central mystery of this hour.

348
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,770
We're studying here. The
science of emergence,

349
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:57,190
which asks where does
organization come from?

350
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,610
How do you get a neighborhood,
a district or a city?

351
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,150
How do you get the complexity of an ant
colony if there's no leader and everyone

352
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,110
in town is stupid? Steve,

353
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,240
Steve Johnson proposes that a city is
the emergent quality of the swerve to

354
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,460
series of accidents, you know
is always going to happen.

355
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,950
You multiply the swerves,
you get a neighborhood.

356
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,720
Debra Gordon is arguing that if you look
very closely at the aunts and you watch

357
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:24,210
them smelling and you
multiply their smells,

358
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,500
then you get the complexity of an
IED colony but buried in the system.

359
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:33,120
Both of them say is a rule, a sense
of direction, but how do you see that?

360
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,790
That's the wrong question and
that's what's so uncomfortable.

361
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,280
The instructions aren't anywhere.

362
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,340
The instructions come out of the way
that the colony lives and behaves.

363
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,600
That's hard. It is hard. If
you had one aunt on its own,

364
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:55,601
you couldn't take it apart and find the
substance that would make it behave in a

365
00:21:56,601 --> 00:22:01,420
certain way. Did you see how hard
that is? Yes. I want to know.

366
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:06,330
So when you asked her to find the rule,
yeah. So when you did any individually,

367
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,060
you see it when all the ants get
together, but where is it? Well,

368
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,780
where is the thought in your
brain? Is it in a neuron?

369
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,350
Does each neuron have a
little piece of the thought?

370
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,230
If you took your neuron out
and lay it on the table,

371
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,550
could you see the little tiny bit of
the thought that's in that neuron? No,

372
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,670
it's not in the neuron. It's in the way
the neurons interact with each other.

373
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,080
[inaudible]

374
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,550
think about a syrup painting.

375
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,910
That one where they're all on the banks
of the Cen River. Yep. You're the one,

376
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,270
if you look at it up close,
all you see is dots, right?

377
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,050
You pull back and the picture emerges
with all the ladies in their parents'

378
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,150
cells. But the question
with these systems,

379
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:49,770
the big question is whether there is
a syrup to make the dots, the paint,

380
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:53,400
the picture, or if somehow the
painting just materializes on its own.

381
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,020
Uh, well, you know, that I have an
opinion about this, but it's not a,

382
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,850
it's not a sciencey opinion. Uh,

383
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,600
I think it's not just fascinating that
there are these hidden patterns and

384
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:09,160
hidden rules.

385
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,640
I think it's just going
to change the whole tone.

386
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,990
I think it's kind of holy and I don't
have to go scientific evidence because

387
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,210
there's no science behind
this. It's just an instinct.

388
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,870
I think when you look at the way ants
work or the way it's shot painting images

389
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:27,760
before your eyes, you're
looking at an author,

390
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,910
see, see, when you say that, all the
air just gets let out of the balloon.

391
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,990
For me, it's like the magic is gone. We

392
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,490
really can. I think so. Let's
see what you're left with.

393
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,850
Then everything that you see when you
wake up in the morning is beautiful and we

394
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:46,100
all agree that it's beautiful.
Is Empty of purpose.

395
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,920
Is that okay with you? Yeah.

396
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,740
In a way it makes it even more
mysterious to be alive in any case,

397
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,460
author or not.

398
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,940
There's really good reason why
these systems would not centralize,

399
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,290
put all their eggs into one basket,
one supreme being. Because if they did,

400
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,310
they'd be vulnerable. Case in point,

401
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:09,560
this story from producer
Laura Star Chesky,

402
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,240
I'll walk you over toward
the beehives, not about ants.

403
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,270
So we're sort of in their flight zone,

404
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:20,271
but don't worry bees and we'll
just see if we have any luck here.

405
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,460
She met up recently with a
beekeeper named John Clayton.

406
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,040
It's always hit and miss trying
to find a queen, that's for sure.

407
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,970
She's right there. Get off me. Thank you.

408
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,270
One of the things that beekeepers really
like to do is raise their own queens.

409
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,160
All you need to do is take a frame out
of an existing hive that has egg cells on

410
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:50,161
it and a bunch of worker bees and put it
in its very own box and they'll realize

411
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:55,150
that they don't have a queen and they'll
pull an egg or pull larva and start

412
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:55,541
feeding it.

413
00:24:55,541 --> 00:25:00,220
The Royal Jelly make the peanut shape
Queen Cell and 16 days later you got a

414
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:05,020
brand new queen. Well, one time I uh,

415
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,820
I made a brand new,
Kwame was my first queen.

416
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:11,821
I was probably 17 years old at the time
and I had it out on my back porch and I

417
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:14,290
knew it come day three,
she goes out to mate.

418
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,670
So I'm sitting there and here it sure
enough comes to queen out the entrance and

419
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:20,770
she flies off and she takes off and,

420
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,490
and I'm watching and I'm watching the
whole meeting process take place and it

421
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:25,420
takes place in flight.

422
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,420
She made a inflight with about 10
drones and the drones die after mating.

423
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:34,570
They come crash into the ground dying
and the queen goes back to the hive.

424
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,130
And while she started coming back to the
hive and then I realized I had a piece

425
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:43,420
of sticky fly tape hanging up on the
back porch and she flew right into it and

426
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,760
there's my queen all stuck to
the fly tape like this, you know,

427
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,870
I said there's my first queen and I
killed the poor thing cause there was

428
00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:52,900
nothing I could do to save it.
Yeah, it was just a horrible story.

429
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:56,110
So it's one of those things you
learn from experience, you know,

430
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,200
but it was a sad moment because
they a queens a special thing.

431
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,843
Just gonna chat there.

432
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,230
Thanks to producer Laura Starecheski
and beekeeper, John Clayton

433
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,950
coming up the science of how a trillion
leaderless neurons in your head come

434
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:18,700
together and music fashion to sing the
song of the thought you are thinking

435
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:22,990
right now, which if you're a caffeine
addict like me, just might be

436
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,430
[inaudible].

437
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,190
I'm Janet, I'm Ron Robert Krulwich
and I will continue in a moment.

438
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,610
All right, now your new assignments are,

439
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,810
who's going to be read anyway?

440
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,160
Who's going

441
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,993
to be round?

442
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,461
Hi,

443
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:50,461
this is Steve Stroke at radio lab is
funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan

444
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,330
Foundation and the National
Science Foundation.

445
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,230
Radiolab is produced by Wny C and
distributed by MPR and this message,

446
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,150
this is Radiolab. I'm chat up with rod
here with Robert Krulwich. Say Hello.

447
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,593
Thank you.

448
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,510
This hour we're trying on a way of looking
at the world that has nothing to do

449
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:16,400
with presidents or queens or mayors and
everything to do with ants and sciences

450
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,510
is an idea called emergence. How many,

451
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:22,470
many stupid things can add up to something
very smart like a colony or in our

452
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:24,450
case a city. Now speaking of us,

453
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,410
it is often and was often assumed
that leaderless snus is a bad thing,

454
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,730
a very dangerous thing.

455
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,160
And this was especially the
case in the late 19th century,

456
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,170
early 20th which is our next stop.

457
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,240
It was a time when throughout Europe
hostile irrational crowds were everywhere

458
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,990
in the streets.

459
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,990
You really see this enormous backlash
in large part in reaction to the rise of

460
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:48,240
democracy. This is James
Scher Wiki author of the book,

461
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,600
the wisdom of crowds and he's talking
about the people on the other end of the

462
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,760
riots, the intellectual elite.

463
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,150
Look at people like Thomas Carlisle
who started the Bon of France.

464
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,610
Nicha obviously for all these people,

465
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,170
crowds were really the epitome
of irrationality and stupidity

466
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,500
[inaudible]

467
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,500
but that was about to change and he tells
this story of a guy named Sir Francis

468
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,700
Galton. Yeah, I'm sure Francis Gordon,

469
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:18,640
who is this sort of famous British
scientist and is actually a most famous

470
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,420
cause. He was the founder of what we now
know as eugenics. Oh, is that so, yeah.

471
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,890
He's sort of a notorious elitist and a,

472
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,140
what's funny is that this is a story
about him finding the opposite of,

473
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,410
of his basic assumptions.

474
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,460
A to be true story goes on a nice
fall day in 1906 Sir Francis Galton,

475
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,590
a guy who truly believed that only the
better classes should be allowed to vote

476
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,450
rule or even have children. He decides
to spend the day in the country.

477
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,080
Ladies and gentlemen, step right this way.

478
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,800
[inaudible] county fair
right over here. Now,

479
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,480
this is going to be quite an
experience for you young man.

480
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,480
The thing that caught Golden's attention
that day was a competition involving

481
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,560
and ox.

482
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,670
I mean, they're, they're on this way.

483
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,670
You might want to avoid that unfortunate
plot right there. I didn't like. Yeah.

484
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,500
Know. What I want you to do, please,

485
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,270
is I want you to examine this very
fat ox [inaudible] touch the OP.

486
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,160
What we do is we look at the
ox and we weigh it in our mind.

487
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,300
[inaudible] you know, the group
was, was was a really diverse crowd.

488
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,310
Family members, local merchants,

489
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,510
most of whom were not experts at
all in Wayne Oxen, young lady.

490
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,190
You know how to weigh a package, don't you

491
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,000
think you can weigh a package? Then you
can weigh an ox. Here's how you do it.

492
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,360
You take a, I don't know,

493
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,660
a couple of packages and put
them in your head and say, well,

494
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:43,400
this ox seems to be about 70 packages
to multiply the weight of a package by

495
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,140
side.

496
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,000
They paid six pants and
they would, you know,

497
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,630
make their guests in the people that
had the best guesses, woodwind prizes,

498
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,350
large cash prize.

499
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,650
So quite a few people. Yes,

500
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,640
there's something like 800 people close
to 800 and while none of those 800 or so

501
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:02,230
people guessed the exact weight of the
ox prizes were awarded, people went home.

502
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,600
But the ever inquisitive, Sir Francis
Hung around after the contest was over.

503
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,670
Excuse me, golden went up
to the organizers. Wow.

504
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,590
Would you mind [inaudible] who said,

505
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:15,580
can I have the guesses if I take
possession of all 787 ticket?

506
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,260
You know the slips they had written the
guesses on. Oh, right. You can have in,

507
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:21,130
I suppose I don't see anything
wrong with that, but why?

508
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,170
Because I'm wondering something

509
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,220
Caesar. Francis figured these
common people wouldn't have a clue.

510
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,380
Most of them were overwhelmingly
uninformed and an expert
in bovine matters and

511
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,130
he just assumed that if you added up a
lot of uninformed on expert individual

512
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:40,510
opinions, you'd get a very
uninformed, an expert group opinion.

513
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,340
That's what he was counting on.

514
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,890
One of the things he did was he
just calculated the average gap.

515
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,420
That is the mid point, the me of all the
guesses. He figured they'd be way off,

516
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,851
but when he did that,

517
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:58,720
it turned out that collectively the
citizens of Plymouth said the ox weighed

518
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,570
1,187 pounds,

519
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,830
101,187 pounds, hope a cure, which was

520
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,830
astonishingly close.

521
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,560
A oxys actual weight was 1,188 pounds.

522
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,560
They're a pound off.

523
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,610
They were basically perfect and they
were actually better than any single

524
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:24,430
individual in the group.
Colton was stunned.

525
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,760
This went against everything
he knew to be true,

526
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,420
but you have to give him credit because
he didn't publish the results. He was,

527
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:34,930
you know, curious enough to
acknowledge possibilities

528
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,470
that this experience that
uh, they've gotten had.

529
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,180
We went up to a lot of dumb people and
collectively they somehow were smarter as

530
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:47,830
a group than any one of them.

531
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,450
[inaudible] is an experience that has
been experimentally tested over and over

532
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:55,210
and over. So it, liberal arts
colleges all over the United States,

533
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,580
professional liberal arts college because
that's where these kinds of things

534
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,350
happen. A science professor never
happens. A vocational school is just that.

535
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,100
It's, I'm being a Snob at schools
everywhere. A science professor,

536
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:09,610
a psychology professor usually puts a
bowl of jelly beans in front of the room

537
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:13,360
and says, how many people here can you
just guess the number of Jellybeans?

538
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,010
And over and over and over again. No
one in the room gets the exact number,

539
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,460
but everyone in the room
at the mean comes closest.

540
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,900
Somehow the group is smarter than
even the smartest kids in the class.

541
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,470
And according to James or Wiki,
this is not just a history lesson,

542
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,670
but that it actually is,

543
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:35,050
is something you can see at work and a
lot of other places and can be used to

544
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,730
solve much more complex problems,

545
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,560
much more complex problems. Well,
let's just take one example.

546
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,061
The Internet,

547
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:51,950
if you go back and read a lot of the
discussion on the Internet from 1995 to

548
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:56,180
1998 it was totally dominated by people
saying, yeah, the Internet's neat,

549
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:59,540
but you can never find anything and
nobody says that anymore. I mean,

550
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:02,660
it's just a problem that Google just
completely solved. It's an amazing thing.

551
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,310
Just a few members, Steven Johnson,
author of the Book Emergence,

552
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:12,020
and here I argues that
exact same mysterious crowds
smarts that was president of

553
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:16,370
the ox guessing contest is what allowed
Google to become such a great search

554
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:19,880
engine almost overnight. So
what Google decided wanted

555
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,530
to do was to solve the
problem of organizing the web
in a bottom up rather than

556
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:25,490
a top down approach.

557
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,780
And what Google said was anytime
somebody decides to link to a page,

558
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,550
we're going to count that as a vote,

559
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,050
as a positive endorsement of the page
that they're linking to. So this,

560
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:37,940
this is like a little democracy. So
it's a little democracy. Exactly.

561
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,380
And so what they said is pages that have
a lot of people pointing to them are

562
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:46,580
going to be more highly valued in the
Google kind of system or algorithm than

563
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:49,570
pages and nobody points to. So
if some guy has a blog, which,

564
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,760
which is really great and, and a
ton of other people linked to him,

565
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,330
he gets in essence what you're saying,
a lot of votes. He wins the election,

566
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,660
he went to votes and they
added a second layer to it,

567
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:02,360
which is that when that guy
points to somebody else,

568
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,200
his link is more valuable than your
average Schmoe's because a lot of people

569
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:11,390
point to him. So he has
more kind of googled juice.

570
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,600
When you think about the way that city
neighborhoods form, you ask the question,

571
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:17,150
where does city neighborhoods come
from? And the answer is, you know,

572
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,020
well everybody and nobody at the
same time as kind of creating this.

573
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,770
When you search for something on
Google and you get a list of results,

574
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,950
that is often really, really good
because Google gives these great results.

575
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,650
Ask Yourself, who
decided that this result?

576
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,660
Here is number one in this
result is number two. Well,

577
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:36,440
the answer is everybody and nobody.
It's nobody on staff at Google.

578
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,690
You know Google isn't deciding
that this is the premier site for.

579
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,070
If you search for Steven Johnson
and this is the second best site,

580
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:44,210
if you searched for Steven Johnson,

581
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,860
collectively all the people who are
offering documents on the web have decided

582
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:51,650
that this is the best site by
choosing to link or not link.

583
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,640
Basically the intelligence of Google
is an emergent property of all of these

584
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:56,960
local decisions to link,

585
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,820
none of which were made until recently
with the intent of influencing Google.

586
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,020
Now what's happened recently
is that people have started
to try and trick it was

587
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,170
my next question to me. You can
manipulate, you can manipulate it,

588
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,920
so I actually have this experience.

589
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:13,280
This is one of the most annoying things
it's happened to me in the last year and

590
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:17,210
it's ironic because it comes out of
precisely the thing that I celebrated and

591
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,890
championed and I've been an advocate
for him for the last five years. Um,

592
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,820
I have a website that a lot of people
link to and thus I have a disproportionate

593
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,060
power over Google here. When I point
something, they will jump up in a,

594
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,020
yeah. Have you seen this in
practical tools? Absolutely. Well,

595
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:38,340
one way you can tell is
that for a stretch of time,

596
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,640
if you searched Google for Stephen,
I was the number one result.

597
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,230
Just Steven just evolved the Stevens
in the middle of the Stevenson,

598
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,440
the world of the Steven
Spielberg's is Stephen Kings.

599
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,490
I was the number one Stephen,

600
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,260
and obviously on some level Google is
wrong in thinking that I have the number

601
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:55,020
one Stephen in the world. I mean, I
like to think very highly of myself,

602
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:56,550
but I'm not the most important
Stephen in the world,

603
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,140
but it's because I have a website that a
lot of other bloggers and people in the

604
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:04,000
kind of Internet community point to.
Well maybe you are number nine, Steve.

605
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,830
According to Google, I'm no longer Irish.
I've dropped to number five or six,

606
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:11,910
which has been a great tragedy in my life.
Who's number one now? Uh, I think it,

607
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,060
last I looked at was this, I
think he's a country music star.

608
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:19,050
Like Steven Curtis Chapman. Yeah,
I'm still up there. So you know,

609
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,010
it's all right. But anyway,

610
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:24,450
so because I have this power
with Google on my website,

611
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,900
there's an open comment area where
anybody can come and post a thought in

612
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:29,160
response to something that I had posted.

613
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:34,110
And about a year ago people
started posting these random
kind of nonsense posts

614
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,260
that would have a link in at
pointing off to some, you know,

615
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,060
free Viagra site or to a porn site or
to, you know, kind of get a mortgage,

616
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,600
you know? So it was a coattails
thing. This guy's good.

617
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:49,050
So I'm going to get on his coattails.
Exactly, and initially I was like, look,

618
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,500
I don't have that many people coming here
that it makes sense to advertise in my

619
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,670
comments area,

620
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,760
but I finally realized that they weren't
trying to attract the people who were

621
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,830
hanging out at my site. They
were trying to attract Google.

622
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,850
They were talking purely to Google's
automated kind of searching.

623
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:03,684
They were saying, look,

624
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,100
Google will see this as an endorsement
from Steven Johnson pointing to this free

625
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,910
gambling site and see this is what
separates us from the ants right here,

626
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:14,220
is that we're aware that
this is a colon. Yes,

627
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:18,960
you can step out and play
the system because people
are smart and they have this

628
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:21,390
ability to kind of reflect on this
system that they're a part of.

629
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,850
We're able to advance faster, but
you also have cheats and spoilers.

630
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,390
We'll destroy the system.
And I eventually, you know,
this is this tragic thing,

631
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:31,080
but I had to,

632
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,040
I had basically to shut down these
conversation areas that I had on my site

633
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,490
because because he spent,

634
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,500
I would get literally a hundred of these
spam posts in a day and a lot of them

635
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,920
were really obscene. So
it was like, you know,

636
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:46,860
my mother would come to my side
and be like, what are you doing?

637
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,743
What is going on?

638
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,710
Steven Johnson is the author of the book
emergence as well as mind wide open and

639
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:56,640
he's working on a new one,

640
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,420
which will be out soon about
how everything that's bad
for you is actually good

641
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,870
for you. So it is no surprise
that he is currently number four,

642
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,250
Steven on Google binds, Steven Spielberg,
Steven Soderbergh, Stephen King,

643
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,683
but ahead of this guy

644
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,750
to the

645
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,470
Massey and die.

646
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,730
This is Steven Curtis
Chapman. So from a crowd,

647
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,360
even a pretty dumb crowd
can emerge magically.

648
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,040
Beautiful complexity.

649
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:33,130
And this after all was the great insight
of Adam Smith wealth of nations seven

650
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,370
no, you don't have to sell me. In 1776

651
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,610
he wrote a book in which you propose
that there's an invisible hand when

652
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:42,700
everybody wants to buy something and
everybody else wants to sell something.

653
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:45,250
Somehow it all comes together
in a perfect balance.

654
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,600
Down 30 to 40 speaking of
which, my name's Ben Rubin.

655
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,150
I'm a sound artist in New York City,

656
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:56,290
and what you're about to hear is
a piece I made called open outcry.

657
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,483
We'll hear an excerpt.

658
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,620
Silver 44 78

659
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:07,330
crude oil, 30 53 silver, silver

660
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,420
[inaudible] nine zero zero

661
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,703
[inaudible] [inaudible]

662
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,590
sometimes I say to people, did you
hear rebidding? And I know if they say,

663
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:32,101
I didn't hear you,

664
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:36,270
I know they're not telling me the truth
because people always hear my voice.

665
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:40,530
It's, it's unique and it's a strong
voice too. If I'm selling October's,

666
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:43,790
you know, you don't say, you say
ark and you don't say the full hand.

667
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,430
I'll just say like AUC at 10
so I'd just yell at, I get 10

668
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,160
oh it's 75 play by play
five so 25 75 bit at 78

669
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,230
seven bedrock seven beds, 25

670
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,380
84 45

671
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,290
by a hundred

672
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,880
yeah. Listen to one person at a time.

673
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:08,770
You're hearing everybody
speak at the same time.

674
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,770
It's like going to a symphony and
hearing every piece of the orchestra,

675
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:15,370
but yet hearing the music at the
same time. And in the midst of that,

676
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,130
you may observe, for instance,

677
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,640
a broker that you've
traded with for years.

678
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,040
You notice face looks
like when he's laughing,

679
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:28,390
you know what his face looks like when
he's upset about something at home and

680
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:31,750
suddenly he's got a nervous look. You
can tell when somebody's just bluffing.

681
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:34,960
When somebody is not bluffing in this.
These are all skills that are, you know,

682
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,350
learned over time. It's really
an internal gut feeling.

683
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,720
And as far as just seeing the
expression on someone's face,

684
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:41,790
the way that somebody breathing,

685
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,810
the way that somebody is
leaning on someone else.

686
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,980
I always knew when the guy behind me had
a real order. Cause when he had a big,

687
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:48,491
big order,

688
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:51,150
he used to take my shoulder and shove
it to the ground trying to hold himself.

689
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,900
He's too bad. These too
too. So 50 decent toe

690
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,390
[inaudible] he's too big. Nobody
and a half. No, me. Five and a half,

691
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,893
five

692
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,303
[inaudible] [inaudible]

693
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,700
orange juice now up and down

694
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,900
gasoline,

695
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,350
natural

696
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,183
gas.

697
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:38,410
[inaudible]

698
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,490
it takes the sound artists,

699
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,040
Ben Ruben and the next big thing
for letting us borrow that piece.

700
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:47,370
Coming up the story of the biggest
search and possibly discovery since the

701
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:50,080
double helix. And it
involves the same guy.

702
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,680
I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich
and I will continue in a minute.

703
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,440
You're listening to radio
lab. Keep listening. Okay.

704
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,750
Hey everyone, this is Matt in St Louis.

705
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Radiolab is supported in part by the
National Science Foundation and by the

enhancing public understanding of science
and technology in the modern world.

More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

709
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,310
this is Radiolab. I'm Jab.
I'm rod here with rubber crow,

710
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,180
which this hour we're looking
at the science of emergence.

711
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,650
How the world often seems to organize
itself into being without an obvious plan

712
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,370
or a leader. Well, think about an ant
colony or termites, right? I mean,

713
00:42:36,371 --> 00:42:39,160
they're trying to build a nest
mathematician, Steve Strogatz.

714
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,960
And if you look at any individual termite,

715
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,230
it's just moving along and its antennas
or wiggling and it's smelling fair

716
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,030
amounts and it has no
idea what it's doing.

717
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,980
It doesn't know it's trying to build an s,

718
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:51,670
it's just responding to whatever little
chemical is right in front of its nose.

719
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,710
And yet out of this, you see a
coordinated group that looks like it's,

720
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,750
you know, everybody
knows what they're doing,

721
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,230
but in fact nobody knows what they're
doing. And the same thing with your brain.

722
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,300
No cell in your 100 billion cells
in your brain is having a thought.

723
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,670
But together they are together.

724
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,820
They're falling in love or are wanting
to write music. So who's in there?

725
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,590
Do we have any idea why this
happens or how, I guess that's,

726
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:18,460
that's the question.

727
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,580
[inaudible]

728
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,930
and it's a really fascinating question
when you really kind of pause to think

729
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:30,680
about it. For example, look, I have here,
you see this as my, my cup of coffee.

730
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,340
Um, I'm looking at it and you
know, it's a cup of coffee,

731
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,910
but how does my brain know
that this is a cup of coffee?

732
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,190
It's something that's uh,

733
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,670
in a way it's hard to even understand
what the question is because this comes so

734
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,720
naturally to us, right?

735
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:48,230
We just look at something and we have
this integrated perception of a cup of

736
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:48,780
coffee.

737
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,020
Like what's the big mystery? I
hear you did use all of her sacs.

738
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:53,320
So you had him on the show recently.

739
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:56,920
He would probably be able to talk to you
in an interesting way about people for

740
00:43:56,921 --> 00:43:58,390
whom this does not come easily.

741
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,490
There is a famous case which was
reported in Germany of a, uh,

742
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,350
a woman who had lost motion perception.
And there's a very nice description,

743
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,510
for example, of her difficulty, Pauling
t till that Oliver, now this woman,

744
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,630
she takes the teapot and she starts to
pour and suddenly the image just freezes.

745
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:22,900
She would have stills
lasting about 15 seconds.

746
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,960
She would see a glacio.

747
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,260
She used that term at glacio
fluid coming from the teapot.

748
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,100
Her brain was seeing
something, not moving,

749
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,120
but then her feet were getting, and
then suddenly there was a puddle.

750
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,340
They were getting wet and
indeed crossing a vote.

751
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,270
It was impossible for this
woman in Germany. Dangerous.

752
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,920
And so it's those people who help us
realize the miracle of perception, right?

753
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:49,860
That the, to see the world as
a coherent thing is a miracle.

754
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,440
[inaudible]

755
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,940
should we hit them at the same time? No.

756
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,330
You can think of yourself as fireflies
and you're out buzzing separate trees.

757
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,670
Okay, so back to your miracle
of the Coffee Cup. So yes,

758
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,030
for those of us who are healthy,
we do this all the time.

759
00:45:05,031 --> 00:45:08,930
The question however remains
how I have trillions.

760
00:45:08,931 --> 00:45:12,200
And trillions of neurons
in my head firing randomly.

761
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,690
Every neuron that you're hearing
here, just going a little, no,

762
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:22,160
we can live on electrical thing
and the question is how does this,

763
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,120
which seems so rampantly
disorganized, how does it resolve

764
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,600
the [inaudible] Cup of coffee?

765
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,590
Yeah, good question. Now,

766
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:40,820
a few years ago,

767
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:45,670
a number of neurologists trying to figure
out how the idea of coffee comes to be

768
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,510
came upon a kind of musical analogy
that I'm bringing, creating a thought,

769
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:54,200
creating, say a cup of coffee
is kind of like a musical event.

770
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,320
Neurons in one side of the brain
and another side of the brain,

771
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,240
I recognize them, color
or shape or something,

772
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,530
and if they vibrate together at about
40 cycles a second, if they create,

773
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:08,310
say the same note in step, that
synchrony is a cup of coffee,

774
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,620
and what's happening in the brain
is that there's a part of the brain

775
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:15,170
responsible for the
sense of smells, smell,

776
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,150
eh,

777
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:22,260
neurons that recognize the coffee aroma
or firing vigorously as they smell it.

778
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,990
Meanwhile, they're colored detectors
that happen to notice that it's a,

779
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,620
you know, a Red Mug,

780
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:31,520
eh,

781
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,110
shape detectors as part of the visual
system that are noticing the edge of the

782
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:35,973
[inaudible]

783
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:39,020
[inaudible]

784
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,021
least.

785
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:43,580
What neurologists think is that it's
the simultaneous firing of all of those

786
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,430
that are looking at red
and at sensing the aroma.

787
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,360
It's the coincidence of their firing
that's telling them this is one thing.

788
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,160
This is not separate aromas and
colors and shapes. This is a coffee

789
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,200
they'd be singing together, Huh?

790
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,950
The

791
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:07,370
[inaudible]

792
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:11,810
a

793
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:19,280
so that is a cup of coffee and to
think we do it every morning before we

794
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:19,671
proceed,

795
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:23,840
we should think the New York
City LaGuardia composition
class or neurons where

796
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,220
my name's Harrison Hill and I'm
tasting, my name is Melanie Charles.

797
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,830
Danielle do visa boy.

798
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,820
My name is Jonathan Chew and
I am smell Jonathan Shoe.

799
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:37,260
Mr Smell did the arrangements
Robert Apostle conducted? No,

800
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:41,740
we say wait a second here because this
is interesting. Robert Apostle. Yes,

801
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,380
their conductor told
them what to do. Right.

802
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:48,340
But in your head when you think of a
cup of coffee, who's conducting you?

803
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:50,230
Huh?

804
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,710
And this is where we start getting into
the, the very mystical or even most,

805
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,660
most mysterious part of this is that who
is it that's paying attention? I mean,

806
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:03,400
because I mean, what is attention
hut? How can you control you?

807
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,160
I don't, I don't really even
know how to talk about this, but,

808
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:10,750
but there's something in you that
that is, uh, that is the signal.

809
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,930
Let's do coffee. Yeah. I mean
cause it's confusing that the,

810
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,230
what is it that brings one thing into
attention and not the other? Anyway,

811
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,760
I don't know. I'm a little
out of my depth here.

812
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,553
[inaudible]

813
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:25,610
somehow or other, whether we're looking
at ants, cities with the Internet,

814
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:26,661
wherever we look,

815
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:31,280
the shape and organization of the world
seems to emerge without an obvious plan.

816
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,380
And yet there it is.

817
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,120
And nowhere is this more mysterious and
more difficult to really comprehend than

818
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:39,770
in our own heads. Even right?

819
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,050
For scientists who work on
a day after day in the lab,

820
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,910
like this Guy Christoph Cock,

821
00:48:44,911 --> 00:48:48,690
I'm a professor of neuroscience and
engineering at the California Institute of

822
00:48:48,691 --> 00:48:49,524
Technology.

823
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,460
Chris stopcock is one of the
most celebrated neurologists
in the world and for

824
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:58,290
him and for many others, they have a hard
time getting rid of a model deep down,

825
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,840
which says somewhere in
there there's a conductor,

826
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:04,260
someone is organizing the
action. You made a mema.

827
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:07,650
There's a movie by Woody Allen called
everything you always wanted to know about

828
00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:12,450
sex. I do, but the way of way to ask this
has great skits in it where he has um,

829
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,310
a, a couple is petting in the back of
it. Oh my God. Sydney, can't you wait?

830
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,380
Do you want to do it right
here in the parking lot?

831
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:24,300
You'd see inside the boys veins is
mission control, mission control.

832
00:49:24,301 --> 00:49:25,980
You have this NASA type control room.

833
00:49:25,981 --> 00:49:29,610
You have these big TV screen corresponding
to the output of the eyes to eyes

834
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,460
come in.

835
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,990
I used to brain over and you have
sort of all these white divest now for

836
00:49:33,991 --> 00:49:35,400
technicians running around.

837
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:39,410
All systems go and we're going to get
an erection in the scene that says we're

838
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,940
trying to do. Yeah, exactly. Then
you have these, uh, you know,

839
00:49:41,941 --> 00:49:44,790
all these Siemens that line up, they
all have these little parachutes.

840
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,840
It's a little long tails. Scared.
I don't want to go out there,

841
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,860
but I mean the point is, so this is
control of a metaphor that, that uh,

842
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,690
you know, we can all laugh about,

843
00:49:55,691 --> 00:50:00,040
but a lot of people including scientists
have implicitly the ideas that meet as

844
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,260
a kissed off who sits inside
meetings. I can tell you,

845
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,870
most people can tell you it's,
it's exactly between my two eyes,

846
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,640
between here and here. And by the way,

847
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:10,310
this Christopher I assume would be saying,
okay sheet and this is in the movies.

848
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,510
It okay, she likes me.
Let's make the next one.

849
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,920
That's exactly what happens. Of course
in the Woody Allen movie. Exactly.

850
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:29,990
Show the points. Christopher [inaudible]
is that the woody Allen Model?

851
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:32,120
This idea that there's
an inner command center,

852
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:36,320
some conductor directing your
brain that thinks is wrong. Now.

853
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,850
Clearly there is no such person
inside my head for a lot, you know,

854
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,560
because who's sitting inside the head
of this little Christoph and then who's

855
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,030
sitting inside the head of the
person sitting inside my head.

856
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,660
You see the problem if Christopher's
thinking about a cup of coffee and he gets

857
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,330
the idea from an inner Christophe
who's thinking about a cup of coffee,

858
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:55,070
where did the inner
Christoph get the idea?

859
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,240
Maybe from an inner inner valve
that wouldn't really solve the pong.

860
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,330
We'll just push that one back.

861
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:05,643
[inaudible]

862
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,630
these are heavy problems.

863
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:08,361
I mean,

864
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:13,361
w what happens here is we're tiptoeing
up the hill here to the Mount Sinai of of

865
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:15,300
science.

866
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,790
Yeah, coffee cups in people
sitting into controls. Well,

867
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:21,300
these are kind of the smaller questions
on the foothills to the bigger one,

868
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,010
which is how does the mind reflect?

869
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,000
Why does someone know who an I is?

870
00:51:30,001 --> 00:51:34,940
Why can you contemplate death? What
is this consciousness? That's the big,

871
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:36,390
if we can figure this out,

872
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:41,130
whatever circuit is responsible for
or circuits responsible for human

873
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,080
consciousness. Think of what we can do.

874
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,830
One day a doctor could walk
into a patient's hospital
room where the patient is

875
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:51,240
laying comatose and a
put a helmet on them.

876
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,650
It's a conscious o meter,

877
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,740
let's call it and measure how alive
they are or maybe even tickle a part of

878
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:00,830
their brain and make them back up. This

879
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,390
idea, by the way,

880
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,520
came from one of the most
famous scientists of the
20th century who worked very,

881
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:10,250
very closely with Christopher Koch. Um,

882
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,970
I'm talking about a man
named Francis Crick and I,

883
00:52:12,971 --> 00:52:14,870
even if you know nothing
about science at all,

884
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,870
you've probably heard about the
discovery of the structure of DNA,

885
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:22,340
the DNA molecule by Watson and Crick.
This is that crick. He was a British guy.

886
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:26,900
He moved to southern California and at
some point he and Christopher coke met.

887
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:31,310
Now Coke was much, much younger,
decades younger than the older guy,

888
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,470
and yet they formed one of
the more magical partnerships,

889
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:41,480
a kind of Gilbert and Sullivan or
Rogers and Hammerstein of neuroscience.

890
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,590
And one of the ideas that crick
had was that there is a way,

891
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,120
they must be a way to figure out
what consciousness is all about.

892
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,460
They developed this notion,

893
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,660
there's no conscious entity inside my
head that serves the whole of conductor.

894
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,740
That's not to say that there may not be
places in the brain that act akin to a

895
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:08,850
conductor that sort of synchronized and
that called Nate the various parts of

896
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:13,200
the brain that find a penalty because
one of the remarkable phenomena of

897
00:53:13,201 --> 00:53:17,310
conscience is everything's integrated.
When I look at you and you talk,

898
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,580
your voice comes out of
your mouth. When you move,

899
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,000
the most I perceive is attached
to your head, not in the brain.

900
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,430
All the things that analyze in
different parts of the brain.

901
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,780
So you need some sort of entity that
pulls all these different networks of the

902
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:34,590
brain together. Is there a place
in the brain that does that well?

903
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,080
So Francis Crick and I think
so. In fact, it was a, the,

904
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,070
the subject of his last
paper that he worked on,

905
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:41,460
on literally on the day he died,

906
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:47,690
there's this odd structure in the brain
called the to home close to means hidden

907
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:50,370
away. And it's a small area.

908
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,970
It's sort of an elongated sheet like
structure beneath the cerebral cortex.

909
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:55,740
You have two of them, one on
the left, one of the right.

910
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,480
And what's remarkable about it? Indeed,

911
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,780
this tractor receives input
from almost every cortical area,

912
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,580
the teams to be in an ideal position.

913
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:06,480
If you want to go to the metaphor of
synchronizing all the different activities

914
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,390
and making sure they're all
in some sort of lockstep.

915
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:14,770
So Francis and you have this idea and
he is very sick with cancer and he wants

916
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:19,290
to get this idea down is what's calling
it. Can you describe the scene there?

917
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,440
You first had this idea 10 years
ago and he talked about it in a,

918
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,350
in his book that he published in 94.

919
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,770
And then we never thought much
more about it over the last year.

920
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:32,730
We came back to this, um, this,

921
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,090
this sort of somewhat obscure structure.
So he was very, very interested in it.

922
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:39,750
And Yeah, he felt his, he felt his, um,

923
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,770
you know, as he felt his illness
coming on and getting stronger,

924
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,970
he was very adamant about trying
to finish up a manuscript.

925
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:50,910
So he literally worked
days and days and days.

926
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:57,360
There's this beautiful photograph of his
desk covered probably four inches deep,

927
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:59,220
just with paper pertaining
to the cloud storm.

928
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,940
And he worked a particular
over the last six weeks, um,

929
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,380
DNI to try to finish a manuscript or to
get it in reasonable shape for us to,

930
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,470
to publish. And so he
was on the day he died.

931
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:14,490
He was still writing the
scientist to the bitter end.

932
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,200
Is a kind of Mozart's requiem
quality to this? Yes, yes.

933
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,603
Yeah.

934
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,410
What was the last thing that
you and he said to each other?

935
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,120
Hello,

936
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,670
I'll see you on thirsty.

937
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,620
Or Friday I was supposed to visit
him in the hospital to work on this

938
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:37,530
manuscript. And was the
manuscript completed?

939
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,210
Uh, no, it's, I'm
currently working on that.

940
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:46,290
I'm editing it and then sending out
and abouts send it out to friends.

941
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,020
[inaudible]

942
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,160
because I feel a little bit exactly
like, um, the student of Mozart,

943
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,470
his names escapes and
who finished his requiem.

944
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,330
He had a student in finished spectrum
and now musicologist today at deciding

945
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:07,410
what is actually original Mozart and
what was finished in the style of Mozart.

946
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,000
And so I say,

947
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,830
which aware of this and you're stuffing
italics or something or something.

948
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:14,581
Like on the other end,

949
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:18,120
we publish 22 or 23 manuscript together
and the way we always work that he wrote

950
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:21,270
the first draft. It was so insistent
upon that. Then I bought, you know,

951
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:24,760
I edited and then he edit my edits
and we integrated. Unfortunately,

952
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:26,820
I can't do this anymore, so you know,

953
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,920
I just have to edit his draft
without the benefit of his feedback.

954
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:36,943
[inaudible]

955
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,870
Christopher [inaudible] is a professor
of neuroscience and engineering at the

956
00:56:44,871 --> 00:56:46,580
California Institute of Technology.

957
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,640
His newest book is the
quest for consciousness.
