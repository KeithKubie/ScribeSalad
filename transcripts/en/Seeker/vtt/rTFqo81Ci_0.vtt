00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.200
Sex is fun, right?

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.179
But, what if it wasn't?

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.340
Finding a partner, maintaining a long-term
partnership and procreating at the right time

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.430
is very difficult.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:20.250
Wouldn't it be better to just… make another
me?

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.490
Six years ago, biologists discovered the Mycocepurus
smithii, a species of ant which are ALL female;

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.830
they're asexual.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.419
The queen clones herself and if the eggs go
unfertilized they'll all hatch female.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.300
Bonus, they then have a whole host of awesome
new ants!

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.739
Sexuality is a lot of work, while asexual
reproduction is exceedingly efficient (if

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.659
less fun), and sexual dimorphism, or splitting
into a binary sex pair, limits the species…

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:48.659
doesn't it?

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:49.949
Why do we have sex?

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.989
Aside from the pleasurable feelings associated
with sex, lowering of stress, strengthening

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.500
of romantic bonds and so on and so forth…
why?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.219
Those things are evolution's way of GETTING
US to HAVE sex.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.639
That's not what I mean.

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:05.210
You could say, the WHY is easy, we have sex
to reproduce; sex equals passing on genes

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.950
and a promise of success!

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.250
But that's STILL not what we're asking.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.610
Like, why, man?

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.720
The Smithii doesn't get busy!

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.750
She's ASEXUAL.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.030
She just… clones herself.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.490
BIOLOGICALLY speaking, WHY sex?

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.659
The question "why we have sex at all," has
plagued scientists for decades.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.850
Some basic theories from the 80s assume the
genetic variety is beneficial and sex allows

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.040
us to purge bad DNA.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.640
A book in the 90s invented The Red Queen hypothesis,
named after the character from "Through the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.640
Looking Glass."

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.229
This describes sexual evolution like a race.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.829
We're all evolving to combat other organisms'
mutations, and by doing so, we stay in balance.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.310
Essentially, as parasites and predators evolve,
the hosts and prey evolve to survive them,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.560
facilitating reproduction.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.619
Of course, having two sexes is pretty inefficient
when you look at it this way.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.499
If I'm in a race to the death, I don't want
to have to find a date for Saturday too!

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:03.909
They call it the "cost" of men, because we
don't necessarily NEED men, or do we?

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.619
I'm biased here, but I hope we do.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.250
A new study in Nature Genetics claims to have
a scientific way to look at this… sharing

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.570
our genetic material makes us stronger and
better able to fight disease.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.160
Using genetic material from the 1,000 Genomes
Project, researchers compared genomes from

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.540
Africans, Asians, Europeans, Canadians of
French descent and found some parts of our

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.950
DNA are rewritten more often than others,
causing hot and cold spots of genetic mutation.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.970
When binary species like humans mate, they
EACH release genetic material that can allow

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.740
the building blocks of genes and chromosomes
to combine and mutate beneficially.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.580
Some mutations help us, while others increase
our risk of diseases.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.160
The rarely overwritten "coldspots," it turns
out, is where bad mutations survive.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.040
Thanks to sex and these mutations, our genetic
material "worsens, and then gets better,"

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.720
but eventually, bad DNA is overwritten.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.300
According to separate research by the 1,000
Genomes Project, each human offspring has

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.540
60 genetic mutations, or about one for every
100 million letters of DNA.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.300
Both asexual and sexual organisms mutate,
but asexual organism mutations have to be

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.680
SO GOOD that they overcome the wider population
size, fitness, and mutation rate.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.820
It's less likely a single mutated clone will
succeed in a colony, versus the constant trial-and-error

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.910
of sexual organism.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.220
That doesn't mean sexuality is better, just
another means of success.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.840
Bacteria aren't the only asexual animals,
some reptiles, insects, and fish reproduce

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.730
without males around; so binary sexuality
isn't a hard and fast rule.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.900
Some even do BOTH!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.610
Sometimes it's a long and seductive one.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.900
*bad-ump cik!* Why we have sex at all is still
a mystery, but this pulls back the curtain

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.900
just a little.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.060
In the end, asexuality might be faster, but
sexuality's DNA lottery has it's benefits

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.060
too!

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.010
You're going to comment on this, maybe you
already have.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.030
Why do you think, BIOLOGICALLY, we're not
asexual?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.730
Get down there and talk it out.
