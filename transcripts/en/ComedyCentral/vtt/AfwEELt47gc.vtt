WELCOME TO GRAMPY GOOBIE'S
EULOGY VIDEO.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.440
- WE HOPE THAT OTHER PEOPLE
ENJOY THIS

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.841
WHEN THEY PLAY IT
WHEN YOU DIE

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:08.909
'CAUSE WE KNOW
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:09.910
'CAUSE YOU'LL BE
IN THE GROUND.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.678
[cheerful music]

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.213
EARLY LIFE.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.349
- I AM GRANDPA GOOBIE
AS A YOUNG MAN.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.617
I'M HORNY.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.418
- WARTIME.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:21.655
- GRAMPY GOOBIE
IS SIGNING UP FOR THE WAR.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.090
WAR II.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.192
HITLER'S ROLLING FOR POLAND.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.761
- OH, NO, IT'S DICK TRACY.
AHH!

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:28.929
- OH, NO.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.031
- BLOOPER REEL.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.332
- WE SHOULDN'T BE
DOING THIS ON-CAMERA.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.700
[bleep] IT,
LET'S JUST DO IT ON-CAMERA.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:34.935
VERITE.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.436
IF GRANDPA GOOBIE COULD BE
ANY ANIMAL IN THE WORLD,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.871
WHAT ANIMAL WOULD HE BE?

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:38.972
- UM--
- PILLS.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.474
- [laughing]

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.211
- REST IN PEACE.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.479
[laughter]

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.247
- KILL BILL, BRO.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.716
[screaming]
- CUT MY NECK!

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.386
- I FEEL LIKE--LIKE,
"HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM,"

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.521
AND THE PROBLEM IS
THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LOVE.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.257
THE LACK OF LOVE IS REALLY HARD
FOR ME TO HANDLE RIGHT NOW.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.593
- A BAPTISMAL, WENDALL.
LET'S DO IT!

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.495
YEAH!

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.596
- THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD TO DO.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.831
- OH, MY GOSH, YEAH.
IT WAS SO--

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.166
I'M SO WET.
I'M SO WET.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.202
- I'M SO WET TOO.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.139
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS GOING ON?

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.174
GRANDPA GOOBIE WOULDN'T
WANT THIS THIS WAY.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:17.244
- GRANDPA GOOBIE IS DEAD!
