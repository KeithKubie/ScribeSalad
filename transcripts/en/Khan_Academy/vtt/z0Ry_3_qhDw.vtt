00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:01.150
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.317
is talk about the idea of
a sampling distribution.

00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:09.525
Now, just to make things
a little bit concrete,

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:13.325
let's imagine that we have
a population of some kind.

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.317
Let's say it's a bunch of balls,

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:17.825
each of them have a number written on it.

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:21.400
For that population, we
could calculate parameters.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.975
So, a parameter you could view as a truth

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:25.417
about that population.

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:27.100
We've covered this in other videos.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000
So for example, you could
have the population mean,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.833
the mean of the numbers
written on top of that ball.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.242
You could have the population
standard deviation.

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:37.236
You could have the proportion of balls

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.635
that are even, whatever,

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:41.314
these are all population parameters.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:43.808
Now we know from many other videos

00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:46.350
that you might not know
the population parameter

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.308
or might not even be easy to find,

00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:50.408
and so the way that we try to estimate

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:53.917
a population parameter
is by taking a sample,

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:57.808
so this right over here is
a sample size of size n.

00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:59.225
Sample of size n.

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:05.442
And then we can calculate a
statistic from that sample,

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:09.258
based on that sample, maybe
we picked n balls from there.

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:13.025
And so from that, we can
calculate a statistic

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:17.092
that is used to estimate this parameter.

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:20.508
But we know that this is a
random sample right over here,

00:01:20.508 --> 00:01:22.909
so every time we take a sample,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.958
the statistic that we
calculate for that sample

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.000
is not necessarily going to be the same

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.325
as the population parameter.

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:33.467
In fact, if we were to take a
random sample of size n again

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.492
and then we were to calculate
the statistic again,

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.109
we could very well get a different value.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.350
So, these are all going to be
estimates of this parameter.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.908
And so an interesting question

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:46.608
is what is the distribution of the values

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:48.483
that I could get for the statistics?

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.542
What is the frequency with
which I can get different values

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:55.050
for the statistic that is trying
to estimate this parameter?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.900
And that distribution is what
a sampling distribution is.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.617
So let's make this even a
little bit more concrete.

00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:04.975
Let's imagine where our population,

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:07.700
I'm gonna make this a very simple example.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.783
Let's say our population
has three balls in it.

00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:12.116
One, two, three,

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:17.350
and they're numbered, one, two, and three.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.300
And it's very easy to calculate.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.867
Let's say the parameter that
we care about right over here

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.608
is the population mean,

00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:27.508
and that of course is gonna
be one plus two plus three,

00:02:27.508 --> 00:02:28.775
all of that over three,

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:31.208
which is six divided
by three which is two.

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:33.500
So, that is our population parameter.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.858
But let's say that we
wanted to take samples,

00:02:35.858 --> 00:02:38.050
let's say samples of two balls at a time

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.150
and every time we take a
ball, we'll replace it.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.742
So each ball we take, it
is an independent pick.

00:02:43.742 --> 00:02:46.958
And we're gonna use those
samples of two balls at a time

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.800
in order to estimate the population mean.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.967
So for example, this could be
our first sample of size two

00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:59.308
and let's say in that
first sample, I pick a one

00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:01.425
and let's say I pick a two.

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:05.217
Well then I can calculate
the sample statistic here.

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.717
In this case, it would be the sample mean

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:09.092
which is used to estimate
the population mean.

00:03:09.092 --> 00:03:13.892
And for this sample of
two, it's going to be 1.5.

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:16.041
Then I can do it again.

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.708
And let's say I get a
one and I get a three.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.850
Well now, when I
calculate the sample mean,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.208
the average of one and three
or the mean of one and three

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:28.892
is going to be equal to two.

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:30.333
Let's think about all of
the different scenarios

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.317
of samples we can get

00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:33.950
and what the associated
sample means are going to be.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.375
And then we can see the frequency

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.467
of getting those sample means.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.725
And so, let me draw a
little bit of a table here.

00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:43.475
So, make a table right over here.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:48.117
And let's see, these are
the numbers that we pick

00:03:48.117 --> 00:03:49.408
and remember, when we pick one ball,

00:03:49.408 --> 00:03:51.933
we'll record that number,
then we'll put it back in,

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:53.158
and then we'll pick another ball.

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:54.575
So these are going to
be independent events

00:03:54.575 --> 00:03:56.483
and it's gonna be with replacement.

00:03:56.483 --> 00:03:59.766
And so, let's say we could
pick a one and then a one.

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:02.675
We could pick a one, then
a two, a one and a three.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.742
We could pick a two and then a one.

00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:07.867
We could pick a two and
a two, a two and a three.

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:09.758
We could pick a three and a one,

00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:12.692
a three and a two or a three and a three.

00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:14.592
There's three possible
balls for the first pick

00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:16.042
and three possible balls for the second

00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:17.925
'cause we're doing it with replacement.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:21.209
And so, what is the sample
mean in each of these

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.312
for all of these combinations?

00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:25.467
So for this one, the sample mean is one.

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:26.800
Here, it is 1.5.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:30.033
Here, it is two.

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.050
Here, it is 1.5.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.583
Here, it is two.

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:34.916
Here, it is 2.5.

00:04:35.758 --> 00:04:37.442
Here, it is two.

00:04:37.442 --> 00:04:38.775
Here, it is 2.5.

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:43.042
And then here, it is three.

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:45.550
And so, we can now plot the frequencies

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.008
of these possible sample
means that we can get

00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:52.217
and that plot will be
a sampling distribution

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:53.983
of the sample means.

00:04:53.983 --> 00:04:55.641
So let's do that.

00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:58.700
So, we make a little chart right over,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.667
a little graph right over here.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.917
So these are the possible sample means.

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:09.484
We can get a one, we can get a 1.5,

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:12.750
we can get a two, we can get a 2.5

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.892
or we can get a three.

00:05:14.892 --> 00:05:17.292
And now let's see the frequency of it.

00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:19.459
I will put that over here.

00:05:21.358 --> 00:05:23.525
And so let's see, how many ones

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:27.375
out of our nine possibilities
we have, how many were one?

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.358
Well, only one of the
sample means was one,

00:05:30.358 --> 00:05:32.658
and so the relative frequency,
if we just set the number,

00:05:32.658 --> 00:05:35.042
we could make this line go up one

00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:37.375
or we could just say, "Hey,
this is going to be one

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:39.558
"out of the nine possibilities."

00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:42.117
And so let me just make that.

00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:44.041
I'll call this right over here.

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:45.958
This is 1/9.

00:05:47.342 --> 00:05:49.675
Now, what about 1.5?

00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:51.975
Let's see, there's one,

00:05:51.975 --> 00:05:54.792
two of these possibilities out of nine.

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:57.775
So, 1.5, it would look like this.

00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:00.942
This right over here is two over nine.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.783
And now, what about two?

00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:07.875
Well, we can see there's one, two, three.

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:11.733
So three out of the nine
possibilities, we got a two.

00:06:11.733 --> 00:06:14.616
So we could say this is two
or we could say this is 3/9,

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:17.175
which is the same thing of course as 1/3.

00:06:17.175 --> 00:06:20.967
So this right over here
is three over nine.

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.967
And then what about 2.5?

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.108
Well, there's two 2.5's,

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:28.375
so two out of the nine times.

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:29.733
Another way you can interpret this

00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:34.050
is when you take a random
sample with replacement

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.850
of two balls, you have a 2/9 chance

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.433
of having a sample mean of 2.5.

00:06:41.883 --> 00:06:45.042
And then last but not
least, right over here,

00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:47.067
there's one scenario out of the nine

00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:50.033
where you get two three's or 1/9.

00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:51.775
And so this right over here,

00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:54.608
this is the sampling distribution,

00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:57.500
sampling distribution,

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:00.550
for the sample mean

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.433
for n equals two

00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:12.352
or for sample size of two.
