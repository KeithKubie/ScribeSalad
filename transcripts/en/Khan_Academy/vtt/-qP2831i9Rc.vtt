00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:01.776
- [Voiceover] In the figure above,

00:00:01.776 --> 00:00:06.776
lines l and k intersect at point Q.

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:11.183
If m is equal to 40, so
this right over here,

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:13.482
that right over there is 40 degrees

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:14.562
because it says m degrees.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:18.451
So if m is equal to 40
and p is equal to 25,

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.746
so p, this angle right
over here is 25 degrees.

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:25.439
What is the value of x?

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.123
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:29.363
and think about this on your own.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:32.183
So the big realization right over here

00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:35.608
is to realize that this angle

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:39.568
and this entire angle are vertical angles.

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:41.239
They're on the opposite sides

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.584
of this point of interesection at point Q.

00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:45.163
So vertical angles are always

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:47.380
going to have the same measure.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.843
So if this is 40 degrees,

00:00:48.843 --> 00:00:52.488
then this whole thing is going to be,

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:55.158
that whole thing is
going to be 40 degrees.

00:00:55.158 --> 00:00:57.585
And if that whole thing is 40 degrees,

00:00:57.585 --> 00:01:02.145
then x plus 25 is going
to need to be equal

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.424
to the whole 40 degrees.

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:04.897
So let's write that down.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:08.197
So x plus 25

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.222
is going to be equal to 40.

00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:16.080
Subtract 25 from both sides.

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:23.791
And we are left with x is equal to 15.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.053
So x, this angle right
over here is 15 degrees

00:01:30.053 --> 00:01:32.398
or x is equal to 15.

00:01:32.398 --> 00:01:34.174
15 plus 25 is 40,

00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:38.147
it's a vertical angle, it
has the exact same measure

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:40.994
as this angle right over here, 40 degrees.
