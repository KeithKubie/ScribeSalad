00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470
 . 

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.160
 Let us represent some equations 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.050
 Let's assume that I have the equation y &lt; 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.520
 = 4x ​​+ 3 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.500
 On the x and y axes, we want to illustrate all x and y points 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.650
 Which fulfills the requirement here 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.210
 A good starting point is probably to separate these less from 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.570
 Or equal, because we know how to represent y 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.140
 = 4x ​​+ 3 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.510
 If this is equivalent to y &lt; 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.870
 4x + 3, or y = 4x + 3 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.170
 This is meaning less than or equal to 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.200
 It can be less than or equal to the phrase 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.015
 And the reason I did it in the first example 

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:47.730
 Is because I know how to represent it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.980
 Let us represent it 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.060
 . 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.170
 I will try to paint better than that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.800
 If this is - no, this is not good 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 This vertical axis, ie y axis 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.920
 This is x-axis, here 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920
 Then we know the intersection y 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.580
 The intersection of y is 3 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.510
 If point 0, 3 - 1, 2, 3 - fall on the line 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.405
 We know that tilt 4 

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:21.330
 Know that inclination 4 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.430
 Which means that if we move 1 in the direction of the x axis, we will move 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.980
 Up on y axis by 4 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.280
 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.920
 If you will be here 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.236
 It is enough to draw a line 

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:35.210
 We can also refer to the X axis 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 If we return 1 on the x axis 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 We will go down by 4 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.930
 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.480
 This will also be a point on the line 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.670
 The best attempt at drawing this line will look like 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.590
 So - this is the hardest part 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.610
 It will look like this 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.270
 This is the line 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 It has to be straight 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.240
 I think you absorbed the idea 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.540
 This is the graphic representation of y = 4x + 3 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.440
 Now let's think about what it means to be less than that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.789
 All these points verify this 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.750
 Equation, but we have more 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.410
 These are the points here 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.830
 What about points when y &lt;4x + 3? 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 Let me think what this means 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.410
 Let's choose some values ​​for x 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.140
 When x = 0, how much is y? 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.390
 When x = 0, this means that y will be 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.150
 Less than 0 + 3, ie y &lt;3 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.620
 When x = -1, how much would y? 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.590
 4 × -1 = -4, + 3 = -1, if y 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.840
 Will be less than -1 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.950
 When x = 1, how much y? 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.110
 4 × 1 = 4, + 3 = 7 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.340
 If y &lt; 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.130
 Let's try to appoint them at least 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.670
 When x = - let us identify these first, when x 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.805
 = 0, y &lt;3 

00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:11.350
 x = 0, y &lt;3 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.230
 If it is all these points - I shading them 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.310
 In green - check the equation 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.200
 If you want to look at this, when x = -1 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.140
 The y &lt;-1 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.850
 If y here are all these points at the bottom 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.470
 After x = 1, y &lt;7 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.500
 It's all about these points 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.960
 All in all, we take any point on x - let's assume we will take 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.020
 This point x 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.980
 If we value 4x + 3, we get the point 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.120
 On-line 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.950
 Which is a value x multiplied by 4 + 3 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.860
 Now the values ​​of y that achieve the equation can equal those 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.100
 The point on the line, or it can be less than 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.840
 Which will be down the line 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.870
 If you want to do this for all possible x values 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.130
 You will not only get the values ​​on the line 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.990
 We draw it, but we will also get the lines that fall below the line 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.279
 We have now represented this equation 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.480
 It is about this line, 4x + 3, with all the space 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.490
 The shaded net is below 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.530
 Now, if the code is limited to less than just, not less than or equal to 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.670
 In this case, we do not include the same line 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.090
 The agreement on this is to make the line 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.860
 Dotted 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.880
 This case if we deal with less code 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.690
 From 4x + 3 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.410
 Because in this case, these do not apply, and 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.620
 We will only get these 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.550
 If the line itself will not achieve it, but 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.010
 The space that lies below it 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.190
 Let's do one like this 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.230
 Suppose we have y&gt; -x 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.530
 / 2-6 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.940
 And the best way to start - the way you'd better start out 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.830
 The issues - is that I graphically balance the equation 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.780
 Let me paint, let me represent y 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.200
 = - This is equivalent to 1/2 - 6 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.890
 If we want to represent it, this vertical axis, this 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.130
 Horizontal axis 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.920
 The y-intersection is -6 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.170
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.020
 This intersection is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.960
 The inclination is 1 / 2- 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.390
 Oh, x should be here, 1 / 2x - 6 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.950
 If the tilt is 1/2, it means that when it moves 2 to 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.395
 Right, I'll move down by 1 

00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:58.775
 If I move to the right by 2, I will move down by 1 

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:02.590
 If I move to the right by 2, I will move down by 1 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.870
 If you move 2 by left, ie to -2 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.880
 I will move 1 up 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.040
 If -2 and 1 are up 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.530
 And the line will look like this 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.200
 The line will look like this 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.400
 This is the best I can draw 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
 If this is the line for y 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.080
 1 / 2x- 6 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.730
 Now, the equation that we have is not greater than or equal to, but it is 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.320
 Larger than x / 2 - 6, or larger 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.850
 From 1 / 2x to 6 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.230
 Using the same logic, for any x - so 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.070
 I took any value for x, let 's assume that for the x value we want to 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.260
 We choose - if we value x / 2 - 6 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.970
 We will get this point 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.720
 We'll get a point on the line 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.620
 But the y values ​​to which this equation is equal are y values 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.650
 Which are even bigger 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.920
 This point will not be - in fact, will draw 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.930
 Open circle - because you can not include a point 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.750
 1 / 2x- 6 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.750
 But all y values ​​will be greater than that 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.300
 All y values ​​are bigger than that 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.670
 This is true for any x value 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.900
 We take this x 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.260
 We estimate 1/2 or x / 2 - 6 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.660
 We get this point 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.100
 The y values ​​that achieve the equation are all the values ​​of y that lie higher 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.660
 If all y values ​​are achieved by this equation, or all 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.990
 The axes that achieve the equation are all this space 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.310
 Which is located above the line 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.070
 We will not include this line 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.300
 If the agreement draw this line it is to have a line clip 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.850
 Let me draw - I will do what I can to make it 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.430
 Dashed line 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.070
 I will erase parts of the line, and I hope it is 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.160
 It will look choppy 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.590
 I turn this line connected to the intermittent line Hannah I see you 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.500
 It's just a limit, but it's not included within 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.210
 Values ​​that achieve the equation 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.760
 The values ​​that make up the equation are all of these 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.430
 The yellow area I shaded above the line 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.260
 Anyway, I hope you found this useful
