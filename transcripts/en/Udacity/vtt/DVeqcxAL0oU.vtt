00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.210
You've done all this research and
competitor analysis, so now what?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.670
Well, use it.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.280
You can get sharp on your original idea
or alter the idea based on what you

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.010
learned from user research and
other early idea validation.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.230
We have four activities that can help
you get more clarity on your idea.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.330
The first is a Twitter description,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.170
how would you announce your product
in a 140 characters, or less?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.720
This activity helps you get laser
focus on the key user value and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.420
your product market fit.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.750
The second is you could write
a future press release.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.250
How would your product
first appear in the news?

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.910
You can use this structure to
focus yourself and your team.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.190
The structure ensures that you
capture your future vision.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.240
The third is a one
page executive summary.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.070
This is the shortest and
clearest way to define your product.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.010
And finally, the fourth is
an experienced strategy template.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.990
This template is appropriate for
defining new product categories.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.560
And in the instructor notes, you'll find
templates for each of these activities.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.150
Take a minute to read over them, and

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.660
think about which one would help
you get more clarity on your idea.
