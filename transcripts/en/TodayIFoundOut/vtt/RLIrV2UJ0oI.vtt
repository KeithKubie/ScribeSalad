00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.020
Providing a unique wrinkle to the phrase,
“throw the bums out of office,” twice,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.410
first in 1419 and again in 1618, frustrated
citizens of Prague (today in the Czech Republic)

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.539
literally threw their leaders out of the upper
story windows of their public buildings.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.320
The word for throwing someone or something
out of a window, defenestration, is also sometimes

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.440
used to mean dismissing the authority of a
person; and with both Prague defenestrations,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.660
both meanings apply.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.070
Each of the two incidents arose, like many
disputes, at the intersection of religion

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.300
and politics.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.550
With the first, at this early point in the
15th century there was a fair amount of discontent

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.900
internally within the Catholic Church; in
particular, regular folks were peeved over

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.440
the relative amount of wealth held by the
clergy and nobility compared with the grinding

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.220
poverty of the peasant class.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.649
In response, radical preachers sprang up,
including a relatively popular priest of the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.659
Hussite sect named Želivsky.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.799
After the Prague town council refused to release
some Hussite members that it held prisoner,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.360
Želivsky led his followers on a protest march
to the town hall, Novomēstská radnice.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.470
During the march, someone from the town hall
threw a stone at Želivsky; this lit a fire

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.230
under the already smoldering mob, which then
stormed the building where they found a judge,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.130
a burgomaster and 13 council members.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.880
Every one of the officials was soon thrown
out of an upper story window; those that didn’t

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.660
die from the fall were killed by the mob below.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.869
The second defenestration came about from
a dispute between Protestants and Catholics.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.080
For four decades following Martin Luther’s
nailing of his 95 grievances (of which a bitch

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.939
was not one) to a Wittenberg church door,
Catholics and Protestants across Europe engaged

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.760
in a range of disputes.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.439
(Interestingly, while today Luther’s act
is often noted to be a rebellious one against

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.690
the church, at the time it was anything but.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.509
Lacking group email or digital message boards,
priests commonly nailed such notices to church

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.310
doors when they had something to discuss amongst
the clergy.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.660
In fact, it would appear that Luther did not
intend for his work to be debated widely by

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.420
the general public, simply fodder for discussion
among his priestly peers.)

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.049
In any event, in 1555, the Catholic Holy Roman
Emperor (who also the King of Bohemia, of

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.880
which Prague was its capital) and his Lutheran
princes and nobles settled their dispute (for

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.040
the time being) with the Peace of Augsburg.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.190
Over the next six decades good relations between
them led the Bohemian kings to gradually give

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.220
the nobles ever greater religious freedom
and increasing civil and legal powers.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.540
In 1618, those fond feelings came to an abrupt
end as the heir to the kingdom, a devout Catholic

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.980
in favor of the Counter-Reformation (to re-impose
Catholicism in Europe) grew in power and succeeded

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.900
in eventually removing much of that formerly
held by the Protestant nobles – to the point

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.120
that he had their assembly dissolved.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.670
On May 23, 1618, several of these Protestant
nobles, understandably infuriated, confronted

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.290
four Catholic lords at the Bohemian Chancellory,
demanding to know the latter’s role in their

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.290
recent downfall.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.120
Two of the Catholic lords, Count Vilem Slavata
of Chlum and Count Jaroslav Borzita of Martinice,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.730
were proud of their actions and quickly took
responsibility, assuming they would just be

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.730
arrested.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.270
The Protestant lords had other plans.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.230
One of the leaders of the group, Count Matyáš
von Thurn, stated to the pair as the gathered

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.980
crowd watched, “You are enemies of us and
of our religion, have desired to deprive us

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.890
of our Letter of Majesty, have horribly plagued
your Protestant subjects… and have tried

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.670
to force them to adopt your religion against
their wills or have had them expelled for

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.670
this reason…”

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.099
He then stated to the mob, “Were we to keep
these men alive, then we would lose the Letter

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.700
of Majesty and our religion… for there can
be no justice to be gained from or by them…”

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.720
Shortly thereafter, the mob threw both counts,
along with their secretary, Philipus Fabricius,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.260
out of the third-story windows; remarkably
all three survived the fall, as well as the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.180
entire incident – even though there was
a crowd of Protestants watching the proceedings.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.870
Unlike with the first defenestration, apparently
no one at the second thought to finish them

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.870
off.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.000
Subsequently, two very different versions
of the Catholic lords’ survival were told.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.020
Catholics later claimed that the Virgin Mary
and angels caught them and gently placed them

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.020
on the ground.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.289
In response to this, protestants averred that
there was a large pile of fecal matter just

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:38.689
under the windows, which cushioned 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:54.340
their fall.
