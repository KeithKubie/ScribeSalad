internet archive and i was going to talk

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:28.420
internet archive and i was going to talk
 

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.320
internet archive and i was going to talk
about research services so i think some

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:34.330
about research services so i think some
 

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:46.590
about research services so i think some
people in the room are going to

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600
 
 

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.660
 
so next week asree saw a conference in

so next week asree saw a conference in
 

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.670
so next week asree saw a conference in
Denmark that'll be a lot of researchers

Denmark that'll be a lot of researchers
 

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.770
Denmark that'll be a lot of researchers
and we have been working on providing

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:53.780
and we have been working on providing
 

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.410
and we have been working on providing
research services in internet archive in

research services in internet archive in
 

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.690
research services in internet archive in
a couple of ways and I'll talk about

00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:58.700
a couple of ways and I'll talk about
 

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.760
a couple of ways and I'll talk about
first the background and then these and

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:00.770
first the background and then these and
 

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.540
first the background and then these and
walk through it so our goal we generally

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:04.550
walk through it so our goal we generally
 

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.550
walk through it so our goal we generally
in the past have worked mostly on large

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560
in the past have worked mostly on large

somewhere between 50 and 200 terabytes
 

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.750
somewhere between 50 and 200 terabytes
or something like that so you know I

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:28.760
or something like that so you know I
 

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.400

think when we talking about collection

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:30.410
think when we talking about collection
 

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.530

it's not just a cross curatorial efforts

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:34.940
it's not just a cross curatorial efforts
 

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.050
it's not just a cross curatorial efforts
but it's also across access methods and

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.060
but it's also across access methods and
 

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.810
but it's also across access methods and
I think web archiving has been very URL

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:40.820
I think web archiving has been very URL
 

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.940
I think web archiving has been very URL
Centrex in its access methods and so

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:42.950
Centrex in its access methods and so
 

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.430
Centrex in its access methods and so
we're trying to figure out ways and I

expertise so this is it we've launched

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:02.019
expertise so this is it we've launched
 

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:04.020
expertise so this is it we've launched
it we started with archive it because

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.030
it we started with archive it because
