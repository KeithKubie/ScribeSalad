second annual online conference for educator.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.520 position:61%
And I recognize some of your names from
other sessions and welcome you back.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.950
Our session, Eagle Eye Citizen;
Interactive Engagement with Civics

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.550 position:59%
and Primary Sources, will be recorded.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.010 position:64%
I would like to introduce our presenters.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.680 position:63%

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.130 position:64%
These inquiry based, asynchronous courses
model how historians analyze evidence.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.010
He also co-developed and
co-taught Teaching Hidden History,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.140 position:64%
a graduate course where students research
and create online history modules.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.710
Sleeter has published and
presented on promoting engaged

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.990 position:64%
and critical thinking in online learning.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.510 position:66%
Jessica Kilday teaches eighth grade
civics and economics in Northern Virginia.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.890 position:66%
Prior to teaching, she worked with social
studies teachers across grades four to 12.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.100
And then associate on several
Teaching American History grants,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.440
a professional development
program that focused on strategies

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.680
for incorporating primary sources
into classroom instruction.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.440 position:59%
Sara Collini is a PhD student in U.
S. History at George Mason University,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.630 position:69%
and a graduate research assistant at the Roy
Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.250 position:58%
Collini works on educational
projects, including Eagle Eye Citizen

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.920 position:70%
and a professional development website for
teachers at George Washington's Mount Vernon.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.510 position:56%
Welcome to all of you, and we're
looking forward to hearing from you.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; We're very excited to share this
project with you, Eagle Eye Citizen.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.400
What is an Eagle Eye Citizen?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.500
It's a excellent question.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.730
We're showing you a mock-up
right now of the site.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.650 position:66%
The site is in the process of being built.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.470
We hope to get it live so
everyone can use it by the spring.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.870
And then so, the pages you'll
be seeing are mock-ups.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.350 position:66%
Taking in the site, you notice at the
bottom there we've got big action buttons,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.270
Solve, Create.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.780
These are for the challenges
that will be a part of this site.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.300 position:63%
These challenges will use the enrich and
engaging Library of Congress sources.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.790 position:67%
And the third action button there is Teach.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.030
You'll be able to use these --
these challenges -- solve --

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.030 position:59%
solve and create challenges to support
teaching of civics and also history.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.770
These challenges are interactives.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.570 position:56%
They're not games, but we're looking
to make use of the ideas in gaming.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.660 position:73%
The techniques that work in gaming while still
emphasizing the close reading, the observation,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.000 position:58%
the reflection, the questioning of
sources, and the good civics content.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.880
As an example of some of the
game techniques we're using,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.560
if you look in the upper right
corner of the screen there.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.020 position:61%
We have -- you'll be able to login,
you have different badges you can earn,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.650 position:59%
different ranks where you complete
these challenges and create challenges

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.590 position:72%
and you'll be able to progress through the
site and build up your status as a legislator.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.150
We'll use that as incentive
to participate in the site.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.000 position:59%
As I mentioned, students will not only
have the ability to solve challenges,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.510 position:72%
but teachers will be able to create challenges

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.420 position:59%
and students will have the opportunity
to create challenges as well.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.780
The goal for the students
solving and creating challenges is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.670 position:56%
to learn content and skill building.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.640 position:56%
The challenges and the process for
creating them are carefully designed

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.450
to reflect the best practices and
research in teaching and learning.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.470
They emphasize 21st Century
skills such as close reading,

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.710 position:69%
critical thinking, sourcing, textualization.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.140
It'll allow teachers opportunities
to integrate content on Congress

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.620 position:72%
and civic participation across the curriculum.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.770 position:75%
Our goal is to make the site relevant to
teachers of civics, adaptable to a diverse range

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.820 position:61%
of middle school, high school classroom
settings with diverse learners.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.270
So it'll reflect national content,
technology, and skill standards.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.870 position:64%
It'll be flexible for -- to maximize
educational use in a variety of settings.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.280 position:66%
Along these lines, Eagle Eye Citizens will
include a section with specific strategies

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.430 position:63%
for teachers to incorporate solving and
creating challenges into their teaching.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.160 position:70%
So with that, I'm going to transition over
to Jessica Kilday, who is a classroom teacher

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.810 position:73%
and has some great things to share about how
Eagle Eye Citizen can be used in the classroom.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.410
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.370
So my name is Jessica.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.200
As Nate said, I currently teach
eighth grade civic and economics.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.690 position:67%
Before we tell you more about all of the
content that we're building in the website,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.030 position:75%
I want to get you guys started by getting you
actively participating to give you a better idea

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.730 position:69%
about how your students are going to be able
to engage with the content on this site.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.850 position:73%
So the screen that you're looking at right now,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.670
is one of our challenge types
and it's called Time After Time.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.600 position:67%
And the purpose of this challenge is to get
students thinking about sources and looking

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:32.080 position:69%
for clues that will allow them to notice the
chronology of events and how they unfolded.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.810
This is a mockup of the screen
that students will see

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.450 position:70%
when they are participating in the challenge.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.840 position:58%
There's going to be five sources that
they'll have the chance to review.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.570
Notice the buttons at the bottom.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.010 position:75%
They say look closer, so students will be able
to zoom in on details for each of those sources,

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.620 position:64%
and their job is going to be to drag them
into the numbered slots where you see one

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.730
through five to check which
sources are in the correct order.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.150 position:66%
So first, I'm going to show you the two
-- the sources that we're going to look at

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.970 position:75%
and the challenge we're going to do together all
have to do with the Women's Suffrage Movement.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.410 position:75%
So I'm first going to walk you through two of
the sources that are earliest in the chronology.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.660 position:61%
I actually had a chance to do this with
my students at the end of last year.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.320 position:66%
So the first two sources I'm going to show
you, and I'm just going to highlight some

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.830 position:67%
of the things that my students noticed when
they were looking closely at these sources

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.470 position:61%
and then I'll give you a chance to look
at the last three in the chronology.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.260
So the one that's on your screen
right now, the first source,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.830 position:56%
is from the Seneca Falls Convention.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.400
My students first noticed the date.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.700
That it's July 19th, 1848.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.640 position:61%
They also noticed the title at the top,
where it says The First Convention.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.980 position:70%
So these gave them clues that it was
probably something early on in the chronology

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.100
of the Women's Suffrage Movement.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.570
And then they would have gone to
read the text in the paragraph,

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.350
talking about the meeting
wanting to discuss women's rights.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.890 position:66%
The second source that's in the chronology
is the Trial of Susan B. Anthony.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.530 position:64%
This is a title page, so there's a lot
of headings, but students have the chance

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.920 position:63%
to notice, again, they noticed the date.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.720 position:66%
That it's something that happened in 1872.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.630 position:73%
And then many students also noticed that it was
a trial, so someone had done something wrong.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.790 position:64%
So they figured that it would have to be
somewhere in the middle of the chronology

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.030 position:69%
because it's an action that someone's taking
and then the response by the government is

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.040 position:59%
that this person was arrested and then
they noticed that there's a charge

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.470 position:59%
that this person was voting illegally.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:50.630 position:70%
The next three sources that I'm going to show
you -- so there's letters here A, B, and C,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.370
so I'm not going to tell
you the dates specifically.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.910 position:64%
I'm going to give you a chance to look at
the sources and see what you guys notice.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.220 position:69%
The first two that we looked at, the first
one was the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.110 position:75%
and then in 1872, the Trial of Susan B. Anthony.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.780 position:70%
So we're going to give you guys -- I'm going
to scroll through a larger screen of image A,

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:18.810 position:72%
image B, and image C and you'll have 30 second
to review what you can, so if you want to jot

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.910 position:59%
down notes to help you remember what
you notice, you're welcome to do that.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:29.250 position:75%
And then I'm going to ask you to identify which
source you think comes third in this chronology,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.010 position:58%
after the two that we just looked at.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:41.940 position:67%
Okay. I'm going to proceed to source B now.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.970 position:59%
And now the last source, the source C.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.930 position:56%
And it looks like -- I don't know if
you guys can see my results or not,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.740
but eight people selected image
C, five people selected image A,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:12.060
and one person selected image
B. So source C was correct,

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.650 position:75%
so those of you who selected source C -- this
is a Votes for Women postcard that was published

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.270 position:61%
in 1913, and to tell you a little about
what my students noticed and thought

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.820 position:58%
about when they looked at the source.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.240
They found this one the most
challenging because as you noticed,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.480 position:56%
there's no date immediately visible.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.890 position:73%
So a lot of students relied on trying to
figure out what the purpose of the document was

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.240 position:66%
and placing it in the chronological order.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.270 position:56%
Some people put it first because
they had all five sources to look at

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.440
and they thought maybe this
started the conversation

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.680 position:69%
for women's rights, so they put it up front.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.950 position:75%
Others put it in the middle because they thought
it was kind of continuing the conversation

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.290 position:61%
about women's rights, so they really
relied on what they thought the purpose

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.220 position:61%
of the document was to put it in order.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.580 position:59%
So now we have three in our chronology
here, the Seneca Falls Convention,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.880
the Trial of Susan B. Anthony,
and the Votes for Women postcard.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.560 position:58%
So now we have two left, sources A
and B. You've already looked at them,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.940 position:69%
so I'm not going to pull them back up
again, but I'll let you guys participate now

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.690 position:75%
that you know the third source, which one do you
think comes after the Votes For Women postcard?

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.270
Source A or source B?

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.900 position:59%
All right, that's a pretty even split.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.420
Almost exactly.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.180
Eight people selected image A.
Nine people selected image B.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.100 position:73%
and my students also had trouble with this one.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.810
The correct answer is actually
source A. For those of you

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.090 position:70%
who selected this one, it's Jeannette Rankin.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:42.260 position:75%
She was the first Congresswoman elected in 1916.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.950 position:66%
And students, when they looked at these
sources, they were often surprised to find

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.860 position:69%
that the first Congresswoman was elected
before women first gained the right to vote.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.570
Looking closely at the source,
many students noted the caption

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.650
that she was formerly a suffrage
worker, and so they concluded

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:02.090 position:75%
that the Women's Rights Movement had ended;
however, since voting rights are not established

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.600 position:72%
in the constitution, there were several
western states who had granted women the right

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.170 position:70%
to vote before it was established nationally.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.740 position:75%
So this also provides a good point of discussion
if you're a government teacher to talk

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.110 position:69%
about not only the Women's Rights Movement,
but also about the distinct responsibilities

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.680 position:59%
between State and Federal governments.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.910 position:63%
That they -- that the States really have
the right to determine voting rights

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.700
that are not in the constitution.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:29.240 position:59%
So then, finally the last source that
completes the chronology was source B,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:35.140 position:66%
which was of course, the ratification of
the 19th amendment which occurred in 1920.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.640 position:67%
The screen you're looking at now is the
completed challenge, so if students got all

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.810 position:67%
of the sources correct, in the right order,

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.640
the screenshot on the right
shows you what students will see.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.250 position:75%
They'll see the checkmarks in the far right-hand
corner, and they'll also have the opportunity

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.970 position:59%
to go back and view the full sources
in context at the Library of Congress.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.830 position:59%
And it has the dates attached to them.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.110
If students don't get them all
right, the smaller screenshot

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.520 position:69%
on the left shows that they can keep trying.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.940
They might have two or three
more images left to correct.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.990 position:59%
After students complete the challenge,
they can review what they missed

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.570
or see that they were successful.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.420 position:72%
They'll have the opportunity to reflect on the
sources and their experience in the challenge.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.490 position:56%
And this is where teachers can
really get information from students

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.890 position:59%
on what they noticed in the documents.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.350 position:69%
These are the questions my students
answered after they completed the challenge.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.120
So I could tell what details
they were picking up on

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.640
and which ones they weren't
-- they were missing.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.510 position:56%
So following the Library of Congress
primary source analysis questions,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.430 position:59%
students will be asked to observe what
kinds of things they noticed first,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:51.440 position:73%
what did they see when they looked more closely
in reviewing the sources, what else do you want

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.060 position:70%
to know, and what else do -- oh, what did you
learn, and what else did you want to know?

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.960
So in this challenge, many students
questioned why women gained --

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.060
why the first woman Congress --
why the first woman was elected

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.970 position:75%
to Congress before she earned the right to vote?

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.570
And this is data you'll have
access to as a teacher,

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.440 position:75%
as your students are completing these questions.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.120 position:63%
So now you've been able to participate
in what one of our challenges look like.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.360 position:75%
I also want to give you kind of a broader
perspective on what content you're going to find

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.580
and what this is going to
help you do in your classroom.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.900 position:64%
If you teach civics and government where
you have included all the primary sources

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.720 position:75%
in our database divided out by theme, so you can
search sources that are related to citizenship,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.690 position:58%
civil rights, the legislative branch,
elections, and the constitution.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:46.020 position:64%
History teachers will find it useful that
there's filters to divide primary sources

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.520 position:73%
out by time period, so if they're looking to --

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.560
to teach a specific topic,
the can do so that way.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.600 position:73%
History teachers might also use it to practice
close reading skills if they're introducing how

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.200 position:58%
to work with primary sources and also
review civics in historical context,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.820 position:63%
particularly if you're talking about the
founding period of American Government,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.690 position:69%
you can talk about the historical event,
but also about how our government functions.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:14.090 position:72%
You can also use it more generally to just
talk -- discuss primary source analysis skills

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.840 position:69%
and give students a chance to practice this.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.390 position:59%
Solving the challenges, students are
going to be asked to observe, reflect,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.700 position:56%
and question on the primary
sources that they're presented with.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.060
If students create challenges,
which that will also be an option

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.520
when you're working in the site.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.080 position:64%
Students will have to reflect on what
kind of hints and prompts would be useful

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.530 position:66%
for another student who's completing a
challenge that they are creating for them.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.440 position:59%
Some ways that you can incorporate
Eagle Eye Citizen into your classroom.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.990 position:75%
Depending on the time you have and the resources
you have available, you can use the challenges

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.690 position:73%
as a hook to a lesson that you're planning that
goes along with something else you already do.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:02.050 position:75%
So for example, the way we used Women's Suffrage
to start this off, it could stimulate inquiry

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.750
about a topic and you could just
use it to catch their attention.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:11.070 position:70%
You could also use it if you don't have a one
to one ratio of technology in your classroom.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.700 position:59%
You can also use it to model and
scaffold how to read a primary source.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:20.730 position:67%
So completing a Time After Time activity as
a class, you could go through each source

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.110
on your Promethean Board and talk
about what details students notice

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.610 position:63%
and put them the correct order together.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:32.850
You could also use it if you do
have a one to one technology ratio,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:39.160 position:66%
students can work individually or in pairs
to create challenges or solve challenges.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.950
So one of the things that will
be good about one of the things

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.310 position:72%
that they should enjoy is creating challenges.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:51.000 position:67%
They'll be able to see what sources we have
and figure out what sources can connect --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.770
they can make connections
between to put in order.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:16:00.120 position:72%
So for example, they could create a Time After
Time showing the expansion of voting rights,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.810 position:73%
not just for Women's Suffrage, but by age group
or other racial and background characteristics.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:12.780 position:75%
And next I'm going to turn it over to Kelly,
and she's going to talk to you a little bit more

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.130
about some of the other challenges
that we have in the classroom.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.290 position:72%
So as you hear more about the kinds of content
and primary sources we have on our site,

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.370 position:59%
be thinking about these different ways

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.930
that you can incorporate Eagle
Eye Citizen into your classroom.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:33.520 position:70%
&gt;&gt; This is Kelly Schrum and thanks to Jessica
for that great introduction to what happens

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.600
when you use this in the classroom.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.830 position:64%
So you've seen a Time After Time suffrage
challenge and when the site goes live,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:44.850 position:75%
there will be many more challenges to solve, but
part of what makes Eagle Eye Citizen unique and,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:50.250 position:75%
I think, especially engaging is that solving a
challenge is only one piece of the larger whole.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.700
So once you've -- I'm sorry.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.360 position:66%
Once you've solved a number of challenges,
you and your students can then go in

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.900 position:59%
and create challenges, for each other,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.680
for classes down the hall, for
classes across the country.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.140 position:56%
You, as a teacher can go in and
create challenges for your students.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.500
So what does this look like?

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.490 position:67%
So the screen you're seeing now is what you
would see if you decided from the home page

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.280 position:72%
or from within the site to create a challenge.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.030
So the first thing you would
do is choose a challenge type.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:22.510 position:69%
So we're going to start with Time After Time
because we just walked you through that one.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:27.810 position:73%
So as Jessica said, this teaches students about
change over time and about cause and effect.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.080 position:56%
The first step is to choose a theme.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.650 position:58%
So you can see here, you would choose
from Legislative Branch, Elections,

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.390 position:67%
Citizenship, Constitution, or Civil Rights.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:45.950 position:70%
And if you wanted to learn more about it, you
would click on this blue What's This button.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.480
You would then select your sources.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.590 position:63%
So this example, again, is the one that
Jessica showed, but you would click here

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.590 position:58%
on this plus sign to select your
third source in this particular case.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.970 position:66%
Once you do that, you can browse or
search through the primary source database

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.750 position:63%
and you can narrow it down by filtering.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.470
You can filter by topic,
by type, or by time period.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.310
And once you do that, you can
pick a particular source and say,

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.440
I want to look a little bit
more closely at this.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.590 position:59%
I want to know more about this source.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:23.060 position:58%
So here on this page you can learn
the basic metadata, about the source,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:28.030 position:66%
and you can actually link to the source as
well if you want to see it on the Library

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.300 position:66%
of Congress' site, but if you want to know
even more, we're really encouraging people

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.600
to look closer, so you would click
on this green Look Closer button,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.580
and you'll get a larger version.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.220
And explore the source carefully.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.040 position:75%
And this look closer idea, as we've been saying,
is really kind of essential to the whole theme

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.090 position:69%
of the project and we're trying to
encourage students to look closer at Library

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.620
of Congress primary sources
in lots of different ways.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.910 position:69%
Once you've selected that particular source,
you're going to pick a hint for the source,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.520
and that would help students who
are going through the challenge

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.200
if they need a little bit
more help thinking about how

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.420 position:66%
to analyze this particular primary source.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.710 position:69%
Once you've picked all five of your sources,
you get to pick a topic for the challenge.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.040 position:66%
So the topics are connected to the
sources and you're going to pick the topic

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.570 position:67%
that you think most closely works with that
particular challenge that you're creating.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.430 position:73%
Once you've picked the topic, that will help
users find the challenge when they're searching

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.900
or browsing and it provides some
contextual information at the end.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.720
And then finally, you're going
to pick a challenge name.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:38.630 position:67%
And if you see this little lever right here
-- if you didn't like your three options,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.860
you could pull the lever and
you'd get some additional options.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.780
When you're done with all that, you
get to review your whole challenge.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.100
So at this point, you might decide,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.760
well I really want a different
source for my third source.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.950 position:64%
You can go back and edit and change that.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.140
You can review it.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.950
All of the pieces.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.550
And then you can publish it.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.810 position:61%
And at the end, as Jessica showed, your
students are then asked to reflect.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.290 position:67%
So if a student is creating this challenge,

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.710
they're going to reflect
on the learning process.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.320
What did you want people
solving this challenge to learn?

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.760 position:73%
And the answers are saved for you, the teacher.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.940 position:63%
They will not be publicly available, but
it's a way for you to assess and connect

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.430 position:63%
with your students and what they're
thinking as they're creating challenges.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.110
And finally, when they've completed
and published their challenge

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:33.560 position:59%
and submitted their feedback, they
get a challenge complete sign -- page.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.890
And they've earned a certain
number of votes for participating.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.060 position:56%
And as a teacher, as I said, you can
create challenges for your students,

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.860 position:64%
but once your students are familiar, they
can go in and create challenges as well.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.730
So there are two additional
challenge types, and I'm just going

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.090 position:73%
to quickly walk you through and introduce them.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.720 position:56%
The first one is called Big Picture.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.460
So solving a Big Picture challenge
is really about looking closer.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.640 position:72%
So it's about figuring out where the
important information lives on different kinds

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.780 position:66%
of primary sources and it's also
thinking about close reading certain parts

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.840 position:63%
of primary sources as well as the whole.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.870
So if you were to start by
solving a Big Picture challenge,

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:17.590
you would see two squares turned
over and you would hit submit.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:22.790 position:63%
And then you would -- oh sorry -- then
you would actually select a third square

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.480
to help uncover the meaning.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.510 position:72%
So you have to figure out where in this source
might the most important information be,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.510
and then you're going to try to
answer the question on the right.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.570 position:72%
So in this case it asks, this poster is about?

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.290
And you would click the one you
think is the correct answer based

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.300
on the information you have.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.460
If you get it correct, the
whole source will reveal itself.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.630
And if it's incorrect, you
get a try again message.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:55.080 position:72%
Two more squares will turn over automatically
and then the person solving the challenge gets

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.480
to pick another square to
turn over and then again,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.530 position:75%
they get a second chance to answer the question.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:06.720 position:73%
When students complete the challenge, they
then reflect on the process, and these answers,

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.910 position:61%
as we said earlier, are really designed
for you to review as an assessment tool

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.830
and to help students show
their thinking process.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.150 position:66%
So to really capture the student thinking,
but they will not be shared publicly.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:22.700 position:73%
They'll be specifically available for you as
the teacher who set up a class to use the site.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:29.990 position:67%
At the end of the challenge is a bird's eye
view and this also is context on the theme

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:35.250 position:69%
and the topic for this particular
challenge, as well as links to other Library

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.580
of Congress resources that
are connected to this.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.950
As you can see on the right,
students can then keep going.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:48.560 position:61%
So they can earn more votes by sharing,
by rating this particular challenge,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.820
by solving another challenge,
or by creating one of their own.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.450 position:70%
And one of my favorite parts with Big Picture
is when you go in to create a challenge,

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.720
you get to pick the two squares
that are turned over at the start.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.910 position:64%
So really have to kind of think
through, well, what are the pros and cons

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.550 position:66%
of picking this square verses that square.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.780
You want to provide enough
information to entice the viewer,

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.790
but not so much that you give
away the answer at first glance.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.120 position:73%
As we've learned from working on this project
for the last year, creating challenges is a lot

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.940
of hard work, but it's also a lot
of fun and it's very engaging.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.610
So the last challenge type
is called Sort it Out.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.630 position:56%
And this one is really about making
connections, thinking about context,

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:37.420 position:67%
and how different sources can work together
to explore issues in civics and history.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.590 position:73%
So Sort it Out asks users to sort five sources.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.830
You see them in a stack over here.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:51.470 position:72%
To sort these five sources into two categories
reflecting their historical and civic context.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.360 position:56%
So in this case we have the American
Revolution and the Civil War.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:01.080 position:72%
And students can look closer at each source to
examine it, to learn more, they can get a hint

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.010 position:67%
to help them look closer at this particular
source, and then they're going to drag

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.490 position:67%
that source into one category or the other.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.980 position:56%
If you put it in the wrong category,
it pops to the bottom of the deck

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.100
and then they have another
chance to sort it again,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.120 position:66%
after they finish the rest of the sources.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.720
So this is what it looks like
when you've gotten them all right.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.770 position:56%
So what do you get for all this work
solving and creating challenges?

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.760 position:66%
This is the profile page, and as Nate
mentioned, these are all from the mockups.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.290
We're building the site right now
so we can't show it to you live.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:41.560 position:70%
But when it is live and you're logged in,
you get votes that change your rank over here

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.530 position:73%
on the right, so you can move from a member of
Congress all the way up to a Master Legislator.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:54.070 position:64%
You can also earn votes by solving or
creating challenges on particular topics.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.950
Here you can see your challenges,
and you earn votes also

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:03.770 position:58%
by other people rating your
challenge and solving your challenge.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.140 position:58%
So now Sara's going to walk you
through some of the wonderful Library

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.720
of Congress primary sources
in Eagle Eye Citizen.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.870
And there are many more to come.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.820 position:73%
And we're hoping that you'll help us with that.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.180 position:58%
So we'll talk a little bit more about
that at the end of our presentation.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you Kelly.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:25.380 position:61%
So as Kelly said, we want to show you
a small sampling of the different kinds

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:31.450 position:73%
of primary sources from the Library of Congress
that are in Eagle Eye Citizen, that students

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.720 position:73%
and teachers can explore in civics and history.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.240 position:72%
So in selecting these sources, we really aimed
for ones that are engaging, and exciting,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.580 position:58%
and represent a mix of historical and
more contemporary topics and issues.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:53.860
And the main primary source formats
are audio, video, text, and image.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:26:00.600 position:69%
And include sheet music, speeches, newspaper
articles, political campaign posters,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.400 position:69%
photographs, and legislation, and many more.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:11.460 position:72%
So the following slides, I'm going to show you
a selection of primary sources in the database

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:16.250
to give you an idea of the breadth
of sources available in civics

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.460 position:64%
and history already in Eagle Eye Citizen.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:26.350 position:70%
So the first is the cover for sheet music for
a 19th Century campaign song called The Boys

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:32.200 position:67%
in Blue Will See it Through, for Rutherford
B. Hayes and we have a modern recording

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.990
of this music to really engage
students with this type of source.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:42.410 position:66%
So the link to audio at the bottom of
this slide will take you to the recording.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:48.020 position:69%
So I think that this is a really great
source for students to learn about elections

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.180
and campaigning and how they
evolved throughout history.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:58.970 position:72%
So the next source format are videos, and this
is a video clip of Teddy Roosevelt campaigning

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.400
in 1912 for the Progressive party.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:08.690 position:66%
We can't play the clip here, but this type
of source also really excites students

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:14.960 position:70%
about elections, the Progressive party, third
parties in general, as well as platforms

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.430
in campaigns and the role of
technology in campaigning.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:27.130 position:63%
There are also many text sources in
Eagle Eye, including newspaper articles.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:34.910 position:66%
This one in particular is from a Minnesota
newspaper discussing Jim Crow segregation

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.420
in the south and the Plessy
versus Ferguson case.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.450
This type of source really connects
to the constitution and checks

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.950 position:58%
and balances as well as civil rights.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.750
Another more contemporary text
source is of course, legislation.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.850
And many of these sources
come from congress.gov.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:59.170
This is the first page of the
Help America Vote Act from 2002

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.020 position:59%
that aims to better facilitate voting.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.840 position:64%
And this source of course, connects to
voting and election, but can also be used

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:13.970 position:64%
in a more historical challenge about the
evolution of voting in the United States.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:20.260 position:75%
So moving on to images, many, many of the
primary sources in Eagle Eye Citizen are images.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:28.020 position:66%
And this one in particular is a photograph
of the March on Washington from 1963.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.720 position:58%
And it is very captivating, as you
can see, and really engages students,

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.540
not only in civil rights,
but also freedom of assembly,

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.120 position:67%
freedom of speech, and civic participation.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:45.230 position:59%
So the last source example that I'm
going to show you is campaign posters,

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:51.600 position:66%
and this one for example is of Shirley
Chisholm campaigning for president in 1972

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:57.810 position:75%
and she was the first African-American candidate
for a major party nomination and the first woman

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:02.080 position:67%
to run for the Democratic Party nomination.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.720
So all of these sources shown here
are only a small sampling of the

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.810
over 100 primary sources already
in Eagle Eye Citizen, that students

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.820
and teachers can use to explore
civics and history.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.120 position:63%
So now I'm going to turn it over to
Nate to discuss how you can get involved

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.510 position:58%
with this project and even
contribute more primary source ideas.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.230
&gt;&gt; Thanks Sara.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.550 position:56%
Yes, well as I hope you can tell, we
are very excited about this project,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.160
excited about Eagle Eye Citizen,
and we'd be extremely excited

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.260
for you to get involved as well.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.500 position:64%
The link on the page is to a Google Form.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.870
If you'd like to be the first

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.730
to know [inaudible] the site goes
live, you can sign up for that.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:49.590 position:63%
You would love to contribute, some great
primary sources that maybe you're using

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.830
in your classroom that you've
seen being used very successfully,

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.480
we would love to know about them.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.700 position:67%
And we would love to have people to pilot
test the site before it actually goes live.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.880
As I said, the site will be
launched sometime in the spring,

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.030 position:70%
and if you want to be among the first to know
when it goes live, please fill out our form

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.900 position:59%
and if you have anything you want to
share, we would love to hear from you.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:20.090 position:58%
That concludes our presentation and I
want to thank you all for joining us.
