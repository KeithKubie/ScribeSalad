00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Years ago I had a boyfriend tell me

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.840
And because I was an insecure idiot who was desperately afraid of losing him

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.860
I said

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.820
Sure.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.500
The problem with open relationships, I've found, is that unless both of you

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.740
actually want to be in one and are great at honest and constructive communication

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820
Dope okay, here are the rules:

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.560
Sex with anyone we want?  Ok.  Yeah.  Ok.  Ok.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.900
Secrecy?  Ok!  Yeah.  No, Secrecy is cool.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.420
Unless, I want to hear about

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.180
the people you're having sex with.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.060
(explosion)

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.360
I should have spoken up in that moment and told him that I believe in monogamy.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.120
And I don't think I can make an open relationship work.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.740
Instead I decided to silently deal with the jealousy and the bitterness

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.700
that came with knowing my partner was having sex with someone else.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.040
And it was my own fault for not even saying that I wasn't comfortable with it.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.960
So do open relationships work?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.900
In the one experience where I didn't want to do it and I sucked it up and tried anyway

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.100
Uh, no.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.140
But I don't know many people who have had open relationships that have been successful

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.280
because for the most part, human beings tend to get jealous.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.900
You look so cute and fluffly.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.120
You've been hanging out with Congress a lot lately.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.640
Uh.  Yeah.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.120
Mhmmm.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.900
Mhm.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
However I do believe that there are people out there in the world who prefer open relationships.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.620
And if those people found each other and could make rules that they agreed on

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.320
and were honest and loving

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.840
I think it could work.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.680
I gotta be honest.  I want an open relationship.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.420
(gasps)

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.080
I want an open relationship!

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.100
We found a love that works for us!

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.880
But for me, it's monogamy.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060
I don't have time for more than one boyfriend.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.400
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.140
Lookin' real fine baby!

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.220
Hey boy!  Give me your dick!

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.720
(gasps)

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.000
I said give me yo dick.  Right now.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.820
No.  Anything but my dick!
