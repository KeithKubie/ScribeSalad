 You already know that the word "language" refers to our ability to communicate with 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.119
 Speech. But we saw that exactly ability, turned into a quagmire. 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.640
 So let us now turn to the other thing that we mean by "language" - as you know, the specific languages 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.300
 We speak their own words, their own rules and their own pronunciation. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:37.000
 I mean, English is a language, is not it? This is English! But that's the case. 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.800
 Back in time, this was English. Even further, we call this English too. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.890
 Wait, I understand. This is the old English, this is the middle English, this is modern English. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.100
 So these three languages ​​or three different stages of the same language? 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.579
 But I know that history is more forever than it wants to be. So let's just stick 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:14.270
 Present. Here are some key words in English. These are the same words in full 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.670
 Different tone of English. They have two dialects, if you get the same language 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.479
 They occur in different ways by different groups of people, we call these different dialects. 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.400
 Let's translate these words into Norwegian (Norwegian). Here's how we write 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.979
 The same words are in Swedish (Swedish). So, Swedish and Norwegian are different languages, 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.100
 But Britons and Scots have different dialects of the same language? 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.189
 Where is the line between dialect and language anyway? Is it just arbitrary or conventional? 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.209
 It may eventually be pressed through the Max Weinreich phrase passed. During the lecture 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:06.009
 A series he gave in the 1940s, a member of his audience made a witty note, "Language is tone 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.470
 With the army and navy. "If so, it is equally about politics and power 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.069
 About rules. 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 Language vs. Languages, Languages ​​Versus Dialects ... Oh, what a mess your Jar! And 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.689
 However, I welcome you to my YouTube channel. Sign up if you want to learn more, because 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.900
 From the looks we got seriously stuff to sort together.
