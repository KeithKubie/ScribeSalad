00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.280
Plot the real zeroes of the
given polynomial on the graph

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.780
below.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.490
And they give us p of x
is equal to 2 x to the 5th

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.526
plus x to the 4th
minus 2x minus 1.

00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:12.150
And when they say
plot it, they give us

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.150
this little widget here.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.770
Where if we click at any point
on this, we get our point.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.830
And we get as many
points as we would like.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.960
And we can drag
these points around.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.990
Or if we don't want
these points anymore,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.510
we can just dump them
in this little trash

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.950
bin at the bottom right.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.180
So let's think about what
the zeroes of this polynomial

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.900
actually are.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680
And to do that I'll
take my scratch pad out.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.450
And this is a little
daunting at first.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
This is a 5th degree
polynomial here.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.976
Factoring 5th degree polynomials
is really something of an art.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.350
You're really going to have
to sit and look for patterns.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.510
If they're actually expecting
you to find the zeroes here

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.510
without the help of a
computer, without the help

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.025
of a calculator, then there
must be some type of pattern

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.150
that you can pick out here.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.550
So let me just rewrite p of x.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.860
So p of x is equal to 2 x to
the 5th plus x to the 4th minus

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310
2x minus 1.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.080
And one way that's
typically seen

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.330
when you're trying to factor
this type of polynomial

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.460
is to try to essentially undo
the distributive property

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.800
a few times.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.740
And if you want to relate it
to techniques for factoring

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.150
quadratics, it's essentially
factoring by grouping.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.880
So for example, you
see a 2x minus 1,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.090
or something that looks like
a 2x minus 1 right over here.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.660
And over here you have a 2x
to the 5th plus x to the 4th.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.540
So you have a 2x
of a higher degree

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.110
term plus a 1 x of
a one degree lower.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.440
So there seems to be
some type of a pattern.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.010
2 times x of a
higher degree-- this

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.750
is a first degree
term-- minus 1 times--

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.882
you could do this as x to the
0-- of a lower degree term.

00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:55.590
And so let's think
about it a little bit.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.250
What happens if we essentially
try to group these two terms,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.450
and we group these two
terms right over here.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.214
And we try to
factor out anything

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:07.880
to essentially clean
it up a little bit,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.690
to see if we can
make sense of it.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.750
Well these two terms, their
greatest common factor

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.730
is x to the 4th.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.960
We could write this as x
to the 4th times 2x plus 1.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.300
And this should get us excited
because this looks pretty

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.840
close to that,
especially if we were

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.890
to factor out a negative 1 here.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.010
So we could factor
out a negative 1.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.090
And then this is
going to be 2x plus 1.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.460
And that's exciting because now
we can factor out a 2 x plus 1

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.680
from each of these terms.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.140
So you have a 2x plus 1.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.030
We're gonna factor
both of these out,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.110
to get 2x plus 1-- which
we just factored out.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.410
And if you factored it out
of this term right over here,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.720
you're left with x to the 4th.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.180
And if you factor
it out this term,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.810
you're left with
just the minus 1.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.170
Minus 1.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.240
And now this is exciting
because 2x plus 1,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.790
this is pretty
easy to figure out

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.670
when does this thing equal 0.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.330
And we'll do that
in a little bit.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.100
And this is pretty
easy to factor.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.720
This is a difference of squares.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.780
This right over here
can be rewritten

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:29.700
as x squared plus 1
times x squared minus 1.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.880
And of course we still have
this 2x plus 1 out front.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.590
2x plus 1.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.220
And once again we have
another difference of squares.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.480
We have another difference
of squares right over here.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.490
That's the same thing as
x plus 1 times x minus 1.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.320
And let me just write all the
other parts of this expression.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.450
x squared plus 1.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.120
And you have 2x plus 1.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.160
2x plus 1.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.750
And I think I factored
p of x about as much

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.830
as could be reasonably expected.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.099
So p of x is equal to
all of this business.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.640
And remember, the whole reason
why I wanted to factor it is I

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.330
wanted to figure out when
does this thing equal 0?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.680
So if p of x can be
expressed as the product

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.940
of a bunch of these
expressions, it's

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.000
going to be 0 whenever at
least one of these expressions

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.790
is equal to 0.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.250
If any of these
is equal to 0 then

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.350
that's just going to make this
whole expression equal to 0.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.150
So when does 2x plus 1 equal 0?

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.836
So 2x plus 1 is equal to zero.

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:30.710
Well you could probably
do this in your head,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.000
or we could do it
systematically as well.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.330
Subtract 1 from both sides,
you get 2x equals negative 1.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.180
Divide both sides by 2, you
get x is equal to negative 1/2.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.730
So when x equals negative 1/2--
or one way to think about it,

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.170
p of negative 1/2 is 0.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.300
So p of negative 1/2 is 0.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.200
So this right over here
is a point on the graph,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.910
and it is one of
the real zeroes.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.315
Now we could try to solve this.
x squared plus 1 equals 0,

00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:01.190
and I'll just write it
down just to show you.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.710
If we try to isolate
the x term on the left--

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.210
subtract 1 from
both sides-- you get

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.160
x squared is equal
to negative 1.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.090
Now if we were to start thinking
about imaginary numbers,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.230
we could think about
what x could be.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.320
But they want us to
find the real zeroes.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.380
The real zeroes.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.450
So there's no real
number where that number

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.270
squared is equal to negative 1.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.530
So we're not going to
get any real zeroes

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.550
by setting this
thing equal to 0.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.980
There's no real number
x where x squared

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.840
plus 1 is going
to be equal to 0.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.770
Now let's think about when x
plus 1 could be equal to 0.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.340
We'll subtract 1
from both sides.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.260
You get x is equal
to negative 1.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.320
So p of negative 1
is going to be 0.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.720
So that's another one of
our zeroes right there.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.770
And then finally let's
think about when x minus 1

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.630
is equal to 0.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.960
We'll add one to both sides.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.450
X is equal to 1.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:02.540
So we have another real
0 right over there.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.960
And so we could plot them.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.800
So it's negative 1,
negative 1/2, and 1.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.820
So it's negative 1,
negative 1/2 and 1.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.180
And we can check our
answer, and we got it right.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.736
Now one thing that might be
bugging you, is like hey Sal,

00:06:19.736 --> 00:06:22.110
you just happened to group
this in exactly the right way.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.984
What if I try to group
it in a different way?

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:27.270
What if I tried to-- Well
actually let's try to do that.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.870
That could be interesting.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.280
Just to show you that
this isn't voodoo.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.150
And actually there's
several ways to get there.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.570
There's several
ways to get there.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.840
So what if instead of writing
it like this, where you're

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.220
writing it kind of
in the highest degree

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.690
term and the next highest
degree and so on and so forth,

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.570
you were to write it like
this: p of x is equal to 2 x

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.390
to the 5th minus 2x plus
x to the 4th minus 1.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.270
Well actually, even
this way you could

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.734
do a fairly
interesting grouping.

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:00.150
If you grouped
these two together,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.410
you see that they have
the common factor 2 x.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.780
You factor 2x out, you get 2x
times x to the 4th minus 1.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.730
And I think you see
what's going on.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.850
And then this can be
rewritten as plus 1 times x

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.810
to the 4th minus 1.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.960
Minus 1.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.590
And now you can factor out
an x to the 4th minus 1.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.340
And you're left with-- I'll
do this in a neutral color--

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.470
x to the fourth
minus 1 times 2 x

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.680
plus 1, which is much
easier to factor now.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.680
A difference of squares.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.360
Exactly what we did
the last time around.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.776
So there are several
ways that you

00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:38.430
could have reasonably
grouped this, and reasonably

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.580
undone the
distributive property.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.809
But I do admit it is
something of an art.

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:45.600
You really just have
to play around in see,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.890
well let's group
the first two terms,

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.706
let's see if there's
a common factor here.

00:07:48.706 --> 00:07:50.080
Let's group the
second two terms,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.830
let's see if there's
a common factor here.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.030
Hey, once we factor out
those common factors,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.260
it looks like both
of these two terms

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.250
have this common
expression as a factor.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.590
And then you could start
to factor that out.
