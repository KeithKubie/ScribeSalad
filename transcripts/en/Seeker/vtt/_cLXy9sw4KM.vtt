00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.840
Batteries suck, you know it, I know it, we
all know it and it's the one thing everyone

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.450
on Earth can come together and sing about.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.510
Will this new technology be the hero we deserve?

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.869
Hey friends, countrymen, battery haters, this
is DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.920
A battery is typically two metals, one that
gives up electrons (called an anode), and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.920
one that takes them (called a cathode), connected
through an electrolyte -- something that can

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.619
move the electrons around easily.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.560
Electrolytes are usually liquids or gels,
but isn't keeping a liquid in your laptop

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.560
dangerous?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.100
What if we could just get rid of it altogether?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.250
Well that’s the challenge.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.080
Because big batteries, like those in your
car, have a liquid electrolyte they require

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.720
a rigid plastic or metal casing to keep the
battery connections stable.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.100
But most batteries you use are Lithium-ion,
where the cathode and anode are connected

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.830
using an electrolyte made of an organic gel,
called a polymer.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.810
Polymer electrolytes can use light-weight
plastic casings, and can be made in different

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.210
sizes which is great for new electric cars
and portable devices.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.730
But there's a problem…

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.350
Their tendency to explode.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.170
Electrons flow from the anode to the cathode
through your device, and that's how you're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.150
probably watching this right now.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.490
But Lithium is highly reactive, and if the
battery casing is punctured the reaction of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.829
lithium with the moisture in the air can cause
the gel electrolyte to catch fire…

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.229
OR as my chem teacher used to say, an "energetic
reaction.”

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.509
Also, as an added suck, lithium-Ion batteries
also don't work well in the cold, and because

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.619
the gel is organic the more times they're
used, the less charge the batteries can move.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.420
But the future is coming!!

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.590
The lithium works great, and the electrons
are doing their job, but the gel is the problem.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.539
So, scientists are working on a way to get
that gel OUTTA THERE.

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.149
Every battery since Alessandro Volta's original
voltaic cell of copper, zinc and a salt bridge

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.009
-- has used liquid or gel components.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.640
But what if we could make an electrolyte that
was just a solid piece?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.060
Research published in Nature Materials might
have done just that!

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.539
IT'S LIKE A SCIENCE MIRACLE!

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.170
Building on another paper from 2011, researchers
created a solid electrolyte that can move

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.880
the electrons just like the gel, but without
the mess of explosions, sensitivity to cold,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.250
and, you know… gel.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.210
They did this using a 3D tetrahedral framework
of Lithium, Germanium, Phosphorous, and Sulfur.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.390
The framework lets electrons move through
it, hopping from one molecule to the next

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.220
for hundreds of thousands of charge cycles!

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.360
Because it's solid, you could "drive a nail
through the battery," and it won't explode

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.580
-- nice.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.990
And surprisingly, it functioned at negative
20 fahrenheit (-29C)!

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.870
One of the researchers commented that this
design could be "almost a perfect battery,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.890
solving most of the remaining issues [that
batteries have]*."

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.890
It's super experimental.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.330
So far, the design is very limited and can
only produce 5 volts… the iPhone 5 battery

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.570
put out 3.8 volts.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.300
Obviously, more research is needed.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.960
And other papers are coming out with alternative
solid electrolytes, but this one is promising.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.780
On top of ALL that, scientists figure, because
they don't have to accommodate a gel, they

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.720
can add MORE individual cells of power, upping
battery density by 20 to 30 percent, all while

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.340
bringing down overall cost.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.690
Meaning these potential solid-state batteries
will be safer, cheaper and will last longer.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.750
Sounds hot.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.640
Lithium-Ion batteries are rechargeable because
they've been designed that way, but why aren't

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.170
all batteries rechargeable?

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:35.830
I've got the answer for you RIGHT HERE!

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.860
Do you hate batteries?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.900
Want a solid state one for your phone?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.650
