00:00:00.575 --> 00:00:04.343
- [Instructor] Let F be a
twice differentiable function.

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:07.022
One of these graphs is the graph of F.

00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:08.707
One is of F prime.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:11.571
And one is of the second derivative of F

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.236
F prime prime.

00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:16.596
Match each function with
its appropriate graph.

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:17.980
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.277
and try to figure out which of these is F,

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:21.684
which of these is F prime,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.450
and which of these is F prime prime.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.000
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.353
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:31.155
One way to think about it is

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.083
if these were graphs of polynomials

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:37.623
the then F would be a
higher degree polynomial.

00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:41.459
So you have F, if you were to
take the derivative of that

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:43.192
you'd get to F prime.

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:44.930
So this is derivative with respect to X.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.315
And if you take the derivative
with respect to X of that

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.500
you get F prime prime.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.106
So, whatever degree polynomial this is

00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:53.513
if it is a polynomial,

00:00:53.513 --> 00:00:54.752
this will be a lower degree

00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:57.481
and then this would be an
even lower degree polynomial.

00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.911
So let's see if we can
make sense of these graphs

00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:01.236
using that lens.

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.455
Well, one way to think about it is

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:05.302
higher degree polynomials are gonna have

00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:08.321
more minima or more potential minimum

00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.598
or maximum points.

00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:11.277
And it looks like B here

00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:13.412
has the most minima and maxima.

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:15.012
A has the second most.

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:17.000
And then C has the third most.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.932
So my first hypothesis

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:20.573
is that

00:01:20.573 --> 00:01:22.751
what we have right over here B

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:25.106
that this is the graph of F

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:27.689
that A is the graph of F prime.

00:01:28.617 --> 00:01:31.986
And that C is the graph
of the second derivative

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:33.460
F prime prime.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.995
So that's just my hypothesis.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:37.530
Now let's see if it actually makes sense.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.828
And what I can do is

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:40.882
I can look at points where I know

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:42.719
that the derivative would be zero.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.969
And then look at the derivative

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.600
to confirm what I think is the derivative

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.854
to confirm that they are.

00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:48.786
And then I could also look at trends.

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:51.241
So let's say, if this is F, so let's say

00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:52.750
and that was just my initial guess

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.236
that this is gonna be the function F.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.979
So let's see, I have a slope of zero,

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.351
a slope of a tangent line
of zero right over there.

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.672
So slope of zero right over there.

00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:06.235
I have a slope of zero

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:07.630
right over there.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.629
I have a slope of zero

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.992
right over there.

00:02:10.992 --> 00:02:14.623
I have a slope of zero,
a horizontal tangent line

00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:16.069
right over there.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.275
So let's see.

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:19.342
If this is the derivative

00:02:19.342 --> 00:02:22.197
then this function should be equal to zero

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:23.678
at this X value,

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:24.876
this X value,

00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:25.920
this X value,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.096
and this X value.

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:28.592
Because the slope of the tangent line

00:02:28.592 --> 00:02:29.871
at those X values

00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:31.449
looks like zero.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.540
So this function is equal to zero here.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.419
Here.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:36.297
Here.

00:02:36.297 --> 00:02:37.130
And, here.

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:40.944
Well these seem to coincide.

00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:43.428
This coincides with this.

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.245
This coincides with that.

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.435
And that coincides with that.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:49.644
And then that coincides with that.

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:52.125
So I'm already feeling
pretty good about it.

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:53.490
So now let's see if

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.547
this F prime prime, what
I think is F prime prime

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:58.905
is indeed the derivative of F prime.

00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:01.676
So, it's got a minimum
point right over here

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:04.498
it looks like the slope of
the tangent line here is zero

00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:06.324
let me do this in a different color.

00:03:06.324 --> 00:03:08.564
So this looks like we have a slope

00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:09.732
of zero there.

00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:12.117
It looks like we have a slope of zero

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.505
right over there.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.450
And it looks like we have a slope of zero

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.368
right

00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:17.616
over there.

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:20.071
So at that point for that X value.

00:03:20.071 --> 00:03:20.943
That X value.

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:22.028
And that X value.

00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:24.028
And we see that this function is indeed

00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:26.465
equal to zero, right over here.

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:27.649
Right over here.

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:28.792
And right over here.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.972
At the exact same X values.

00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:33.017
So, based on what I just said,

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:35.084
I would feel pretty good if
I was under time pressure

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.899
I'd already feel pretty good about

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.196
how I'd match things up.

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:41.149
But you could also look
at trends between points.

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.316
So for example

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.434
let me pick out a trend.

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:46.767
So, between this

00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:50.580
between this maximum point

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.135
and this minimum point

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:53.292
at first,

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:55.292
the slope is decreasing.

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:58.552
So the slope is getting more

00:03:58.552 --> 00:03:59.820
and more negative.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.095
And you see from here

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:05.059
to here is indeed getting
more and more negative.

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.008
And then it starts getting
more and more positive

00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:08.737
starting right about here.

00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:11.372
So that trend seems to be consistent.

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:13.674
And so you could look for
these trends, as well.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:15.739
But I find looking at
the minima and maxima

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.122
and where you see

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:18.972
horizontal tangent lines,

00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:21.405
or where the slope of
the tangent line is zero,

00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:23.534
those are the easiest to
test for your derivatives

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:26.201
or for your second derivatives.
