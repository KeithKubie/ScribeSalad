00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.190
and the relationship of benzodiazepine
receptors to anxiety then he wrote about

initiative and and I was so excited to

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050
initiative and and I was so excited to
 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.570
initiative and and I was so excited to
hear about brain hub and to learn more

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580
hear about brain hub and to learn more

about it but the other reason honestly

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479
about it but the other reason honestly
 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.260
about it but the other reason honestly

what's the draw and and I'm presuming
 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.770
what's the draw and and I'm presuming
that you'll have a current president of

that we always think about the brain and

that we always think about the brain and
 

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.379

a material scientists together with
neuro scientists and in six months they

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:25.129
neuro scientists and in six months they
 

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.700
neuro scientists and in six months they
had transformed neuroanatomy more than

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:27.710
had transformed neuroanatomy more than
 

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.490
had transformed neuroanatomy more than
anybody in the last five decades that's

again the public health mandate is so

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:37.990
again the public health mandate is so
 

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:42.190
again the public health mandate is so
urgent the interest is so urgent the

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200
urgent the interest is so urgent the
 

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.889

funding should be forthcoming this is

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:44.899
funding should be forthcoming this is
 

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:46.899
funding should be forthcoming this is
really the right time to do this and I

00:34:46.899 --> 00:34:46.909
really the right time to do this and I
 

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.000
really the right time to do this and I
really believe this is probably the

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.010
really believe this is probably the
 

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.490
really believe this is probably the
right place to make that happen thanks

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:51.500
right place to make that happen thanks
 

00:34:51.500 --> 00:35:03.930
right place to make that happen thanks
very much for your attention

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:03.940
