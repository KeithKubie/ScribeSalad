NATHAN STRUE: Hey, everyone.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.260
Really excited to be
here today and give you

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.700
a talk about design, which
is just an amazing thing

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.010
to talk about.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.850
My name's Nathan Streu.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.900
I lead Product UX for
the Google Play product.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.590
And joining me on stage is
Taddeo Zacchini and Will

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.130
Kiefer, both colleagues of
mine who both work on Play.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.010
So here we are.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.800
Lovely photos.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.860
So pretty much
everyone in the room

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.850
should be familiar with
the Google Play product.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.240
And if you're not, we
are not just a store.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.370
We are responsible for all of
the other media applications

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.950
that make up the Play family.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.040
And we're not just on
the Android platform.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.380
We also work on iOS
and on the web as well.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.540
And so at this stage
in your I/O experience,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.980
you should be
very, very familiar

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.970
with material design
at this point,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.690
or at least somewhat
familiar from the keynote

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.540
and other sessions.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.930
So we're here today to talk
about how, as an apps team,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.480
we have been approaching the
material design within Play.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.460
And hopefully get
you guys on a path

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.640
to purposeful and considered
design improvements.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.920
And we're not here today to
reveal the new Play products

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.879
or features or to
announce a ship date.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:37.420
But what we want to
do is to give you

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.430
a peek behind the curtain
about how our team is thinking

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.260
about the same challenges
and opportunities

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.510
you encounter as you are
addressing a robust platform

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.390
update, such as L. And so
all of the mocks in motion

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.730
studies we're going to show
you today are just iterative.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.060
They don't represent
the final products,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.290
and we're continuing to work
hard over the coming months

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.320
to bring this vision
to life for you.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.540
And so you're familiar
with the driving principles

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.419
of the new design language, such
as material is the metaphor.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:16.240
We're relying on hold graphical
and intentional graphics

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.480
in that our motion
is providing meaning.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.460
And when we started working
with material design,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.190
we were incredibly excited
about the opportunity

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.850
that was ahead of us.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.180
And so today, I want
to run through some

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.100
of these things we were
super excited about.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.330
So again, material
designs motion story

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.780
is meaningful and appropriate.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.140
It's serving to focus attention
and maintain continuity

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.960
throughout your user experience.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.420
The feedback is
subtle and clear,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.680
and transitions are meaningful.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.140
Interior design also relies on
the fundamental print design

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.930
tools that you may have heard
of earlier, such as baseline

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.785
grids, instructional
template that

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:59.854
can scale across
various page types.

00:02:59.854 --> 00:03:02.520
The improved structural guidance
is super important for the Play

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.690
product Because since
we're a suite of products,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.950
it's incredibly important for us
to maintain visual consistency

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.020
among them.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.380
Some of the other things
we're looking at and super

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.430
excited about was the bold
and colorful language.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.710
It cannot only help tell
your brand story but can also

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.990
provide more engagement and
enrichment within your UIs.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.480
And as the designers in
the room should know,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.450
too many types sizes and styles
can totally wreck a layout.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.540
It can confuse the
visual hierarchy

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.520
and dramatically affect
the user experience.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.420
So material designs
typography set

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.180
offers a variety of type
sizes that can work seamlessly

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.540
with the layout grids
that we described before.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.620
In a material design
imagery, whether it's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.340
illustration or photography, not
only provides visual interest

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.390
to the page, but it can
provide the user with context.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.830
In Play we think of images
as the heroes of our UI,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.640
as it puts the emphasis on
the content you guys love.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.270
Like your favorite music
albums, your favorite movies,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.840
your favorite books,
and combine together

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.730
the material guidelines
make it easier than ever

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.980
to scale your products
to multiple platforms.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.319
And part of what
really excited us

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.860
was that we felt
like we were already

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.370
doing a lot of
these things right.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.630
And my point is that a lot
of you guys in the room

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.150
are also doing
these things right.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.440
We see apps every single
day on the Android ecosystem

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.010
that are just getting
better and better

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.410
and follow a lot of
these same principles.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.080
The thing was that material
design has given us

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.020
a much bigger
sandbox to play in.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.860
And it's making it
a lot easier for us

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.310
to do the types of experiences
that we want to do.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.790
And so I'm going to take
a step back a little bit.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.240
And so I joined the plate
in about two years ago.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.060
And at that point, the product
was in a much different place

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.509
as you can see by these images.

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.050
We were doing a lot of things
well, but we have a lot of work

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.502
to do.

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.960
And so as we work together with
our product and engineering

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.220
partners, we really wanted to
set out very specific product

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.870
goals and redefine how we're
positioning Play, things

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.510
like telling a cohesive
brand story among all

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.530
the different content types.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.890
We want to create a
consistent and responsive UX

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.120
framework that can scale.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.641
We wanted to build shared
engineering components,

00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:27.390
and we wanted to make
sure we were working

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.110
with a top down product vision
that everyone could align to.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.630
Maybe most importantly,
the design team really

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.850
wanted to focus on
building relationships

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.720
with partners outside of design.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.150
Our engineering partners,
our product partners,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.980
our marketing partners
with very early involvement

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.920
in an iterative design approach.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.190
And so we set out to define
a visual and interaction

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.670
framework that can scale
responsibly to multiple device

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.780
types and orientations.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.130
We want it to be very
expressive with our color

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.810
to give each product
in the family

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.650
its own personality while
not overwhelming the content.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.130
And also because Play
is a media product,

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.000
we wanted to make sure that our
content is front and center.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.350
We wanted to represent
it as best as we could.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.200
And so as we were thinking
about our current design

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.460
in the material
world, the challenge

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.972
seemed daunting at first.

00:06:19.972 --> 00:06:21.680
You know, you have a
new platform update,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.860
things can be a little scary.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.776
What am I going to do?

00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.820
Do we redesign
from the ground up?

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.100
And I'm sure a lot of you guys
are probably in the same boat.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.520
And so, you've recently
updated your products.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.920
How should you go about
addressing this issue.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.410
And we cose to see it rather as
a challenge, as an opportunity.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.180
So we wanted to take a step
back and address and identify

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.710
some of these core
opportunities in our UI.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.950
And so we started with
our current product.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.880
We wanted to identify
our hero screens,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.620
and review them
together as a team.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.210
And so our hero screens
were the key screens

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.190
that represented a subset of
the pages within the entire UI.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.370
Things like our
product detail pages,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.750
our library views,
our landing pages.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.090
And we wanted to identify the
common UI elements and patterns

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.830
that existed across these
pages, and take note of them

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.520
and look at where we
could make improvements.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.310
And because design
doesn't happen

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.500
in a vacuum and
great product doesn't

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.610
get created without advocacy
of folks outside of design,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.370
things like quality
and craftsmanship,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.090
and attention to detail.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.110
It's very important for
groups outside of design

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.570
to understand these things
and to embrace them.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.490
And so we really wanted
to workshop together

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.920
with these partners.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.770
Inviting them in, doing a
series of different workshops,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.090
getting their feedback and
involvement as early and often

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.890
as possible so that we
could all be thinking ahead

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.540
and understand the vision
that we're sharing together.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.170
And so workshopping helps get
everybody on the same page

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.590
and gets a lot of
high-level thinking there.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.040
But our next step
was to really get

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.900
a little more tactical about it.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.690
Meaning like our team
likes to use Sprint

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.750
methods, where we take very
specific design challenges

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.760
and go heads down
across disciplines,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.390
working on very similar
design problems.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.290
Again sharing that work often.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.190
And this can be a
day-long exercise,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.980
this can be a
week-long exercise.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.280
It just depends on the
complexity of the problem.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.500
And so quickly recap here.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.184
I just want underscore the
fact that it's really important

00:08:26.184 --> 00:08:27.850
to approach material
design and thinking

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.480
about the opportunities
within your product.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.549
It's not just about
design, but it's

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.929
about how you work
together with your teams.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.039
To bring that institutional
advocacy and importance

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:42.610
to these sometimes subtle
things., the craftsmanship.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.100
Thoughtful design is just not
about being a differentiator

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.960
anymore.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.720
It's pretty much table
stakes at this point.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.570
So earlier today in
this room, a good friend

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.810
of mine, Marco,
and Karill talked

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.520
about how we approached
the responsive design

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.100
problem in Play.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.490
And we spent a lot of
time in our current UI

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.617
thinking about our structure.

00:09:05.617 --> 00:09:07.200
And so with material
design, we didn't

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.980
want to throw away that
really good thinking

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.150
that we had invested
lots of time in.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.010
We wanted to leverage
our existing structure

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.360
but be a little more deliberate,
so we could take advantages

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.640
of the opportunities that
we had and connecting

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.680
the structure and
more logical ways.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.880
So again, the reason why
I'm underscoring this point

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.880
is that many of you
may have a product,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.020
you may have a general
structure, an architecture

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.340
that you feel pretty happy with.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.180
And you like us, we
didn't feel like we

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.200
needed to reinvent the
wheel on everything.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.459
We wanted to be very tactical.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:45.500
For instance, one of the
structural opportunities

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.862
we wanted to look at
was our card system.

00:09:47.862 --> 00:09:49.570
If you're familiar
with the Play product,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.100
we obviously
leverage like Google

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.140
does the card metaphor
to represent content.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.350
5 So the material framework
was giving us an opportunity

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.740
to do really great things
like the dynamic shadowing,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.290
and the transformation
from scene to scene.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.280
And so we really
wanted to use this

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.880
as an example of one
structural component

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.240
that we saw as a very
opportunistic way

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.550
to bring a lot of
value to the product.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.100
So keep in mind, just like
design is in a vacuum,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.190
we weren't thinking of
structure in isolation.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.070
We try to avoid the waterfall
process where you identify

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.820
things, it goes
to visual design,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.360
then to interaction
design, maybe motion,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.250
at some point it ends up
in the hands of engineers.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.210
But the point is we want to
advocate a parallel process

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.930
where this is obviously
dependent on the size

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.570
of your team.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.770
But we wanted to
advocate a process where

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.230
we're working together
and in parallel

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.910
to iterate on these ideas.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.740
Because we draw a lot of
inspiration from one another.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.910
Visual layout can greatly
affect interaction design

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.910
and visual design
can do storyboarding

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.790
to influence motion design.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.632
And we can all riff
off of one another.

00:11:07.632 --> 00:11:09.840
I'm going to bring to Taddeo
to the stage where we're

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.180
going to talk a
little bit about how

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.830
this work we did
in the beginning

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.680
will set up some
of the design work.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.717
Taddeo will show you.

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:18.050
TADDEO ZACCHINI: Thank you Nate.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.270
Hello everyone.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.480
So now that we have a
solid structuring place,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.200
let's see how we work
and how we bring together

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.940
and visualizing Google
Play Material Design.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.560
So first we went crazy.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.130
And structure and guidelines
a really important.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.520
But to evolve with language,
we wanted to have inspiration.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.580
We require inspiration.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.442
So we went pretty crazy in
creating tons of visual design

00:11:44.442 --> 00:11:46.650
without too much consideration
on the material design

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.680
guidelines at these points.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.650
So we're exploring
from iconography

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.620
to typopraphy, images
and motion as well.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.150
There was some good stuff,
maybe too out of scope.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.090
But as you can
imagine, we have a lot

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.670
of reviews and with
the goal of narrowing

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.210
all these tremendous
amount of creative work

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.270
with material design.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.100
And at the same time,
we set another goal

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.140
that was to create a visual
system that can give our Play

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.110
product a unique
voice and respecting

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.210
the individual needs
of the Play family.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.960
So how did we align
the visual inspiration

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.800
with material design
and then sync,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.180
trying to keep the identity and
the personality of Google Play.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:36.040
The team look at the
material design guidelines

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.090
and trying to understand
what was already

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.010
successful in our
product and also

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.670
the nature of the product which
is a very content [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.130
to media followup
of this product.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.420
So we determined which aspect
of the visual design language

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.070
were more important.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.120
And we start with
typography which

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.400
can have a huge
impact in your app,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.830
such as interaction or
hierarchy or eligibility

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.270
and also branding.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.070
So with material design,
one of the benefit

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.830
is that we have a pretty
large inflexible fund family.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:11.020
And we want to expand our
topography uses in the product

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.710
and make it more purposeful
and more compelling.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.520
So we apply more style,
style for the theme,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.120
for the medium, for
action and so on,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.260
and make it more appropriate.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.490
And we want to give the
page more breathing room,

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.770
feel less clutter
and complicated.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.290
And so we had a generous
amount of padding

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.560
and we play with
alignment as well.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.630
So these will give the UI a
more fresh and modern and clean,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.120
and the text will be
more easier to read.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.600
So we also increased
the contrast

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.900
in adjusting the scale
of the typography

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.860
to make the hierarchy more
cleaner and easy to read.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.940
And we explore also
overlaying typography

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.100
in content which can
be really powerful.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.600
And considering things
like legibility of the text

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.080
without compromising the
image and the masses.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.150
And then colors.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.545
Colors can be really
powerful in your design.

00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:05.670
And with material design,
we embrace it completely.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.810
So we take advantage of these
beautiful new material design

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.129
color palette, which
represent the brand colors.

00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:18.670
And we wanted to
apply it to our URI,

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.400
so we believe that
we wanted to make

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.420
the colors more
vivid and exciting.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.440
And so we started redefining
all the usage of our color

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.440
in the whole Play experience.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.430
And we made the color
brighter and more vibrant

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.470
to represent more the
Google Play brand.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.210
And also add a more
fresh and modern look.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:44.627
And there's also the functional
aspect of using color.

00:14:44.627 --> 00:14:45.710
You have a sense of place.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.668
You know where you are.

00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:50.570
Or actions are more highlighted
and more easy to read.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.290
We also play with
color extraction

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.150
which is a really important part
of material design guidelines.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.430
And you can see
how it works well

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.435
in a service like Play
which is a media service.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.130
So This is a great example to
show you how much your design

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.020
guidelines can be
flexible enough

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.820
to make your own color pallet.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.750
In fact, we extract
the color that we need

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.000
and we make our
own color pallet.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.090
Imagery.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.300
When you think about Play, you
think about content, media.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.650
It's defined by its own content.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.740
Which, of course, rely
heavily on images.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.270
So we always want it to be bold.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.860
And we were already pretty bold
right now with the products.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.860
But we want to be
even more immersive

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.150
and represent the content
in all its beauty.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.350
And most importantly, we want to
create an emotional connection

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.870
between the user
and the content.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.360
So we start developing
for different screen size,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.970
and you can't imagine
how big and bold can

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.370
be the images in a larger
screen such as TV or a tablet.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.180
So the contents
speak for itself.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.820
And the contents are
real here on the page.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.220
Of course we align other
things to material design,

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.380
like the grid, the
layout, the metric,

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.109
and, of course,
iconography as well.

00:16:10.109 --> 00:16:12.650
So you can see that everything
has a consistent visual story.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.380
And the Play experience feel
like part of the same family.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.760
And this could be a
possible evolution

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.130
of however we use a language.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.010
You have material
design applied.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.410
So these were the three
areas as of our user language

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.700
that we did our first pass.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.220
And for other problems such as
text editor app or a messaging

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.641
app, your starting point
can be totally different.

00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:37.140
But there's something
more important

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.940
that is missing
here that combined

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.060
all these things together
and with interaction

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.820
and actually make a truly
enchanting and magic

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.549
experience, which is motion.

00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.340
One of the core aspects
of material design,

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.990
as you are already
probably know,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:57.110
is how can motion design
bring life into a product.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.140
We were really
excited about that.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.620
So the team and visual
designer were already

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.040
exploring all this stuff before
in an our early exploration.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.154
So we were doing also
visual expiration

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.740
and storyboard that
can represent motion

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.640
and can be easily translated
into moving images.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.480
So we started thinking
about how we can find a way

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.849
to tie all these things
together and thinking

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:24.675
about how the user moves
through the experience

00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:26.990
and how to interact and
engage in the content.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.980
And the emotion that you
feel doing all of these.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.310
So we can apply motion
without a story.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.352
And what is our motion story?

00:17:35.352 --> 00:17:36.435
It's been straightforward.

00:17:36.435 --> 00:17:39.100
It is a typical story.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.580
There is a starting
point where in the motion

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:47.190
world can be translated like
the user is guide to the UI

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.980
and how things appear
and how things load.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.020
And then there is a medial
stage where the action happened

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.990
and what's the feeling and
emotion that the user is

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.530
feeling at the moment.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.440
And then there is the end
where the animation is actually

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.240
resolving.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.820
So where user lands into the
page after the animation.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.960
So as Nate mentioned before,
we define hero screen,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.860
but also we define
hero moments that

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.250
were guide all these
explorations that you're

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.280
going to see today,
and things like

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.980
how the object move in the
space, how the object appears

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.880
or transitions, and
most importantly, create

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.100
meaningful motion that
can connect emotionally

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.174
and can make you feel something.

00:18:33.174 --> 00:18:35.090
So taking on the latest
structures [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.110
was talking about
before, you can already

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.000
see that one sees emotion.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.480
You understand where the objects
are and how they could move

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.030
and potentially how you
can interact with them.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.600
And the parallax effect,
not just the flavor

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.100
or just the fashion things that
everyone is using right now.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.140
But it's actually
purposeful for the motion.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.920
You understand where
the objects are

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.170
and how you can
interact with them.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.450
Blocking out animation.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.600
Once we were starting doing
this prototype and exploration,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.560
it was really important to
get the animation right.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.070
So we reduce completely, the
level of detail and thinking

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.880
blocks, and focus only on the
motion and the actual sense

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.450
of the motion and
bring the movement

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.580
as natural as possible.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.220
So don't worry about around the
corner, or pixel perfect stuff

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.350
in this time.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.060
So this is our early
exploration where

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.750
we wanted to show how
things load in the page.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.530
But we weren't quite
happy with that

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.020
because there is
too much going on.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.640
There is too much tilting
the card too fast.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.360
And it was an
overwhelming experience.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.460
User will actually too
distracted from the movement.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.210
So we simplify the transition
and make it more simple,

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.690
and guide the user
attention and focus

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:58.190
through the actual important
thing, which is the content.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.310
So we explore also
how content loads

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.030
when there is a measured
change in the screen layout.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.235
Like in this case, you
talk to a collection,

00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:07.390
and you go into
the detail phase.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.200
And what is very interesting
here is with material design,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.490
you have a feeling that you
have full control of the UI,

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.910
and that you
actually almost paint

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.625
the screen with you finger.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.650
And here's another
example of how

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:28.180
things can load from a place
into a totally different place.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.420
Like here, I'm in
a home home phase,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.060
and then I'm going
to a detail page.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.580
And here, example of how we
could interact with objects

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.830
like opening and closing.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.700
In this case, in Newsstand,
you're opening the object

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.610
and the card expands.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.780
And it goes S to S until
it gets full screen,

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.460
and you see the real
content in all its beauty.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.320
So this transition is
especially important

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.500
because you have a special sense
of where things are removed.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.250
And in this case, the
most important thing

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.284
is the backward transition, with
if we had to tell the story,

00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:04.700
you have to tell
a complete story.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:10.612
So you want also to
[INAUDIBLE] and key experience

00:21:10.612 --> 00:21:11.570
once you're going back.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.760
So backward
transition for us was

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.579
crucial as any other key motion.

00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:18.620
Of course, we were doing
all of this motion study

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.870
with engineering and each
array team and reviewing.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.790
But Will will go in
depth about that.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.660
Again, opening and closing
elements is fast using place.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.820
The card expand and contract.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.969
The object is marked.

00:21:33.969 --> 00:21:36.385
He knows where he comes from,
and he knows where he lands.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.620
And of course, detailed matter.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.000
So we look at
purposeful animation

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.330
and enhance the overall
experience with little touches.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.460
Like in this case,
the loading spinner.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.760
You also have a chance
to brand these things,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.330
so we were trying to
express the product that we

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.110
were showing-- in
this case, movies.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.790
So this will give the user
an engagement, and also

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.850
a little bit of surprise
and curiosity to the UI.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.870
Again, details are
important, so an animation

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.820
that could be static
and pretty boring,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.570
we actually trying to make a
storytelling aspect into it.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:22.060
So like the downloading arrow.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.770
So here, this is
an example of how

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.399
can be the potential
complete story once you

00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:28.815
combine all these
pieces together.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.770
So these are our here moments.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.390
Every half has their own one.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.960
So it is up to you
to define which one.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.460
So this is just
part of the magic.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.940
This is mean nothing
without the actual someone

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.360
that can make it real.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.810
And as Nathan was
mentioning before,

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.200
it was that effort of
the team working together

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.220
with the engineering
product researcher.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.550
And this time, we'll have
Will talking about in detail

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.250
how we actually
did these things.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.242
Thank you.

00:23:03.242 --> 00:23:04.450
WILL KIEFER: Thank you Teddy.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.770
So I'm going to give you
guys a little glimpse

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.530
into the engineering
process, and what

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.030
was going on throughout
all this on the engineering

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.990
side of things.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.850
And the key takeaway is
really that it was the same.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.650
We were working in
parallel and collaborating

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.821
sort of simultaneously
back and forth.

00:23:22.821 --> 00:23:24.570
And one of the early
things Nate mentioned

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.170
is the early stage of
identifying your opportunities,

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:27.690
right?

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.280
I'm really lucky,
because I actually

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.990
work on both UX frameworks
and on the Play suite apps.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.250
And so I kind of get
to wear both hats,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.730
and there are opportunities
in both of these places.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.210
So the core tenant
from the framework side

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.970
of things, the core
opportunity there

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.080
was to make it really
easy for your apps.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.110
We basically wanted to bake the
material DNA into the framework

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.010
so that that stuff just
comes along with your apps,

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.090
and life is easy,
and you can focus

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:03.610
on making the subtlety that
is appropriate for your app.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.160
So things like cards are
first class citizens now.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.780
So you have consistency
across your cards in your app,

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.530
across the system, the
notification, the system UI,

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.040
and it feels like
part of one family.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.210
And there's elevation and
layering for your hero images,

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.690
or your hero content.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.860
And then shadows, for maybe you
have custom shadows for content

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.720
that doesn't quite fit in
what the framework provides.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.700
That's all there.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.860
Complex layouts are
now much easier.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.390
Everyone knows that,
design and engineering

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.350
knows that list
view is very arduous

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.140
to do some complex things.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.120
So now you have
actual proper support

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.540
both in L and in the compat
library with recycler view

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.580
to make layouts that are
appropriate for your content.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.600
And actual support for animating
things in and animating things

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.280
out.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.120
So it's really nice.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.536
And actually, my
personal favorite

00:24:54.536 --> 00:24:57.300
is the suite of API's
around scene transitions.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.400
This opens up a whole new
category of story and design

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.420
for your app that just basically
wasn't possible before.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.420
And scene transitions are how
you're app or your activity

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.130
animates in and then animates
out when it's disappearing.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.500
And this is into your app, or
across activities in your app,

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.090
or even between applications.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.910
It's really pretty powerful.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.080
If you want to dig into some
of the things, some of this

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.160
a little deeper, yesterday's
"What's New in Android" talk

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.590
is on video, is a great
whirlwind tour of everything.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.090
And then actually
right now, there's

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.717
a talk on material
science where they dig in.

00:25:32.717 --> 00:25:33.800
You can catch it on video.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.787
And I think at 2:00 PM,
there's another talk

00:25:35.787 --> 00:25:37.620
where they're going to
walk through actually

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.140
building material witness.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.110
Building an actual android
app with all this stuff.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.610
So that's a little bit of the
opportunities on the framework

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.109
side.

00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.830
And so apps have their own
sort of personal opportunities.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.891
Nate mentioned what Play
was looking at early on.

00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:53.390
Your apps may have
different things,

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.690
but the other opportunities
to leverage the framework.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.865
So next up was structure.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.890
And this is actually
really interesting

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.490
because one of my other favorite
parts about the material design

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.715
language is it has
very strong guidelines.

00:26:09.715 --> 00:26:14.030
It's very opinionated, and
has a strong philosophy.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.570
But it's not actually very
rigid in your app structure.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.280
There's actually a lot of
flexibility in the system

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.800
to make an app that
fits your content,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.080
fits your structure,
fits what you want to do.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.680
And so earlier, Teddy
alluded to the structure

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.140
that Play was developing.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.280
And this didn't just
sort of come overnight,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.130
and get thrown over the wall
from design to engineering.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.500
This is a really good example
where we're working together

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.520
in parallel and
collaborating here.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.250
So I'm going to
share little vignette

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:47.960
of an actual true story
of Play Newsstand,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.300
and how that was happening.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:55.310
So early on, I saw some amazing
blue sky sort of moments.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.116
Visual mocks in motion
design and stuff.

00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.740
So I just went and
started prototyping.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.870
And so everything you see here
is actual random prototypes

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.730
from this time off my laptop.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.424
And I worked at it.

00:27:08.424 --> 00:27:09.840
I did a whole bunch
of iterations.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.381
I may builds.

00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:11.970
And I just was not happy.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.230
There were a couple
issues that came up

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.410
when actually implementing
it that were really,

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.780
I felt like we were going
to have to start over, take

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.600
a new direction.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:26.030
There was issues with tabs and
having layers actually split

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.409
when we scroll, and trying to
blend these different layers

00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:29.950
and parallax.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.620
And it's they're subtle
issues, but they were there.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.320
And so basically, I was
giving daily builds.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.950
And one day I thought, oh man.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:40.380
OK, we're going to
have to start over.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.330
So I turned it off.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.871
I reverted it, and
the next day, they

00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:46.530
would build, like went back to
a sort of a previous iteration.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.610
And a designer, the legendary
Marco, came up to me that day

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:50.450
and was like, hey.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.550
Where did that go?

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.800
This was awesome, I loved it.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.425
And I said, oh.

00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:56.440
Well, obviously, it can't work
because of engineering reason

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.950
A, B, C. And he
said, no, no, no.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.580
We can do this.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.890
Let's iterate, let's
solve those problems.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.605
And so we ended up
coming to a place--

00:28:05.605 --> 00:28:07.980
this is sort of the next stage
where we're like, oh yeah.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.896
It's actually working.

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:12.009
This is, I think we can
pursue this structure.

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:13.800
And this would not have
happened had we not

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.530
actually been prototyping
and iterating together.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.260
Having people live
with prototypes,

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.360
even if they're very
rough and not quite right,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.527
really lets you know if
the structure's going

00:28:24.527 --> 00:28:26.110
to work because
you're living with it.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.262
You can see what works,
what doesn't work.

00:28:28.262 --> 00:28:29.720
And so this is like
the next stage.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.290
We're getting a little bit
closer, and feeling like yes.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.581
We could pursue this structure.

00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:35.430
And once we got there,
then the whole sort

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.740
of rest of the pieces of the
app started to fall into place,

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.180
and become a cohesive
story around this.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.400
So that's a little
glimpse of the structure.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.410
Iterating in conjunction with
each other, living with it,

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.220
and solving the structure
early on with prototypes

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.930
to basically prove out the
technical feasibility of

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.510
is that going to work?

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.490
And you'll notice I showed
some iOS footage there.

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.780
And Play is a cross
platform product.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.750
So this was going up, we were
firing on all cylinders, web,

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:10.137
iOS, and Android, because the
challenges on each platform

00:29:10.137 --> 00:29:11.720
are going to be a
little bit different

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.720
and the interaction models
can be a little bit different.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.511
And so it's really
important that if you're

00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:18.200
doing cross product
work, that you're

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.420
kind of repeating this
process in parallel

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.120
across the different platforms.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.059
So the final piece
is story, and Teddy

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:27.350
talked about this a little bit.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.225
And so what is story?

00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:30.370
It's basically connecting
these hero moments

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.590
that you've defined for your
app using motion design,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.040
and using animation.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.720
And this animation is
not actually fluff.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.050
It's not eye candy.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.660
It's very purposeful.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.510
So when a user touches on a
card with an image and a title,

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.800
and that image and
title stays on screen,

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.240
transitions into place, and
supporting content and details

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.580
appear to basically
supplement it.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.940
There are fewer pixels
moving on the screen.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.610
And with your pixels
moving, there's

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.520
actually less cognitive
overhead for your user.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.000
If it's an abrupt transition,
and everything changes at once

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.750
there's a lot more
cognitive overhead.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.302
The user has to sort
of rescan everything,

00:30:11.302 --> 00:30:13.510
and reacquaint themselves
with where everything went.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.830
So this is very,
very purposeful.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.330
And that doesn't
mean everything has

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.140
to be completely
smooth everywhere.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.340
There can be abrupt changes
just like in novels, and film,

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:25.850
and music.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:29.660
There can be abrupt changes,
but they're purposeful.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.200
They're there for a reason.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.530
And so we looked at
Newsstand and we said, OK.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.150
What's one of our really
common transitions that now we

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.050
can leverage this opportunity?

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.950
And so collections of cards of
articles to the actual article

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:44.450
themselves.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.040
And you saw some of the motion
studies on this earlier.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.570
This was a great
opportunity for us.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.470
And how did engineering actually
tackle this at the same time

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.714
that the motion designers
were working on it?

00:30:54.714 --> 00:30:55.880
We used the same techniques.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.830
We use Block-it.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:00.110
Here's a random, early
prototype of just getting

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.410
the blocks in place, and
giving the designers knobs

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.320
to tweak like live on
the device to adjust

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.350
timings and curves,
and all sorts of stuff

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.100
so that they get really
immediate feedback

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.220
to feel what's working.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.210
Because when it's in your hand,
it just changes everything.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.360
Here's another example
in tablet where

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.240
I slowed the entire
animation down.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.580
I used a big, bright,
red debug color

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.050
just so I could really
focus on what was going on.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.410
And here, it turned out
that this was not right.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.610
You'll see the right edge, it's
the right edge of the tablet

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.260
before the left side does.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.540
And it wasn't quite right.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.290
It wasn't working.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.530
So we iterated, and we adjusted.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.720
And you wouldn't really
notice that if you just

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.860
put in the final
sort of transition

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.571
without the color and
stuff, because it might just

00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:45.820
look pretty good in our right.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.278
But really slowing it down and
getting those details right.

00:31:48.278 --> 00:31:52.060
And so blocking is actually
very helpful on an engineering

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.780
prospective.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.113
And so when you start putting
all these things together,

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:59.650
you get this motion story
without these rough edges.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.950
And everything you do
and touch with the screen

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.810
is purposeful and interactive.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.270
And it's important here
that these early prototypes,

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.447
the level of details high.

00:32:08.447 --> 00:32:09.280
This is not perfect.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.920
There's a lot of bugs, there's
a lot of weird color and issues.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.130
But the important part is
that at a granular level,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.140
it's where you're going.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.460
And you live with it, and
you see if it's working.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.920
So that's a little
bit about Story.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.120
And finally, I just wanted
to basically highlight

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.710
two sort of key takeaways
from our talk today.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.390
And one is this idea
that Nate mentioned

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.760
of institutional
advocacy for design.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.640
If everybody is involved
in design, than everybody

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.880
feels a bit of ownership
over that design.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.440
And if everyone feels
ownership of that design,

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.420
then everyone is
invested in it, and you

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.330
get much better results.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:51.150
We have engineering product and
design all working together.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:51.840
And this scales.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.150
This scales from a one person
indie dev to a big company.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.410
Design advocacy applies
in both situations.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.640
And arguably, it's
even more important

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.690
when your team is much
bigger, because it's

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.560
easier to sort of start
throwing things over the wall.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.190
And you don't get quite
as good results that way.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.880
And the last point is
leveraging your opportunity.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.820
This is basically finding
those hero moments,

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.500
finding of the parts
of your app you

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.625
want to improve with the
parts of your app you want

00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:21.830
to highlight, and building
around those first.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.530
Build blue skies, building
really nice mocks,

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.720
and working out from there using
those to define your structure,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.540
or refine your
structure if you already

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.830
feel very happy
with what you have.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.420
And then, prototyping early.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.060
Building that stuff, living
with it to see if it's working.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.820
And then connecting those
dots using the motion study

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.720
in the story that
you want for the app.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.730
And this is just
really fantastic,

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.640
because material design
gives you these tools

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.060
to basically connect all
this together and improve

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.350
how everything works.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.830
So thank you for coming out
and by letting us give you

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.470
a little sneak peek
into what Play is doing.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.760
And we've got a little bit of
time for questions I think,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.670
about 10 minutes.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.600
So I'll hand the mic to Nate,
and then you can answer.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.850
NATHAN STRUE: Thanks everyone.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.314
TADDEO ZACCHINI: Thank you.

00:34:15.823 --> 00:34:18.239
WILL KIEFER: Yeah, there's
mikes on both sides of the room

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.639
if anyone has anything.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.944
And if not, you can always
find us afterwards too.

00:34:24.283 --> 00:34:24.991
NATHAN STRUE: No?

00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:25.490
Crickets.

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:26.839
WILL KIEFER: Crickets.

00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:28.230
AUDIENCE: You guys, is this on?

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.850
Can you guys talk a little
bit about your process

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.050
and the tools that you use?

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.760
Who on the team is
the creative lead?

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.810
Who comes up with the concept?

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.600
Before you invest a bunch
of time prototyping,

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.280
you probably should
put that into some sort

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.060
of a software that's
easier than a software

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.359
that you're writing code.

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:50.150
NATHAN STRUE: Sure.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.190
AUDIENCE: So what
are those tips?

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.340
NATHAN STRUE: I think it's a
little variable for everyone,

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.250
depending on the
size of the team,

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.050
depending on what tools
you're comfortable with.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.540
We have the benefit of
working with a good sized team

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.760
where we have people with
some After Effects skills who

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.560
are doing quick prototyping,
motion studies, leveraging,

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.140
some of the visual
mocks and assets

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.430
that have already been created.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.910
But it can be whatever
works for you, whatever

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.920
works quickly and fast
to get you to a point

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.600
where you can really start
feeling how something

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.400
is working in your hand.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.520
I think it's variable.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.080
For us, it's a combination
of some internal tools

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:40.250
that we've developed in addition
to things like After Effects.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.160
But it's usually variable.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.720
TADDEO ZACCHINI: But even the
process that we are actually

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.270
doing, we are starting
maybe from sketches,

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.900
and then we go into static
modes with Illustrator,

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.400
and then we pass it
through the prototyper.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.590
And with After Effects, in five
seconds it does everything.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:01.017
So it could be that, or it
could be just directly on

00:36:01.017 --> 00:36:01.600
After Effects.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.330
So it's variable.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:06.040
Depends on the interact and
the motion that we want to do.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.240
WILL KIEFER: And we also,
even just really simple HTML

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.940
prototypes too.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.060
NATHAN STRUE: Yep.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.440
WILL KIEFER: Definitely
take advantage of those just

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.965
to get something quick and
on a browser on the device.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.910
What do you find are the
best methods and practices

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.740
for getting good design
advocacy, especially

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.250
across large platforms?

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.810
Since Play covers
so many domains,

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.060
I figured this might be
something that you could offer

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.540
some insight into and something
that my company's just

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.350
now getting really big about.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.470
So it's got some
bumps and bruises.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:39.859
Any advice would be awesome.

00:36:39.859 --> 00:36:40.650
NATHAN STRUE: Sure.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:47.380
I mean it's a tough
thing to tackle, right?

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.570
Google historically, has been
an engineering driven company.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.560
And design over the
last two to three years

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.570
has really become--
from Larry down,

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.450
something that is
incredibly important.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:05.410
So I think the sooner you can
engage folks who are driving,

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:06.580
the better.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.120
And it never hurts to
give, show people examples.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.290
Like this is the other
products in the wild.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:17.020
They don't even necessarily
have to be competitive products.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.830
Being able to show people
like the state of the art,

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.800
like what people are
doing is hugely important

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.770
because not everybody knows.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.860
If you're not in a design world
or you're not in an engineering

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.430
world, I think it's
really important

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.060
to let people know what
is going on in the wild,

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.810
and how these innovations
are happening quickly.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.530
And the quality bar is
raising all the time.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:38.985
So it has to be considered.

00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:40.610
WILL KIEFER: And then
on the flip side,

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.800
I'd also say that there's
a grassroots approach too.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.070
If your leadership
is not necessarily

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.482
happy about doing that, is
that designers and engineers

00:37:49.482 --> 00:37:50.440
can just work together.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.270
Like literally, that moment
of just collaborating and just

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.930
brainstorming, involving
each other in that part

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:58.580
is really nice.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.040
Because then you're
on board together.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.480
That was really good in the
early days of Newsstand.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.860
We got a couple engineers and
a couple designers in a room

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.210
with basically where do
we want to be in 10 years?

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.610
And where do we want
to be in five years?

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.485
And just work it out.

00:38:11.485 --> 00:38:14.160
And then you feel like
you're on the same team.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.700
So then you both have
ownership over it.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.520
So it's easier to drive back
just from the bottom layer too.

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:25.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.962
WILL KIEFER: Oh, here.

00:38:25.962 --> 00:38:27.160
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Prishan.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.020
I run a small app company.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.739
One point of contention
we have is basically

00:38:32.739 --> 00:38:34.405
when to do the handover
from engineering

00:38:34.405 --> 00:38:35.650
to design, essentially.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.090
So my designer come up with
big, [INAUDIBLE] feature.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.360
My designer come up
with this beautiful UI

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.950
layout and workflow.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.610
And then you first
thing they say

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.850
that this is not a
standard UI component.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.500
You should think in terms
of standard UI components

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.850
available.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.240
And also when
standardization, A,

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.180
do you encourage using
only the standard UI

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.420
component because
user are familiar

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.940
and there's less learning curve,
and when to empower design?

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.619
How do you make the decision?

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:04.410
NATHAN STRUE: Sure.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:08.800
No, that's a very good question,
and I think super relevant.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.930
I think there's a lot of factors
that go into that hand off.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:19.257
I mean, I think it depends the
competency of your designers

00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:20.840
and how familiar
they are with working

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.330
with framework components.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.490
And as Will was talking about,
it's that collaboration.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:31.330
So if there are designers that
aren't fully aware of what

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.200
the suite of a
framework can offer,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.250
it's really good to try
to bring them up to speed.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.940
And also going back to how we
were discussing opportunity,

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.520
it's like where do you get
the most value, the most

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.840
bang for your buck in
going a custom route?

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.140
Now for certain
experiences, taking

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.260
what the framework offers you
with minor changes, things that

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.160
are easy to do in code, that can
make a big difference in design

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.040
like changing font scaling,
are changing color palates,

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.170
changing background assets.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.850
These things are
relatively cheap ways

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.290
that still leverage
the framework,

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.380
but can give you a very
different look and feel.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.880
But it's also about when is
it appropriate to override

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.010
the framework or do
something custom?

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.810
And I think that decision
comes from working together

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.310
as a team, and determining
whether or not it's worth

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.650
the engineering investment.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.150
Is the payoff going
to be big enough

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.840
on undoing a
component in custom?

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.050
As an example in
Play, maybe we don't

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:36.310
want to take the
platform scrubber bar,

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.310
because we want to bring
something more branded

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.260
or something that's
differentiated.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.945
And for us maybe,
that's a big win.

00:40:41.945 --> 00:40:43.570
I'm not saying that's
what we're doing,

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.757
but that could be an example
of how you address that.

00:40:46.757 --> 00:40:48.840
WILL KIEFER: And from the
engineering perspective,

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.470
I'd say what's great
about material design is

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:56.680
it's sort of like a higher level
philosophy that's not like, use

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.310
this button.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.330
Use this thing.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.427
It's like, here are
the guidelines and here

00:41:00.427 --> 00:41:01.760
the red lines, and these things.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.100
And so actually, the compat
library and the framework

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.220
are in some ways, much
more flexible to achieve

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.569
what previously might
have been a lot more

00:41:09.569 --> 00:41:10.485
of a custom component.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.360
AUDIENCE: So between prototyping
with After Effects or something

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.880
more interactive like
Quartz or HTML, when

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.200
you see that payoff
in going interactive,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.610
and what goes into
that decision making.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.430
Is it just the skill
sets on the team,

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:34.540
or is there some sort
of thought process?

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.020
NATHAN STRUE: Great question.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.500
We would advocate for
getting it in people's hands

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.580
as quickly as possible.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.600
I mean, even literally if
it's sketches on paper that

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.430
are captured and broken up
into the variety of tools that

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.950
are available for doing quick,
iterative, rapid prototyping

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.690
on device.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.160
We live in a world where
everything is interactive,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.010
and statics can't capture how
something is going to feel.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.060
And so we in general,
advocate for trying

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.270
to do that as quickly as
possible with any tool that

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.210
works.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.160
And you can continue to refine
and iterate, and develop,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.400
and polish as you're going.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.970
And that tool set
can adapt depending

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.480
on what your needs are.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.206
But the sooner you
can start playing

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.330
with something, the better.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.204
TADDEO ZACCHINI: Yeah,
it's a parallel track.

00:42:25.204 --> 00:42:27.910
I mean maybe the
motion designer will

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.640
start designing the motion,
and then the first draft

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.470
will get in the
prototype, and then

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.074
we figure out what we could do.

00:42:36.074 --> 00:42:37.740
And then production
design will go ahead

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.900
and do all the pixel perfecting.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.920
Meanwhile, the engineering
will fix the motion.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.330
I mean, it's a collaboration.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.010
WILL KIEFER: And I've been
known to put just static images

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:50.456
and movies, and view them in
gallery on the phone, just

00:42:50.456 --> 00:42:52.580
because holding it in your
hand kind of changes it.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.500
And so you can really get an
easy, fake interactive thing

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.527
by pressing play,
and just kind of--

00:42:57.527 --> 00:42:58.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.610
NATHAN STRUE: Yep.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, I had a question
about creating cross platform

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.565
mobile apps.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.860
Let's say you're working on
Android with new material

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.110
design, and you're
also working on iOS.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.600
Both sort of have
similar design paradigms

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.900
whenever you sort
of look at depth.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.060
IOS accomplishes that blur,
whereas material design does it

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.410
with subtle shadows.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.770
So my question is
whenever you're

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.710
creating an app
for both platforms,

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:32.600
do you conform to
the design paradigms

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.820
of the specific platform?

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:40.070
Or should you try to just create
one single cohesive design

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.636
across both versions
of your app?

00:43:42.636 --> 00:43:46.290
NATHAN STRUE: Sure, that's
a very good question.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.150
I don't think there's
a direct answer.

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.070
There's certain
platform paradigms

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:55.280
that are very core
to a user experience.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:03.910
There are some that for
instance, a good example is

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:08.200
when we were developing
music on iOS,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.100
we really felt our
interaction of our tab model

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.460
was super successful.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.399
And iOS's tab
platform didn't really

00:44:15.399 --> 00:44:16.940
let us do the things
we wanted to do.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.310
So that was something where
we took a pattern from Android

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.520
and applied it to iOS.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.730
There's other areas, I
can't think of anything

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.690
off the top of my
head, but where

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.110
you do you want to conform
to the platform standards.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.059
TADDEO ZACCHINI: Oh,
well like the back button

00:44:31.059 --> 00:44:32.350
in the ActionWare, for example.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:32.910
That's typical.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.701
NATHAN STRUE: Sure.

00:44:33.701 --> 00:44:36.680
TADDEO ZACCHINI: So you may
align your visual design

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.230
to this material
design guidelines.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.860
But the interaction and some
of the key elements of the UI

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.614
can still be platform
based, like the back button.

00:44:46.614 --> 00:44:49.030
NATHAN STRUE: You want to make
sure to respect your user's

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.900
comfort.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.550
And if they've spent
all of their time

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.525
on a specific platform.

00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:55.650
There's going to be certain
platform paradigms that

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.740
makes sense to adopt.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.330
So there's not a good
definitive answer there.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:05.370
I would say try to be as
consistent with the product

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:09.490
across all platforms as possible
in the major structural and

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:14.570
component elements, but
respect the platform paradigm.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:18.300
WILL KIEFER: And there's some
platform sort of interactions

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.690
that are not necessarily
tied to the model.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.107
Like the edge swipe
on iOS to go back.

00:45:24.107 --> 00:45:26.190
You can support that without
changing your design.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.520
But unfortunately,
we're out of time.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.020
So I really thank
you guys again.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.500
You can come grab us afterwards
if you have more questions.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:31.930
NATHAN STRUE: Thanks, everyone.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.480
TADDEO ZACCHINI: Thank you.
