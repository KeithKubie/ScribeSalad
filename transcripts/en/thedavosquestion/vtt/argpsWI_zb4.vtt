JIM FLAHERTY &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm Jim Flaherty. I'm
the Minister of Finance in Canada. Here at

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.110
Davos I'm having a large number of discussions
about a very important issue this year and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.740
that is the state of the economy, um-the economy
in the world, making sure that we-that we

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.880
preserve strength in the economy so that we
can deal with the other important issues that

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.720
we have concerning the environment, demographics,
and the poorest one billion people in the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.050
world-many of them in subSaharan Africa. All
of these issues that we do need to deal with

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.570
over time but can be dealt with only with
a strong base around the world. So, we have

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.520
these challenges right now on the economic
front that we are addressing and it's important

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.800
in terms of our ability to move forward on
the broader range of issues. The foundation

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.950
must be solid in order to do that and we are
making some progress in our understanding

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.180
of those issues here at Davos. Thanks.
