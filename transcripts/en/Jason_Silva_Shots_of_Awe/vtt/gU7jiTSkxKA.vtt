00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.150
So you hear a lot of people
are really freaked out

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.080
about this idea, this
meme of singularity.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.220
Some call it the
"rapture of the nerds."

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.280
They feel like
technologists have

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.709
hijacked the
Christian story of God

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:30.250
and heaven and the
afterlife and just

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.880
translated it into the language
of electronic technology

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.890
and synthetic intelligence
and mastering the information

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.720
processes of biology so that
we can engender and engineer

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.690
our own godhood.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.910
But I don't really think
that that's a problem.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750
Those religious myths that
we have been caught up

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.570
in for centuries
reflect our yearnings

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.290
to transcend our own limits.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.980
As Ernest Becker says,
"We are gods with anuses.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.800
With our minds, we can
ponder the infinite.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.410
Yet we're housed in these
heart-pumping, breath-gasping,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.800
decaying body."

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.560
So to be godly, yet creaturely
imbues the human condition

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.230
with a sort of bittersweet,
exquisite pain quality to it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.690
that, in a way,
drives our creativity.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.450
Our desire to transcend
all previous limits,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.390
to transform the world
in our own image,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.780
comes from our desire to
escape the death sentence that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.940
makes us ultimately
food for worms.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.710
So I think that the
singularity as a meme that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.360
reflects the acceleration
of the human design process

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.095
to the point of achieving
a kind of infinite velocity

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:30.750
where everything becomes
linked with everything else,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.880
and matter becomes mind where
we impregnate the universe

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.660
with intelligence, as
Erik Davis has written.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.857
Today, technologists are
these ecstatic technicians

00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:40.440
of the sacred.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.560
They're figuring
out how awareness

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.170
works, how the self emerges.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.920
Can we create
non-biological intelligence?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.800
Can we create sentience
in a different substrate

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.690
that is not bound by
the limits of biology?

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.772
We are the frontal
lobes of the universe.

00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:55.820
If we are the eyes and
ears of the universe,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.210
if we are a way for the
cosmos to know itself,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.530
as Carl Sagan says,
then our desire

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.690
to transcend all previous
limits is the universe's desires

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.369
therein.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.660
So I don't think there's
anything unnatural about that.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.130
And so for that reason, I think
the idea of the singularity

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.450
is awesome.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.598
