00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.050
Every time the
browser connects to a server

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.529
to make a request, it has to
go through the TCP handshake

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.610
process.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.429
This three-way handshake
is very time consuming.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.129
To counteract the cost
of these handshakes,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.480
HTTP/1.1 introduced the
concept of keep-alive.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.269
If the client sets the
connection keep-alive header,

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.339
the server will not
close the connection

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.980
after successfully
delivering the response,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.070
but allows the client to
reuse the already established

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.589
connection for
additional requests.

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.619
Keep in mind though that
you still can send requests

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:35.629
before the response
for the last request

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.850
has been fully transferred.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.460
All in all, this forces
web developers to keep

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.829
the number of additional
resources as low

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.259
as possible, making
the best possible use

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.149
of their six connections.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.030
This is why JavaScript
and CSS files are commonly

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.509
concatenated into bundles and
why images are put together

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:54.679
into sprites.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.179
The bundles can be obtained
in just one request.
