early on here is that your you're going

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060
early on here is that your you're going
 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.330
early on here is that your you're going
to learn constantly but in terms of the

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340
to learn constantly but in terms of the
 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.269

focused very very specifically on trying
 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.610
focused very very specifically on trying
to reduce the frequency of failure or

to reduce the frequency of failure or
 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.680
to reduce the frequency of failure or
increase the frequency of success but we

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690
increase the frequency of success but we
 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.870
increase the frequency of success but we
know that we're still going to fail more

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880
know that we're still going to fail more
 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.630

we turn that around a bit by using

we turn that around a bit by using
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.050
we turn that around a bit by using
genetic tools to find some of the

working with bacteria in the laboratory
 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.100
working with bacteria in the laboratory
we apply an array of tools to determine

we apply an array of tools to determine

we apply an array of tools to determine
which genes and gene functions and

therefore processes are essential for

therefore processes are essential for

they're always going to be working on
the next problem so we need to continue

therefore if we weren't working on that

therefore if we weren't working on that

there are things like that that keep us

more actively right now you know we've

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:23.379
more actively right now you know we've
 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:25.800
more actively right now you know we've
come to acknowledge the fact that while

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810
come to acknowledge the fact that while
 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.469
come to acknowledge the fact that while
we have you know the largest

research investment that's out there so

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.650
research investment that's out there so
 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.770
research investment that's out there so
it really would be a little bit

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:40.780
it really would be a little bit
 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.860
it really would be a little bit
presumptuous of us to believe that

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870
presumptuous of us to believe that

within these walls we have all of the

with all the answers we need there's a
 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.460
with all the answers we need there's a
lot of smart people out there and a lot

lot of smart people out there and a lot
 

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.960
lot of smart people out there and a lot
of people that we'd love to partner with

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970
of people that we'd love to partner with
 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.450
of people that we'd love to partner with
we're willing to partner with us and so

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.460
we're willing to partner with us and so
 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.029
we're willing to partner with us and so
yes we are actively exploring those

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039
yes we are actively exploring those
 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.580
yes we are actively exploring those
kinds of things can we work together to

00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.590
kinds of things can we work together to
 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.129
kinds of things can we work together to
generate some fundamental knowledge that

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:02.139
generate some fundamental knowledge that
 

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:04.050
generate some fundamental knowledge that
will allow us to go off and then come up

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.060
will allow us to go off and then come up
 

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.879
will allow us to go off and then come up
with those new small molecule
