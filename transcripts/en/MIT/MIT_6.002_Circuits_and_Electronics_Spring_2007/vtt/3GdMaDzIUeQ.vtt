00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.573
OK.
Good morning.

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:38.098
Let's get going.
As always, I will start with a

00:00:38.098 --> 00:00:41.737
review.
And today we embark on another

00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:46.655
major milestone in our analysis
of lumped circuits.

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:51.180
And it is called the
"Sinusoidal Steady-state".

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.081
Again, I believe this will be
the second and the last lecture

00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:02.000
for which I will be using view
graphs.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.917
And the idea here is that,
just like in the last lecture,

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:09.344
there is a bunch of
mathematical grunge that needs

00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:12.352
to be gone through.
And I want to show you a

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:16.479
sequence in a little chart today
that talks about the effort

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.836
level in doing some problems
based on time domain

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:23.054
differential equations,
as in the last lecture,

00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:27.181
something slightly different
today and something much better

00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.553
on Thursday.
And so, in some sense,

00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:34.719
Thursday's lecture and today's
lecture involve talking about

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.956
the foundations of the behavior
of certain types of circuits.

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:43.193
And it is good for you to have
this foundation as background,

00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:47.218
but when you actually go to
solve circuits you don't quite

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:50.678
use these methods.
You use much easier techniques,

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:53.291
which I will talk about next
Thursday.

00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:57.246
Let's start with a quick
review, and then we will go into

00:01:57.246 --> 00:02:02.448
sinusoidal steady state.
The last lecture we talked

00:02:02.448 --> 00:02:07.817
about this circuit and we did
the same two lectures ago on

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:11.113
Tuesday.
We had one inverter driving

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:15.540
another inverter.
And we said that the wire over

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.626
ground had some inductance.
CGS is the capacitor of the

00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:26.559
gate and R is the resistance at
the drain of the first inverter.

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:31.645
And if you look at this
circuit, that circuit formed an

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:36.471
RLC pattern.
And what we did was we said

00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:41.871
let's drive this with a one to
zero transition at the input.

00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:47.271
And the one to zero transition
at the input would cause this

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:52.030
transistor to switch off,
and this node would then go

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.416
from a very low value to a high
value.

00:02:55.416 --> 00:03:01.000
So it as if a 5 volt step was
applied at this input.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.218
We also saw that using time
domain differential equations

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:09.436
that by applying a step input
here the output looked like

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:11.771
this.
The output would show some

00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:16.140
oscillatory behavior when we
have a capacitor and inductor.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.810
I also gave you some insight as
to why it oscillates like this.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.651
And you also heard in
recitation that the reason for

00:03:24.651 --> 00:03:30.000
this oscillation was because of
these two storage elements.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.349
Each of these storage elements
tries to hold onto its state

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.925
variable.
For example,

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:40.500
the capacitor tries to maintain
its voltage while the inductor

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.074
tries to maintain its current.
And, much like a pendulum which

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:48.900
oscillates back and forth,
it swaps potential energy

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.000
versus kinetic energy down here
and swings back and forth.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.146
In the same way,
in an LC circuit like this,

00:03:57.146 --> 00:04:01.463
energy swaps back and forth
between a potential energy and a

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:05.268
kinetic energy equivalent,
which swaps back and forth

00:04:05.268 --> 00:04:09.439
between energy stored in the
inductor and energy stored in

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.365
the capacitor and sloshes back
and forth.

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:16.756
And because of this resistor
the energy eventually dissipates

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:21.292
and you end up getting a final
value which corresponds to the 5

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:24.000
volts appearing here.
And why is that?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.170
That is because remember the
capacitor is a long-term open

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.465
for DC.
It is a DC voltage.

00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:35.321
After a long time this
capacitor looks like an open

00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.948
circuit and the inductor looks
like a complete short circuit,

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:43.958
an ideal inductor as a complete
short circuit for DC.

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.046
And so therefore in the
long-term it is as if this guy

00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:52.904
is a short, this guy is an open,
so 5 volts simply appears here.

00:04:52.904 --> 00:04:55.526
And this is the transient
behavior.

00:04:55.526 --> 00:05:00.000
Then we just switch the first
transistor off.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.708
In the last lecture,
I left off with intuitive

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:06.840
analysis.
Let me quickly cover that and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.725
redo the intuitive analysis for
you.

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:14.340
I left it the last time by
having you think about whether

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.203
the transient response would
begin by going down or begin by

00:05:19.203 --> 00:05:22.252
going up.
And I will cover that today.

00:05:22.252 --> 00:05:25.302
This was the circuit that we
analyzed.

00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:30.000
A VI input with a step and an
RLC out here.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.837
And we were plotting the
capacitor voltage.

00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:36.418
And intuitively we can plot
this in the following way.

00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:40.337
I have also marked for you the
section number in the course

00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:44.054
notes which has a discussion of
this intuitive analysis,

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:47.094
(Section 13.8).
Let's do the easy stuff first.

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:50.540
Notice that the capacitor wants
to hold its voltage.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.391
And so given that we don't have
any infinite impulse here,

00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:58.108
I am going to start out with
the capacitor voltage being

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:02.088
where it is.
And the initial conditions are

00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:04.524
given to you.
You are given that the

00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:08.700
capacitor voltage starts out
being positive at v zero and the

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.902
current starts out being
negative at time zero.

00:06:11.902 --> 00:06:15.730
So I am telling you that there
is a voltage v across the

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.907
capacitor at time t=0 and there
is a current that is flowing.

00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:23.735
Since i is negative there is a
current initially that is

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:27.354
flowing in the opposite
direction to this arrow here.

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:31.344
The i zero is negative.
In light of that,

00:06:31.344 --> 00:06:35.061
I can start plotting my curve
here by intuition.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:40.043
I start by saying at time t=0 I
am told that the initial voltage

00:06:40.043 --> 00:06:44.551
of the capacitor is at zero.
This is about as simple as it

00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:46.607
gets.
Completely intuitive.

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:51.352
I also know that after a long
time, can someone tell me after

00:06:51.352 --> 00:06:55.543
a long time what the voltage
will be at the end of the

00:06:55.543 --> 00:06:58.627
capacitor?
You should be able to get his

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:01.266
by observation?
VI.

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:05.345
And why is it VI?
It is vI because this is a DC

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:08.804
value VI.
And after a long time this guy

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:11.819
behaves like an open circuit to
DC.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.633
This guy behaves like a short
circuit to DC.

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:20.244
So since this is an open
circuit, VI will appear here

00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:23.348
after a long time.
And so therefore,

00:07:23.348 --> 00:07:27.605
after a long time,
the capacitor voltage is going

00:07:27.605 --> 00:07:32.082
to be at VI.
And I just showed you that.

00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:34.936
There you go.
You already have the two

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:38.715
endpoints of your curve
completely by observation,

00:07:38.715 --> 00:07:40.952
intuition.
No DEs, no nothing.

00:07:40.952 --> 00:07:45.194
Just by staring at it and
understanding the fundamentals

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:48.664
of how simple primitive circuit
elements work.

00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:52.752
Absolutely simple stuff.
So you've nailed the two ends

00:07:52.752 --> 00:07:57.071
now and you cannot go wrong with
the stuff in the middle.

00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:01.182
Let's see.
As a next step what I do is I

00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:05.395
need to understand what the
dynamics of the circuit looks

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:08.104
like here.
What I do is I develop the

00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:12.016
characteristic equation.
And initially you will write

00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:16.305
the differential equation and
then substitute e^st and get

00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:20.745
this characteristic equation.
But you could also remember it

00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:23.830
as a pattern.
For a series RLC circuit you

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.065
always get an equation of this
form, always.

00:08:27.065 --> 00:08:30.000
If this were R,
L and C.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.778
And whether you are looking at
L up here or C up here,

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:37.342
as long as you're looking at
the capacitor voltage,

00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:40.835
the capacitor voltage is going
to behave the same.

00:08:40.835 --> 00:08:44.755
And for this circuit the
characteristic equation remains

00:08:44.755 --> 00:08:47.107
the same as well for a series
RLC.

00:08:47.107 --> 00:08:50.173
It is exactly this.
And I write the standard

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:54.164
canonic form as s squared plus
two alpha s + omega nought

00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:56.873
squared.
And omega nought is simply one

00:08:56.873 --> 00:09:01.150
by square root of LC and alpha
is simply R divided by L and I

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.000
have two in the denominator as
well.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.194
And then I get omega d which is
my damped frequency given by

00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:12.037
omega nought squared minus alpha
squared.

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:14.952
And Q is simply called the
quality factor.

00:09:14.952 --> 00:09:18.933
And we will learn about Q in a
lot more detail in about a

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:22.843
couple of lectures from today.
That is given where omega

00:09:22.843 --> 00:09:26.042
nought divided by two alpha.
These parameters,

00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:29.241
alpha, omega nought,
Q and omega d pretty much

00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:33.293
characterize everything else
that I need to know about the

00:09:33.293 --> 00:09:36.035
circuit.
First of all,

00:09:36.035 --> 00:09:39.140
omega d is the frequency of
oscillation.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.598
And so since omega d is a
frequency of oscillation then I

00:09:43.598 --> 00:09:48.216
know that the time period of
oscillation is two pi by omega

00:09:48.216 --> 00:09:49.968
d.
Omega is in radians.

00:09:49.968 --> 00:09:54.824
Notice that for typical values
of circuits like this when R is

00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:58.089
pretty small,
alpha squared is going to be

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:01.902
very small.
It's a common case for

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:07.175
underdamped circuit that omega d
will more or less be equal to

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:10.720
omega nought.
Commonly that is going to be

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.005
the case.
This frequency is governed by

00:10:14.005 --> 00:10:16.253
LC.
And if R is large it is

00:10:16.253 --> 00:10:21.095
governed by this omega d here.
So I have the frequency of

00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:24.639
oscillation.
I also know that Q is related

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:30.000
to the frequency of oscillation
divided by alpha.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.703
It is a ratio of the frequency
divided by how badly I am being

00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:37.402
damped.
So it is a fight between the

00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:41.027
frequency of oscillation and now
heavily I damp.

00:10:41.027 --> 00:10:45.500
And the ratio of that is an
indication of how many cycles I

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.199
ring.
So Q tells me that the ringing

00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:50.820
stops approximately after Q
cycles.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.291
These four values,
omega d, Q, alpha and omega

00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:57.298
nought are telling me more and
more now.

00:10:57.298 --> 00:11:01.000
So I have got these two
factors.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.241
So I know now,
based on omega d and Q,

00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:08.096
that it is going to look
something like this.

00:11:08.096 --> 00:11:12.214
Some ringing here and then I
stop at this point.

00:11:12.214 --> 00:11:17.296
The last thing that is left to
do here for me for now is to

00:11:17.296 --> 00:11:22.640
figure out whether I start out
going down or I start out going

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.268
up.
I start out going down or I

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:30.000
start out going up?
I don't know that yet.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.037
And I stopped at this point in
the last lecture and let you

00:11:34.037 --> 00:11:38.145
think about how you can stare at
the circuit and intuitively

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:41.556
figure out whether this goes
down or that goes up.

00:11:41.556 --> 00:11:44.898
So here is the insight.
Let's stare at this for a

00:11:44.898 --> 00:11:49.145
minute purely through intuition.
The capacitor has a voltage v

00:11:49.145 --> 00:11:52.000
across it, right?
And that is because I am

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.063
telling you that it has an
initial voltage v.

00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:58.613
Now, I want to find out at
prime t equals zero plus,

00:11:58.613 --> 00:12:03.000
in which direction does a
capacitor voltage go?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.393
Increase or decrease?
What do I do?

00:12:05.393 --> 00:12:08.349
Let me take a look at the
inductor current.

00:12:08.349 --> 00:12:12.432
I am told that the inductor
current is negative which means

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:16.021
I am told that the inductor
current is going in this

00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:19.611
direction initially.
The inductor current is pushing

00:12:19.611 --> 00:12:21.864
in this direction.
Now, remember,

00:12:21.864 --> 00:12:26.016
just as the capacitor is one
stubborn nut trying to hold its

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:28.550
voltage, the inductor is as
stubborn.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.000
It is trying to hold its
current.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.470
It is trying to maintain its
current.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.833
And its initial current i(0) is
in this direction.

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:40.715
Capacitor has a voltage here,
that is v(0),

00:12:40.715 --> 00:12:44.627
and the inductor is yanking the
current in that direction.

00:12:44.627 --> 00:12:48.470
So what should happen to the
capacitor voltage initially?

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.901
If I am at v(0) and someone is
yanking current out,

00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:55.470
at least initially in that
direction, what should the

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:00.000
initial dynamics of the
capacitor voltage look like?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.936
Pardon?
It should drop,

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:07.392
which means that if the initial
current is being pulled in that

00:13:07.392 --> 00:13:12.320
direction the capacitor voltage
must droop to begin with.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.015
Completely through intuition.
No math here.

00:13:16.015 --> 00:13:18.831
This means that i(0) is
negative.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:23.320
It is as if i(0) is being
pulled out in this manner,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.543
so the capacitor voltage must
drop to begin life.

00:13:27.543 --> 00:13:33.000
Therefore, the dynamics look
somewhat like this.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.668
Notice that this is very
reminiscent of the ringing that

00:13:40.668 --> 00:13:47.081
we saw at the gate node of the
second inverter.

00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:54.750
Let's stop here in terms of
time domain analysis of RLC,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:02.000
and today let's take another
big step forward.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.541
Today marks another transition
in life here.

00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:09.741
This is actually a huge
transition so I want to just

00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:14.682
pause and take like ten seconds
of a breather just to clearly

00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:19.541
demarcate the fact that we have
a huge transition coming up.

00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:24.564
The key to this transition is
that I want to look at today the

00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:30.000
steady-state response of
networks to a sinusoidal drive.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.758
We are going to do two things
differently starting today on

00:14:33.758 --> 00:14:36.155
this new journey of ours.
In the past,

00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:39.071
we looked at time domain
behavior of circuits.

00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:42.116
For RLC, for example,
we looked at the transient

00:14:42.116 --> 00:14:44.708
response.
And what happened the instant I

00:14:44.708 --> 00:14:47.365
turn something on?
The transient response.

00:14:47.365 --> 00:14:50.799
Today we are going to look at a
steady-state response.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:54.233
Steady-state response says that
if I wait long enough,

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:58.120
for whatever the circuit wants
to do in the beginning of life

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.375
to die out.
If I wait long enough,

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:04.625
how is the circuit going to
behave after a long time?

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:07.687
I will tell you why that is
important in a second.

00:15:07.687 --> 00:15:09.875
I look at the steady-state
behavior.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:13.125
Second, I am going to look
today at sinusoidal drive.

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:16.312
Two things that are different
from, say for example,

00:15:16.312 --> 00:15:18.687
what I covered in the past ten
minutes.

00:15:18.687 --> 00:15:22.062
In the past ten minutes I
covered two things which were

00:15:22.062 --> 00:15:24.375
different.
One is that I looked at the

00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:28.000
transient response and then
steady-state.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.331
And remember for a DC input,
for a DC voltage the

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:34.802
steady-state was a DC voltage
across the capacitor,

00:15:34.802 --> 00:15:37.440
correct?
So the steady-state was pretty

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.466
boring, it was steady-state DC.
But what we are going to do

00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:45.353
today is instead of having DC
inputs or step inputs which

00:15:45.353 --> 00:15:49.518
settle to a DC value after some
time, we are going to drive a

00:15:49.518 --> 00:15:52.017
circuit through the sinusoidal
input.

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:54.793
So you may ask me,
Agarwal, are you nuts?

00:15:54.793 --> 00:15:58.334
Why do you want to drive
something with a sinusoidal

00:15:58.334 --> 00:16:02.540
input?
Why not just steps in DC and so

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.754
on?
That was painful enough.

00:16:04.754 --> 00:16:08.278
Why sinusoidal?
Why not do triangular or why

00:16:08.278 --> 00:16:13.032
not do some other exponentially
decaying stuff or something

00:16:13.032 --> 00:16:16.147
really cool like a whacko music
signal?

00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:19.262
What is special about
sinusoidal stuff?

00:16:19.262 --> 00:16:23.770
The key thing to realize is
that, well, let me ask you a

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.540
question first.
How many people here know about

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.364
Fourier series?
Good.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:34.306
It looks like some of you have
taken the prerequisites.

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:36.861
Good.
Need I say more as to why this

00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.000
is important?
Just that question should give

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.532
you the answer,
right?

00:16:41.532 --> 00:16:44.087
You've learned about Fourier
series.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:47.664
And when you learned about
Fourier series you were

00:16:47.664 --> 00:16:51.970
wondering why on earth are we
learning about Fourier series?

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.766
Who cares that you can
represent the periodic signals

00:16:55.766 --> 00:17:00.000
as a summation of a series of
sine waves?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.341
Why is that interesting?
Why are you telling me that I

00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:06.997
can take a square wave and
represent that as a summation of

00:17:06.997 --> 00:17:10.591
periodic square waves and
represent that as a summation of

00:17:10.591 --> 00:17:12.671
sines?
Who cares that I can take a

00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:16.517
sequence of pulses with a fixed
period and represent that as a

00:17:16.517 --> 00:17:19.039
sum of sines?
Who cares that I can take a

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.317
triangular wave and represent
that as a sum of sines?

00:17:22.317 --> 00:17:26.036
I am not sure what answer your
math professors gave you when

00:17:26.036 --> 00:17:30.792
they taught you Fourier series.
But in math they are purists.

00:17:30.792 --> 00:17:32.893
They don't care about
applications.

00:17:32.893 --> 00:17:36.477
The answer could well have been
because it is aesthetically

00:17:36.477 --> 00:17:38.825
pleasing.
I mean isn't it cool that you

00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:42.039
can represent a sequence of
pulses as a sum of sines?

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:44.387
That is good enough for
mathematicians.

00:17:44.387 --> 00:17:47.601
But I am an engineer.
If it I cannot see how it helps

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:51.370
humanity in the short-term then
I probably don't care too much

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.780
about it.
Let me give you some practical

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.376
significance of this.
So it turns out that,

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:59.837
since we know that we can
represent periodic signals with

00:17:59.837 --> 00:18:04.562
sums of sines.
What this means is that if I

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:10.145
can figure out the behavior of
networks to a sinusoidal input,

00:18:10.145 --> 00:18:14.630
if I can understand how to
analyze a network for a

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:20.305
sinusoidal input that means that
if the circuit is linear I can

00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:25.338
then compute the response of the
circuit to any periodic

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:29.000
waveform.
Here is the argument.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.731
I can represent any periodic
waveform as a sum of sines.

00:18:33.731 --> 00:18:36.139
The Fourier series,
remember?

00:18:36.139 --> 00:18:40.612
If I just figure out the
response of my network for a

00:18:40.612 --> 00:18:44.311
sine wave, then if this is a
linear network,

00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:49.301
I can compute the response to
any sequence of scaled sum of

00:18:49.301 --> 00:18:50.849
sines.
A some sine,

00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:55.752
B sine two, omega whatever,
C sine something or the other.

00:18:55.752 --> 00:19:01.000
I can simply take the response
of the one sine.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.214
And from there I can go ahead,
and knowing the response of a

00:19:05.214 --> 00:19:09.071
sine wave I can compute the
response to a sum of sines.

00:19:09.071 --> 00:19:12.142
That is pretty cool.
Therefore, doing it for

00:19:12.142 --> 00:19:14.785
sinusoidal drives is really
important.

00:19:14.785 --> 00:19:18.500
Why steady-state now?
Hopefully, I have convinced you

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.928
that looking at the response of
circuits to sinusoidal drive is

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:26.785
important and interesting
because we can long ways from

00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:30.000
there.
What about steady-state?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.928
Well, it turns out that,
and I am going to show you,

00:19:32.928 --> 00:19:35.799
when you listen to music,
you have an amplifier and

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.384
listen to music,
what you are observing by and

00:19:38.384 --> 00:19:41.312
large is the steady-state
behavior of the amplifier.

00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:44.873
You are listening to something
over many seconds or many hours.

00:19:44.873 --> 00:19:48.031
And the transients used for
most of our common circuits,

00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:50.156
the transients die out pretty
quickly.

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:53.544
And so the transients are quite
complicated and they die out

00:19:53.544 --> 00:19:55.382
quickly.
We say we are engineers.

00:19:55.382 --> 00:19:59.000
Let's focus on what is
practically important.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.118
And we focus on the
steady-state behavior as a large

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:05.786
part of our analysis and just
completely ignore the transient

00:20:05.786 --> 00:20:09.455
response when we care about the
response to sinusoidal input.

00:20:09.455 --> 00:20:12.940
The transient response will die
away, and I will show that

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.264
mathematically to you in a few
seconds.

00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:18.566
And let's focus on the
steady-state because that what I

00:20:18.566 --> 00:20:20.583
am going to hear most of the
time.

00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:23.885
I am going to listen to an
average over long periods of

00:20:23.885 --> 00:20:25.903
time.
That's the motivation behind

00:20:25.903 --> 00:20:27.554
this.
And let me put this in

00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:31.643
perspective for you.
By now this should bring

00:20:31.643 --> 00:20:35.205
memories to your mind.
This is the playground that we

00:20:35.205 --> 00:20:37.465
are in.
This is the lumped circuit

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:40.273
playground here.
Remember we came from the

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:44.315
playground of nature to the
playground of EECS where we made

00:20:44.315 --> 00:20:48.150
the big leap from Maxwell's
equations to lumped circuits,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.410
that's lumped circuit
abstraction.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.452
And within there we spent a
large part of the last couple of

00:20:54.452 --> 00:20:58.219
months doing linear circuits.
We also analyzed nonlinear

00:20:58.219 --> 00:21:02.068
circuits.
Remember the amplifier circuit

00:21:02.068 --> 00:21:05.448
of the MOSFET large signal
analysis was nonlinear?

00:21:05.448 --> 00:21:07.862
Well, there is linear and
nonlinear.

00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:11.586
Within linear we also showed
that if you take a digital

00:21:11.586 --> 00:21:14.275
circuit, at least as we
understood them,

00:21:14.275 --> 00:21:18.275
and draw the subcircuit for a
given set of switch settings,

00:21:18.275 --> 00:21:22.137
if I set the switches in a
given way what I was left with

00:21:22.137 --> 00:21:26.344
was another linear circuit for a
given value of all the switch

00:21:26.344 --> 00:21:29.843
settings.
My small signal analysis was

00:21:29.843 --> 00:21:32.674
also linear.
If I focused on small signals I

00:21:32.674 --> 00:21:36.230
also had linear analysis.
Today what we are going to do

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.600
is this.
We are going to articulate a

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.707
different part of the
playground.

00:21:40.707 --> 00:21:42.814
This was a big linear
playground.

00:21:42.814 --> 00:21:44.921
We've done this.
We've done this.

00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:47.423
We are going to explore this
territory.

00:21:47.423 --> 00:21:51.111
This is that territory of the
playground in which we have

00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:53.876
sinusoidal inputs to circuits.
Furthermore,

00:21:53.876 --> 00:21:57.563
we are going to look at a
subcircuit of that region which

00:21:57.563 --> 00:22:02.079
is steady-state.
We will look at sinusoidal

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:06.559
input and in the steady-state.
So that is going to be our

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:11.200
focus for the next two or three
lectures just to give you a

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.799
perspective of where we are.
To motivate this,

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:18.799
what I would like to do is
consider your amplifier.

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:22.000
This is our friend the
amplifier circuit,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.240
this part here.
And remember,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.400
even though this is an
amplifier, I am using a MOSFET

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.887
here.
And a MOSFET,

00:22:30.887 --> 00:22:33.755
as you know,
has this gate capacitance CGS.

00:22:33.755 --> 00:22:36.691
I am explicitly drawing it out
for you here.

00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:40.583
And I am going to drive this
with a bias voltage plus some

00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:43.178
small signal vI,
the usual template for

00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:45.704
amplifiers.
And there is some Thevenin

00:22:45.704 --> 00:22:48.026
resistance attached to that
source.

00:22:48.026 --> 00:22:51.235
I am going to model my source
as a bias voltage,

00:22:51.235 --> 00:22:54.103
a small signal plus some source
resistance.

00:22:54.103 --> 00:22:58.268
And I want to apply a sine wave
here and I am going to look at

00:22:58.268 --> 00:23:02.234
what this looks like.
You may think,

00:23:02.234 --> 00:23:05.054
look, this is a linear
amplifier.

00:23:05.054 --> 00:23:10.343
And so if I apply a sine wave
here I should see some response

00:23:10.343 --> 00:23:15.279
here, and that should be the
same amplitude if I feed the

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:18.629
same amplitude here over any
frequency.

00:23:18.629 --> 00:23:22.331
But let's see what happens.
Keep a look at,

00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:27.179
switch over to that view graph
while I show you a little

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:32.260
demonstration here.
What you see here are three

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.782
sine waves, a yellow sine wave
which is the input here,

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:41.889
you see a green sine wave which
is the input vC at the gate of

00:23:41.889 --> 00:23:47.081
the MOSFET, and then you see the
blue which is the output here.

00:23:47.081 --> 00:23:51.016
For now simply focus on the
yellow and the blue.

00:23:51.016 --> 00:23:55.203
The yellow is the input and the
blue is the output.

00:23:55.203 --> 00:24:00.143
So I apply some input and I get
an output that looks more or

00:24:00.143 --> 00:24:05.000
less some linear function of
this input here.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.968
It is a small signal.
What I am going to do is I am

00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:10.461
going to change the frequency of
the input.

00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:13.963
Remember, I want to look at the
response of the circuit to a

00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:16.219
sinusoid.
I am feeding a sinusoid here.

00:24:16.219 --> 00:24:19.009
I look at the response.
I am going to change the

00:24:19.009 --> 00:24:21.442
frequency.
That is a big shift that we are

00:24:21.442 --> 00:24:25.182
making in that the curve that we
drew in the last lecture had to

00:24:25.182 --> 00:24:27.972
do with varying time.
Now I am going to focus on

00:24:27.972 --> 00:24:31.000
sinusoids and vary their
frequency.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.387
I am going to change the
frequency.

00:24:33.387 --> 00:24:37.530
Stare at the blue curve as I
increase the frequency and just

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.883
think of what you might expect.
Based on the knowledge you have

00:24:41.883 --> 00:24:46.096
so far you would expect that
look, as I change the frequency,

00:24:46.096 --> 00:24:50.520
the frequency should change but
I should see the same amplitude.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.891
OK but take a look.
Let me increase the frequency

00:24:53.891 --> 00:24:56.910
of the input.
What do you see at the output?

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.000
I am increasing the frequency.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.440
What do you see happening
there?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.850
If you don't see anything
changing there you will need to

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.921
see an optometrist.
What do we see here?

00:25:19.921 --> 00:25:24.251
As I changed the frequency,
as I increased the frequency

00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:28.425
what happened to the blue?
The blue kept decreasing in

00:25:28.425 --> 00:25:31.730
amplitude.
And you are saying whoa,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.623
what is happening here?
We don't have the tools to deal

00:25:35.623 --> 00:25:38.506
with this.
I expected that when I changed

00:25:38.506 --> 00:25:41.679
my frequency,
my frequency here should change

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:44.851
of course, but why is the
amplitude changing?

00:25:44.851 --> 00:25:47.518
What is happening here?
That is weird.

00:25:47.518 --> 00:25:51.483
I noticed that this amplitude
became smaller because the

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:54.151
amplitude of the green became
smaller.

00:25:54.151 --> 00:25:58.404
And remember the green was the
voltage across the capacitor.

00:25:58.404 --> 00:26:02.604
So this is your RC.
And here is my input.

00:26:02.604 --> 00:26:07.034
My input has the amplitude,
which I am holding more or less

00:26:07.034 --> 00:26:10.090
constant.
And notice that vC decreased in

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.611
value as I increased my
frequency.

00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:16.736
Just hold that thought.
As I increased the frequency of

00:26:16.736 --> 00:26:20.784
my input the amplitude of the
output kept diminishing.

00:26:20.784 --> 00:26:24.145
In other words,
the gain of the system seemed

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:27.583
to have decreased as I increased
by frequency.

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:31.708
And today we will look at why
that is so and how we can

00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:37.904
analyze that.
The other thing that is not so

00:26:37.904 --> 00:26:42.849
obvious here is there is a phase
shift.

00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:50.917
What I am going to do is try to
see if we can observe the phase

00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:53.000
shift here.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.126
Notice here.
What we have been used to is

00:27:05.126 --> 00:27:09.113
for the amplifier we get a
complete inversion at the

00:27:09.113 --> 00:27:11.458
output.
Inversion means a phase

00:27:11.458 --> 00:27:15.210
difference of 180 degrees for a
sine wave, right?

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.743
This peak should have been
here, but notice that there is a

00:27:19.743 --> 00:27:22.557
shifting of the peak.
In other words,

00:27:22.557 --> 00:27:26.857
if the yellow was my input my
output should have had its

00:27:26.857 --> 00:27:31.000
minimum when the input had its
maximum.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.716
But notice there is a shifting
of the signal such that the

00:27:35.716 --> 00:27:39.687
output is a maximum,
not quite at the point where

00:27:39.687 --> 00:27:43.825
the input is a minimum but a
little bit after that.

00:27:43.825 --> 00:27:46.721
Also weird.
Not only has this little

00:27:46.721 --> 00:27:51.271
circuit here lost its gain
somehow, but also it seems to

00:27:51.271 --> 00:27:53.919
have shifted the signal in
phase.

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:57.477
That is weird.
And today we will look at why

00:27:57.477 --> 00:28:02.607
that is so and try to understand
the frequency behavior of this

00:28:02.607 --> 00:28:09.551
little subcomponent here.
Notice that vC is exactly 180

00:28:09.551 --> 00:28:15.918
out of phase with vO.
So vO is faithfully an inverted

00:28:15.918 --> 00:28:23.387
amplified form of the input vC.
However, vC itself should have

00:28:23.387 --> 00:28:30.000
been the same as vI but it looks
quite different.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.466
So let's understand why that is
so.

00:28:32.466 --> 00:28:36.455
The subcircuit to model is the
subcircuit comprising the

00:28:36.455 --> 00:28:38.922
source, resistor and the
capacitor.

00:28:38.922 --> 00:28:41.678
And I am just showing that to
you here.

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:44.362
I have a vI,
a resistor and capacitor.

00:28:44.362 --> 00:28:47.626
And I am going to understand
how this behaves.

00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:51.181
And it is a first order
circuit, single capacitor.

00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:53.647
My input is a vI cosine of
omega t.

00:28:53.647 --> 00:28:58.000
vI is a real number for t
greater than zero.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.404
And I am telling you that the
capacitor voltage starts out

00:29:02.404 --> 00:29:05.109
being zero.
And my vI is a sinusoid.

00:29:05.109 --> 00:29:08.354
It's not a step this time.
It's a sinusoid.

00:29:08.354 --> 00:29:13.068
So vI is a sinusoid and I want
to find out what vC looks like.

00:29:13.068 --> 00:29:17.240
The behavior here tells me,
I will give you the answer,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.181
that when I feed a sinusoidal
input as the frequency

00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:25.277
increases, vC should be
decreasing somehow and also be

00:29:25.277 --> 00:29:28.754
shifting in phase.
Let's do the derivation for

00:29:28.754 --> 00:29:34.470
that and see what happens.
To give you some insight as to

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:39.576
how to go about analyzing this
let me draw a little graph as to

00:29:39.576 --> 00:29:44.352
the effort level of doing this.
To determine vC of t on the

00:29:44.352 --> 00:29:48.964
y-axis here is our effort.
How hard do we have to work to

00:29:48.964 --> 00:29:52.341
solve this circuit for a
sinusoidal input?

00:29:52.341 --> 00:29:56.211
And on this graph,
down here is easy and up here

00:29:56.211 --> 00:30:00.000
is pure agony.
Sheer agony up here.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.541
So it's the scale of effort
level ranging from easy to

00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.281
complete agony.
And this is the time axis.

00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:10.290
And the time axis starts out at
11 o'clock, the early part of

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.896
today's lecture,
and ends at roughly 12,

00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:16.103
that is today's lecture and
this is next lecture.

00:30:16.103 --> 00:30:19.845
What I am going to show you
today is a method that uses a

00:30:19.845 --> 00:30:23.654
usual differential equation
approach, and this is going to

00:30:23.654 --> 00:30:26.460
be pure agony.
If you thought last Thursday

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.555
was agony watch today.
This is going to be sheer,

00:30:30.555 --> 00:30:33.488
sheer, sheer hell.
So I am going to grunge through

00:30:33.488 --> 00:30:37.079
that, and I think I will sort of
give up halfway because it's

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:39.054
just too painful even for me
here.

00:30:39.054 --> 00:30:42.644
Then what I am going to do is
at the end of this lecture I am

00:30:42.644 --> 00:30:45.936
going to show you an approach
that I give a cutesy name.

00:30:45.936 --> 00:30:47.791
I call it the "sneaky
approach".

00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:51.561
We are going to sneak something
in there it is going to be a lot

00:30:51.561 --> 00:30:53.776
easier.
And then in the next lecture I

00:30:53.776 --> 00:30:57.247
am going to show you an even
sneakier approach that is just

00:30:57.247 --> 00:31:01.418
going to be absolute bliss.
So let's start here.

00:31:01.418 --> 00:31:04.326
Indulge me as I go through the
agony part.

00:31:04.326 --> 00:31:08.510
I am going to blast through it
because that is not of how we

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.269
are going to do things,
but you just need to know that

00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:15.319
that is agony.
Let's do a usual differential

00:31:15.319 --> 00:31:17.659
equation approach.
Steps one, two,

00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:20.780
three and four.
Set up differential equation,

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.893
find the particular solution,
find the homogenous solution,

00:31:24.893 --> 00:31:27.801
add up the two and solve for
the unknowns.

00:31:27.801 --> 00:31:31.630
It's a mantra.
The four-step manta.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.483
Let's do it.
Step one, write the DE.

00:31:34.483 --> 00:31:37.989
That's easy.
We have done this before the RC

00:31:37.989 --> 00:31:40.353
circuit.
It's RC dvc/dt+vc=vI.

00:31:40.353 --> 00:31:45.244
This is no different from what
you got from what you got from

00:31:45.244 --> 00:31:49.972
your RC circuit with a step
input, just that my input is VI

00:31:49.972 --> 00:31:55.027
cosine of omega t in this case.
It is not just a DC voltage VI.

00:31:55.027 --> 00:31:58.369
Stare at that.
Enjoy it while the going is

00:31:58.369 --> 00:32:02.131
easy.
It's like traversing rapids,

00:32:02.131 --> 00:32:06.700
and before you come to a class
five, you have calm and raging

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.822
waters there,
you kind of sit there saying

00:32:09.822 --> 00:32:14.010
oh, the scenery around here
looks really good and so on.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:18.350
All you are doing is stalling
before you have dive down to

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.091
class five.
We will get to class five

00:32:21.091 --> 00:32:24.746
rapids in a few seconds here,
so just enjoy this.

00:32:24.746 --> 00:32:27.791
RC dvc/dt+vC=vI.
You've seen this before.

00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:31.208
Nothing fancy.
Good old stuff.

00:32:31.208 --> 00:32:34.994
VI cosine of omega t.
You want to hold onto your

00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:36.041
seatbelts?
OK.

00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:40.391
Let's find the particular
solution to the cosine input.

00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:44.902
Let's use our standard method.
What I will do is just so,

00:32:44.902 --> 00:32:48.527
there is going to be so much
crapola up there,

00:32:48.527 --> 00:32:53.038
so that I draw your attention
to vP, which is what we are

00:32:53.038 --> 00:32:56.422
trying to get,
I am just going to put a box

00:32:56.422 --> 00:33:01.061
around vP in red.
If you see like all sorts of

00:33:01.061 --> 00:33:04.301
garbage appear,
just look for the red square.

00:33:04.301 --> 00:33:06.952
That is what we are trying to
get at.

00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:09.161
That's the equation.
Let's try.

00:33:09.161 --> 00:33:12.990
First try, A worked before.
A constant value A worked

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.083
before for DC inputs.
Let's try that again.

00:33:16.083 --> 00:33:18.513
If it worked then it may work
now.

00:33:18.513 --> 00:33:22.489
If I use A, a constant value,
and I substitute it here,

00:33:22.489 --> 00:33:26.539
I get dA/dt goes to zero,
vP is A, but on the right-hand

00:33:26.539 --> 00:33:32.363
side I have VI cosine omega t.
So clearly A doesn't work.

00:33:32.363 --> 00:33:34.090
Sorry.
I struck out.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:39.090
Well, cosine omega t here,
let's try A cosine omega T as

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.636
my particular solution.
Things are getting a little

00:33:43.636 --> 00:33:46.636
harder now, a little more
painful.

00:33:46.636 --> 00:33:49.818
So substitute A cosine omega t
here.

00:33:49.818 --> 00:33:55.090
So I do get A cosine omega T
for vP, but out here I get RCA

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:00.000
sine omega t times omega times
minus one.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.618
So I have a sine and a cosine,
and I have a cosine on the

00:34:05.618 --> 00:34:09.531
right-hand side.
Sorry, it doesn't work.

00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:15.150
Nope, doesn't work either.
Well, let's try A cosine omega

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:19.163
t plus phi.
We are now embarking into the

00:34:19.163 --> 00:34:22.876
rapids here.
You can begin feeling the

00:34:22.876 --> 00:34:26.688
pressure.
Just to refresh your memories

00:34:26.688 --> 00:34:32.038
of sines and cosines.
A is the amplitude of the

00:34:32.038 --> 00:34:34.483
cosine.
Omega is the frequency.

00:34:34.483 --> 00:34:38.152
Phi is the phase.
Remember the signal I showed

00:34:38.152 --> 00:34:41.331
you earlier?
If something happens to the

00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:45.652
amplitude of the sine,
something happens to the phase.

00:34:45.652 --> 00:34:50.135
A cosine omega t plus phi.
Let me plug it in here and go

00:34:50.135 --> 00:34:53.396
by standard practice.
Here is what I get.

00:34:53.396 --> 00:34:56.902
I plug in A cosine omega t to
this equation,

00:34:56.902 --> 00:35:01.412
and this is what I get.
I differentiate it.

00:35:01.412 --> 00:35:05.501
I get omega out minus sine,
sine of negative d plus phi,

00:35:05.501 --> 00:35:09.218
A cosine omega t plus phi
equals VI cosine omega t.

00:35:09.218 --> 00:35:12.563
That might work.
Now we get into the class six

00:35:12.563 --> 00:35:16.429
part of the class five.
All class fives have a little

00:35:16.429 --> 00:35:20.369
bit of class six rapids.
Remember, the rapids go up on

00:35:20.369 --> 00:35:23.565
an exponential scale so it like
earthquakes.

00:35:23.565 --> 00:35:27.208
What I do now is expand out
sine omega t plus phi,

00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:31.000
blah, blah, blah,
it goes on and on.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.783
I could go on and on,
but this is even tiring me.

00:35:35.783 --> 00:35:41.364
This can be made to work,
but I am not sure I want to put

00:35:41.364 --> 00:35:45.549
all of us through this trig
nightmare here.

00:35:45.549 --> 00:35:50.034
If I am really,
really nasty I could give this

00:35:50.034 --> 00:35:54.419
to you as a homework assignment
or something,

00:35:54.419 --> 00:36:00.000
but I am not that nasty so you
won't see that.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.586
But if I go down this path it
will get me to the answer,

00:36:03.586 --> 00:36:06.456
but I would have to soon
negotiate class six,

00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:09.130
class seven rapids to get to
where I want.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.195
So let me punt on it,
let me start from scratch.

00:36:12.195 --> 00:36:15.000
I am at step two,
let me start from scratch.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.652
Instead what I would like to do
is let's get sneaky here.

00:36:18.652 --> 00:36:21.586
Rather than negotiating the
class five rapids,

00:36:21.586 --> 00:36:25.239
what we can say is ah-ha,
we can take our canoes and jump

00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:30.000
onto shore and run down and then
get back onto the river.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.361
Let's do that.
That is called the sneaky

00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:34.783
approach.
So that all our friends who are

00:36:34.783 --> 00:36:37.507
behind us think we are
negotiating the rapids,

00:36:37.507 --> 00:36:41.080
but what we are going to do is
get sneaky and take the shore

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.412
path.
Let's get sneaky,

00:36:42.412 --> 00:36:45.197
just walk down the shore and
see what is there.

00:36:45.197 --> 00:36:47.861
I want to do something
completely weird here.

00:36:47.861 --> 00:36:51.251
I want to look at solving this
equation through the shore

00:36:51.251 --> 00:36:53.492
method.
S stands for shore or S stands

00:36:53.492 --> 00:36:57.185
for sneaky, whatever you want.
What I am going to do is rather

00:36:57.185 --> 00:37:01.000
than trying to solve for VI
cosine omega t.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.370
I am going to say let's try a
different input all together.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.637
And you will understand why in
a second.

00:37:06.637 --> 00:37:09.601
It's like I am the captain of
my canoe and I tell my

00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:12.274
teammates, hey,
let's not negotiate the rapids,

00:37:12.274 --> 00:37:15.645
let's go and explore the shore.
Maybe down the shore we can

00:37:15.645 --> 00:37:19.190
find a path that gets us across
to the other side more easily.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.735
So here is me and my colleagues
carrying our canoe and getting

00:37:22.735 --> 00:37:24.769
onto shore and taking a sneaky
path.

00:37:24.769 --> 00:37:26.803
This is not what I set out to
solve.

00:37:26.803 --> 00:37:30.000
I don't know where this will
lead me.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.412
But let's see where the shore
path leads us.

00:37:33.412 --> 00:37:36.746
I want to try solving this
equation Vie^st.

00:37:36.746 --> 00:37:40.634
S stands for shore or sneaky or
whatever you want.

00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:45.396
I don't know where I am going,
but let's see where this leads

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.746
us.
Let's explore.

00:37:46.746 --> 00:37:50.079
Make believe you are Columbus
or something.

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:53.492
I don't know.
Let's use the usual techniques

00:37:53.492 --> 00:37:57.380
and see how this works out.
Let's try a particular

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.775
solution, Vpe^st.
My input is Vie^st.

00:38:01.775 --> 00:38:06.822
I am trying to solve the
circuit for a different input.

00:38:06.822 --> 00:38:11.962
And let me try solution Vpe^st
and see if that works out

00:38:11.962 --> 00:38:15.140
nicely.
I substitute Vpe^st into my

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.971
equation here,
so RCVpe^st blah blah blah.

00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:23.457
What I get here is Vie^st,
Vpe^st stays the same,

00:38:23.457 --> 00:38:28.317
but here vP comes out,
s comes out and e^st stays the

00:38:28.317 --> 00:38:31.751
same.
That is nice property of

00:38:31.751 --> 00:38:34.087
exponentials.
This is what I get.

00:38:34.087 --> 00:38:37.883
A really cool property of
exponentials is that when I

00:38:37.883 --> 00:38:41.021
differentiate it I get the
exponential back.

00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:45.328
Unlike a cosine I got a sine,
and for a sine I got a cosine.

00:38:45.328 --> 00:38:49.635
Exponentials are very plain and
simple, are straightforward.

00:38:49.635 --> 00:38:53.284
What you see is what you get.
You differentiate it.

00:38:53.284 --> 00:38:56.350
You get the same thing,
you get scaling vP,

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:00.000
S and so on,
and some scaling here.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.168
You get S scaling here,
but the basic form stays the

00:39:05.168 --> 00:39:07.601
same.
This is quite nice.

00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:12.972
I have e^st in all three
places, so I can cancel those

00:39:12.972 --> 00:39:17.533
out and I get this expression.
And I get this.

00:39:17.533 --> 00:39:21.081
Wow.
So if I go down the shore I get

00:39:21.081 --> 00:39:25.540
some place fast.
I don't know where I am yet,

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.000
but whatever I did,
it was easy.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.638
I am just exploring this path,
down the shore path.

00:39:33.638 --> 00:39:36.985
I am making progress.
I don't know where I have

00:39:36.985 --> 00:39:39.969
gotten yet.
We will see where we got to in

00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:43.171
a second, but I got some place
quickly, fast.

00:39:43.171 --> 00:39:47.028
I was able to solve for this
input Vie^st and get this

00:39:47.028 --> 00:39:50.230
solution very quickly.
So what happened here?

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.305
I assumed the solution of the
form Vpe^st, substituted it

00:39:54.305 --> 00:39:58.816
back, and found that if vP were
equal to Vi/(1+sRC) then Vpe^st

00:39:58.816 --> 00:40:03.971
is a solution.
What I have done here is that

00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:09.607
Vi/(1+sRC) is a particular
solution to this equation for

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:14.321
the input Vie^st.
I put a box around it because

00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:17.600
this is important.
This was easy.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.929
We went down the shore,
and said let's try this other

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:26.720
input.
We made rapid progress on shore

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.753
and I got some place.
I don't know where I am yet.

00:40:31.753 --> 00:40:34.196
I got this.
Let me pause here and let me

00:40:34.196 --> 00:40:37.766
give you the final answer.
I am going to show you over the

00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:40.334
next five minutes that this is
our answer.

00:40:40.334 --> 00:40:42.651
You are staring at the answer
already.

00:40:42.651 --> 00:40:45.281
I am a party,
I have taken a shore path and

00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:48.350
we have gotten some place.
We see the river there,

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.482
so it turns out we are exactly
where we want to be,

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:54.739
just after the rapids.
All I have to do now is get my

00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:58.496
colleagues into the river with
myself in the canoe and we are

00:40:58.496 --> 00:41:01.263
done.
You don't know that yet.

00:41:01.263 --> 00:41:04.315
My colleagues and I are sitting
on the shore looking at the

00:41:04.315 --> 00:41:05.894
river.
We've gotten some place.

00:41:05.894 --> 00:41:08.631
There are no rapids there.
We have gotten some place.

00:41:08.631 --> 00:41:11.578
We don't quite know is this
just after the rapids or not.

00:41:11.578 --> 00:41:14.052
We don't know yet,
but I got there very quickly.

00:41:14.052 --> 00:41:17.210
And I will tell you right now,
that is the place we wanted to

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.105
go to.
The next five view graphs I am

00:41:19.105 --> 00:41:21.894
going to blast through.
There is going to be more pain

00:41:21.894 --> 00:41:24.105
and agony to show you why that
is the case.

00:41:24.105 --> 00:41:27.157
It's me thinking I am Columbus
and proving to my colleagues

00:41:27.157 --> 00:41:30.000
that this is where we want to
be.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.720
And pulling out my sextant,
and the compasses and so on

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.716
that cartographers and people
use to prove to my colleagues

00:41:37.716 --> 00:41:41.230
that this is where I want to be.
This is the answer.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:45.295
The next five view graphs will
be demonstrating that this is

00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:48.533
indeed the answer,
or close enough to the answer

00:41:48.533 --> 00:41:51.909
that we will be satisfied.
Isn't this spectacular?

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:56.181
I am going to show you in about
five minutes that this gives us

00:41:56.181 --> 00:42:00.314
all the information we need to
know to compute the sinusoidal

00:42:00.314 --> 00:42:05.000
steady-state response to this
differential equation.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Let me write that down here
just so you know.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.515
Just so you remember.
I am going to put a marker on

00:42:24.515 --> 00:42:28.031
the shore that says this is
where we are right now.

00:42:28.031 --> 00:42:31.939
Now let me prove to you.
As I just said,

00:42:31.939 --> 00:42:39.181
vPS is Vi, it's this stuff here
multiplied by e^st is the

00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:45.646
solution to Vie^st.
This guy here is a solution for

00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:52.629
Vie^st and vP is simply the
coefficient that multiplies

00:42:52.629 --> 00:42:56.896
e^st.
Similarly, if I substitute S

00:42:56.896 --> 00:43:02.406
equals j omega.
I told you five view graphs of

00:43:02.406 --> 00:43:07.379
more hell, but I am just going
to prove to you that this is it.

00:43:07.379 --> 00:43:10.106
I am substituting S equals j
omega.

00:43:10.106 --> 00:43:15.000
This is Columbus giving a big
speech at the end convincing his

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.368
colleagues that we are where we
want to be.

00:43:18.368 --> 00:43:22.299
I substitute j omega for S and
this is what I get.

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:27.112
This is a solution for e to the
st, and so this is a solution

00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:33.480
for e to the j omega t.
And let me mark this for you as

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.971
something to remember.
Vi/(1+j omega RC).

00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:43.136
In terms of that,
I am substituting j omega for

00:43:43.136 --> 00:43:46.617
S.
And this is a complex number.

00:43:46.617 --> 00:43:52.905
It is a complex amplitude.
It is a complex number because

00:43:52.905 --> 00:43:58.182
of j here, and it multiplies e
to the j omega t.

00:43:58.182 --> 00:44:03.609
Just keep this in mind.
So that was easy.

00:44:03.609 --> 00:44:08.343
The steps were easy.
I am still proving to you that

00:44:08.343 --> 00:44:13.834
this is where we want to be.
Now let me draw the connection

00:44:13.834 --> 00:44:17.431
back to vP.
And the first fact was that

00:44:17.431 --> 00:44:21.976
finding the response to Vie^(j
omega t) was easy.

00:44:21.976 --> 00:44:25.479
We know that.
Second was the following

00:44:25.479 --> 00:44:31.159
observation that Vi cosine omega
t is simply the real part of

00:44:31.159 --> 00:44:37.119
this number here.
So Vi cosine omega t is simply

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:42.943
the real part of Vie^(j omega t)
from the Euler relation.

00:44:42.943 --> 00:44:48.456
So cosine omega t is simply the
real part of this guy.

00:44:48.456 --> 00:44:51.679
Light bulbs beginning to go
off?

00:44:51.679 --> 00:44:58.128
The first fast was that finding
the response to Vie^(j omega t)

00:44:58.128 --> 00:45:02.377
was easy.
And the response was this,

00:45:02.377 --> 00:45:05.212
right?
Times e to the j omega t.

00:45:05.212 --> 00:45:07.407
That was easy.
All right.

00:45:07.407 --> 00:45:12.985
And the second part is that the
real part of this is Vi cosine

00:45:12.985 --> 00:45:17.831
omega t was our input.
Draw the connection between two

00:45:17.831 --> 00:45:21.123
steps.
Finding the response to Vie^(j

00:45:21.123 --> 00:45:25.421
omega t) was easy.
The real part of that was the

00:45:25.421 --> 00:45:31.000
input we cared about.
Are light bulbs going off?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.492
Let me draw you a little
picture here to show you what is

00:45:35.492 --> 00:45:37.979
happening.
Response to vI is vP.

00:45:37.979 --> 00:45:41.750
It's the particular response we
are looking for.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.083
Remember the red square?
But we threw in a sneaky input

00:45:46.083 --> 00:45:49.452
vIS and we formed the response
vPS to that.

00:45:49.452 --> 00:45:52.501
This step was easy.
This step was hard.

00:45:52.501 --> 00:45:55.148
vI to vP was hard,
trig nightmare,

00:45:55.148 --> 00:45:59.000
remember?
But vIS to vPS was easy.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.898
It was a simple Vpe^st thing.
We also know that the real part

00:46:05.898 --> 00:46:10.958
of vIS is vI.
The real part of this is simply

00:46:10.958 --> 00:46:14.407
vI.
If you have a real circuit,

00:46:14.407 --> 00:46:20.731
if you have a real linear
circuit, for a linear circuit,

00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:27.745
if the real part of this gives
me vI then the real part of the

00:46:27.745 --> 00:46:33.844
solution should give me vP.
So computing vPS was easy.

00:46:33.844 --> 00:46:37.818
If I take the real part of
this, I take the corresponding

00:46:37.818 --> 00:46:40.940
real part of this.
This is sort of an inverse

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.565
superposition argument.
Superposition,

00:46:43.565 --> 00:46:47.538
I said, take the response for
A, take the response for B,

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:51.015
add them up and you get the
response for A plus B.

00:46:51.015 --> 00:46:55.272
Here what we are saying is that
get the response to A plus B,

00:46:55.272 --> 00:46:59.388
or to A plus jB and the real
part of the input will produce

00:46:59.388 --> 00:47:04.000
the response given by the real
part of the output.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.042
So this is an inverse
superposition argument.

00:47:07.042 --> 00:47:10.914
If it is a linear circuit,
then if vI is the real part of

00:47:10.914 --> 00:47:15.132
this sneaky input then I find
the response to the sneaky input

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:17.760
and take its real part I should
get vP.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.287
Here I am, Columbus,
staring down at the entrance to

00:47:21.287 --> 00:47:24.952
this part of the river.
I just proved to my colleagues

00:47:24.952 --> 00:47:30.000
that all we have to do is take
the real part of what we have.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.180
We can just jump right back
into the river and get back to

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.601
vP.
And what I am going to do next

00:47:36.601 --> 00:47:40.488
is just grind through the math
and just show you that.

00:47:40.488 --> 00:47:44.083
I will just blast through it.
It is not important,

00:47:44.083 --> 00:47:48.264
but you have it in your notes.
I am telling you that vP is

00:47:48.264 --> 00:47:51.271
simply the real part of the
sneaky output.

00:47:51.271 --> 00:47:54.865
And I take the real part of vP
e to the j omega t.

00:47:54.865 --> 00:48:00.000
And I take the real part.
And just a bunch of math here.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.089
I am just taking the real part
and doing a bunch of complex

00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:06.487
math.
Remember vP was given by this

00:48:06.487 --> 00:48:09.589
quantity here.
And I take the real part and I

00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:13.679
end up with vP is simply this
quantity multiplied by cosine

00:48:13.679 --> 00:48:16.993
omega t plus phi,
where phi is given by is given

00:48:16.993 --> 00:48:20.801
by tan inverse of omega RC,
and this is the coefficient

00:48:20.801 --> 00:48:24.397
multiplying the cosine.
So by taking the sneaky path

00:48:24.397 --> 00:48:27.993
and then taking the real part of
that output answer,

00:48:27.993 --> 00:48:33.000
I was able to very quickly get
to where I wanted to be.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.303
So from here to here it is only
math.

00:48:35.303 --> 00:48:38.182
Recall, that vP,
the thing in the red was what

00:48:38.182 --> 00:48:41.189
we set out to find out,
which was the particular

00:48:41.189 --> 00:48:43.236
response to VI cosine of omega
t.

00:48:43.236 --> 00:48:46.372
And remember that two grunge is
all of this stuff.

00:48:46.372 --> 00:48:50.274
I am going to blast through two
or three more view graphs that

00:48:50.274 --> 00:48:54.113
just give you more insight and
more math, nothing particular.

00:48:54.113 --> 00:48:57.376
And remember to solve the
equation we have to find a

00:48:57.376 --> 00:49:00.000
homogenous solution,
too.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.418
But recall that the homogenous
solution for an RC circuit is of

00:49:04.418 --> 00:49:07.909
the form Ae^-t/RC.
This means that as time becomes

00:49:07.909 --> 00:49:10.261
very large this part goes to
zero.

00:49:10.261 --> 00:49:13.182
As time becomes large in the
steady state,

00:49:13.182 --> 00:49:15.890
remember I care about the
steady state?

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:18.741
This goes to zero.
I don't care about the

00:49:18.741 --> 00:49:21.662
homogenous solution.
Isn't that fantastic?

00:49:21.662 --> 00:49:25.439
Most the circuits we will deal
with, except for purely

00:49:25.439 --> 00:49:30.000
oscillatory ones,
the homogenous part dies away.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.358
You have something like e to
the -t whatever.

00:49:33.358 --> 00:49:35.496
It just dies away.
It's gone.

00:49:35.496 --> 00:49:38.473
So the total solution has vH
going away.

00:49:38.473 --> 00:49:40.992
And what I end up with is just
vP.

00:49:40.992 --> 00:49:44.809
My total solution in the steady
state is simply vP.

00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:48.320
And A is given by this that we
just calculated.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.442
I just have a bunch more
insight that I talk about that

00:49:52.442 --> 00:49:55.038
you can look through in your
notes.

00:49:55.038 --> 00:50:00.000
And I just want to show you a
very quick summary.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.152
In summary, what we have is we
computed vP.

00:50:04.152 --> 00:50:08.997
It was a complex coefficient.
And all these steps,

00:50:08.997 --> 00:50:12.754
2 grunge, 3 and 4 were a waste
of time.

00:50:12.754 --> 00:50:18.884
And what I showed you was that
for the input VI the coefficient

00:50:18.884 --> 00:50:23.135
vP was complex.
And I can take the ratio and

00:50:23.135 --> 00:50:26.596
represent it in this manner as
well.

00:50:26.596 --> 00:50:29.957
And from vP,
I can then compute the

00:50:29.957 --> 00:50:35.000
multiplier for the cosine as
follows.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.125
I divide by vP here.
Remember the cosine was

00:50:38.125 --> 00:50:41.395
multiplied by,
in the mathematical step that I

00:50:41.395 --> 00:50:44.375
did, VI divided one plus,
this stuff here,

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:48.226
so I could get the magnitude
and phase of the transfer

00:50:48.226 --> 00:50:51.715
function of this circuit in the
following manner.

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:55.930
And to wrap up very quickly,
I am going to cover this again

00:50:55.930 --> 00:51:00.000
the next time and show you a
magnitude plot.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.882
Notice here that if I plot
Vp/Vi.

00:51:02.882 --> 00:51:06.846
Remember this was Vp here.
That's the answer.

00:51:06.846 --> 00:51:12.252
The magnitude looks like this.
On a log scale Vp/Vi for small

00:51:12.252 --> 00:51:17.297
frequencies omega is at one,
but as omega increases Vp/Vi

00:51:17.297 --> 00:51:20.540
keeps decreasing.
That is the output.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.414
Remember Vp was the amplitude
of the output?

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:30.000
That keeps decreasing.
And this is the reason why.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.798
As I increase the frequency,
the amplitude of my output

00:51:34.798 --> 00:51:39.596
cosine kept decreasing.
I could also plot the phase for

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.196
you.
And the phase,

00:51:41.196 --> 00:51:46.172
in the same manner as omega
increased, my phase also kept

00:51:46.172 --> 00:51:50.082
shifting from zero initially to
pi/2 finally.

00:51:50.082 --> 00:51:55.502
Let me stop here and start with
this the next time and revisit

00:51:55.502 --> 00:51:57.190
this.
Unfortunately,

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:02.255
I won't have time for the demo.
I will show it to you next

00:52:02.255 --> 00:52:03.255
time.
