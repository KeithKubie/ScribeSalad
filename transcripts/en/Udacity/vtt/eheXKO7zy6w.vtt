We briefly mentioned attitudes earlier in this lesson, but now we're going to

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.988
take a look at attitudes in a bit more detail. First, we can define attitudes

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:14.025
as an individual's favorable or unfavorable beliefs, feelings or actions toward

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:20.014
an object, an idea or a person. How do you feel about birth control, or

00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:26.104
abortions? Or what about guns, or even the Detroit Red Wings? Well, we can look

00:00:26.104 --> 00:00:29.521
at attitudes towards one of these examples by examining the three components of

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:34.587
our attitudes. Given my earlier discussion about the Red Wings, let's use that

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:39.763
as an example. Attitudes are comprised of three components. First, we have the

00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:44.203
affective component. And this includes our feelings and emotions that are

00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:49.332
associated with our belief. In my example, my affective component towards the

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:55.006
red wings would consist of enthusiasm, excitement, price and overall happiness.

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.646
Now, let's move on to talk about the second component and that is the

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.000
behavioural component
