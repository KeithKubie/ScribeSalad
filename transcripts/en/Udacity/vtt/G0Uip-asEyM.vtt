00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.430
The change from cytosine to thymine is considered a

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.270
nonsense mutation, because it changes an arginine codon to

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.250
a stop codon. Now, this ends protein synthesis prematurely,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.620
and you get a very shortened and highly dysfunctional

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.200
protein. And without a fully functioning protein, an individual

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200
is likely to be effected by a kind of

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.310
red green color blindness called protanopia. Which means that

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.050
instead of seeing a normal color spectrum like this,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.720
they're actually less sensitive to red light. And the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.650
color spectrum looks like this instead. As you can see,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.280
there's very little difference between what should appear green and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.642
what should appear red. Thus the name, red-green color blindness.
