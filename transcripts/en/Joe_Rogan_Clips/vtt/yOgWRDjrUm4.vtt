1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.540
The Joe Rogan experience,
we come here,

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:06.230
what would you have to do to be fined if they actually are,

3
00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:08.960
that's the bonus system would be jailed.
Yeah.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.300
I mean just think about what they're doing to Julian Assange.
Right?

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.190
They're throwing that guy in a jail somewhere.
I can look good.
That embassy move.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.360
No,
but I mean the fact that what he did was released information that everybody

7
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:26.361
found very interesting and what they did is crashed the whole fucking economy.

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.630
Right.
He was able to write that embassy idea for as long as he,

9
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.750
cause he's not actually in another country.
It's in London.

10
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:37.470
And I went and visited him in there.
As a matter of fact,
just briefly popped in.

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.940
So things going to happen with him.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
Well think he's gonna end up serving a pretty lumpy prison sentence somewhere

13
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:45.390
isn't even,
hopefully things are going to get them on though.

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.890
Like what are they going to charge them on?

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.500
They're charging them on like hacking charges or some shit now,

16
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.520
which they didn't charge him on before.
Right.
Is that what's emerged?

17
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.620
And he's going to be extradited to this country.
Is that true?
I don't know.

18
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.260
I don't know.
Well,
I mean again,

19
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.650
I suppose this is what happens if you challenged the interest of the powerful,

20
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.620
if Trump was really Trump really wanting to get people on the side,

21
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.740
he pardon him.
Do you think that that would be popular?

22
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:10.380
Cause I assimilate that Edward Snowden is it sort of,

23
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
obviously I think don't put the lives of people at risk that are in compromised

24
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.000
military positions.
That seemed like a fairly obvious thing,

25
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.030
but like I don't think they did that.
No,
it doesn't.

26
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.820
What I understood was they got hacked and someone else released the,

27
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.640
the documents without the names redacted.
Yeah.

28
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.380
It seems to me Wiki leaks never did that.

29
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.120
[inaudible] it seems to qualify for hero in pretty much any way you look at it.

30
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.450
And he's like 26 year old person making that decision and had very brilliant,

31
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.810
you know,
I've heard him,
uh,
I think he was on Neil degrasse Tyson's podcast.

32
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.380
They talked to him.
Oh Wow.
Skype or however they did it.

33
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.360
But did you see in season four,

34
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.120
there's a bit like in that film about able to Snowden citizen for,

35
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.730
there's a bit where he's just come out and he's talking to the journalists are

36
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:52.350
film makers that are making the film.
It's kind,

37
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.540
they can find what do you with this foam,
you can't leave that like ever.

38
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:57.840
He's like in a sort of a state of mad enlightenment where he's just seeing the

39
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.030
truth.
If they're listening to us now,
you can't fucking have that on.

40
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.990
You've got to let them know like this terrifying to watch someone because you

41
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:05.550
know,
obviously now he's calmed down.
He's dealt with,
he understands that,

42
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:05.760
you know.

43
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.700
But he was like a person that was emerging from having seen the other side of

44
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.010
the Matrix.
Yeah,
many,
many.
He was deep into it.

45
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:13.740
And then when he revealed all the information,
they had a fucking,

46
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.840
they were had a man hunt for him.

47
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.790
The guy to hide out in Russia here to seek asylum in our enemy.
Yes.

48
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.710
The whole thing is so strange.
Yeah.

49
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.260
So who do our power structures actually support?

50
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:28.320
If someone tells the truth that are population they have to flee to Russia.

51
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.370
If someone talks about improper agricultural practices,
that's against the law.

52
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:36.120
They can be in prison.
That it starts to reveal that the state itself,

53
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.320
the very thing that we revere,

54
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:41.550
the very thing that we identify is the tool of our oppression.

55
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.000
Who want to discourage people from leaking information that makes them look

56
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.000
horrible.
It's that simple.
It's that simple.

57
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.900
If you look at what information he leaked and what would it did,
what it,

58
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.880
you know what he did was he revealed things that everyone wanted to know that we

59
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.220
felt

60
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v 1>were crying.</v>

61
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.250
<v 0>It makes me feel that it's as simple as if you knew what we do in order to keep</v>

62
00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:10.700
shit running,
you would revolt so we are never going to let you know.

63
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.690
Well that for me in a sense is a pass.

64
00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:14.900
The stuffing we'll hold on fucking hell are you?

65
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.020
<v 1>I thought you are elected officials.
You're one of us.
But no,
you're above us.</v>

66
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:22.080
To the point where someone leaks information about your crimes.

67
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.040
They get locked in this embassy for seven years.
Like,

68
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:30.720
what is their crime exactly in comparison to the crimes that he's revealed?
Yes.

69
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.550
Like that's where it's crazy that when you look at the balance,

70
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:40.551
the imbalance between what his crime is and the crimes that he's revealed,

71
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.630
I mean,
he's revealed some staggering crimes and no one's concentrating on that.

72
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:48.930
The government is not freaking out.
We've got to,
we've left some obviously,
uh,

73
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.410
we have work to do,
we have corrections to make.
There's none of that talk.

74
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.610
There's get that guy talk.

75
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.110
<v 0>Yeah,
that's right.
And a like a,
it's sort of under the veil of patriotism.</v>

76
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.600
A lot can be concealed and that is,
uh,

77
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.830
an incident that passes through several administrations.
Yeah.

78
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.810
So like you have for seven years.
So yes.
It makes you feel,
well,
what is the,

79
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.080
what are the difference is,
you know,
like I kind of,
you know,
sort of a,

80
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:16.530
I've been on Bill Maher show,
I like Bill Maher.
I'm,
I'm,
you know,

81
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:17.880
very simple fake tear left.

82
00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:20.760
We can know that I'm ultimately beyond the left left wing.
I'm,
you know,

83
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.400
trying to,

84
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.510
my belief is that we should try and organize a system based on hallucinogenic

85
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:25.880
experience for fuck sake.
There's,

86
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.830
there's no party for me and I'm not even allowed the fucking hallucinogens.

87
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.690
So like,
so like I'm like,
you know,
I'm not a right wing person.
It's safe to say,

88
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.920
but like I feel that many of the problems that we're experiencing now is because

89
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.840
the democratic left wing liberal organizations stopped serving the people.

90
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.980
They were in the case of the British Labor Party,
designed or set up to serve,

91
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:49.300
they neglected them,
they abandoned them.
You know,

92
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.520
the white or the white working class in Britain were 50 60 years ago told,
hey,

93
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:54.630
there's this thing called Britain.

94
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.930
We want you to go out there and fight and die for it and give up your sons.

95
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:01.800
Get out there.
Oh,
and now they're told,
hey,
there's no such thing as a Britain.

96
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.870
And like,
yeah,
no wonder people are confused.
No one there.

97
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.050
People are baffled,

98
00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:11.370
no wonder they were abandoned constituencies and despair and rage.

99
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.670
And I feel that in a way it's like what is patriotism resourced from a sense

100
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.170
that we all need to belong,
that we want to be together.
So,
you know,
look,

101
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:24.960
we're willing to believe in a fictional idea,
a flag,

102
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:28.080
and a story about,
you know,
the origin of a nation,

103
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.450
whether that's an old one like mine or a new one like this one.
You know,

104
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.880
we're willing to participate in that,
but if those values aren't real,
if I own,

105
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.160
like,
if it is,
we are going to support the most powerful,

106
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.490
we will lie to you whenever necessary.
When our lies are revealed,
will imprison,

107
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.900
punish,
and lie about those people.
We don't care about the most vulnerable.

108
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.590
What the fuck is the flag that we're waiving?
Who is it for?
