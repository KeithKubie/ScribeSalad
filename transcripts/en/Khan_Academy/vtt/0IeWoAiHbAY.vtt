00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:01.209
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.089
we introduced the idea
of parallel resistors.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.609
These two resistors are in
parallel with each other

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.889
because they share nodes and they have

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:09.389
the same voltage across them.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.249
So that configuration is
called the parallel resistor.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.949
And we also showed that
these two resistors

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.449
could be replaced by a single resistor

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.229
we labeled this one R1, this is R2.

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.229
We showed that we can replace R1 and R2

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:28.729
by an equivalent parallel resistor

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.789
with this expression
here for two resistors.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.789
RP ..one over RP equals one over R1 plus

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.589
one over R2.

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.189
So that's how you calculate
the equivalent resistance

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.269
for two parallel resistors.

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.209
Now you can ask and
it's a good thing to ask

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:51.769
what if there's more resistors?

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.489
What if there's more
resistors in parallel here?

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.489
What if I have R3 and R4 and RN

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.369
all connected up here.

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:09.149
What happens in this expression?

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:17.905
So like we did before
we had a current here

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:19.935
and we know that current comes back here.

00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:23.115
The first current split, some current goes

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.995
down through R1, some
current goes through R2

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:28.515
and if we had more resistors
some goes down through

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:32.325
R3, and some goes through RN.

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:35.615
So the current basically
is coming down here

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:38.475
and splitting amongst all the resistors.

00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:40.975
Now all the resistors share the same

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:44.335
all the resistors share the same voltage.

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:47.715
So that's just V, let's label V.

00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:50.195
That's just V, they all share the same V

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:51.735
and they all have a different current.

00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:54.475
Assuming they all have a
different resistance value.

00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:56.295
So we do exactly the same analysis

00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:57.335
that we did before.

00:01:57.335 --> 00:02:01.295
Which was, we know that I here

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:03.175
here

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:04.625
has to be the sum,

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:08.045
there's the summation symbol

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.898
of all the I's.

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.618
I1, plus I2, plus I3

00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:18.458
plus IN, that's as many as we have.

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:19.458
So we know that's true.

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:22.718
And we also know that

00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:24.679
the current, we also know that the current

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.419
in each individual resistor

00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:30.571
IN

00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:33.981
is equal to one over that resistor

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:39.121
times V, and V is the same
for every one of them.

00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:43.481
So now we substitute this
equation into here for I

00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:47.221
For I.

00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:52.221
We get the big I, the
overall I is equal to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.468
voltage times, it's gotta
be a big expression,

00:02:57.468 --> 00:03:01.918
one over R1 plus one over R2

00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:08.948
plus one over R3, plus as
many resistors as we have

00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:18.234
One over RN, like that.

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:21.664
And we do the same thing as we did before

00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:23.774
which was we say that this expression here

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:27.434
is equivalent to one parallel resistor

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:29.574
we're going to make the equal
to one parallel resistor.

00:03:29.574 --> 00:03:32.634
So this whole guy here is gonna become

00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:35.694
one over RP

00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:39.814
That gives us a way to simplify
any number of resistors

00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:42.974
down to a single parallel resistor

00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:44.854
and I'll write that over here.

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:47.614
So for N resistors, multiple resistors

00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:51.654
one over RP the equivalent
parallel resistor

00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:54.054
is equal to the same thing.

00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:58.054
One over R1 plus one over R2

00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:04.898
plus dot, dot, dot, one over RN.

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:07.247
So this tells you how to simplify

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:11.007
any number of parallel resistors

00:04:11.007 --> 00:04:14.375
down to one equivalent parallel resistor.
