[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.180
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Perfect.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.620
All right, welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.820
I'm Dominique Ehrl.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm sure I've met
most of you here.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.520
I'm here with the executive
director of the Hispanic Latino

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.000
Commission of Michigan,
Dr. Felipe Lopez Sustaita,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to share his story of the
immigrant worker experience,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.049
"From the Fields to the
Michigan State Capitol."

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:24.840
Let's please give him
a big Google welcome.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.449
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.824
FELIPE LOPEZ
SUSTAITA: Thank you.

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:31.020
Thank you, Dominique.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.880
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Of course.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.720
And it really wouldn't
be a true Google

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.730
welcome without an icebreaker.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.880
So I'd love to kick it
off with asking you,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.750
as a second generation Latina
myself living in the US,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.370
I feel there is a
certain obligation

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.610
to keep my Latinidad alive,
whether that be speaking

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.670
Spanish, teaching others
about my identity,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.880
dancing, advocating for
the community, et cetera,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.150
or even carrying out traditions,
and with the Day of the Dead

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.300
just recently finishing
the last few days,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.750
can you talk to us about maybe
one of your favorite family

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.655
traditions that you carry out
to keep your culture alive?

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:07.780
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yes.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.050
So family traditions, I
always think of Christmas.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.190
We were so poor that--

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.980
tamales, right?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.120
So you unwrapped
something the next day,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.820
so we didn't have
actual presents.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.380
But the tamales was
always a good sign

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.470
that we were doing good.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.050
We might not have gotten the Air
Jordans or the beautiful things

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.050
that we could have dreamed
of, but we had tamales.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.210
And it's something
that my mom still does,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.128
and it's a tradition that
makes me remember of--

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.050
And still, even today, that's
still the most important thing.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.260
So thank you, yeah, for
embracing the Day of the Dead.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.230
And it's just part
of our culture,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.925
being Latino, Latina,
in this country.

00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:57.050
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Absolutely.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.141
Thank you.

00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:58.640
Great.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.740
So I'd love to dive right
into the topic for here

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.280
today by going back to the
beginning of your story,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.930
before you accomplished
your career

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.190
and your multiple degrees
that you've received.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.900
Can you tell us
about your childhood

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.780
and how you became a part of
the migrant worker community

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.310
in the United States?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.680
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yes.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.380
And I just want to acknowledge,
too, I want to thank Dominique.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.720
I was a keynote speaker
for Cesar Chavez, who

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.740
is a legend and an
advocate for Latinos,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.230
and we were at Eastern
Michigan University.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.180
There was about 500 people.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.230
And that day, I just
felt the Holy Spirit.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.155
I felt that I had a mission
to go there and inspire

00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:45.530
some of the young
people from all

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.860
over the state, young people.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.250
And so I want to acknowledge,
so thank you very much

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.590
for making this happen
and for being there,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.780
and for Google to be so
involved with a community

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.000
that you happen to
be there that day.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.540
So going back, I was born in
Matehuala, San Luis PotosÃ­,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.420
Mexico, as the youngest of 12
really, but eight of us lived.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.600
And we lived in poverty.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.400
We grew up poor.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.490
But I was raised here in the US.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.320
I came to this country.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.020
And luckily, my father was a
Bracero back in World War II.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.200
When the men, American
men, were going to war,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.890
they brought in Mexican men
to work in the agriculture.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.010
And so that was our first
glimpse of how we even

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.540
ended up in the US.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.230
It was through that journey
that brought us to America.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.430
And so my journey began
since I can remember.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.780
My entire childhood was
working in the fields.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.680
And I don't know how, but all
of the people in my village

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.780
would move around.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.690
We'd move around.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.320
We would go to Tennessee,
Georgia, Michigan,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.030
and we picked everything
from onions to oranges.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.400
And in Tennessee,
we planted tobacco.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.130
We picked strawberries
and onions in Georgia

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.660
and then up in Michigan.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.650
So that's how it started.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.660
In this country, if you
don't have education,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.810
I mean, the fields
is a good place.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.494
And that's how I started.

00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:24.410
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Great.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.520
Thank you.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.150
So can you give us some context,
as somebody who has lived,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.310
what it means to be
a migrant worker?

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.840
Who is a migrant worker?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.760
And how do they get here
to the United States?

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.510
Why did they come?

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.676
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yeah.

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.750
So migrant workers,
there's different types

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.970
of migrant workers.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.330
You have first generation,
second, third generation.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.130
Sometimes migrants,
that's just a way of life.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.800
They've been here
five, six generations.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.410
I don't know if they enjoy it,
or if they don't know anything

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.460
better.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.220
But for us, I can tell you
that it was really hard.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.300
I mean, I always tell this story
when I talk to the young people

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.951
that I slept on the floor.

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:08.450
I mean, being the
youngest of eight,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.640
sometimes a room was as big as a
classroom in a college setting,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.455
like just half of the room,
and eight of us lived there.

00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:20.400
And so I was the youngest
one, so I knew my role.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.100
It was sleeping on the floor all
the way till I came to college.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.290
And then just the poverty
that goes with it,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.060
like the long hours.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.420
I remember when I was 12
years old, 11 years old

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.820
is when I started working
16- or 18-hour shifts.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.850
And that's why the office
that I'm in is so important.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.550
It's to regulate those laws
that young people shouldn't

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.550
be working that long.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.540
But a migrant is just somebody
that moves from state to state,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.980
or maybe they're seasonal.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.992
They live here in
Michigan, maybe they just

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:54.950
pick during the season.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.640
And they come from
all over the place.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.265
They don't just look like me.

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:03.560
There's a big
population of Haitians

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.600
that are coming now
to the US, and it's

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:14.770
being used as a major force
now, the Haitian community.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.720
And then obviously,
the Mexican community

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.620
has been along for very long,
since before Cesar Chavez

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.764
and Dolores Huerta.

00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:23.680
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Great.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.179
Thank you.

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:27.190
And do you mind giving
us a quick recap on who

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.950
Cesar Chavez was for
those of us who may not

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.150
have heard of him before?

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.316
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yeah.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:37.620
So Cesar Chavez,
he was a veteran.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.105
He was born in Arizona.

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:42.690
He went to the military.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.140
I think his family went through
a financial crisis, kind

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.576
of similar to what it's now,
and that took him and his family

00:06:51.576 --> 00:06:52.700
into working in the fields.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.490
And that's when he
saw firsthand how

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.480
the inequalities of migrant
workers, how they were being

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.310
brought in and
weren't being paid

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.670
or weren't being paid enough or
living in terrible conditions.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.690
So he really fought.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.380
And he fought in a very quiet--

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.220
very similar to Dr.
Martin Luther King.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.300
He didn't fight with his fists.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.400
He fought with his mind
and his humbleness.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.120
And I think that's what we can
remind him of a fighter that

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.250
fought for his people.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.690
Very kind.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.734
And that's who Cesar Chavez was.

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:32.650
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Great.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.920
Thank you.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.410
So although invisible
to most people,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.430
the presence of migrant workers
in many rural communities

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.420
throughout the
nation is undeniable.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.090
Since hand labor is a
necessary for production

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.790
of blemish free fruits and
vegetables that consumers

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.739
demand, why are
they so invisible?

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:51.530
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA:
So the invisibility,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.760
I think it's intentional.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.135
So like I said, I've moved
around in different cities.

00:07:56.135 --> 00:08:01.080
And in Tennessee, we were
very hidden from everywhere.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.240
I think in this country,
we want to eat our salads,

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.960
we want to eat our
oranges or apples,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.420
but yet, we're hidden in
some of the communities.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.850
Maybe it's because of zoning, or
maybe it's for whatever reason.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.090
Maybe there's this
perception that the property

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.330
loses value when we're
there, whatever it is.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:30.500
But we do tend to be almost
hidden in some cities, almost

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.280
invisible.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.289
We come out on
Sunday to do laundry.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:41.059
And in some cities, people go
wild on Facebook or Twitter

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:45.350
like, oh, all these Mexicans
are shopping at Meijer.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.510
And I hear those
stories constantly

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.592
traveling through the state
of people that are unaware.

00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:54.800
Yet, they don't realize that
we're the ones providing

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.740
the food so that people eat.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.230
So it's a very
interesting dichotomy

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.260
that that's happening.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.330
But yeah, I have two
brothers, one of them

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.620
that recently stopped working.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.310
He got injured.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.770
And he had been working
his entire life.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.490
And then I have another one
that was still picking apples.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.720
And nothing has changed.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.270
It's been, I don't know--

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.730
I'm 34 years old,
since I was little.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.820
And they always pick somebody
else to come and do the work,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.090
so it hasn't changed a lot.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.640
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Thank you.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.240
So it's a great paradox
of our food system

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.060
that the very people who
work to feed the US struggle

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.650
to feed their own families.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.860
Farm workers are among the
poorest workers in the country.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.950
Child farm workers risk their
safety, health, and education

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.560
working for fields because their
parents can't earn a living

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.520
wage.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.020
Hazardous conditions
are routine,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.680
as I'm sure you're
familiar with,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.090
including pesticide exposure,
extreme heat, lack of shade,

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.090
and sometimes inadequate
drinking water.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.085
Did you ever witness or hear
of any of these conditions?

00:10:01.085 --> 00:10:02.210
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yes.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:07.270
And again, this was in the
middle of the 90s, early 90s,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.420
when I was first exposed.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.670
And I remember as a child
playing through the fields,

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.290
and the airplanes would
come and pesticide.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.240
And so I'm sure I was exposed.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.460
And it's heartbreaking
thinking back of pregnant women

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.430
out there working and the
children and the effects

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.330
that it had.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.910
My father, he passed
away when he was 62.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.900
So I was 17 years old
when he passed away.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.450
And I know it's because
of the intense work

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.330
labor, the intense hours.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.660
I'm sure that I would pass away,
too, if I continue to work 16,

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.160
17 hours shifts my entire life.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.210
And so I've experienced,
like I said,

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.760
the housing-- there was snakes
sometimes that we would kill.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.230
And no child-- I'm sure
my parents didn't--

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.940
they had a hard time
grasping with that.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.300
But that has been
generations of poverty.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.010
I don't know how they grew up.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.790
And for me, it was
probably a great living.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.100
Even if there was
snakes or we were

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.490
in a part of a barn
sleeping, it was a lot better

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.040
than it was in Mexico.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.410
So there is still work
that needs to be done.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.780
I remember, I mean, the trailer
we lived in Covert, Michigan--

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.630
and my brother
still lives there--

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.950
I remember not having
running hot water.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.920
And the one year we stayed,
it was October, November,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.890
December, I had to boil
water before I go to school

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.180
and just took it in.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.580
And we didn't have no
heater, and everybody

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:55.070
slept in the floor to
be close to the heater,

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.990
the kerosene heater.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.430
And so those things
are still here.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.310
I'm sure there's kids still
sleeping in the floor,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.140
the housing's still
no running water.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.430
I had to go out into an
outhouse to go to the bathroom

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.200
and shower outside of the house.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.900
They didn't have that.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.950
This was, again, in my lifetime,
and I'm only 34 years old.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:23.317
So I know that it's
still out there.

00:12:23.317 --> 00:12:24.900
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Thank
you for sharing.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.760
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA:
Oh, no problem.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.093
DOMINIQUE EHRL: So I'm curious--

00:12:28.093 --> 00:12:29.960
you spoke a little
bit about maybe

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.790
how your parents might
have been feeling.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.850
And I'm sure as all of us have
been children at one point,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.890
and there's things
that are covered up

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.390
that our parents tried
to make things better,

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.230
especially when situations
maybe aren't as good

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.730
or what they would
hope them to be.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.800
Can you speak a little
bit to maybe your family

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.800
or other families'
experiences with morale?

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.290
That's something that I was
curious about when researching

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.670
about migrant workers.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.200
Are people optimistic?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.720
Are they complacent?

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.910
What is the sentiment
around their situation?

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:05.150
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: So
for us, it was always prayer.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.670
[SPEAKING SPANISH] God.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.320
My parents had so much faith.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.890
And I think that's where
my sense of being--

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.940
that's what carried us
through, this energy,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.740
this positive energy that
things would work out.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.950
And so I was always blessed
leaving the house or in

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:32.280
[SPEAKING SPANISH],, and
that's a constant reminder

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.150
that there's hope.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.680
And for us as Catholics,
that was something

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.050
that I think allowed us to
survive because it was really--

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:48.880
I can't imagine if
I was barely eating,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.710
I don't know if they
were eating at all.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.570
And so when you think of that,
I remember the corn flakes

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:59.040
with water and
mixing coffee powder

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.180
to make milk or Valentina--
all the Latinos always had

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.460
Valentina-- with salt crackers.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.770
And I remember those
meals, so I can't

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.760
imagine if I was going through
that, what my parents were

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.640
struggling with.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.540
I had a brother who
also passed away at 43,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.240
and I believe it was because
of the hard life of working

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.190
and the pesticides and all this.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.480
And he passed away at 43.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.500
But he was the
life of our family.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.960
He was a happy guy, Ismael.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.550
I always think of him
because he was just so happy.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.330
When I was listening to the
Google with George Lopez,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.550
you always have somebody in the
family that just brings joy.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.100
And Ismael was the one.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.070
He was always cracking
jokes, no matter if it

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.910
was a snake that they cut and he
was trying to scare other kids.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.980
But he had that
sense of happiness.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.060
And to an extent, I
think it prepared me

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.780
for going to get a
doctorate degree.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.238
There's no way I
could have made it

00:15:03.238 --> 00:15:11.170
if I didn't have those struggles
of hoeing or picking something

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.380
or asparagus and looking at the
long lines and thinking, man,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.210
can I make it
through those lines?

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.170
It taught me self-discipline,
to stay in my lane

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.930
and stay focused on
finishing whatever that was.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.850
But I think faith, if I were
to say, that carried us.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.422
I think that was the
game changer, the faith.

00:15:31.422 --> 00:15:32.380
And that we still have.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.060
I talk to my mother
every single day.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.550
And this morning,
I talked to her.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.560
I said, Mom, pray for me.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.640
And it's something that I feel
like it's like a shield for me.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.550
And respecting other
cultures because I

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.620
have a lot of friends that
are from other cultures,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.734
and I also respect that as well.

00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:53.650
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Great.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.840
Thank you.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.800
I've also always admired--

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.250
I'm not sure if it's just
with Latinos or people that

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.070
maybe are underrepresented
or other minority groups--

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.450
the sense of happiness,
even when there's nothing.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.610
I've witnessed that myself
with my family in Mexico, too.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.640
And it's just a really
great reminder and gut

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.580
check of like, you know,
things aren't so bad.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.010
And not to say that
someone's situation

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.280
is worse or better than someone
else's, but in hindsight,

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.890
all of us here are in
a place of privilege.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.590
And it's always a good
reminder to kind of go back

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.820
to where our roots are
from in certain situations.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.277
So thank you.

00:16:31.277 --> 00:16:33.610
So what you were kind of
talking about at the end there,

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.250
I think, pivots to my
next question for you.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.170
Sometimes even the
thought of pursuing

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.510
an education for many
marginalized communities

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.200
can often be seen as foreign,
impossible, laughable,

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.530
or just it's not going
to happen for you.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.300
So what was your out?

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.380
What was your driver?

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.515
How did you make
it into college?

00:16:52.515 --> 00:16:53.890
FELIPE LOPEZ
SUSTAITA: So for me,

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.889
it's going to be a little
bit of a longer story.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:58.840
But it's important because
I got to pay respect

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.324
to the folks that have allowed
me this privilege of being

00:17:03.324 --> 00:17:04.490
in Google, for all you know.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.640
Never in my life
did I ever imagine

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.839
that I'd be here with your
folks listening to this tape.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.660
We're very traditional,
especially with women.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.560
Latina women have it, I
think, way harder than we do.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.410
And my sisters,
all four of them,

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.589
are tough, strong Latinas,
and my mother, of course,

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.000
we have to look up.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.140
But my sister Mayra,
she was the first one

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.930
who came to Michigan State, and
it was through night school.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.940
We went to night
school that one time.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.430
And I was like 13 years
old-- the only time--

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.140
and that was to make
up credits so that I

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.020
could graduate in three years.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.860
We met this gentleman
named Rudy Hernandez, who's

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.700
from southwest Detroit,
who really set the tone.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.690
And Mayra was smart enough
to get into Michigan State,

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.380
and so that's how
it all started.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.340
Mayra was accepted.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:06.320
She, in her mind,
made this pledge

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.320
that she was going to get
out of that lifestyle.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.770
Because it is terrible when
you're out in the dirty

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.930
all the time and not making
any money and just at home.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.030
And so she went to college.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.630
And it was because of Rudy
that gave her that opportunity.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.490
And again, I believe it's faith.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.224
It's Rudy was there that night.

00:18:23.224 --> 00:18:24.640
If Rudy wasn't
there that night, I

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.010
don't know if we would
have been here right now.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.200
But Rudy was there, met Mayra.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.820
And Rudy was one of
these educators--

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.609
I love higher ed
people, especially when

00:18:37.609 --> 00:18:38.650
they go out of their way.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.190
Rudy went and asked my parents
if they could allow Mayra

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.470
to come to Michigan State.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.430
And they didn't really want to,
but they didn't have a choice.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.990
So they said [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.480
That's something that Latinos--

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.860
once they say that, it's a gold.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.210
Like, go.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:58.890
Right?

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.430
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
And so they did.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.510
And that's when
my journey began.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.329
Basically, I didn't
have a choice.

00:19:06.329 --> 00:19:08.620
My parents were like, you
got to go take care of Mayra.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.820
Not that Mayra needed
me to take care of her,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.740
but that's how the
Latino mindset is.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.940
And so I ended up with a 13.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.960
I thought it was a 13 on my ACT.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.460
We checked, my wife checked,
and she said I got a 15.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.910
So I couldn't even read
correctly that I got a 15.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.040
And I'll be honest
with you, again,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.710
it was because of Rudy I got
admitted to Michigan State.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.920
But I took the test a few
days before admissions,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.050
and I guessed on everything.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.750
But again, I was blessed
that it came with a package.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.210
You accept Mayra, you're
going to accept Felipe.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.890
And so I came in.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.510
I couldn't read,
I couldn't write.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.570
When you're a migrant
worker, you leave.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.460
In October, you
leave the school,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.640
and then you leave to
go back home to Texas.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.070
And then you leave early,
you leave in March.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.890
And so you're always
making up work.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.640
And so oftentimes,
that's a blessing, too,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.440
because they didn't really
pay attention if I was failing

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:06.940
or not.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.114
I was always passed.

00:20:09.114 --> 00:20:11.530
But the unfortunate part is
that I couldn't read or write.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.446
I didn't know my ABCs.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.230
But I was very clever
and very smart.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.550
I made up credits.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.160
My sister was helping
me do my math homework.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.860
I passed, and the
rest was history.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.250
I came to Michigan State.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.510
A lot of tragedies happened.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.080
Like I said, my father passed
away my sophomore year.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.610
My brother passed.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.880
And so there was a
lot of tragedies.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.235
But I can always look back,
and that's a motivation,

00:20:42.235 --> 00:20:45.220
that people out there
are really good people.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.160
The person that I
least expected came in

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.947
and gave us this opportunity.

00:20:50.947 --> 00:20:52.030
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Wonderful.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.680
Thank you.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.170
So for many first generation
students, and minorities

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.960
in general, it's one
thing to get into college,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.160
and then to be accepted, all of
that which is the first step.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.230
But there is still a
large gap for completion

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.760
of higher education.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.660
Now you've received two degrees,
two bachelors, I believe,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.070
as well as a doctorate.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.470
Can you talk about what drove
you to finish not only one,

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.060
but multiple degrees?

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:17.250
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yeah.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.910
So like I said,
it takes a village

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.200
to do this kind of work.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.040
And I met a lot of great people.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.200
One of my friends, Juan
Flores, who came with us,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.275
we were in remedial math.

00:21:31.275 --> 00:21:33.730
We didn't even make it to
the real classes, right?

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.335
So we were remedial
math, remedial writing,

00:21:36.335 --> 00:21:37.335
everything was remedial.

00:21:39.895 --> 00:21:41.680
And I could barely
pass those classes.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.430
But I've had Juan, I've
had other great people.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.190
My sister Mayra was there.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.830
I was very antisocial,
too, because of everything

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:56.224
that I mentioned, all the
stigma that happens in school.

00:21:56.224 --> 00:21:57.640
But I've had good
people, and I've

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.130
met great people along the way.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.790
My friend Kelly Simmons,
who I met through Mayra

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.670
working in the KCP programs.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.850
I met my friend Danny,
who's here also with me.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.880
We met in Greece and
have stayed in touch.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.460
And I met great people
like Sean Smith,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.640
Daniel [INAUDIBLE],, who
works with me in the office,

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.570
and Sean, who has had a vision
to help students get out

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.430
of the math and graduate.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.080
And my wife.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.690
So there's been
a lot of pieces--

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.990
my family, obviously--
that have been supportive.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.230
But the biggest
thing is that I've

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.380
had this vision, like
this law of attraction,

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.000
that if you think positive--

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.940
I always think of
my brother Ismael

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.680
because sometimes money would
just show up out of nowhere,

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.902
and I would say, man,
how do you do that?

00:22:51.902 --> 00:22:53.360
He didn't go to
school or anything.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.776
He didn't even
finish high school.

00:22:54.776 --> 00:22:55.700
He dropped out.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.850
But he had such a positive
vibe that the people that

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.310
would come, everything that
he had was just his thinking.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.920
He was so positive.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.360
And so I started applying
that, just being so positive

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.340
and studying the law of
attraction and vision boards,

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.540
and everything
that I said that--

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.790
And people would laugh, right?

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.415
It's laughable.

00:23:17.415 --> 00:23:19.340
Oh, you're going
to do this, you're

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.930
going to do that,
it's laughable.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.840
But it's happened
because of that.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.750
I was already signing doctor
when I was with Danny.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.230
We were in Hungary, and I was
writing postcards to my sister,

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.720
writing Doctor Felipe
Lopez Sustaita.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.740
And I was barely trying to get
through my bachelor's degree,

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:44.160
but I was already envisioning
that I was going to get there.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.950
And so it's almost like
it's already happened

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.380
and it's not there yet.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.452
But I keep talking
about my goals.

00:23:51.452 --> 00:23:52.910
And sometimes I
get flagged for it,

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.030
like, oh, you think you're so
good or [SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.720
It's not that.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.060
It's just that sometimes we
need positive role models.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.790
So that's why I
really appreciate

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:07.190
you allowing me this platform
because that's what it takes.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.030
Sometimes we have to
put it out there and say

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.280
that if we're going to
conquer the world, right,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.880
we have to talk
about it and do it.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.630
And it doesn't mean
that it wasn't hard.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:22.850
I mean, academically, if you can
go from not reading or writing,

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.280
being able to, to
finishing in four years,

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.010
it took a lot of hard work.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.810
Going on study abroads--

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.470
I went to Greece, I
went to Ghana in Africa,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.390
I went to Ukraine,
and then in Mexico--

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.360
to make up credits so that
I could graduate early.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.610
And I was able to get out
in four, so by the time

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.110
I was 20 years old.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.980
And then I did my masters by 22.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.490
And then I had a
family, and then I

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:50.780
went and got my doctorate.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.890
And I got it all paid for,
all my masters, my doctorate

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.290
degree.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.260
And again, things
just don't happen.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.779
I had it already written
that it was going to be paid

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:05.195
and that this was
going to happen.

00:25:08.195 --> 00:25:10.580
And again, there's
so many things

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.520
that I'm sure I'm missing.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.710
And especially the rigor of
the classroom and teachers

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.890
telling me just to quit.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.250
And I remember--

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.320
I won't put names out there--
but I've been told, just stop,

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.110
you're not going
to pass a class.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.030
And I refused.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.850
And I think it's that
ignorance that has brought me

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:38.700
this far, the ignorance
to accept where you're at

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.620
and to just say no, why not?

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.750
If you can do it-- if
I see other people,

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.400
if they can do it, why can't I?

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.730
And so that attitude.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:50.320
And I'll tell you one last story
before we go to the next thing.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.730
So I remember my senior
year, I was 16 years old.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.620
I was in Covert, Michigan.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.480
And again, I couldn't
read or write.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.040
So my teacher gave
me an assessment.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.500
And I remember it vividly.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.770
She sat down with me and
gave me this assessment.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:08.110
And she told me, she's like,
you're at a third grade level.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.120
There's no way.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.000
I mean, even my kids now
can spell better than I can.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.690
And so if I would have
taken that literally,

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.690
there was no way that I
would have ever made it even

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.020
to graduate high school.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.160
But I was too ignorant
to know what that meant.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.860
And I'm very thankful
for that ignorance

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:33.750
as well because it's helped me
through other difficult times.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.250
So yeah, I mean,
part of it is luck.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.880
A lot of luck and hard work.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.450
Yeah.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.720
DOMINIQUE EHRL: So on
this note of people

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.150
coming into your life that
gave you an opportunity

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.650
or maybe being a
little bit lucky

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:53.040
and having that grit to
continue despite the challenges,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.730
there is a lot of people
who, despite maybe

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.520
having the same outlook,
still don't make it.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.730
Is there a clear distinction
between those who kind of make

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.670
it out versus those who don't?

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.120
I mean, is there a big
difference that you know of?

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.130
I'm curious more than
anything to know.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.588
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: That's
a really, really, really good

00:27:12.588 --> 00:27:15.810
question because I've met
some very successful people.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:22.220
I'm thinking of a good friend
of mine that migrant as well,

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.630
ended up going to
Philadelphia to college,

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.870
and then ended up going to
get her PhD in Stanford.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.740
Out of the same place.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.320
There's no difference between.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.714
If you're a migrant,
you're a migrant.

00:27:35.714 --> 00:27:37.130
And then I've met
others that have

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.460
gone on to work with
the governor of Michigan

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.300
and being their chief of
staff and have worked for two,

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.340
three different governments.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.300
Same circumstances, but
they had that extra.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.410
And Elva says it
all the time, she

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.260
says I'm made out of titanium.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.380
Ice nor fire can take me down.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.450
I've been through the ringers.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:08.840
And so it's that extra step.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.620
It's that swagger.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.390
I mean, if you can
go through that,

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:19.990
what I just told you, just
being so much in poverty

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.060
and you can survive, and then
moving from place to place.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.110
I think of my parents moving
from their entire family

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.700
and not speaking
the language, not

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.400
having a salary, nothing,
to bringing us here

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.540
and then making us
and be successful,

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.960
I think they're people
that don't quit.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:46.210
Because I've thought about that,
too, because I think of Mayra.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.910
She works for the Border
Patrol, and she ended up

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:55.859
going to Washington DC and
doing very important work

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:56.650
that she was doing.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.380
And so I often think of that.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.990
But I think really it goes
back to-- at least for me

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:06.580
and the people that I know-- is
my family, and then our faith.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.975
We have faith that things
will work out, no matter what,

00:29:10.975 --> 00:29:13.094
how hard it gets.

00:29:13.094 --> 00:29:14.760
And I've always said
this-- you're going

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.060
to have to drag me lout dead.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.390
I'm not leaving this place until
I finish what I came to do.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.190
And I get that from
my dad as well.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.450
There was no quit ever.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.720
But I think there is something.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.000
It's that titanium, and
I guess that's the way

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.208
we're going to put it, right?

00:29:31.208 --> 00:29:34.011
If you're built out
of titanium, then you

00:29:34.011 --> 00:29:35.010
can go through anything.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:40.090
Fire, ice, snow, and nothing's
going to pull you apart.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.300
And so that's the
way I would say.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.230
It's like NASA, right?

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.430
They went up.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.930
Who would have
thought that somebody

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.150
would have ended up in space?

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:51.150
And somebody dreamed big.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.010
Maybe they were told,
no, you can't do this.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:56.100
But they refused to dream big.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.380
And I think that's
how I see myself, too.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.040
And I often tell young people
that I talked to-- we're just

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.270
getting started.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.752
And no matter what--
and I tell my kids--

00:30:05.752 --> 00:30:07.335
if you want to be
president of the US,

00:30:07.335 --> 00:30:10.200
say it, speak it, and
then let's go get it.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.700
I don't want excuses.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.680
I don't care if you fall and
you're broken into 100 pieces.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.850
You put yourself back
and you go and get it.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.200
And so that's just the attitude.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.270
I think that I learned from all
my siblings, all eight of them,

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.210
who taught me lessons.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.630
And they built titanium, right?

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.797
That's what I made out of,
and that's exactly how I feel.

00:30:34.797 --> 00:30:35.880
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Beautiful.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.490
Thank you.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.230
So can you tell us a little
bit about how you ended up

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.940
in a career in
government here working

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.480
with the Hispanic Latino
Commission of Michigan,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.522
what your role is also as
the executive director?

00:30:47.522 --> 00:30:48.646
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yes.

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:49.860
That's an excellent question.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.200
I always ask myself
that as well.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.570
Because I went into
higher education, so

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.980
I did an undergrad
in criminal justice.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.280
Then I did a master's
in clinical social work,

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.560
and then I did a
doctorate in education.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.000
And I've worked as a therapist.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.620
I've worked as an
academic advisor.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.670
I've taught.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.330
And then I end up in
government, not really

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.440
knowing why or how or how
that even happens, right?

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.620
It's like a puzzle.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.470
But I've always said this--
and I constantly say this

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.270
to my kids and to my friends--

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.630
is that I work for God,
and so there's probably

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.090
a reason why I'm here.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.400
And I came at a
very critical time.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.010
In 2016 is when I started.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:33.360
And the Latino community
is very crucial.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.570
With everything going on, I
think I was built, like I said,

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.820
out of titanium to take the
roles that are going on,

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.330
the issue that we
have with education,

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.660
the issue that we have with
businesses, with immigration.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.130
And if anybody was
tested to get there,

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.710
I felt like it was a
privilege and an honor

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.850
for me, especially
coming into this country

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:01.905
and being undocumented
and understanding

00:32:01.905 --> 00:32:04.920
the migrant fields
and understanding

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.510
to a certain extent the
hoods because I grew up

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.160
in the barrio.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.040
That's the other piece that
I haven't talked about,

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.190
but growing up in a
barrio is rough, too.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.580
It's filled with gangs
and filled with drugs.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.190
Luckily, I never got
involved with any of that.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.550
Mine was petty.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.700
It was just hanging
out with people

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.280
and maybe fighting in
school here and there.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.130
But it was never big time, so
I never really talk about it.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:38.470
But if anybody was prepared
to take on this role,

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.770
I felt like it was God
putting me in this position

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.790
to go and do it.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.650
And so this position,
what it entails

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.100
is advising the governor,
advising the legislature,

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.420
and then advising the state
departments on Latino issues.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.490
So I travel all over the state.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:01.510
I've put in about close to
35,000 miles going from city

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.430
to city with the most
vulnerable people.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.450
And again, that's a
craft, to be able to go

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.100
with the most vulnerable
people and sit

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.620
with them in their homes.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.550
And even for them to allow
me to come into their homes

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.110
has been a huge
deal because that's

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.960
the only way I can
advise the governor

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.760
and the legislature is
to let them know, look,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.750
these are real stories.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:28.010
And I can name names, I can
name places where I'm at.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:32.740
So I think I serve as a
linkage to what I'm doing.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.880
And so it's very
complicated work,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.960
but I feel like I'm growing
and learning for something

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.000
that whatever's coming next.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.140
And so that's really
what the job entails,

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.820
and that's how I ended up.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.460
It was never planned.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.270
It was never something
that I thought of.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.680
My plan, after I got my
doctorate in community college

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.730
leadership, was going for the
presidency, for a community

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.020
college presidency.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.430
And that's another one that
people sometimes laugh.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.360
They're like, oh,
that's impossible.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.600
Oh, it's not impossible.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.760
I did my dissertation,
and I went and visited

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.462
these people that have done it.

00:34:11.462 --> 00:34:12.670
And I did my homework, right?

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.950
So you figure out how
other people did it,

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:17.949
and then you go back and
then you start working.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:18.954
It's like a lab.

00:34:18.954 --> 00:34:19.870
And that's what I did.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.010
I did my dissertation.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.199
I interviewed all these
successful people.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.360
I came back and
built my own recipe.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.260
And mine has looked different.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.480
I came to government.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.300
Others have gone directly
through the pipeline.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.120
And very fortunate--
I met a Latina

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.790
that became a president at 33.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:40.120
And those are the kind of
people who are out there.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.595
And I talked to her, I
listened to her story,

00:34:44.595 --> 00:34:46.810
and then go back
and get to work.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.270
Again, it's a lab,
a never-ending lab.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.739
And that's what has been helpful
is also to use my resources

00:34:53.739 --> 00:35:00.280
and then to apply them and
be the best at what we do.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.700
I know that's a long answer.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.450
DOMINIQUE EHRL: No,
they're great answers.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:05.770
Thank you.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.810
So you spoke a little
bit about how you

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.780
connect with these communities.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.490
We do a lot of diversity and
inclusion work here at Google.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:14.110
So all the employee
resource groups

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.690
that we have usually
have like a pillar that

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.520
owns community impact.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.980
How do you go into
these communities

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.180
as someone who might
seem as a person in power

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.500
and connect with them?

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.430
Are there strategies
that you have?

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.130
How do you best
really get to the core

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.572
and become a trusted person
to these communities?

00:35:32.572 --> 00:35:34.030
FELIPE LOPEZ
SUSTAITA: Yeah, that's

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:41.710
an excellent question because
you can't teach being humble.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.480
That's the first step
in whatever community.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.560
Whether it's a Jewish
community, whether it's

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.290
a Latino community, the
Caucasian community,

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.840
you got to come in
knowing your place.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.060
You have to be humble.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.070
And when I go into
these communities--

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.840
Because, again, I'm like
cold switching all the time.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.920
I could be going to
a predominantly black

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.630
neighborhood, but still
representing the Latino

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:11.330
community for alliances, and
with the Jewish community,

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.250
the Latino community,
just alliances.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.230
So the first thing
is humble, knowing

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.730
that I'm not better
than everybody

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:23.540
or that I'm not anything.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.230
Our community is
very hard to crack.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:29.860
And so especially with
the times right now,

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.840
people don't trust
people if you come in.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.410
Even if you're going for voting,
they won't open the door.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.330
I still don't open my door.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:41.545
I'm still not 100% secure.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.380
And meeting people
where they are.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.030
Sometimes I go to a factory,
or I'll go to the schools

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:53.440
and make myself visible.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.510
But the best thing
for me has been

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.730
to go with a trusted
person in the community.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:07.190
I don't have the time to be that
person to go to, I don't know,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.040
Alpena 20 times from Lansing.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.710
I don't have that, so I
have to do my research

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.150
and figure out who is a person
that's the most trusted,

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.200
make that connection.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.805
And my job is to make sure
that we have a connection

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:22.930
right there because if they
don't open their doors,

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.740
nobody is going to
open the doors to me.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.130
So that's how I've
been doing it.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.110
Whether it's Flint,
whether it's Detroit,

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.600
whether it's Benton
Harbor, I have

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.860
to go with a trusted person.

00:37:35.584 --> 00:37:37.000
That's how they
sponsor me, right?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.030
So Google now.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.055
It's like Google.

00:37:41.055 --> 00:37:45.250
If I go to another
city, like California,

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.660
and I go and ask for
something, maybe I've

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.340
done something with them and
did good by my word, that

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.340
is very helpful.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:58.210
And so that's how I've done it
is through understanding who

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:03.040
the real champion
of the community is

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.640
and then going there after that.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.830
Then it's up to me.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.720
I literally sometimes
have 30 seconds

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.730
to make a connection
with these folks.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:14.970
And my ability to speak Spanish
has helped tremendously.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.950
And my ability that I was
born in another country

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.980
and I understand the fear
that you have or what you do,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.920
that gives me more
brownie points, too.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.830
And I never abuse that.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.250
I never take that for granted.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.350
I understand that that's
personal and private,

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.544
and that's how I operate.

00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:33.460
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Great.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.280
Thank you.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.790
So I'm going to end off
on one last question,

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.160
and then we'll hand it
over to the audience

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.860
for some live Q&amp;A. What sense
of responsibility do you feel?

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.420
Often-- I can speak
for myself, too--

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.480
my parents' conditions
are not what I have today.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.030
I think that's true for many
immigrant second generation

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.560
people here in the States.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.620
So what do you feel like
you owe to your community?

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.740
What is, I don't know, your
North Star in all of this?

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.420
And how do you give back?

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.920
How often do you visit home?

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.880
What is your contribution to
pay back to where you came from?

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.300
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yeah, I
owe everything to my community,

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:17.320
to my family, to my ancestors
who sacrificed so much.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.024
And if I think I had it bad,
I just think back 60 years.

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.940
And I don't know what
they were going through,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.260
but I have a lot of debt.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.170
And I have goals written
down for the next two

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.960
years of raising $100,000
for scholarships.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.240
I have an obligation
to make sure

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.840
that anybody that wants to go
to school has an opportunity.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.040
I'm actually on the works--

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.540
and this is something
that I've been

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.360
talking to my friend
Danny Rosenberg

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.460
about and Juan and Kelly--

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.190
about writing a book
and those proceeds

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:53.260
going to help my community so
that others get opportunities.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.940
But more than that, going out
into the actual communities

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.280
and talking to the young
people that have no hope

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.130
or don't see people
that look like them.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.480
And so I've been
being more intentional

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:13.170
about doing that, going out
to places where nobody visits.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.340
And that's where the law
of attraction, that's

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.130
where it happens.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.630
So I have a friend, Eric
Thomas, that's doing some work.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.200
He does it all over the world.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.840
He invited me to go to
Las Vegas and to really

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.590
work with the youth there.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:32.110
And he said, man, it's some
of the toughest schools

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.920
that I've been to
in this country.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.730
And so I'm excited about
that, putting myself

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:42.970
in a pit with a lion on a
snowy day, like the book.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.040
In a pit with a
lion on a snowy day

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.110
is putting yourself
in situations

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.490
that are uncontrollable.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.826
And do the work, right?

00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:57.910
If the person that did NASA
wasn't willing to take risks,

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.050
then we wouldn't have that.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.270
So that's how I feel,
as an obligation

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:06.400
to go out and just risk.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.280
And sometimes, maybe things
that haven't been done, just

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.420
try them.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.700
And so, again, just
a huge obligation.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.160
And for me, it's education.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.675
That's a pathway out of poverty.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.550
But yeah, I owe
everything I have

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.260
to folks that gave
me scholarships,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.460
that gave me opportunities.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.927
KSP paid for my
doctorate degree.

00:41:27.927 --> 00:41:30.010
And then there's so many
people that I'm thinking,

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.490
like Dr. Tom [? Rios, ?]
Dr. Margie [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:38.100
Dr. Hall, that have
been in my life, that

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.710
have pushed me to think
bigger, to dream big,

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.890
to not settle for anything.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:49.950
And my wife, too, who always is
on me to do more, to give more.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.420
Give till it hurts, right?

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:56.740
We have a commissioner,
Jesse, who said,

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.810
I want to give till it hurts.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.960
And so when you
give, you receive.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.060
And so that's how I felt.
I've been so blessed,

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:07.664
and so I want to give
more than I can give.

00:42:07.664 --> 00:42:08.580
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Great.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.570
Thank you.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.740
So I would love to start
off the Q&amp;A. Something

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.990
that I was thinking
about last night

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:19.800
when preparing for the
talk was, as people who

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:25.080
maybe have a better circumstance
than our parents, ancestors,

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:30.210
grandparents before us, how
do we teach the sense of grit,

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:33.960
the sense of titanium that
you were talking about?

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.230
I think that that's
something I wonder, too.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.960
When I get married one day
and maybe have children,

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.730
how am I going to
teach that drive?

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.230
So you have children of
your own, so I'm wondering,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.390
how do you teach that?

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:51.420
How do you teach that
culture or that ability

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.320
to continue no matter what?

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.904
And yeah, how do we
pass that forward?

00:42:54.904 --> 00:42:56.069
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yeah.

00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:57.320
So I have four children--

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.630
Felipe, Amancio,
Sion, and Eliadio--

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.180
and that's what I'm
trying to teach.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.670
Because my father did such a
great job, and like I said,

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.520
he'd passed away at 17.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.140
His dad passed away at 17.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.270
And I want to break that chain.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:17.490
But what my dad did in those
few years that I had him was he

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.700
taught me how to
have faith I've never

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.440
seen anybody to
have so much faith

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.760
and be praying for his family.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.330
And I'm sure sometimes we
didn't know how to eat,

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.040
what we were going
to eat the next day,

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.090
but he was there praying.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.330
And I'll tell you
something, we never

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:35.100
didn't have food on the table.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.410
I don't know if they
were eating or not.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:38.250
So that faith.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.660
And that's something
that I teach

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.800
my children is to have faith.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.700
And then the work ethic.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.650
You can't expect great results
if you don't put in the work.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:53.640
So we put them in
martial arts, something

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.870
that I didn't have access to.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.640
Like the Y, they also
go to the Y, the camps.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.446
I always tell them,
the only camps

00:44:00.446 --> 00:44:01.820
I went with migrant
camps, right,

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.975
moving around going
to all these camps,

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:06.330
so you guys get to
go to swimming camp.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.730
And teaching them
the value of that.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.920
Not only do I take
them to the YMCA camps,

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.880
but I take them to go
pick strawberries, go

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.380
pick blueberries, apples.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.370
They know where
their dad comes from.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.010
They know when they go
and visit their cousins

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.460
that they might not get a lot
of gifts still to this day.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.790
They might just get
tamales, and that's OK.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:31.620
Don't get too high
up there and thinking

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.260
that you're so good,
that just because you

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.760
get good presents
from us doesn't

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.590
mean that when you
go to your place,

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.930
you might not get
anything, and that's OK.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.770
So teaching them that
sense of appreciation

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.891
for what they have, and
then what they have when

00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:47.640
they go out there.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.730
And then more about giving
than just asking for.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.270
And so taking them to
the homeless shelter

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.380
and showing them strong
movies that are powerful that

00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.910
will pierce their soul.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.900
Even at a young age,
those are the things

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.870
that I thought about.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:09.630
And then I have a
band of brothers,

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:13.440
too, that we meet, we
pray, and we talk life.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.680
And I learn from them
how to be a better

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:22.620
father because, again, I don't
have mine here physically.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.200
I have my father-in-law,
who's a great father.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.540
And so those are
the type of things.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.020
If you want to
elevate your game,

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.520
you've got to surround
yourself by greatness, right?

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.430
And so that's what we try
to do and then pass it

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:37.580
on to the kids.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.440
The question for them is
not, am I going to college?

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.850
They're going to college.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:48.642
Their mom, she's working on
her PhD, my wife, Danielle.

00:45:48.642 --> 00:45:51.195
And this morning when they
were doing their prayer,

00:45:51.195 --> 00:45:53.250
my wife left to Puerto
Rico this morning.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.370
And they're praying for
her, I hope my mom's good.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:00.120
And so they're learning
that sense of awareness,

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.130
like take care of
people and be good.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.230
So I'm trying my best.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.080
It is very difficult
because I can't simulate

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.210
living in the hood
and picking up a fight

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.300
just so that I
don't get picked on.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.800
They're not going to
have to live like that.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:18.550
Or cornflakes with water, they
don't have to worry about that.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:23.730
We have a refrigerator full
of milk that they can do that.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.880
But as much as I can and telling
them stories, like, look, man,

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.360
we grew up poor,
so appreciate it.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.860
And the fact, too,
that I don't have

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:38.097
any pictures from my childhood,
they can't even see that.

00:46:38.097 --> 00:46:39.930
I don't know how I
looked when I was little.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.100
And so they have all
kinds of pictures, right?

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.670
They're in daycare, they're
already selling you pictures.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.651
We didn't have that.

00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:46.650
We couldn't afford that.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.050
It was eating or that picture.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.090
So just teaching
them those things.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.927
That was a long answer.

00:46:53.927 --> 00:46:55.010
DOMINIQUE EHRL: Thank you.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.890
FELIPE LOPEZ
SUSTAITA: No problem.

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.380
DOMINIQUE EHRL: All right,
we'll open it up for live Q&amp;A

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.640
for anyone who would like to.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.280
So we'll have a mic
being passed around.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.210
Thanks.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.585
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you

00:47:04.585 --> 00:47:06.550
for the work you do
for your community.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.270
I think many of ourselves,
many of my colleagues,

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:13.890
myself included, are
from immigrant families.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.050
I'm first generation myself.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.700
I'm curious-- your
work is focused

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.420
on lending a voice to those
who might not have channels

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.790
to voice their needs.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:25.770
Personally, how
do you prioritize

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.980
the needs of the
communities you're hearing?

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.800
You mentioned you're
motivated a lot by the pain,

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.850
and I think you probably
measure yourself by the impact

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.877
that you're having.

00:47:36.877 --> 00:47:38.460
I can imagine that
the impact that you

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.370
don't get to have because
you have to choose

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:42.690
causes a lot of pain as well.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:45.300
But what goes into
your mental calculus,

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.490
and how do you decide
which of the issues

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:52.134
you encounter on a daily basis
gets the ears that it deserves?

00:47:52.134 --> 00:47:53.550
FELIPE LOPEZ
SUSTAITA: Yes, that's

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.140
a very difficult question.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:02.430
Especially with a very small
budget and a very small staff,

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:05.250
I think we use that
Google approach.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.250
And Daniel will tell
you, we have a board,

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:11.405
a to-do list board.

00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:12.270
And it's important.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.353
People don't do it, right?

00:48:13.353 --> 00:48:14.700
They don't communicate.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.250
And so we sit there literally
and we spend one or two

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.130
hours prioritizing
what's going on,

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.200
whether it's a bill
that's being introduced

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.630
or whether it's a
community that's in need,

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:32.100
and we evaluate that, and then
we deploy whatever resources

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.040
that we have.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.940
So we have to be very
strategic with what we do.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.630
And it always
reminds me of when I

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.730
was in school, the same thing.

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:47.040
I had to prioritize and with a
family, always multi-tasking.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.220
But that's how we gauge that.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.240
Because you're right,
there's so many issues.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.310
And right now, with the
current political climate,

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:59.580
it's very difficult. It
could be immigration one day.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.630
It could be bullying
the next day.

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:07.500
It could be an incident that
happened at another community.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.720
And so sometimes
you're in three places

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.570
at once, if you didn't
think that's possible.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:14.640
And we're making a
call and an email

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.480
and then physically going there.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.160
So that's how we do it.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.370
And again, I work for God, so
He's guiding me in this work,

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:26.130
and very blessed
to be doing that.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.410
And again, this is
part of it, too.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.920
Having this platform that
Dominique has giving me

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.030
the opportunity is so
great because we're

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:39.270
talking to our people
at a larger scale

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.080
than I've ever done.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.340
And so this is huge for me.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.060
And so taking the time
to come here and do this

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.950
is very important.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:51.910
But that's how we gauge
and we try to do that.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.480
AUDIENCE: So from traveling
around the state, what's

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.291
the current state of Michigan?

00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:57.790
If you're meeting
with the governor,

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:00.600
what's the two,
three minute speech

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.780
to update him as far as what's
happening in the Michigan

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.954
community?

00:50:04.954 --> 00:50:06.120
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yeah.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.380
And again, it depends when
it is because sometimes it

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.370
could be economic or whatever.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:16.800
So what we did so that
we don't have the two,

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.000
three minutes is that we got
a really good team together.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.900
Daniel, he's a researcher,
does all this with numbers.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.470
And then we brought in Jose
Mendez, who was our designer.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:33.460
And so what we did not
just to do that two minute

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:38.980
or three minute spiel, we
did a whole newsletter,

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.710
and we put the issues
there along with a letter,

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:43.960
and then through
communication as well.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.220
So we try to be creative,
almost like Google, man.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.780
Try to put everything
out quickly

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.370
because you don't
have time sometimes.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:53.560
And so I got the
team to do that,

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.070
and that has been
very effective.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.220
It's helped us
increase our budget.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:02.620
It has helped us go
viral in terms of we

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.884
got a standalone website
the governor approved.

00:51:05.884 --> 00:51:07.300
And there's only
like four or five

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.310
departments that
have a similar--

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:12.730
And we had the
staff to do it, too.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.220
And then to make it
into bilingual, too,

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.470
so that people that want
to apply for a license

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:19.970
or do something, they
have that access.

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:23.612
So that's how we've done
it through communication

00:51:23.612 --> 00:51:25.570
like that, through nice
graphics because we all

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:29.530
know that nice graphics
gets people's attention.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:32.530
And so we've just been creative.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:36.345
And when we do have
that time, it's quickly

00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:37.720
like, look, you
have this coming,

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.450
whatever, whatever,
and we move on.

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:43.270
But we're trying
with what we have.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:46.010
It's like being a migrant.

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:50.206
You figure it out with a
little time or little money.

00:51:50.206 --> 00:51:50.830
AUDIENCE: Hola.

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.110
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.480
I'm trying to frame the
question, but I was curious.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.780
So I moved from Mexico,
born and raised.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.390
I moved two years ago.

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:02.380
And I went through a long
process to get my citizenship,

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.250
and I'm still trying to do that.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.190
So I have a lot of
privilege that I

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.844
can read and write
in English and afford

00:52:08.844 --> 00:52:10.010
a lawyer that helped me out.

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:11.750
And it's been a very
difficult process.

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.770
So after all this conversation,
I'm just very curious.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:18.610
How do these farmer workers get
any help, or any organizations

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:21.580
that help them, too, if they
are aiming to get a citizenship?

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.710
How do they get that help?

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:25.990
Is there any ways
for them to get it

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:28.630
if they don't have either
the means or the language

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:29.540
to do that?

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:34.170
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.770
AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:38.160
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA:
I'm just kidding.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.090
So yes, there is a
lot of organizations.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:43.810
And again, we have limited
resources, but we partner

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.390
with a lot of great
organizations,

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.840
through pro bono lawyers
that have reached out to us.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.140
And we can deploy
resources quickly.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.390
Stuff that's in
Spanish and English,

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:56.860
which sometimes
people don't think.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.776
And then there's people
that can't even speak.

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:02.650
So for us, it's tag teaming.

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:06.260
And if there's a place,
say, for example, farmers,

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.790
there's a community of migrants
that can't read or write,

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.670
letting that organization
know so that they could deploy

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:17.380
some lawyers that can go in and
kind of answer those questions.

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:21.270
We've also partnered
with a Mexican consulado

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:22.790
and done some work
with them as well

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:24.790
to send them to the
community so that they could

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.890
get their passport
because some of them

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:30.600
can't go, or get
registrations or whatever.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.590
So it's all about
using what you have

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:37.430
and then putting things
in place to make it work.

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:41.750
So that's some of the
work that we're doing.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:42.622
So I'm so happy.

00:53:42.622 --> 00:53:43.580
So you work for Google?

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:44.000
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.416
FELIPE LOPEZ
SUSTAITA: Man, great.

00:53:45.416 --> 00:53:47.240
You guys, we're all
over the place, right?

00:53:49.749 --> 00:53:52.040
DOMINIQUE EHRL: All right,
so we're almost out of time.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.160
Probably have time for one
more question, if there is one.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.581
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA:
Any burning questions.

00:53:57.581 --> 00:53:58.780
Oh, we got one.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:02.955
AUDIENCE: First of all, thank
you for sharing your story.

00:54:02.955 --> 00:54:06.170
I think it was really
touching and impressive how

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:08.130
you managed to break the cycle.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.130
I think that's kind
of the key over here.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:11.930
So my question is--

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:14.000
I mean, you were
like a lot of us.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.690
We're lucky to
have like a mentor

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.570
or to run into
people that actually

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:19.890
made a difference in our lives.

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:23.380
How do you say that can
be scalable, for example,

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.070
if you just don't
have the opportunities

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:27.350
and you just don't happen
to step into someone that

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:28.860
is willing to help you look?

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.994
How can we actually
make that a bigger plan?

00:54:31.994 --> 00:54:34.160
FELIPE LOPEZ SUSTAITA: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.160
And I think we all
need mentors, right?

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.990
But if you're not
in those spaces,

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:43.560
you don't get those
opportunities.

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:47.750
So what I would say
is that we need--

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:51.110
because now we're all here,
we're in a place of privilege,

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:53.820
we are mentors, whether
we see it or not.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.110
So for me, it's just
taking it to the next step.

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.560
If my wife gave me permission
to go to Las Vegas for four days

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.040
to work with those kids
and going where they are--

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.060
because there's no way
they'll ever get to me,

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.030
and I'm not even a
big deal or anything--

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:13.410
but I can go and maybe
share some positivity, then

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.720
I'm willing to do that,
whether it's there

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.130
or whether it's going to
Central America or wherever.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:22.140
Shoot, we were in Africa,
and I learned so much

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:22.920
from those folks.

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.760
But some people
can get out, right?

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.410
They don't have the access
or the privilege to do that.

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.380
So I just think that us--

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:38.240
we have a responsibility
to go out and do that work

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.720
and be intentional about it.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.929
Yeah, because everybody
needs somebody.

00:55:44.929 --> 00:55:46.470
I think none of us
in this room would

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:49.220
have been here if we didn't
have access to somebody

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.150
that believed in us.

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:52.740
And so it's
critically important.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.760
So, yeah.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.720
So for me, it's just going out
and doing it more, and more

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.210
intentional with a mission.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:03.620
And that's something that
I do, too-- to close this--

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.040
that has helped, for
me, going out sometimes,

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.740
and I go and speak
and I offer to mentor.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:15.530
So I go and I have mentees,
and I wake up at 6:00 AM.

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:17.690
I do that pledge
to wake up at 6:00

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:21.390
AM with MSU college students.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:24.260
And I walk during the
entire school year.

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.840
And then I tell them,
the whole purpose of this

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.060
is to build an army.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.810
So I'm going to mentor
you, I'm committing

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:35.570
that two hours or that whole
semester one hour each week.

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.231
And then I expect for you to
go back and mentor two people

00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:39.230
next year when you come.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:41.540
And that's how you
build an army, right?

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:45.640
So intentionally they're
going out and seeking that.

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.070
So those are just some
strategies that I've used.

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:52.202
And so thank you
for that question.

00:56:52.202 --> 00:56:53.660
DOMINIQUE EHRL: I
just want to echo

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.480
that, just going into
communities with intention.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.720
And then I think secondly,
meeting people where they are.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.130
There's sometimes
this false expectation

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:03.980
that people are just
going to naturally

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.650
be interested to speak to
all of us, which I really

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:07.430
think is false.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:12.440
And we have to be more aware and
more willing to sometimes also

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.780
take off our Google
hats and come in

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.380
as people, approach people
as Latinos, as Asians,

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.780
as black people, as
whatever your identity is,

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.720
to better connect and
maybe break through

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.350
to someone who might need it.

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.220
So thank you so much, Felipe.

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.600
Thank you for joining
us at Google today.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.370
It was a pleasure.

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:34.850
And really appreciate your
authenticity and vulnerability

00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:36.290
to share your story.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:37.980
So thank you so much for coming.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.960
A round of applause
for Dr. Felipe.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.710
[APPLAUSE]
