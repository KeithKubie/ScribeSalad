different tissues there's a specificity
in different diseases so for example our

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799
in different diseases so for example our
 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.110
in different diseases so for example our
skin looks different from our liver it

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120
skin looks different from our liver it
 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.210
skin looks different from our liver it
looks different from our brain and it's
