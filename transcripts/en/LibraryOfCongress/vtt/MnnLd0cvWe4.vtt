&gt;&gt; Leila Farrer:
Welcome everyone.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.570
So glad that you guys
could join us for Life

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.870
of a Poet this evening.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.170
My name is Leila.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.740
I'm on the programming
here at Hill Center.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.730
How many of you guys have--

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.770
are here for the first
time this evening?

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.230
A couple of you.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.390
Well welcome; we're so glad
that you could join us.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.690
As you may or may not know,
Hill Center does a wide variety

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.230
of programming, not only Life of
a Poet with Library of Congress,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.690
but also political talks and
Q and As, cooking classes,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.210
language classes, visual arts,
music, everything under the sun

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860
for children, so please go
online, check out our calendar.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.940
We've got print materials
downstairs as well.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.940
This evening we're here with
Ron Charles and Marilyn Chin

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.720
and introducing them
will be Rob Caster--

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.000
Casper of the Poetry and
Literature Department

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.510
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.540
[ Applause ]

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.100
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Thanks everyone.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.400
Thanks Leila.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.580
If you could turn up
Marilyn's just a little bit,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.140
make sure that everybody
can hear you.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.510
Here's my nicely
crumpled little intro.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.850
It's wonderful to have
you all here tonight.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.720
I'm thrilled to kick
off the fifth season

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.370
of our Life of a Poet series.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.940
It's hard to believe we've
been doing it for five years.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.030
Thanks to Diana Ingram and
everyone here at the Hill Center

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.600
for helping make this
possible, and of course thanks

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.110
to Ron Charles for
continuing on with this series.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.000
I feel like-- this
is what I wrote.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.660
I feel like I can't even brag

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.940
about Ron's turn
to poetry anymore.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, you can.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.580
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: But I
can't [laughter], I can't.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.240
Instead I can say
he's become legendary

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.410
for his in-depth
conversation with poets here

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.860
at the Hill Center over
the last five years.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.710
Leg-- I wanted to say
legend and mean it.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.470
Before I go any further let
me tell you a little bit

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.790
about the Poetry and
Literature Center

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.090
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.180
We are home to the Poet Laureate
Consultant in Poetry and we put

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.550
in programs like this
here at the Hill Center

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.740
and at the Library's
Capitol Hill Campus

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.610
and around the country.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.160
We'd love to have you come
to more of our programs,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.240
so if you want to
check us out you can go

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.460
to www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.190
We've also passed out a little
survey that you all should have,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.490
which we'd love to
have you fill out.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.710
You can hand them
to me afterwards;

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.010
we'd love to know what
you think of the program.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.080
The rest of the PLC
staff is in the front.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.550
You can hand them
your-- the surveys too;

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.450
we'll all be happy to get them.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.310
Today, if you don't know, is
the start of the fiscal year

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.730
in terms of the federal
government,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.030
of which we are a part.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.040
And I can't imagine a better
way to start FY19 than to kick

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.990
of this year's lope season.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.380
We call it lope in the office.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.570
And I couldn't be more excited

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.090
to introduce tonight's
feature poet, Marilyn Chin.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.750
I have heard Marilyn read
only twice and only briefly

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.930
at a Brooklyn book party
to celebrate the launch

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.180
of her 2014 collection Hard Love
Province, and the year before

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.240
when she read as part
of the Poet Laureate,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.270
Natasha Trethewey's closing
event, Necessary Utterance:

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.040
Poetry as Cultural Force.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.420
I'll never forget seeing her

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.550
up on the Coolage
auditorium stage reading poems

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.790
with such necessary
force that it seemed

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.500
like they might blow
the speakers.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.220
Hers are poems willing to
face up to death and loss

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.040
and also unabashed in
their lyric playfulness.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.110
They can be body and
prophetic and sorrowful,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.160
can dazzle with wild images
and be joyously talking,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.470
can feel steep in history
and form and also charged

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.300
with challenges to our moment.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.540
Listening to her then I thought
only I want to hear more.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.260
And luckily here we are.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.590
Please join me in
welcoming Marilyn Chin.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.390
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.220
[ Applause ]

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.820
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh, thank you.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.120
Thank you for loving poetry.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, thank
all of you for coming too.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.350
And if you can't hear at
some time just call out;

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.880
it's very informal and
we'll-- we'll adjust.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.180
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Can you hear me?

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.480
Yeah, okay.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.790
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Ron, why
don't you push up your--

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mine
a little more.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.860
Let me put it here.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.160
Okay.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.460
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I want
to thank Rob for being

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.410
such a cheerleader for poetry.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.710
We've got to give him a--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.190
[ Applause ]

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: One of
your early poems begins,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.260
beginning is always difficult.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.740
But the beginning of this
conversation doesn't feel

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.690
difficult because I've spent all
week in conversation with you

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.780
and your work, but it's all
been one way and now I'm

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.170
so looking forward to
asking you about this.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.140
I want to start with
this incredible event

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.300
that starts early in your
life where your folks move

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.280
from Hong Kong to
the United States

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.040
and you eventually
settle in Portland.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.750
Why do they do that and
how did you feel about it?

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.050
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh
God, I don't know.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.800
I was a child, I
guess I had no--

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.350
no power in those decisions.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.910
I was born in Hong Kong in
1955 in a cold water flat,

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.610
if you remember those
in colonial Hong Kong.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.570
And there were open
sewers, there were 15 of us

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.800
in a small apartment and-- and
it was really-- yeah, and my--

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.010
my father was already
in the U.S. He was--

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.300
he worked in various
restaurants in what--

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.150
what I call piss river Oregon.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.250
Various restaurants
in Portland, Oregon.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.800
And so-- so we came as-- yeah,
the family came shortly after--

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.450
af-- yeah, after he-- you
know, he first went to the U.S.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.560
and then-- then he brought my
mother and the family over.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
how old were you?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.160
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I
was seven years old.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So, you were--
you knew what was going on.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.760
You-- you--

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.060
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah,
I guess so [laughs].

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.660
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah yeah.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.960
I was-- and when I
was very young my--

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.730
I remember my grandmother
carrying me

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.030
on her back in this little--

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: She came too?

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.630
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah,
the whole family came.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.650
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: And she-- she
used to sing Chinese poems,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.070
she used to chant Chinese poems.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.590
She was-- she was
illiterate but she had a--

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.510
a prodigious memory and
she memorized various poems

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.840
from the-- from the
Tang dynasty and--

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.000
and Confucius sayings and
she was-- she was incredible.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.240
And then she used
to walk, you know,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.840
carry me around on her back.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.070
And so, the very first words I
heard were poetry, yeah, and--

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.160
and yeah, and I've loved the--

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.680
I've loved poetry
ever since, so.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did
she speak English?

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.330
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: No.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you?

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.930
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: No.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your mother?

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.530
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: No.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.830
Nobody spoke English.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How
did that come about?

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.430
How did you gradually
learn English?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Well
when we immigrated to--

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.890
to Portland I started school.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.490
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
That's what ha--

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.580
you know, and it's really
interesting how first I,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.780
you know, I changed-- I
changed languages several times

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.000
because first I-- I spoke
in the dialect of Taishan

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.050
and then I moved-- then I-- then
when we moved to Hong Kong--

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.880
when I was born in Hong
Kong, I spoke Cantonese.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.650
And then when I came to the
United States, you know,

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.530
I learned English and--

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.440
and so it was pretty
much a tri-lingual family

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.440
because there were
dialect differences and--

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.160
and nobody spoke
English, so, you know,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.620
the children served
as translators.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
all learned it first

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.300
and then brought it
home from school.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.600
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.300
Yeah, we-- yeah, we brought--
but my mother never really,

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.600
yeah, learned English,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.830
and my grandmother didn't know
a word of English, yeah, so.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
say in one piece,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.950
poetry is a vast orphanage.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.950
In another poem you write,
poetry is my nunnery.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.540
Here I am alone in
my alter self-hate,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.530
self-love, both erotic notions.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.090
What led you to write poetry
and why does it sometimes feel

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.760
like that a lonely
place sometimes holy,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.450
sometimes bereft?

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.750
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Well, you know,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.440
I think poetry saved
my life in many ways.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.160
I was a very lonely,
quiet child and-- and--

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.200
and there was a lot of
inter-generational problems,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.230
as you know you can imagine
in a family like that, and--

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.350
and I would-- I would read
a lot of poetry and I--

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.660
and a lot of the poetry I
didn't know what they meant.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.440
You know, when I was
younger, I read Shakespeare,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.820
I read Emily Dickenson,
I read, you know--

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.690
I read all kinds of poetry and
I didn't know what they meant

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.000
but somehow, they soothed
me and the poem soothed me.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.420
And I suppose I learned that
soothing from my grandmother

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:12.150
who used to chant Chinese poetry
with me on her back, therefore--

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.640
therefore, yeah, I think
that lone-- you know, I'm--

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.580
poets are solitary animals.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:23.140
We have to-- you know, we-- we
read and write, I mean, that's--

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.520
it's very difficult in
that if you're a play write

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.020
or if you're a-- yeah, or a--

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.210
write for TV you have a lot
of people to work with, right,

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.620
but po-- but poets,
we-- we sort of sit--

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.330
you know, my favorite
thing to do is to go

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:43.490
to the Harvard-Yenching
Library and read and it's

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.500
that solitary-- that solitary
conversation that I have

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.140
with the ancients, with the
Tang dynasty poets that--

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.380
that, you know, really
warms my heart, so.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.360
Yeah, we're poetry nerds; I
love poetry; we're poetry nerds.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.660
What-- what can I say [laughs]?

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
about your--

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.120
how did your family react to
this decision to go into poetry?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.420
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh my gosh,
are you kidding [laughter]?

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's a long way

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.880
from becoming an
engineer or a doctor or--

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.530
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah, a
doctor, you know, doctor,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.090
lawyer, poet, you know.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.070
Oh my gosh, you know.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.250
Gosh, I guess I had an
old uncle who was crazy

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.280
and he lived on--
you know, he was--

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
were following his--

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.970
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: The village
idiot, and then he was the poet,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.270
you know, I don't know.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:33.800
And yeah, but, you know, when
I finally found a teaching job,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.800
you know, they felt
better about that.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.780
But I was always the
weird child anyway.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.660
It was, you know--

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would
you read Poetry Camp,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.640
which I think might
contain some of that?

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.940
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Poetry Camp.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your
family's frustration.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Well this is
pretty-- this is a new sequence,

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.430
a prose poem sequence, so
there was a prose-- yeah, okay.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.000
Poetry Camp.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.640
Grandmother, when can
I go to poetry camp?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.210
What in hell is poetry camp?

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.130
Where a bunch of
teenage girls go

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.720
into the woods to write poetry.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.280
I know what teenage girls do in
the woods and it's not poetry.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.540
[ Laughter ]

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.640
You may not go to poetry camp.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.720
You must scrub the soy sauce
off the walls of the restaurant,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.770
then study for the SAT exam.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:29.000
Grandmother, what if I spurn
you and go to poetry camp?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.320
Then you will shame
your ancestors

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.690
with your foolish dreams
and in your vain attempts

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.270
to change your destiny
you will trip

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.330
and fall off your platform
shoes, break your neck

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.230
and amount to nothing.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.980
This is the grandmother
[laughter] how supportive.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.580
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah, she is.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's pretty--
pretty encouraging [laughter].

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.210
You write so movingly,
and sometimes very wittily

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.160
about the pain of a simulation.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.460
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In many poems.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.340
In a short poem called prelude,
dedicated to your mother,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.950
you write, although
the country is lost,

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.960
rivers and mountains remain
and we shall always live

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.000
in this poetry that you love.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.430
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: That--

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.070
that first line is
actually from Du Fu

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:24.450
from the Tang dynasty
poet Du Fu, and it goes

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.880
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.180
Which means all-- country--
although the country is lost,

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.110
rivers and mountains remain.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.120
It is such an amazing line, you
know, it says all in that one--

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.690
in those five characters
and-- and--

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:50.110
and yeah, and I feel that
I've lost many countries,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.830
but rivers and mountains remain.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.620
There's some-- yeah, there is--

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
the poetry remains.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.670
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: The
poetry remains, yeah.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: If you'd read
this poem, We're an Ameri--

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.620
We're-- We Are Americans Now.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.940
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah,
these are early poems;

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.510
I wrote them in my 20s.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.590
Okay. He digs up all
this dirt [laughter].

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.610
We are Americans now.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.100
We live in the Tundra.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:21.630
Today in hazy San
Francisco, I face seaward.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.130
Toward China, a giant begonia.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.820
Pink, fragrant, bitten
by verdigris and insects.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:35.980
I sing her a blue song; even
a Chinese girl gets the blues.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.580
Her reticence is black and blue.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.230
Let's sing about the
extinct Bengal tigers,

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.430
about giant pandas.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.190
Ling Ling loves Xing Xing,
yet we will not mate.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:56.740
We are not impotent, we
are important [laughter].

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.510
We blame the environment,
we blame the zoo.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.610
What shall we plant
for the future?

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.740
Bamboo, sassafras,
coconut palms?

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:13.360
No. Legumes, wheat, maize,
old swine to milk the new.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.340
We are Americans now.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.260
We live in the Tundra
of the logical,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.900
a sea of cities, a wood of cars.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.350
Farewell my ancestors.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:31.280
Hirsute Taoist failed scholars,
farewell my wet nurse who feared

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.320
and lathed the Catholics
who called out.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.730
Now that the half-men have
occupied Canton hide your

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.000
daughters, lock your doors.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:53.240
They-- well I didn't have
a wet nurse [laughter].

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.480
We were too poor to have a wet--

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:02.090
but apparently in that building
women would share their milk,

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:06.630
their breast milk because, you
know, some women had problems,

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.670
yeah, with their breast milk.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.160
So yeah, I didn't really-- you
know, we weren't rich enough

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.300
to have to-- but I thought wet
nurse is an interesting word,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.600
yeah, it's a--

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, I loved
the way the poem celebrates

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.430
America and mocks
it at the same time.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.730
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yes.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.330
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Yeah, this is when I--

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.880
I started to be comedic
here [laughs].

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.480
Yes.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.740
There's a poem about things
you never forget called the

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.240
Floral Apron.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.550
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh,
students love that poem.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh,
I love it too.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.450
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Yeah, I don't know--

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.150
they always answer, yeah yeah.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.450
Yeah they [inaudible].

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.000
It's a-- yeah.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.610
The Floral Apron.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:55.900
The woman wore a floral
apron around her neck,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.540
that woman from my
mother's village

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.970
with a sharp cleaver
in her hand.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.540
She said, what shall
we cook tonight?

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.960
Perhaps these six
tiny squid lined

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.700
up so perfectly on the block?

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.700
She wiped her hand on the apron,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.400
pierced the blade
into the first.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.400
There was no resistance,
no blood,

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.870
only cartilage soft
as a child's nose.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:30.070
A last iota of ink
made us wince.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:36.280
Suddenly, the aroma of ginger
and scallion fogged our senses,

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.180
and we absolved her for
that moment's barbarism.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.980
Then, she, an elder of the
tribe, without formal headdress,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.390
without elegance, deigned
to teach the younger

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.360
about the Asian plight.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.500
And although we have travelled
far, we would never forget

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:04.060
that primal lesson on
patience, courage, forbearance,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.510
on how to love squid
despite squid.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.040
[ Laughter ]

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:17.420
How to honor the village,
the tribe, that floral apron.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
can see why-- oops.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.740
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oops, sorry.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
just-- it'll be fine.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.860
I think it'll be fine there.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.160
It's just your--

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.460
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Oh, my-- oh okay.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: As long
as it's still working.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.060
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Okay.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.660
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Thank you.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You can see
why people love that poem.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.260
It's so sensuous, it's
so filled with imagery

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.560
of site and touch and smell.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.770
It so captures the things
we do retain forever

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:44.230
from childhood and it's witty.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.530
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
It's interesting,

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.030
the students either say,
ewe, why did you have

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.730
to use the image of squid?

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.180
But it depends-- it's
really culturally bound.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.060
If you're from Greece
you love squid.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.290
If you're from Hong
Kong you love squid.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mm-hmm.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.890
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: But if you're

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.190
from the Bronx you
might not like squid.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah [laughter].

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.790
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I don't know.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.800
Or maybe-- I don't know.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.720
But-- but, yes, it's
the something

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.700
about the kitchen table, you
know, and mother's apron.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.720
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: And it's what's
interesting about this poem is

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.110
that for a time people would
send me their mo-- their aprons.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh wow.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: You
know, because I read--

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:29.250
I read this, it was Bill Moyers,
you know, introduced this poem

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.290
in his PBS-- you remember
his PBS special and--

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.610
and I got all these
aprons from women.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Funny.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.210
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: And-- and yeah,

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.510
everybody remembers
their mother's kitchens.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.110
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: You know,

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.410
I think that's why this poem
is personal and universal.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.010
Exactly.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.910
Peculiar and-- and
universal at the same time.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.240
A longer poem called How I Got
That Name, much anthologized.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.540
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.150
It is just-- it's one of those
poems, if I don't read it,

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.040
Rob would have a fit [laughter].

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.860
You know, if I don't
read it at--

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.710
or somebody would say you got
to-- you got to read this.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well I've
been working up to it here.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.910
Is it in that-- is it in
that collection, number four?

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.210
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh yeah.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.200
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Should
I read the whole thing?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: If
you don't mind.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.930
It is long, but I
think it's so--

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.680
it's so good and it
deals with so many

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.970
of your most essential themes.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.870
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I
usually-- okay, I--

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Here it is.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.860
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I-- I
usually perform this one.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.370
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: So-- so I--

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.210
okay, I usually perform
this one.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:44.590
I-- it's called How I Got That
Name: An Essay on Assimilation.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do you need it?

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.520
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I am
Marilyn Mei Ling Chin Oh,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.490
how I love the resoluteness
of that first person singular,

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.010
followed by that
stalwart indicative of be,

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.090
without the uncertain
i-n-g of becoming.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.790
Of course, the name had
been changed somewhere

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.560
between Angel Island
and the sea,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.110
when my father the paper son
in the late 1950s obsessed

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.810
with a bombshell blonde
transliterated Mei Ling

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.110
to Marilyn.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.810
And nobody dared question
his initial impulse,

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.080
for we all know lust
drove men to greatness,

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.910
not goodness, not decency.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.020
And there I was, a
wayward pink baby,

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.520
named after some tragic
white woman swollen

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.020
with gin and Nembutal.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.180
My mother couldn't pronounce
the r. She dubbed me Numba one

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.890
female offshoot for brevity,
henceforth, she will live

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.550
and die in sublime ignorance,

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.560
flanked by loving
children, the kitchen deity.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.100
while my father dithers, a
tomcat in Hong Kong trash,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.710
a gambler, a petty
thug, who bought a chain

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.430
of chop suey joints
in Piss River, Oregon,

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.860
with bootlegged Gucci cash.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.360
Nobody dared question his
integrity given his nice,

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.850
devout daughters and his
bright, industrious sons,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.830
as if filial piety
were the standard

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.940
by which all earthly
men are measured.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.760
Oh, how trustworthy our
daughters, how thrifty our sons.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.820
How we've managed to fool
the experts in education,

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.790
statistic and demography.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.620
We're not very creative but
not adverse to rote-learning,

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.280
rote-learning, rote-learning.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.250
Indeed, they can use us.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.330
But the model minority
is a tease.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.770
We know you are watching and
we refuse to give you any.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.900
Oh, bamboo shoots,
bamboo shoots.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.750
The further west we
go, we'll hit east.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.730
The deeper down we
dig, we'll find China.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.280
History has turned its stomach
on a black polluted beach

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.530
where life doesn't hinge on
that red, red wheelbarrow,

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.780
but whether or not our new
lover in the final episode

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.940
of Santa Barbara will lean

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.660
over a scented candle
and call us a bitch.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.750
Oh Lord, where have
we gone wrong?

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.660
We have no inner resources.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.400
Then, one redolent spring
morning the Great Patriarch Chin

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.480
peered down from his
kiosk in heaven and saw

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.520
that his descendants were ugly.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.510
One had a squarish head and
a nose without a bridge.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.830
Another's profile, long
and knobbed as a gourd.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:29.820
A third, the sad, brutish
one, may never, never marry.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.010
And I, his least favorite, not
quite boiled, not quite cooked,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:40.870
a plump pomfret simmering in my
juices, too listless to fight

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.420
for my people's destiny.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.820
To kill without resistance is
not slaughter, says the proverb.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.790
So, I wait for imminent death.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.460
The fact that this death is
also metaphorical is testament

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.940
to my lethargy.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.330
So here lies Marilyn Mei
Ling Chin, married once,

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.100
twice to so-and-so,
a Lee and a Wong,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.260
daughter of the virtuous
Yuet Kuen Wong

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.070
and G.G. Chin the infamous.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.600
Sister of a dozen,
cousin of a million,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.690
survived by everybody
and forgotten by all.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.310
She was neither black nor white,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.230
neither cherished
nor vanquished,

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.530
just another squatter in her own
bamboo grove minding her poetry,

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.460
when one day heaven was
unmerciful, and a chasm opened

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.420
where she stood, like the
jowls of a mighty white whale,

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.630
or the maul of a
metaphysical Godzilla,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.930
it swallowed her whole.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:38.800
She did not flinch nor writhe,
nor fret about the afterlife,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.180
but stayed solid as wood,
happily a little gnawed,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.630
tattered, mesmerized by all
that was lavished upon her

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.330
and all that was taken away.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:24:02.330
[ Applause ]

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:03.630
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: So.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
fantastic.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.230
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I
had to read this one

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.530
for Rob and for you, my dear.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: My gosh.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.150
That is your song
of myself, isn't it?

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.450
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.750
Yeah, you're right.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.050
Yeah, it is a-- yeah,
a song of myself.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.860
I mean, if you're a short
little Chinese poet and you need

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:25.420
to insert yourself into the
poetry world how shall I do this

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:31.240
and I shall do it with as loud
as forcefully as possible.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And yeah,

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.370
some of us I heard gasping
were touching references

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.670
to other poems in there.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.970
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh yes.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.570
Yeah.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.870
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yes, of course.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
some TV shows.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.470
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Yeah [laughter].

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
comic and tragic

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:50.990
to have your identity just sort
of casually remade after some,

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.800
as you say, tragic white
woman, swollen with gin.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.100
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.400
Yeah.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You never
changed your name back

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.000
when you could have.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.300
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Well,
you know, because--

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.650
you know, a Mei Ling
appears in my--

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.690
in my fiction and appears in the
poetry as an alter ego, but--

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.260
but, you know, I don't know,

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.410
because are there
many women named--

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.890
are you naming your
kids Marilyn these days?

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.530
It's really-- yeah, what
happened to that name.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.500
I think it's kind of an
interesting name actually.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:26.990
Yeah, my father was like-- oh he
was-- he was a rake, so trans--

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:30.870
he translated literally
Mei Ling to Marilyn.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.140
And then my sister's
name was Mei Jun

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:40.070
and he named her Jane
after Jane Mansfield.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.130
[ Laughter ]

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.120
So, talking about
bombshell blondes.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.310
I mean-- I mean it's-- yeah
that's-- that's another story.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.890
But-- but yeah, those--

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Twice in that
poem you say no one dared

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.800
question him.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.100
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
obviously questioned him.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.700
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh yes, yes.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.140
He-- you know, I
am very rebellious

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.430
because of my father, yeah.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:07.510
So-- so-- so yeah.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:12.980
But the name, I like the name
Marilyn Chin I guess, yeah.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.130
Mei Ling. You know, at first,

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:19.290
I started with Marilyn Mei Ling
Chin, and it's a little long.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.890
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: And
makes Mei Ling look

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.190
like an afterthought, right.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh yes.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:25.790
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah,
like a translate--

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.600
yeah, ladies or something
like that, so yeah.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
say in that poem

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.700
that all was lavished upon her
and all that was taken away.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.000
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: That's right.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.340
I mean that's how we feel about
our li-- they-- we're all temp--

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.770
temporary here, right.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.370
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: And I feel--

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.680
I, you know, I feel very
blessed to have all I have.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.290
You know, I was born in a
cold water flat and, you know,

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.590
I was one of-- one
of many young--

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:58.130
you know, small little girls
born in that flat and in

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.850
that building and, you know, I
remember the story about this--

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.610
this, you know, uncle who
looked at me and said,

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.330
oh she's so small and dark,
maybe we should sell her.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.840
I mean that-- that was
supposed to be a joke.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.440
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: But, you know,
and so I feel so fortunate

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.620
to be able to write poetry to
be able to express myself to be

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.950
in this world to
celebrate poetry.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.550
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I mean
how-- how great is that?

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It is.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.150
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: So.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And that poem
is very raw and very funny,

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:28.750
but there's another
one that deals with one

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:33.040
of the same themes called
That Half is Almost Gone.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.340
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which is not
funny; it's really very sad.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.240
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.440
Actually, I-- you
know, I try to be funny

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.670
because I'm a deeply depressed
person, can't you tell.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No,
we cannot tell.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.120
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: That
Half is Almost Gone.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.860
That half is almost gone, the
Chinese half, the fair side

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.830
of a peach, darkened
by the knife of time,

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.720
fades like a cruel sun.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.350
In my 30th year I wrote
a letter to my mother.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.380
I had forgotten the
character for love.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.140
I remember vaguely
the radical heart.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.750
The ancestors won't fail
to remind you the vital

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:29.020
and vestigial organs where
the emotions come from.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.260
But the rest is fading.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.410
A dash dissects in midair.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:40.350
Ai, ai, ai, ai, more
of a cry than a sigh

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.370
and no help from
the pheneticist.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.880
You are a Chinese; my
mother was adamant.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.350
You are a Chinese, my
mother less convinced.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:59.430
Are you not Chinese, my
mother now accepting?

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.720
As a cataract clouds her vision,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.980
and her third daughter marries
a Protestant West Virginian,

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.620
who is very handsome
and very kind,

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.220
the mystery is still unsolved.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.800
The landscape looms over man.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.010
And the gaffer-hatted fishmonger
sings to his cormorant.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:28.830
And the maiden behind the
curtain is somebody's courtesan,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:34.930
or, merely Rose Wong's
aging daughter pondering the

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.800
blue void.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.440
You are a Chinese,
said my mother

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.180
who once walked the
fields of her dead.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.790
Today, on the 36th
anniversary of my birth,

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:53.000
I have problems now even
with the salutation.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.060
Oh, thank you.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.870
Yeah. This is a nice audience.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:06.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's such a
beautiful and heroing image

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.930
of not being able to
remember the word for love

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.230
when you're talking to your mom.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.890
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Well the
character, you know, I--

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.450
so I'm playing with
homophony here.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:23.060
Ai, ai, ai, ai is a cry when,
you know a Chin-- when Chin--

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.460
yeah, it's a cry, but it's
homophonous with ai image love.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.930
And so-- so, you know, I--
yeah, so it's a pun there,

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:36.460
and also a visual pun because
a slash goes through the heart,

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.300
the-- yeah, the character,
the ideogram

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.600
of heart there's a
slash that goes right--

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.900
right through that character.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.540
So, I'm playing with the
pictograph, and also playing

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.000
with the sound of-- of
that character for love.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.770
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: So, this--
there's all, you know,

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.560
all that stuff going on.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.340
And when you look at
the poem, the left--

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.530
the left side, you know, the
half-- when I write the line,

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.780
that half is almost
gone, there's a break

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.600
to the next line,
the Chinese half.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.500
So visually you, from the
very first line you see the,

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.970
you know, the despair,
you see that cut.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:25.060
And so, I was playing vis-- with
the visual aspects of the poem

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.710
and a sonnet-- the sonic
aspects of the poem.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.990
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: And pondering
the blue void, I tried--

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.620
you know, I tried to give it
space, that, you know, line.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.330
So, when you have it-- so when
you read it you-- you have--

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.920
yeah, there's all this play
with the page, the space,

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.510
the space and everything.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.920
Yeah, that's-- and it's--

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.530
it's really amazing how
much Chinese I've lost.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.910
You know, I-- when
I go to Beijing

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.740
or Hong Kong I can
barely speak to people.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.170
It's just, you know,
it's so easy.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.800
I remember, I think it
was around sixth grade,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.330
which English completely
took over

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.740
and I started dreaming
in English.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.410
Then I realized it took over
my other half, you know.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.860
And-- and I don't
know, bilingual--

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:20.570
any of you bilingual, you--
I don't know, I have friends

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.650
who are perfectly bilingual
but I-- you know, I just-- I--

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:30.370
yeah, I think I'm only 80%--
I'm only 20% now [laughs].

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And so, losing
the language becomes combined

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.500
with losing the culture,
losing your ancestors;

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.390
it's losing all kinds
of complicated things

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.170
that are wound together
in that poem.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.420
In another poem you write,
my loss is your loss.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.770
A dialect here, a memory there.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:51.250
If my left hand is dying will
my right hand cut it off?

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.450
We should all be vesicle
organs, the gift of democracy,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:58.420
the pale faces, the wan
conformity, the price we pay

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.340
for comfort is our
mother tongue.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.680
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yes,
it's-- it is very sad.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.390
I-- I morn this all--
yeah, all the time.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:09.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:10.990
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: But--

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's the
essential American story,

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.590
is that if you come here--

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:14.890
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Yeah, it's-- yes.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're
blessed with freedom and riches

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.350
and you lose this rich heritage.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.910
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: That's
right, and then-- and yeah--

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.550
I think now there's, you know,

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.980
there's this new identity thing
now in which poets want to write

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.900
about their-- their
id-- yeah, identity now.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:38.350
But I think, yeah, it is
a problem of assimilation.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.010
It is-- and it's
hard work to try to--

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:48.900
try to keep yourself bilin--
you know, to keep bilingual,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.480
I mean it's very hard work
and to keep the culture, yeah.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right,
particularly

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.280
when you're struggling to
assimilate at the same time.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.580
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.070
Yes. And as a teenager you
want to be like everybody,

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.430
you want to conform, you want
to be like everybody else.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.390
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: You don't
want to be different, but.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Identity
poem number 99.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.750
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Oh, you're talking

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.770
about identity, [laughs] okay.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.610
Ron Charles, he is
digging into these--

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.860
these poems I haven't
read for years.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.160
Okay.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now there
aren't 98 other identity poems

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.960
are there?

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.260
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Well, you
know, I'm just, you know,

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.560
trying to be-- yeah, not--

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.280
well I've written a
lot of identity poems.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.220
Some of them like are
still in the drawer, right.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.230
But the word-- the number 99
there was meant ironically.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.630
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: No, yeah yeah.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:38.450
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Identity poem 99.

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:43.130
Are you the sky or the
allegory for loneliness?

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.700
Are you the only Chinese
restaurant in Roseburg, Oregon,

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:54.030
a half-breed war orphan,
adopted by proper Christians,

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:58.970
a heathen poi dog, a
creamy half-and-half?

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:04.650
Are you a dingy vinyl address
book, a wrist without a corsage?

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:10.460
Are you baby's breath faced down
on a teenage road in America?

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:15.090
Are you earphones,
detached, left dangling

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:19.940
on an airplane jack to diaspora?

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.700
Are you doomed to a
childhood without music,

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.350
weary of your granny's
one-string,

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:31.460
woe-be-gone erhu
mewling about the past?

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:37.050
Are you hate speech
or are you a lullaby?

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:44.380
Anecdotes requiring footnotes,
an ethnic joke rehashed?

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.200
How many Chinamen does
it take to screw--

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.470
how many Chinamen does it
take to screw a lightbulb?

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.000
Are you so poor that you
cannot call your mother?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.650
You have less than two
dollars on your phone-card

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.790
and it's a long cable
to Nirvana.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:10.640
Are you a skylight through
which the busgirl sees heaven?

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:16.090
A chopping block stained by the
blood of ten thousand innocents,

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:21.400
which daily, the same
busgirl must wipe off.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.540
Does existence preempt essence,

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:29.780
I being what my ancestors
were not?

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.240
Suddenly, you're a
vegan vegetarian.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.770
Restaurant is a facticity

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:41.690
and getting the hell
out is transcendence.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.480
Was the punch line incandescent?

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.730
Was a nosebleed your last
tender memory of her?

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.720
Did he say no dogs
and China women?

00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:02.510
Are you a rose or
a tattoo of fire?

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.450
[ Applause ]

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.190
Well I haven't read this
one for a while Ron Charles.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's-- it's
such a powerful recitation

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.490
and denunciation of all
of those horrible slurs

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.560
that you turn each one.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.250
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Yeah, that's-- yeah.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.620
There was that ethnic joke.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.530
I mean there was-- there's
these jokes you hear

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:30.120
or these slurs you hear in
your childhood and I-- yeah.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And all these
clichés about who you are,

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.740
who you can be as we're
trying, you know, slot everyone

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.640
into the identities we
expect them-- of them.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.870
This becomes more complex
when you start dating.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.170
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
falling in love.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.770
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Not with
other Chinese people,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.370
much to your parents' horror.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:49.670
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah
that's right [laughs].

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I love him.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.270
I hate him.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.570
I don't know how.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.870
I'm bi-racial.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.170
I'm torn in two, you
write in one poem.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.190
He is so fair you can see the
Thames pulsing in his temples.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.380
So fair, he blanched the
skies of the suburbs.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.260
You love him anyway.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.980
His beauty is all you know.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.460
So fair you imagine
sewing his grey children.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.170
In a parking lot you say to
Margarete, why must I yearn

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.510
for his bland porridge.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.240
[ Laughter ]

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.110
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: That's called
weaponizing your images.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.210
[ Laughter ]

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I want
you to read one stanza

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.040
from the end of this poem.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.580
Oh, where's number nine?

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.350
Oh, must be in my lap.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:33.770
Would you start here?

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.070
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh, okay.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
read to there.

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.670
This is your mother reacting

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:42.200
to a young man you
brought home, I think.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.490
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Okay.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:48.800
So, you've come home finally
with your new boyfriend.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.260
What's his name?

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.010
Ezekiel. Odd name for a boy.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.400
Your mother can't pronounce it

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.950
and she doesn't like
his demeanor.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.520
Too thin, too sallow.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:07.950
He does not eat beef in a
country where beef is possible.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:12.090
He cannot play the
violin in a country

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.130
where rapture is possible.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:21.680
He means a tawdry smile, perhaps
he is hiding bad intentions.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.220
And that moon, which
accompanied his arrival,

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.340
that moon won't drink
and is shaped haughtily

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.170
like a woman's severed ear.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.320
[ Laughter ]

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
didn't marry him, did you?

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.920
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: No [laughter].

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.760
Oh boy, but I dated lots
of creeps [laughter].

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We're going
to stand up, and turn around

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.940
and sit back down, just
so they can, you know--

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.240
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh, get--

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They've
been listening very hard.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.840
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh
okay, they're okay.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.140
Let's--

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Come
on, stand up.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.050
You stand up.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.350
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Okay.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This isn't
an intermission though,

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.610
we're just standing up.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.090
Now we're going to
sit back down.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.220
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: That's great.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now let's keep
talking about your mother,

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.750
she's such a character in
these-- in these poems.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:15.130
In a poem called Alba you speak
of your mother as the moon.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.630
It's another beautiful poem.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.930
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Actually--

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.680
actually, my mother was
a very sad character.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.920
I mean I felt that-- that I need
to avenge my mother's death.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.850
I feel that my father ruined
her life, so that's-- that's--

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.930
basically, that's why I write
poetry, to avenge my mother.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:36.690
Yeah, so.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
should read that poem.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.960
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh yeah.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:47.000
Take a left at the
waters of Samsara.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.270
Do you know this--
what Samsara is?

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:57.140
It's a cycle, yeah, of-- it's a,
yeah, cycle of life and death.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.700
It's reincarnation
to life, yeah,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.910
a continuous reincarnation.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:10.880
There is a bog of sacred
water behind a hedgerow

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.700
of wild madder, near the
grave of my good mother.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.140
Tin cans blossom there.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.980
The rust shimmers like amber,

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:27.620
a diorama of green gnats
ecstatic in their veil dance.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:33.720
A nation of frogs regale,
swell-throated, bass-toned.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.560
One belts and rages,
the others follow.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:43.290
They fuck blissfully, trapped
in their cycle of rebirth,

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:48.210
transient love, unprepared
for higher ground.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:53.870
And I, my mother's aging
girl, myopic, goat-footed,

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.850
got snagged on an
unmarked trail.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:02.620
The road diverged; I took
the one less traveled blah,

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.920
blah [laughter].

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.460
You know what I'm referring
to in that line, right?

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:15.340
I sit at her grave for hours; a
slow drizzle purifies my flesh.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:20.670
I still yearn for her
womb and can't detach.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.410
I chant new poems,
my best fascicle.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:31.440
Stupid pupil, the truth
is an oxymoron and exact.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.360
Eternity can't be
proven to the dead.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.130
What is the void
but motherlessness?

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.780
The song bellies up.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.720
The sun taketh.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:50.510
The rain ceases to bless.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.230
[ Applause ]

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I still yearn
for her womb and can't detach.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.610
What-- what was the source
of your mother's unhappiness?

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:02.910
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: My father.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.350
Didn't I say he was a rake?

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.920
And her situation was not
uncommon, you suggest.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.310
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:11.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Many
women suffered

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.670
like from those situations.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:15.970
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: And-- and she--

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.800
she stopped eating
and died at 62.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.440
She just, you know,
didn't want to live.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.120
So, she was-- but she
was such a good woman.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.690
She was ver-- a very
important role model.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:33.540
She was ethic-- you know, she
was ethical; she was so pure,

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.270
she was pure-hearted, yeah.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.690
Well that part-- you know,

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.760
interesting about these poems
you've chosen, that poem I--

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.170
I reread it the other day and
I felt it was a perfect poem,

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.980
that there's something about
the lines and how-- how the--

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.890
they were carved, and
yeah, I couldn't--

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.070
yeah, I couldn't change
a thing in that poem,

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:01.300
I mean there's something about
precision and I learned from,

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.320
you know, from Chinese poetries,
the precis-- yeah the precis--

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.270
the precision of the line,
the precision of the imagery.

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Talk about that

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:13.040
because the language
just seems so different.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.340
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: You felt that--

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.640
you feel that the
language is different?

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
languages seem so different

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.620
in their construction.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.920
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah, the--

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How do you--
how do you translate that lesson

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.110
of precision from
Chinese into English?

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.550
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: The-- you
know, Chinese-- I stud-- for--

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:29.540
my undergraduate degree
was in Chinese poetry

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.600
and I studied the Chinese
poem deeply and heavily,

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.120
you know, I was really into it.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.400
I was such a nerd, right.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.460
But, you know, the Chi--

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:43.720
classical Chinese poetry there's
no inflection or morphology.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.960
You-- I mean there-- there--
you know, there are no tenses,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.940
you know, no-- and, you
know, lack of case tense.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.370
I mean, and some poems there
aren't verbs, you know.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:00.460
I mean, I-- it's-- it's
so concise and precise

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:05.290
and the imagery is so
precise that I try to bring

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.250
that into the, you
know, my English poet--

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.800
my writing, and t hat's,
I think-- I think that's--

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.960
that's why I've been developing
a Chinese-American esthetics,

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.640
a Chinese-American quatrain,
a Chinese-American poem,

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.370
where I borrow from
the ancient Chinese--

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:27.640
Chinese poetry and
try to bring--

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.730
bring that precision into
the, you know, my-- so--

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.390
you know, some of my poems.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.670
Now I write different kinds of
poems; I write long line poems

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.900
and talky poems and-- and I--

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.250
you know, some poems
shout at you, but--

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:46.580
but some poems are really
influenced by Chinese poetry,

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.390
and so-- so, yeah,
I just-- it's--

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.250
it's a wonderful
puzzle for me too,

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:56.660
to try to bring Chinese
poetry into, you know,

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.120
into the western world.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It is--
it is wonderful for us.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.730
Here is a poem that
captures, I imagine,

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.030
what your mother went through,

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.760
but what so many
women go through.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.190
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Which-- which one?

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:13.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This side here.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.980
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh, this one.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.060
Ron Charles [laughter].

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.360
Okay, I'm--

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You should
have told me what poems not

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.190
to ask you to read [laughter].

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:24.490
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Okay.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.450
This one is called
Variations on an Ancient Theme:

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:31.980
The Drunken Husband,
right, and this--

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.040
okay, these are written
in octaves and fashioned

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.050
after Du Fu's octaves, his--
his [inaudible], I just--

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:44.090
okay, I won't get into the geeky
information regarding that form,

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.110
but-- but there's also
there's these folk songs,

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.390
these ancient folk songs that--

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.880
that talk about drunken
husbands.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.180
They would come home,

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.330
these drunken husbands
would come home and--

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:57.770
and of course the woman would--

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.810
would wait for him in her
finest, you know, outfits

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:05.160
and she would forgive him for--
you know, after he's you know,

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.070
come home from the brothel.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:08.370
Of course, these
poems were written

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:11.440
by men, right, so-- so yeah.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:15.370
So, I talk back to those
poets and-- and so--

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.780
and there's a dog that
goes through these--

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.310
this poem, and in Chinese
poetry there's often this bark,

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:23.370
this dog that is-- that he--

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:27.410
often the harbinger of
good luck, of good news.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:33.150
But in-- in this sequence he's
a harbinger of bad news and--

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:37.040
and this is my-- one of my issue
poems about domestic violence,

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.320
so, and these are
different vignettes of--

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.110
these are vignettes
of different--

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:46.100
different situations,
different families.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:50.700
Variations on an Ancient
Theme: The Drunken Husband.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.870
The dog is barking at the door.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.990
Daddy crashed the car.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.330
Hush, kids, go to your room.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:00.790
Don't come out until it's over.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.890
He stumbles in the
dim lit stairs,

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:06.700
drops his Levi's to his ankles.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.100
Touch me and I'll
kill you she says,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.950
pointing a revolver at his head.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:16.290
The dog is barking at the door.

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.140
She doesn't recognize
the master.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:24.400
She sniffs his guilty crotch,
positioned to bite it off.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.640
Jesus, control your dog.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.570
A man can't come
back to his castle.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:32.530
Kill him, Ling Ling, she sobs,

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:36.250
curlers bobbing on
her shoulders.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.470
The dog is barking at the door.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:42.420
Quiet, Spot, let's not wake her.

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.150
The bourbon is sour
on his breath.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:48.400
Lipstick on his proverbial
collar.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.330
He turns on the computer
in the den.

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.970
He calms the dog with a bone.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.650
Upstairs she sleeps,
facing the wall,

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.190
dreaming about the
perfume river.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.830
The dog is barking at the door.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.080
He stumbles in swinging.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.180
Where is my gook of a wife?

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.300
Where are my half-breed
monsters?

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.210
There is silence
up the cold stairs.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.920
No movement, no answer.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.820
The drawers are open
like graves.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:26.280
The closets agape
to the rafters.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.520
The dog is barking at the door.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.830
He stumbles in singing.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.100
How is my teenage bride?

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.240
How is my mail-order darling?

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.270
Perhaps she's pretending
to be asleep,

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.510
waiting for her man's hard cock.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.120
He enters her from behind.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.860
Her sobbing does not deter him.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.100
The dog is barking at the door.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.740
What does the proud beast know?

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:02.050
Who is both master and intruder?

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:05.040
Whose bloody handprint
on the wall?

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:08.370
Whose revolver in
the dishwasher?

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:12.940
The neighbors won't
heed her alarm.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:21.720
She keeps barking, barking,
bent on saving their kind.

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:25.880
I-- I think domestic
violence will do us in.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.180
We just--

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
a devastating poem.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.180
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah, it's--

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
you say that it--

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.970
you've borrowed from a Chinese
form, and even a Chinese theme,

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.270
so it's not just a translation,

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.050
it's a transformation
of that form.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.350
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: That's
a-- yeah, that's a good--

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:44.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Into a very
different kind of poem.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.280
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Right, right.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:51.390
I-- I used-- I used the formal
base, but then I bring in,

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.070
you know, contemporary
themes and ideas and issues.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:59.200
I just-- I see myself as an
activist poet and I write

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.490
about the issues of the day.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:05.110
And also, it's per-- it's
personal, it's political

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:10.390
and my family is just filled
with -- with strife and--

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:14.820
yeah, and therefore
I feel like I must--

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.420
I must write about-- about it.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What's
so chilling is, you know,

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.070
each of those, are
they quatrain?

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:22.690
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
They're octaves, yeah.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:23.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Octaves.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:25.960
Each of them is parallel,
each of them very similar,

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.290
but each of them different,
in different cultures

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:28.910
at different times, obviously,

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:31.890
but it's essentially the same
story over and over again.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:33.190
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Right.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It
reminds me, of course,

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:36.360
of Dr. Ford's testimony when
women all over the country said,

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.570
yes, that's exactly-- even
people in my own family told me,

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.790
yes, that's exactly what
happened to me at a party.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:43.090
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yes.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:44.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Everyone's
had this happen apparently.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.070
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yes, and--
and women's issue-- I mean--

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:51.960
I mean I wrote this poem, what
20 years ago and it's, you know,

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.870
and the theme-- it's universal.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:56.690
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: We're still
suffering from, you know,

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.030
from domestic vi--
from violence.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:00.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
the denial of it.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:01.750
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
And denial, yes.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
all part of it.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.840
It's acting like it never
happens or being surprised.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.010
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
And-- and, yeah.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:11.420
So, yeah, that's--
that's why these--

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.750
you know, certain poems live on.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:18.040
You know, they're-- they're
un-- they're universal.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Every
Woman Is Her Own Chimera.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.990
That's a very different kind
of feminist poem, right.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.700
Where is that?

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.550
Number 16.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.620
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I wrote
this poem for Adrienne Rich.

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.420
Did you know Adrienne Rich?

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.720
Yeah.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I-- I
can't have you read the--

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.320
we won't get through
the whole thing

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.510
but just you'll see
when to stop.

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: You
want-- should I read this?

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:44.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I've
got a little mark

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.300
on the other side, next page.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.600
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
I-- I stop here?

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.900
I read--

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes please.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.500
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Okay.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.100
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah, I wrote
this suite for Adrienne Rich.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.900
Every Woman is Her Own Chimera.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.290
Every woman is her own chimera.

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.010
Today she is laughing
with Julio.

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:05.620
Tonight, she is dancing
with Coolio.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.710
How long can happiness last?

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:12.840
For a slow brief afternoon,
my head on the thigh

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:17.170
of a Sequoia, reading Wang Wei.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:21.070
Butterfly in mouth,
but don't bite down.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:23.230
Whose life is it anyway?

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:30.720
She born of chrysalis and shit
or she born of woman and pain?

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.160
Mei Ling brings a
wounded poem, cry--

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.480
crying, please, mommy,
mommy fix it.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.000
You wipe the tears
from her cheek,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.090
then glue a gnat's torn wing.

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.770
The sand dab flicks her tail.

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:50.250
The tears of the
wombat are green.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:54.730
Kiss me against the
last hydrangea.

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:58.350
Comrades, we are not yet free.

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:02.810
[ Applause ]

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:04.110
Yeah.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:05.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Women aren't
just victims in your poems.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.780
They push back.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.950
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh yeah, they
talk back, they push back.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They fight back.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:11.550
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
They fight back.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They-- what
they say about a woman at 45;

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.060
too late to live, too
soon to die [laughter].

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:22.000
My wine is bittersweet,
my song is rye.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.080
You go on to talk about
other parts of your body,

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.880
which I will not read.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.050
[ Laughter ]

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:33.510
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Yeah,
he's afraid of the c word

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:38.160
and the v word he's
afraid of [laughter].

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But
it is very funny.

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.120
It's a very funny poem.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.570
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: There's a v
word, okay, and a c word, okay.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:46.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In the afterward

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.850
to the Phoenix Gone you write
I have not been rehabilitated

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:51.150
in middle age.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.470
In fact, I want to reassure
my friends that I am as feisty

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:54.770
as ever, which we've
clearly seen.

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:58.270
I am still very much an activist
poet who believes in my work,

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:01.260
my life work, to infuse my art
with three powers; to inspire,

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.370
to illuminate, and to liberate.

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:06.180
How does poetry do those things?

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.810
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin:
Oh, as Oden says,

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:13.060
poetry makes nothing
happen, right [laughter].

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:17.990
Well it's-- it's important
that the poet believes that,

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:19.370
you know, she can
do these things.

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:20.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:21.970
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: It's
important for the poet to--

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:25.950
to have this grand scheme
of-- you know, of things.

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:28.860
I don't know.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:34.180
This is-- this-- I just retired
from my full-time teaching job.

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.270
I'm going to, you know, run
around the country and talk

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:40.670
about poetry and-- and
bring the good news,

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.880
present the good news, and
it's-- it's important, I think.

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your poems do
that, but they also push back

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:51.030
at our temptation to speak in
a grandiose way about poetry.

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:52.330
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Right, right.

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:53.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Several
witty lines here.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:56.590
The poet guards the
conscious of society.

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:57.890
No, you're wrong [laughter].

00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:02.800
She stands lonely on that hill
like observing the pastures.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.520
Later you say, I do hate my
loneliness, sitting cross-legged

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.920
in my room, satisfied
with a few off rhymes,

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.220
sending off precious haiku

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.950
to some inconspicuous
journal named Lev Leaning

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:14.340
Bamboo [laughter].

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.210
It's such a great
satire of the poet.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:22.760
And finally, how could we write
poetry in a time like this,

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.440
a discipline that makes so
much ado about so little.

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.660
Willfully laconic, deceptively
disguised as a love poem.

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.670
I mean you implicitly
challenge poetry,

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.500
not to claim more
than it can do.

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.800
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Right, right.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.290
And-- well I-- but I
still love the genre.

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:40.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh yes.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:42.250
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: You know,
it's the genre that's closest

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:44.840
to our hearts, when
you're sad and lonely

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.840
and angry you write a
little poem, you know,

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.160
you write poems, you know.

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.880
And so, yeah, yeah.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.070
I just-- well, you know, a
poet, we're-- we're the--

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:58.540
we're the step-children
of literature, aren't we?

00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:59.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.510
No. You're the queens and kings.

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:05.360
[ Laughter ]

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.510
Look at you laughing.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.430
[ Laughter ]

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:17.320
There's a wonderful tribute poem
here I want you to read the--

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:23.780
the first part, and
this will be the end.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.140
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: I read here?

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.740
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Okay.

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.130
This-- I wrote this
for my friend,

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:31.870
the activist poet,
Mitsuye Yamada.

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:36.240
Do you-- any of-- yeah, I wrote
it for her 90th birthday and--

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: She's
still alive.

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:38.920
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: She's
still alive, she's 93,

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.030
and she calls me and says
when are you going to come

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.290
and visit me, I might
not have long, you know,

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:46.590
I might have another year.

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.510
And so, it's-- she's
really great.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.190
But she's-- she was
one of the fir--

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:54.540
you know, first Asian-American
poets that I read and her--

00:57:54.540 --> 00:58:01.200
and her father was
inturned, you know, she was--

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.130
you know, was taken away
to an internment camp.

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:08.130
For Mitsuye Yamada
on her 90th birthday.

00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:11.460
They say we bitch
revolutionaries never go

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.690
out of fashion.

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.180
Look how fashionable
I am [laughter].

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:20.250
Wearing floppy hats
and huge wedgy shoes.

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:24.230
A feather bandolera
and a lethal python.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:29.210
Sometimes we wear a fro perm
cause we hate our straight hair.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:34.070
Sometimes we wear it straight
to the ankles like Murasaki.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:39.290
I bleached mine purple to
look like Kwannon Psylocke.

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:42.470
Maxine's beaming, like the
Goddess of Nainai temple.

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:47.530
A cross between Storm, the
X-girl and Ahsoka Tano.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:52.420
We love our laser eyes; our
Yoko granny glasses are dizzy.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.400
Short women poets unite!

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.510
Revolution ain't just
style, it's destiny!

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:07.040
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.080
Remember those spiral perms?

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.490
I don't know, you
guys are too young.

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:14.950
Oh, the spiral perms
in the 80s, you know.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:17.800
I had-- ugh, yeah.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's been such a
pleasure to talk to you tonight.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:21.870
Thank you so much.

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:23.170
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh, thank you.

00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:24.470
It's-- the hour's over.

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:25.770
I can't believe it.

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:27.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There
are poem books--

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:28.370
there are collections
for sale in the lobby.

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:30.200
Please fill out the
questionnaires and feel free

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.500
to come up and talk to Marilyn.

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.800
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Chin: Oh,
thank you so much.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.100
Thank you [applause].

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.400
Thank you for coming.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.700
Thank you.

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.000
Thank you.
