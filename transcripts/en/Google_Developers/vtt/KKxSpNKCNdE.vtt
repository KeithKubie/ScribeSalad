00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:05.090
The Launchpad is a five
day boot camp for startups.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.995
Everything from the design
all the way through to user

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.286
experience all the way through
to the pitching process.

00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:13.980
I have learnt absolutely
everything I wanted to know.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160
'Cause we have gotten
business advice, and sales,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.579
and modeling advice.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.620
Everything was practical.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.580
It was like a bit
business-oriented.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.327
My business has definitely
taken some different directions

00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:26.542
because of Launchpad.

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.121
Our mentor session
on Monday really

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.430
pushed us to make a
product from an idea.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.130
We practically saved.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.650
I think approximately
two months, maybe three,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.589
of our development time,
and countless hours

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.396
of the user research, market
research, everything, probably

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:42.394
our company, to be honest.

00:00:42.394 --> 00:00:42.894
Yes.

00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:44.886
A lot of the mistakes
you make as a startup,

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:46.380
we hopefully are not
going to make them.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.880
Or we made them in
such a short time

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.360
that we still have enough
time and budget to continue.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.250
Google Launchpad saved us.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.150
Yes.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.700
Bye!
