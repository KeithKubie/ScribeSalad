00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.300
Hey guys, Matt here with Science or Fiction.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.090
Is there a speed that would harm humans?

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.490
There are a bunch of human speed records that
are going to be broken in the coming decades

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.200
as we develop the technology to travel thousands
of miles in minutes by land, send commercial

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.010
flights into low-earth orbit, and attempt
to get humans to Mars.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.850
So with all of these possibilities on the
horizon, a question you might be asking yourself

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.320
is “How fast is too fast?”

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
Well, first of all, wherever you are, no matter
what you are doing, you are traveling nearly

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.400
67,000 mph around the sun.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.730
It just doesn’t feel that way because the
Earth, and therefore humans, have been traveling

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.890
at that constant rate for, well, you know,
kind of a while.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.300
We can actually survive any speed, as long
as it remains constant.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.780
It’s when acceleration enters the equation
that things can get pretty tricky.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.460
In fact, if you accelerate at a high enough
rate, you will pass out and very possibly

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.460
die.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.829
This is because of what happens to the human
body when it experiences g-force, or the unit

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.420
of measure for acceleration.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.010
It’s based on Earth’s gravitational pull.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.079
One “G” is the force applied to an object
by gravity while on the Earth’s surface.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.909
It’s also the force that determines how
much we weigh.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.430
So, simply put, if a human experiences three
Gs, they experience a force on their bodies

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.420
that is three times their weight.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.250
We can experience the G force in different
ways.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.630
If we accelerate horizontally like in a car
or train, we can experience g-force either

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.039
front-to-back or side-to-side.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.399
We can actually withstand quite a bit of g-force
when it’s hitting us horizontally.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.630
It’s when things go vertical, which mostly
happens only on airplanes, roller coasters,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.310
or during space launches, that things get
much more dangerous much more quickly.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.900
Vertical g-force can be experienced negatively
(foot to head) or positively (head to foot).

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.920
Both can be experienced in an airplane or
rocket, and both can pose serious threats

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.659
to our health because of what happens to all
the liquid in our bodies under these circumstances.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.659
With a high level of negative Gs, blood can
end up collecting in our heads.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.659
Sometimes a “red out” will occur, with
the lower eyelids swelling up so much that

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:56.770
they cover the pupils.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.499
If enough blood pools in the head, which can
happen around 2 or 3 negative Gs, a person

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:02.890
will lose consciousness.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
Yikes.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.890
And other scary stuff happens when force is
applied from head-to-foot and blood starts

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.630
to pool in the lowest parts of our bodies.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.340
At 1 G, or normal conditions, our bodies require
22 millimeters of mercury blood pressure to

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.140
pump blood from the heart to the brain.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.500
That requirement doubles at 2 G, triples at
3 G, and so on.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.070
There’s a certain point at which our bodies
can no longer muster the energy needed to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.510
pump the blood, which happens around 4 or
5 Gs.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.830
Blood ends up pooling in the feet, and the
rest of the body receives such a lack of oxygen

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.360
that a person first loses vision due to a
lack of blood flow to the eyes and then consciousness

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.940
altogether when the brain loses enough of
its blood flow.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.200
This phenomenon is known as G-LOC, or G-induced
loss of consciousness.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.340
Both head-to-foot and foot-to-head vertical
g-forces can eventually lead to death if they

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.340
last long enough.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.630
So, given that humankind is on the precipice
of breaking many speed records, and given

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.950
that many of the airplanes and spacecrafts
that will be involved could one day fly your

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.940
average Joe across the country at record speeds,
how can we make sure that we, you know, don’t

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.940
die?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.700
Pilots do a number of things to train for
serious g-s.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.400
The better shape they are in, the more able
they are to control their body’s blood flow

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.950
with their muscles.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.220
Leg and abdominal muscles must be particularly
strong so that when pilots tense these muscles,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.080
they can keep the blood from draining to their
legs while experiencing positive g-force.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.800
Well, it’s sort of unrealistic to expect
everyone to have abs of steel, so other solutions

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.180
might be needed if we are to expect average
people to eventually accelerate at rates currently

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.360
only safe for fighter pilots.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.480
One solution could anti-g suits, which pilots
have been using since World War II.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.390
They utilize air bladders to keep the blood
in our bodies where it should be.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.870
Fortunately, we haven’t quite reached the
point where people like you or me (unless

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.840
there are a lot of fighter pilots watching
this episode, then I take that back) are going

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.540
to be accelerating at deathly rates.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.580
There is still time for us to figure out how
to manage all that.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.200

our future check out THE AGE OF AEROSPACE.COM

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.260
Did you know we learned a lot about how g-force
affects the body from one guy shooting himself

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.790
down a track in a rocket sled?

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.290
It’s true, check it out here.
