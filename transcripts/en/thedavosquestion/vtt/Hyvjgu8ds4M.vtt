&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Prime
Minister of Thailand.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.980
Here at Davos, we are addressing a number
of significant challenges we

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.470
are all facing.
Not just the economy but also the issues of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.179
food security, climate
change, and other issues.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.380
To me, what's really important is all these
issues cannot be solved by

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.300
government or even by government and business
alone.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.189
We need the engagement of civil society, of
ordinary people.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.439
We need everybody to be aware of the common
challenges that we face.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.450
And I would very much like to invite you to
participate at whatever

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.630
forum, at whatever convenience that you may
have, so that we all work

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.390
together towards a better world which gives
peace and prosperity for

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.710
all of us.
Thank you.
