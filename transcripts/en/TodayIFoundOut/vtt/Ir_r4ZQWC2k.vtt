00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:13.179
In 1492, Columbus 
sailed the ocean blue… with a whole lot

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.460
of maps and information about the very round
Earth.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.839
Contrary to popular belief, not only did Columbus
realize the world was round, so did his contemporaries.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.019
In fact, it was so well accepted that daring
seafarers had been exploring the Atlantic

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.900
for hundreds of years before Columbus’ time.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.450
Without a doubt, men of the early Renaissance
knew the world was round, and that the Nina,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.970
the Pinta and the Santa Maria were in no danger
of sailing over the edge.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.620
The ancients were well aware the world was
a sphere.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.800
Pythagoras (6th century B.C.) is generally
credited with having first suggested a round

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.800
Earth.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.301
Aristotle (4th century B.C.) agreed and supported
the theory with observations such as that

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:56.580
the southern constellations rise higher in
the sky when a person travels south.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.450
He also noted that during a lunar eclipse,
the Earth’s shadow is round.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.519
Eratosthenes (3rd century B.C., head librarian
at the Library of Alexandria) built on their

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.800
ideas and calculated the circumference of
the Earth with remarkable accuracy at about

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.710
252,000 stadia.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.551
Depending on which stadion measurement he
was using, his figure was either just 1% too

00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:22.390
small or 16% too large; many scholars think
it likely that he was using the Egyptian stadion

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.960
(157.5 m), being in Egypt at the time, which
would make his estimate about 1% to small…

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960
remarkable.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.590
Later, the Roman Ptolemy added to the collected
wisdom.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.920
He observed that as a man approached a far
off mountain, it appeared to grow out of the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.070
ground – a clear indication of a curved
surface.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.510
He later devised the forerunner of modern-day
longitude and latitude, including measuring

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.060
what we now call latitude from the equator.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.390
In Christian medieval Europe, Bede (7th century
C.E.), a scholar and a Catholic monk, produced

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.979
an influential treatise that included a discussion
of the spherical nature of the world.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.810
This work, The Reckoning of Time, was copied
and distributed to clerics across the Carolingian

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.810
empire.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.450
Later, in the 1300s, Dante Alighieri’s Divine
Comedy also describes the Earth as a sphere.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.750
The Catholics weren’t the only religious
sect that thought the world was round.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.709
The Islamic world is known to have consistently
maintained the scientific knowledge of the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.980
Greeks and Romans, preserving the works of
Aristotle and Ptolemy, among others.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.099
They were well aware the Earth was round,
having calculated with relatively good precision

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.790
its circumference in the early 9th century.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.319
As historian Jeffrey Burton Russell stated,

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.260
With extraordinary few exceptions, no educated
person in the history of Western Civilization

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.629
from the third century B.C. onward believed
that the Earth was flat.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.209
The debate since then among the educated,
both religious and secular, was not whether

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.050
the Earth was approximately a sphere, but
exactly what the size of the Earth was.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.730
The idea of sailing west to reach India also
has its origins in antiquity, with the first

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.190
known person to mention the notion being the
Roman writer Strabo in the 1st century BC,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.409
who stated:

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.489
If of the more recent measurements of the
Earth, the one which makes the Earth smallest

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.279
in circumference be introduced–I mean that
of Posidonius who estimates its circumference

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.749
at about 180,000 stadia, then.

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:17.129
. . if you sail from the west in a straight
course, you will reach India within 70,000

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.129
stadia.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.129
“

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.029
Beyond the educated, even the most empty headed
sailor knew the Earth was round simply by

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:28.019
the fact that ships and the like disappeared
over the horizon with the bottom first and

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.510
then the mast the last to be sighted.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.849
A similar effect is observed when spotting
land from a ship.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.079
Again, what was the real mystery at this time
was the actual circumference of the Earth.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.849
Most- correctly -thought Eratosthenes’ estimate
was probably reasonably accurate, meaning

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.079
that if one did not encounter a well stocked
land mass in between Spain and Asian to resupply,

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.849
Columbus’ expedition would end in failure
with the crew dying of thirst or starvation.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.689
In fact, this would have happened if not for
Columbus encountering the Caribbean islands

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.379
around where he expected to encounter his
destination.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.840
Columbus, of course, felt that the Earth was
much smaller than Eratosthenes’ estimate,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.219
so the journey was doable at Columbus’ estimation
of only about 3100 miles (5000 km) to Japan,

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.419
rather than the true 12,400 miles (20,000
km) it is.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.459
Queen Isabella eventually sided with Columbus
and agreed to finance the expedition, despite

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.270
the objections of scholars who were consulted
over the plan.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.599
As to how the myth that people during Medieval
times thought the Earth was flat came about,

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.220
this is up for debate.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.060
The idea seems to have first popped up in
the 17th century and appears to have been,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.810
at least in part, put forth by secular scientists
railing against the ignorance and misguided

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.030
notions of religious groups (specifically
Catholics), who they claimed in Medieval times

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.712
believed the world was flat- ironically, despite
the lack of much evidence supporting that

00:04:47.712 --> 00:04:50.600
claim, and the numerous documented instances
of religious scholars from that era stating

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.669
the Earth is round.

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.770
The myth gained significant traction in the
19th century with various works, such as Andrew

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.440
Dickson White’s History of the Warfare of
Science with Theology.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.780
The “Columbus / Flat Earth Myth” itself
was widely popularized in Washington Irving’s

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.360
The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus,
which was in numerous places largely fiction,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.310
though presented as fact and a scholarly work.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.250
In his account, Irving claimed that it was
Columbus’ voyage that proved to the world

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.930
that the Earth was round, going so far as
to explicitly state that one of the objections

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.789
to Columbus’ voyage was that a round Earth
wasn’t scriptural, so the voyage was doomed

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.629
to fail when Columbus encountered the edge
of the world.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.520
In fact, there is no first hand record of
any such objection to Columbus’ expedition,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.250
with the primary documented objections having
to do with the length of the journey.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.360
Irving’s fanciful tale is simply in line
with the “Warfare of Science with Theology”

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.849
viewpoint, which at least in terms of the
“flat Earth vs. spherical Earth” issue,

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.750
historically wasn’t ever a sticking point
as has been so often claimed from the 17th

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.190
century on (though around the 1920s, most
scholars stopped believing this myth).

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.160
One of the only significant Christian works
that seems to put forth the notion of a flat

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.830
Earth was written by an Egyptian Monk in the
6th century AD, Christian Topography.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.940
On the whole, though, evidence seems to indicate
this work wasn’t very influential, as you

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.110
might expect given that most educated Christians
were well aware of the mountain of evidence

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.539
that the world was a sphere.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.840
That being said, Christian Topography was
often cited as support for the notion that

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.039
Christians thought the world was flat until
recently, with those authors casually ignoring

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.039
all evidence to the contrary.

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.039
Another common myth surrounding Columbus’
voyage was that he was the first to discover

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.039
the “New World”.

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.039
In fact, there is no question that North America
was visited by Northern Europeans in the 10th

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:25.039
or 11th centuries.

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.039
Specifically, Norse settlements, one of which
has since been excavated, were established

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.039
in continental North America in the 10th century.

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.039
The settlements were a failure in part, it
appears, due to problems with the Native Americans,

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.039
who the Norse called Skrælings.

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.039
However, according to recent scholarship,
the Norsemen continued to meet and trade with

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.039
indigenous Americans, at least sporadically,
even after the failure of the two colonies

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.039
they setup.

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:33.039
Not the dull oafs of legend and Capital One
commercials, the Vikings apparently made a

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.039
map of their North American conquests.

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.039
The Vineland map is believed by some to have
been made circa 1440, and demonstrates that

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.039
at least some Europeans were aware of the
existence of continental North America, well

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.039
before Columbus set sail.

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.039
Today, there is also increasing evidence,
and speculation, that the Americas were visited

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.039
by Muslim and Chinese explorers long before
the “Age of Discovery” in the late 15th

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.039
and 16th centuries.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.039
Although still somewhat up for debate, there
is evidence that a Muslim sailor, Khashkhash

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.039
Ibn Saeed Ibn Aswad, traversed the Atlantic
and landed in the New World in 889 C.E.

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.039
In 956, famed Islamic historian, Abul Hasan
Ali Ibn Al Masudi, created a map from his

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.039
research of this journey that depicts an unknown
landmass where America is located.

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.790
Other voyages to the New World chronicled
in Muslim histories includes that of Ibn Farrukh,

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.120
who seems to have visited islands far to the
west of the Canaries in 999 C.E.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
Proponents of the Muslim exploration theory
repeatedly turn to an intriguing map drawn

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.120
in the early 16th century by the famous cartographer,
Piri Reis.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120
Reportedly copying from ancient documents
found in a Turkish library, it is widely accepted

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120
that Reis created the map in 1513.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.689
Even though this is after Columbus “discovered”
the New World, the Piri Reis map depicts the

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:54.689
accurate placement of islands and landmasses
far before they were visited and mapped by

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:55.689
Europeans.

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:56.689
In fact, it shows the Andes Mountain range,
which was not “discovered” by Pizarro

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.691
until 1527.
