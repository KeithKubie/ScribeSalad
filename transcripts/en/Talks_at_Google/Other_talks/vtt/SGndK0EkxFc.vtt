FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello everybody,
and welcome to a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.560
talk by Peter Samuelson
about his new

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.470
institute at USC, the--

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.840
I'll let him tell you all
about that, both his

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.210
personality and the things that
he's devoted his life to.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.510
And I'll let him tell
you about that.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.760
So, Peter--

00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:25.030
PETER SAMUELSON: Thank you
and good afternoon.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.860
I have to first tell you--

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.600
I have to say something about
the experience for me of being

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.600
in the Googleplex.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.300
In 1984, the Olympics came to
Los Angeles, California.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.240
It was also the year that I
was part of a production

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.500
company, a film production
company called Interscope.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.490
And we decided that it was time
that there should be a

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.820
film set on a college campus
that wasn't all about the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.790
jocks but that was
about the nerds.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.610
And so we developed a script.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.480
It started off being called
"Brains," and it ended up

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.330
being called "Revenge of the
Nerds." And for all of these

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.660
decades since, people have said,
you're the father of the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.170
nerds and things of that kind.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.380
And I just want to say, if
that's what I am, as father of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.600
the nerds, I salute this-- the
Temple Mount of nerdosity.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.870
Clearly, this company,
these people, are the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.450
revenge of the nerds.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.860
So I'm honored to be here.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340
I thought I'd give you a little
bit of background and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.450
then tell you about the Media
Institute for Social Change at

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.010
USC, which is my new obsession
and the one that

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.730
we're here to discuss.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.880
But I don't think it's possible
to really pitch it to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.830
you, to tell you about it, until
I give you a little bit

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.730
of background.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.730
So I grew up in London.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.500
I never did get rid of the
accent, I think because I'm

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.080
probably half-deaf or I've got
cloth ears or something.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.590
I was the first kid in my family
to ever go to college.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.260
I got myself into Cambridge
on a scholarship.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.150
I got a bachelor's.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.520
I got a master's.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.960
And then I came out of
Cambridge, and there was no

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.020
work of any description
anywhere visible

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.000
in the United Kingdom.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.850
So the first job I actually
got was working as an

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.670
interpreter.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.990
I had managed to learn medieval
French as well as

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.010
medieval English.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.150
So when a film company that
was about to make a Steve

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.970
McQueen film in France decided
they needed someone to be an

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.680
interpreter, I actually did not
tell them that the kind of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.670
French that I spoke was
medieval French.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.170
And I spent the next several
months making up words for

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.090
things that they didn't know
about yet in medieval times.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.340
So I did that, and I worked on
a series of other American

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.840
films in Europe-- "The
Return of the Pink

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.720
Panther" and so forth.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.190
And I was a lousy interpreter.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.830
I always used to say what I
thought people meant as

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.840
opposed to what they actually
said, which was not popular

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.020
with people paying me.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.700
So I got promoted.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.160
And I became a production
assistant.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.160
You know, the guy who makes
the tea or the coffee.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.070
And then I got promoted and
promoted and promoted, and I

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.830
became a production manager.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.590
But still, it was really
challenging at the time, not

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.820
dissimilar to now where there's
very little work for

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.360
young people here.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.810
In the UK and in Europe
at that time

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.440
there was almost nothing.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.780
And then, one of my wonderful
Americans said, you know, you

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.540
might want to come out
to Los Angeles.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.370
And you could work for us.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.730
And we could give you maybe
a year contract.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.010
So I did.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.670
And I found myself literally in
an office at the corner of

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.510
Hollywood and Vine, which I
suppose was a Temple Mount of

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.480
its own in the sense
of Hollywood.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.590
And I started as a production
manager.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.040
I couldn't get into the union,
so I had to promote myself to

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.209
be a producer.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.019
And I started off as a line
producer, which is the person

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.350
who organizes somebody
else's film.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.430
And then I managed to get a
film financed, I thought--

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.920
the first one that
I would ever have

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.530
produced with a credit.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.300
It was called "A Man, a Woman
and a Bank." And we were going

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.290
to make it in Vancouver.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.460
And I had financed it with money
from dozens or hundreds

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.440
of doctors and dentists
in Canada.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.240
And just before we were about
to start shooting, I got a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.980
phone call from the lawyer in
Toronto, who said, I don't

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.590
quite know how to tell
you this, but

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.510
they've changed the law.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.170
And all of your doctors and
dentists will not be investing

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.270
in your film.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.390
And I said, well, they
can't do that.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.890
It's unconstitutional.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.530
The can't retroactive--

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.760
isn't it grandfather--

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.900
no, that's America.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.020
This is Canada, said the man.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.600
So I had no money to
make this film.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.940
But I did have people
building the sets.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.930
I had a crew in Vancouver.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.280
So I didn't really
know what to do.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.940
I came back down
to Los Angeles.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.260
I didn't tell anybody that
we had the problem.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.080
And I read an article in the
newspaper about a young man

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.640
called Ted Field.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.230
And it said that he had just
turned 25, he had inherited a

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.940
great deal of money, he was the
heir to the Marshall Field

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.240
family, and he was interested
in motion

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.270
pictures and motor racing--

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.700
two things that I was
quite interested in.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.900
So I wrote him a letter.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.030
We didn't know where to say it,
but the newspaper article

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.200
said he was a student of
philosophy at Pomona College.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.530
So that's where we delivered
the letter.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.920
And Ted phoned me.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.970
We had lunch.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.110
He said, what are you doing that
I could be involved in?

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.610
I said, well, I'm actually
in a crisis.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.240
And he said, what do you need?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.980
I said, I need half of three
and a half million dollars.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.070
And he said, OK.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.435
Let me read the script.

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:13.650
I happened to have it with
me, and I gave it to

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.600
him across the table.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.330
And he steamed in.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.010
And two days later a lawyer
phoned me and said, where

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.500
would you like this
check delivered?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.370
And that's how we
made that film.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.770
So Ted and I ran Interscope
for six, seven years.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.580
Then I was bought out.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.010
And I've been an independent
producer ever since.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.770
"Tom &amp; Viv," "Wilde," "Arlington
Road--" I think

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.880
I've made 23 films
in 25 years.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.310
That is one whole
side of my life.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.530
But the epiphany, the thing that
changed my life, is not

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.340
making films.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.790
Of the films I've made, half a
dozen of them, I think, are

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.880
quite good.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.080
Some of the others we don't talk
about or even dare name.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.210
Some of them made money.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.720
Some of them didn't
make money.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.760
But what changed my life was
nothing to do with film.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.710
My cousin met a child, an
11-year-old little boy, who

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.910
was seriously ill-- dying, in
fact-- in a hospital in

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.460
London, and asked him, what
would make you happy?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.740
And the little boy, whose
name was Sean,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.090
said, oh, that's easy.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.060
I want to go to Disneyland--

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.380
which, considering that he was
in a hospital bed, in a very

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.590
bad way, with all sorts
of equipment and

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.690
nursing and so forth--

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.230
My cousin and I said, well, if
that's what he wants, that's

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.580
what we should do.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.710
We flew him and his mom
to Los Angeles.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.470
And the first thing
was, we couldn't

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.080
get them into a hotel.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.390
So everybody-- the cousin, the
mom, and the little boy moved

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.380
into my apartment on
Wilshire Boulevard.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.520
And for two weeks, we did all
the things that you are not

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.490
supposed to do, for sure, with
a seriously ill child.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.000
We took him to Disneyland and
Knott's Berry Farm and on the

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.570
beach and we borrowed Ted
Field's helicopter and we went

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.790
up in that.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.560
And he had a fine old time.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.290
And he went home with his mom
with his Mickey Mouse ears and

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.380
all his other souvenirs.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.910
That was not the epiphany.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.600
The epiphany, which I think has
changed my life and a lot

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.250
for the better, is that--

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.950
Sean went back to London.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.850
And he died.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.950
And it was both sad
and not sad.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.309
Everybody knew he was going
to die, including Sean.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:45.600
And we had talked about it
at the dinner table.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.510
I had a lunch with a man called
Steve [? Ulaky ?]

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.990
from HBO.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.810
He was the commissioning
editor.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.560
And there I sat in the Regency
Club, and I tried to sell him

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.530
some project.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.290
I don't remember what it was,
and he didn't buy it anyway.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.250
And halfway through the lunch he
said, what else is new and

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.220
exciting in your life?

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.430
And I said, well, I just had
this extraordinary experience.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.250
And I told him the story of
little Sean and the visit.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.390
And Steve, the man
from HBO, cried.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.380
He wept at the lunch table.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.080
It was in one sense incredibly
embarrassing.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.340
He was embarrassed, I was
embarrassed, the waiter was

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.170
embarrassed.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.770
The whole thing was a complete
catastrophe.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.330
After we--

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.140
I don't remember how
I said goodbye.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.500
I hope I hugged him.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.010
And he went off to the men's
room to sort of recover.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.750
I remember going down in the
elevator and thinking, I'm a

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.090
film producer.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.000
We sell stories.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.470
I just told someone a story.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.640
It had this effect.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.140
Maybe I could tell some other
people the story and it would

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.380
have an effect on them, too.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.000
So I did.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.030
I called a meeting of a dozen
people in the Interscope

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.840
boardroom after work.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.910
And I just stood there.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.200
And I said, look, this
is what we just did.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.310
This is what happened.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.400
This is why I think
it had value.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.070
Maybe, who knows, we
could do it again.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.940
There must be a lot of other
sick kids in the world.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.750
And maybe we could help them.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.290
Maybe we could make
them happy.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.680
It wasn't any more complicated
than that.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.180
And that, really, was the first
meeting or what became

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.210
the Starlight Children's
Foundation.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.260
So here we are.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.590
It's 30 years later.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.840
I won't tell you any
of the middle.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.250
But what Starlight was in
the last fiscal year--

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.980
we raised a little
over $60 million.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.620
We served 5.2 million children
and their moms and dads and

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.580
their brothers and
their sisters.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.490
We have around 50 offices across
the United States,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.290
Canada, Australia and New
Zealand, and the UK.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.770
It's become a very big deal.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.170
It's one of the leading children
charities providing

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:06.720
psychosocial services to kids
who could use a little help in

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.060
being happier when they're under
great stress because of

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.270
their medical condition.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.140
So the clock moves forwards.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.050
And in the early '90s, I got
myself a meeting with Steven

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.800
Spielberg, who didn't
know me from Adam.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.610
But one of things you learn
is you can meet

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.640
anyone in the world.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.020
You just phone up
and ask nicely.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.200
And mostly, you can get
in and see them.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.310
So I did.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.620
And I was told, you
have 15 minutes.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.590
Don't leave your collateral
material with Mr. Spielberg.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.930
Leave it out here.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.190
And please be gone
in 15 minutes.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.060
So I went in, and I was deer
in the headlights.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.030
I was still there
an hour later.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.990
I was there two hours later.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.930
I was there two and a
half hours later.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.580
And at the end of it,
Steven said, what do

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.280
you want me to do?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.070
And I said, be the chairman
of a new nonprofit.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.175
What will we call
it, said Steven.

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.610
And I thought, OK.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.310
Starlight--

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.140
Starbright.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.910
I said, you'll be the

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.380
Starbright Children's something.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.930
And he said, OK.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:06.900
I'll do it.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.980
And what will we do?

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.960
And I said, we need to
provide an online--

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.210
remember, the word online, a
little early to say that in

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.800
the early '90s--

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.220
I said, I can see that we are
going to link kids together

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.880
when they can't get out
of a hospital bed.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.620
And if we do that, I
believe that they

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.860
will help each other.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.520
And we could also provide
distractive entertainment and

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.090
education and so forth.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.440
And Steven said, OK.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.330
And as I was leaving, he said,
now, if I'm going to be the

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.340
chairman, I probably should
donate some money.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.910
What do you think
I should give?

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.390
And I said, honestly, I just
don't think I was put on the

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.320
earth to tell Steven Spielberg,
of all people, what

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.150
he should give to charity.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.760
And he said, no, no.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.920
I can always say no.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.170
Just give me a number.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.830
And I said, no I'm not going
to give you a number.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.640
He said, you can't leave unless
you give me a number.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.280
So I said, I, well I--

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.940
have you ever have one of those
moments where you sort

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.680
of feel as though you're
not in your body?

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.940
And I felt as I was sort of
up here watching my mouth.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.920
And my mouth said, two, two and
a half million dollars?

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.910
And there was a silence.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:20.331
And I saw his mouth from
up here say, OK.

00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:21.500
And I came out.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.020
And I actually went and
hid behind a tree

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.470
in the parking lot.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.290
And I called my wife.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.300
And I said, I think
I just had a

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.360
meeting with Steven Spielberg.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.000
I think I was in there
two and a half hours.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.925
And I think he just donated
two and a half million

00:13:34.925 --> 00:13:36.540
dollars, and he's going
to be the chairman.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.430
But I think I may have
hallucinated.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.980
And there was a silence.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:45.430
And my wife said, do you think
you're safe to drive?

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.580
Maybe I should come
and get you.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.140
So in 1995, Norman Schwarzkopf,
Steven

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.680
Spielberg, and I--

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.490
at Digital World that June
we pressed a button.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:03.140
And we turned on, I kid you
not, the world's first

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:09.090
avatar-based, continuously
running social network.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:14.400
In 1995, we had kids sitting
on the east coast video

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.630
conferencing with kids
on the west coast.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.820
You navigated--

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.250
you first chose an avatar.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.930
And then you navigated it.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.910
It was before there
was a mouse.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.370
So you could only navigate
in right angles.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.360
It was kind of an Etch-A-Sketch
kind of an

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.010
experience.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.190
Because to go diagonally you
had to do it in a zigzag.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.720
And they received distractive
entertainment.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.140
If two avatars bumped in one of
the three worlds, it opened

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.250
up the video conference
and you chatted.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.410
We had to--

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:50.160
it was about a $50-million
investment by all sorts of

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.510
different companies, in
cash and in kind.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.940
It enabled children who couldn't
get out of a hospital

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.220
bed to do so.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.950
It obviously evolved.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.050
It's never been turned
off since.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.280
Starbright World runs 24/7.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.040
It is supervised by trained
people who are paid, staff

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.240
people, in Los Angeles.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.430
And when Los Angeles goes
home, they hand off.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.450
It's been like Houston
mission control.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.230
They hand it off to
Sydney, Australia.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.750
And they run it through the
night, their day, and then

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.330
they give it back in their
evening, which is our morning.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.750
So that was number two.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.830
Starlight, Starbright, you
begin to see the pattern.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:37.980
Number three was that in 1999
I got incredibly angry--

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.840
pissed off, actually--

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.370
at what goes on with foster
kids in America.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.960
I just couldn't get
my head around it.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.880
How can we know best practice
but we don't do it in 3/4 of

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.080
the country?

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.990
How can we, according to UNICEF,
rank one from dead

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.800
last in the first world
when measured by

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.520
the welfare of children?

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.460
How can we understand best
practice but we don't do it?

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.650
Nobody that I know
hates children.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:09.890
Why would we marginalize half
a million foster kids with

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.950
appalling outcome stats, where
one in two ends up homeless

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.900
within two years of aging out?

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.980
Where, at best, they end up
in minimum-wage jobs.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.430
They never go to college.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.910
3% of foster youth ever get
a college education.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.110
So I got a little bit angry.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.390
And sometimes it's
good to be angry.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.560
And I formed the third nonprofit
with Sherry Quirk in

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.160
Washington.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.070
I said, where are all lobbyists
in this city?

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.860
They all say, K street,
northwest.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.780
That's where all the office
buildings are.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.810
And I say, great.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.740
That's where we'll
open our office.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.340
And we will bang away.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.920
And we will get laws enacted,
enforced, we'll get budgets

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.000
put in place, and we will
be the lobbyists and the

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.710
advocates for foster kids
because God knows they've got

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.190
nobody else.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.580
They will never march.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.950
They are children.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.510
You've never read an op-ed.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.170
And in fact, because of all the
secrecy laws, you've never

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.050
seen the face of a foster
child in the newspaper.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.720
So if nobody understands what's
going on, and they

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.940
cannot self-advocate,
well then why would

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.290
anything ever change?

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.150
So for a decade, First Star
worked top down, not

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.270
grassroots.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:25.250
Top down, drive using
embarrassment in the press,

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.270
give school grades
by jurisdiction--

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.860
there are 2,200 jurisdictions.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.070
Give them A through F and
embarrass the ones with an F.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.180
We had a headline in the Boston
Globe a couple of years

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.650
ago-- we flunked.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.540
That's what you want.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.780
You want them saying-- you want
the legislators to say,

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.750
how can this be?

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.860
We have an F?

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.730
And up the road they
get A-minus?

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:47.810
What are we doing wrong?

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.090
Let's go to emulate them.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.510
So First Star--

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.050
top down for a decade.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.270
And then one of my board
members, Kathleen Reardon,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.390
who's a professor at USC in
the business school--

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.270
she said, so, I've been
studying this.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.760
Everybody agrees that the most
difficult kids to place are

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.520
foster kids because whereas you
can find a foster home,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.210
perhaps, for a little girl of
eight, if it's a 6 foot 1"

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.570
16-year-old boy there's a whole
higher hurdle to jump.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.270
So those kids end up in what
used to be called group homes.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.490
But group homes are so terrible
that they got renamed

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.270
congregate care, which didn't
make them any better.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.520
But we do that in America.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.760
We change the name because we
think somehow that will

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.090
miraculously improve things.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.100
So these group homes are mostly
run by private entities

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.480
under government contract.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.690
They have 100 beds, they have 75
beds, they have 200 beds--

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.820
they are warehousing.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.070
They are, in many cases-- not
all, there are few good ones--

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.960
but almost all of them
are dreadful.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.720
And they guarantee that kids
will come out when they turn

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.900
18, normally, and will go
straight into unemployment,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:08.090
welfare, criminality, or
whatever it is that they've

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.630
learned in there.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.280
And as I said, half
of them end up

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.350
homeless within two years.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.220
So Kathleen said, so, I've
had a better idea, maybe.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.520
I don't know.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.800
It's like a huge idea.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.430
But I can't really--

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.810
I don't know what
I've got here.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.330
Tell me what you think, if we
put one of these group homes

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.860
somewhere better.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.520
And I said, well, where would
you put it, Kathleen?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.580
And she said, well, what would
you have if you put it on the

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.930
campus of a four-year
university?

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.890
What if you put a group home,
call it a boarding school, for

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.820
foster youth in ninth, 10th,
11th, and 12th grade smack in

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.495
the middle of a four-year
university campus?

00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:51.360
I said, well, the first thing
you'd have is let's say 25,000

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.150
undergraduate potential big
brothers and big sisters.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.620
The second thing that you would
have would be you've got

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.320
every kind of expert.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.950
How many psychiatrists
do need?

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.650
Do you want some
social workers?

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.210
How about people who
measure things?

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.540
What about some educators?

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.170
We have a whole school
of education.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.730
I said, I have to believe
it's been done.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.520
So we got a couple
of grad students.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.880
We looked all around
the world, not just

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.160
in the United States.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.140
No one had ever done that.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.110
So we did it.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:24.540
I went and got a meeting with
the chancellor of UCLA.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.620
And I said, hello.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.110
You don't know me but
we have this idea.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.700
And he said, have you read
my 10-year plan?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.240
And I said, no Chancellor
Block.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.900
I'm an idiot.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.130
I haven't read your
10-year plan.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.470
It would've been a
really good idea.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.510
He said, I'll read you
two sentences.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.160
He takes it out and he
runs his finger down.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.350
And he says, UCLA, as a
taxpayer-funded public

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.630
university, will strive in every
way possible to build

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.230
affirmative pathways to
post-secondary education for

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.620
young people, none of whose
family members have ever

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.310
previously had that advantage.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.710
He says, check one.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.670
And he runs his finger down and
he says, UCLA will try in

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.380
every way possible to use all
of its prodigious academic

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.640
skills to be the most excellent
neighbor to the

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.890
community surrounding
it, the community

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.236
of greater Los Angeles.

00:21:13.236 --> 00:21:14.830
He says, check.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.010
He says, do you think
you could raise the

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.400
money for this thing?

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.830
I said, I'm clueless.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.600
I don't know.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.880
But we can try.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.530
He says, OK.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.930
Well, if you raise the
money, we'll do it.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.420
So we did raise the money.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.940
And we did do it.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.610
So our first academy
started two years

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.580
ago on the UCLA campus.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.350
We now have three because a year
later we set up George

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.760
Washington University in DC.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.030
And we also are at the
University of Rhode Island.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.470
We're about to add a major
university in Connecticut and

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.500
another major university
in Illinois.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.150
Just before Christmas,
I was in Washington.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.340
I met with the Department of
Education, the Department of

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.010
Health and Human Services, I
met with the staffers of 10

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.890
members of Congress.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.290
I met a senator.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.660
This is a very, very big idea.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.720
We don't know what percentage
of these kids we

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.040
will get into college.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.840
But it will be one heck of a lot
more than 3%, which is the

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.250
benchmark if we don't
intervene.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.400
So you get the pattern--

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.560
Starlight, Starbright,
First Star.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.590
I couldn't think of anything
to call I See Tonight.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.230
So I did something different.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.350
One of the things that has
served me really well in my

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.230
life is if I'm kind of scared of
something, I sort of take a

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.240
deep breath and do it.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.310
And I decided I was scared
of homeless people.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.110
So I did 62 interviews with
homeless people while riding

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.470
my bicycle on weekends.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.520
The first thing I found out is
I thought they were all men.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.525
And they're not all men.

00:22:48.525 --> 00:22:51.410
They are 60% male, 40% female.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.240
I thought they were all
middle-aged men.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.080
No, actually 18% are under
the age of 18.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.840
Sorry, 15% are under
the age of 18.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.890
There's children
sleeping rough.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.930
I thought when I asked
them, where do you

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.490
go to bed at night?

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.130
I thought they'd all say,
I go to the shelter.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.110
I go to the mission.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.020
I go somewhere like that,
the Salvation Army.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.100
So it turns out just in greater
Los Angeles, the

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.140
county, we have 65,000,
in the most recent

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.390
census, homeless people.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:27.350
But we only have about 14,000
beds in shelters.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.540
So whichever way you cut it, we
have tens of thousands of

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.670
men and women and children
sleeping in the scrubland off

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.960
the freeway, behind
the pillar--

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.690
you know where they are.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.200
They're where you see them.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.510
You think there are no women and
children because they hide

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.150
better, I discovered.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.290
The epiphany--

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.620
I believe in epiphanies--

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.760
for me was that an old lady,
when I asked here, where do

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.970
you sleep at night, my dear?

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.540
She said, come on,
I'll show you.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.420
She takes me behind some bushes
behind a pillar off of

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.170
the 405 freeway.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.120
And there is a huge
cardboard box.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.020
And on the side of the cardboard
box, which is her

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.400
home, it says Sub-Zero.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.810
And I thought, OK.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.100
That's the epiphany.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.800
Because I got the refrigerator,
she got the

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.160
cardboard box.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.460
What the hell is this?

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.510
This is America.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.640
We have money.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.960
So my first thought was,
I'll build shelters.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.500
But when you run the math, it's
about $50,000 per bed

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.360
that you generate.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.470
And that's just to build it.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.530
So 100 beds, $5 million
kind of math.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.720
So I said, OK.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.430
50,000 times, say,
60,000 people.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.230
Oh, wait a minute.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.420
That's $3 billion.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.640
I have no clue how you
raise $3 billion.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.220
So I said, OK.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.210
Never daunted.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.000
What's the best we can
do with $500 a head?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.760
What could we build with $500?

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.210
So I tried to draw a thing.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.330
I knew in the daytime,
it would have wheels.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.730
You would push it around.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.490
And then at night, you
would park it.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.240
You would open it up somehow.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.080
And it would turn into a cot
with a tent over it and some

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.800
doors and windows and
off the ground.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.480
I tried to design this thing.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.670
I have the spatial ability
of a newt.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.100
So I thought, well, who
knows how to do this?

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.160
You see, film producers
actually don't

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.550
know how to do anything.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.450
All we know how to do is
hire people who know

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.000
vastly better than us.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.060
So I went to Pasadena Art Center
College of Design.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.660
I went to Dean [? Korshek ?]

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.990
and I said, have you ever done
like a nonprofit design pro--

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.760
No, we haven't.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.100
And I said, well, couldn't
we have a prize?

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.840
I'll put up a little
bit of prize money.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.520
He said, what you want
to call this thing?

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.190
Because I described it.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.930
And I said, I don't know.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.220
We can call it whatever
you like.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.580
Anyway, by the end of the
meeting we had decided it was

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.070
called an EDAR.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:54.540
E-D-A-R. Because everyone
deserves a roof.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.240
So we had the competition.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.840
I'd been working with Eric
Lindeman and Jason Zasa, who

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.680
were in the competition.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.300
Ever since, we got a
fabrication house.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.310
We built, I think, 50
in the first batch.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.340
We gave them away on Skid Row.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.070
We got the Rand Institute
to do an efficacy study.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.680
And we're up to-- this
is only in the

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.140
last, say, three years--

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.190
we're up to about 300 people
who sleep in them now every

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:24.740
night in greater Los Angeles.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.160
I like to say, on a scale of 10,
if 10 is an apartment with

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.980
a nice warm bed and if
zero is a cardboard

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.750
box on a rainy night--

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.360
so we're a five.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.890
It's nowhere near as good
as the apartment.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.690
But it's one helluva lot better
than the cardboard box.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:48.060
And three weeks ago, end
of last year, we

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.510
got the patent issued.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.760
So we actually now are patent
holders, which is great

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.230
because it means that we can
hopefully sell them to other

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.500
for-profit entities.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.200
And then we can take the money
and give them, obviously, for

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.870
free to yet more homeless
people.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:11.520
So I had this really happy life
until April of last year.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.980
I made my films.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.170
I raised my family.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.520
And I did Starlight and
Starbright and First Star and

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.100
EDAR very happily.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.070
I thought, I'll do this another
10, 15 years and then

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.410
I'll hang it up and I'll read
the "New York Times."

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.890
At which point I got a phone
call from USC, from the

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.410
chairman of film, a man
called Michael Taylor.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.050
And he said, come have
some lunch with me.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.380
So we had some lunch, which led
to more meetings with him,

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.630
which led to meeting the dean.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.530
And by the end of all of this,
we had decided that there was

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.770
no good reason why there would
not be, and every good reason

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.930
why there should be, a new
institute at USC, within the

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.110
film school, which we have
called the Media Institute for

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.820
Social Change.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.400
And faced with running this
thing as part of a team--

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.280
I'm the managing director--

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.470
I had to make a decision
whether I was going to

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.320
continue to produce
films or was I

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.470
actually going to do this.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.680
And I decided that the
opportunity was so enormous

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.130
that, really, I have to do it.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.630
So the Media Institute
for Social

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.740
Change has five programs.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.800
And I suppose at its core it's
why I'm standing here in front

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.600
of you in the revenge of
the nerds of Google.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.130
So the first thing is, we are
already teaching, and we want

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:42.350
to teach much more, media
for social change.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.540
What is it?

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.190
How do you do it?

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:49.530
How do you audiovisually create
a moment of empathy?

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.200
And while the person, the
audience member, is moved in

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.500
their heart, how do you give
them an action point so that

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.990
they will vote, donate,
volunteer, recycle, whatever

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.070
it is that you want
them to do?

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.810
Absolutely chip away,
raise awareness,

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.450
it's not without value.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.650
But really the highest value
is you want people to do

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.950
something that they weren't
previously doing or weren't

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.120
doing enough.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.050
So we're teaching it.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.660
We're teaching undergraduate
courses.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.490
Were teaching graduate
courses.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:23.840
And as we raise more money
we will do more and

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.500
more and more courses.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.270
The goal is to send forth
a legion, a battalion of

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.430
prosocial media makers into
the world as we graduate

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.330
students who with all, for some
of them, or with part of

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.560
their time will affirmatively
struggle to make, using their

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.420
audiovisual skills that they've
learned, the world

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.300
into a better place.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.000
The timing is particularly
fortunate.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.660
Number one, you may have noticed
there are quite a lot

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.600
of problems in the world.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.770
Some of them are intractable.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:02.040
Some of them are susceptible
to study, to science.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.220
Others require a massive
change of thought.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.440
They require people to think
differently and to prioritize

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.480
differently.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.550
You can try and do that
at the point of a gun.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.250
You can try and do it by

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.370
persuading people with science.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:24.300
But really, really, the way
that people are moved is

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.470
emotionally.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.100
And you don't do that--

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.250
you can scare the hell out
of them with a gun.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:33.780
But you are unlikely to affect
a lifelong change when you're

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.060
no longer pointing the gun.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:41.250
The camera is a lot more
powerful in this business of

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.270
changing hearts and minds than
either a gun or logical

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.650
persuasion.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.400
Because what we are doing is
creating a moment of emotion.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.270
We are then suggesting, after
all due research, an action

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:58.770
step, and we are inviting people
to join the cause.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.070
Now, who is our audience?

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.090
This is where it gets
really exciting.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.630
Who is the Google audience and
who is the audience for motion

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.220
picture, television, interactive
video games, both

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.090
in a box and massive
multiplayer, and all the

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:12.820
online stuff?

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.050
We take a very broad view
of what media may be.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.540
It's all of those things.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.130
It's documentary, it's fiction,
it's long form, it's

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:21.890
short form.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.070
We're kind of platform agnostic
because God knows the

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.260
platform changes every
10 minutes.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.410
Who is the audience?

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:34.000
Well increasingly, the rising
wedge is Gen Y. What do we

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.020
know about Generation Y-- young
people aged currently

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.730
between, say, 15 and
the late 20s?

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.000
The answer is it's the most
prosocial generation of young

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.610
Americans since 1937.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:53.300
They are more volunteering, more
donating, than either of

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.650
the two prior generations
of young Americans--

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.610
their parents' generation,
their grandparents'

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.420
generation.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.850
You actually have to go back
to the Great Depression to

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.490
find another generation that
really said, oh, dear.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.700
This world is really fragile.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.370
I'd better do something
about it.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:13.790
I better do my bit.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.920
I better pay something
back in.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.080
I can't just take and
take and take.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.160
I need to exert myself and make
my world a better place.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.410
We're all in this
thing together.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.000
Then they had the Second World
War, where a lot of young

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.610
people fought and saw
terrible sights.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.960
And they came back and that
generation have been

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.660
incredibly philanthropic
ever since.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.880
The present generation, Gen Y,
is more philanthropic, more

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.670
caring even than them, when
measured by volunteering.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.210
The interesting thing is--

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.410
young people start volunteering
in high school

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.940
because you can't go to
college without it.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.090
You need to put it on
your on your resume.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.060
But the interesting thing is,
even when they get into

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.140
college and after college, they
carry on volunteering

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.340
because they realize, hey, that
made me feel really good.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.580
So our audience--

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.720
we do not have to teach them
that the world is a fragile

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.560
place and that everyone needs
to help to make it better.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:18.120
We also do not need to teach
young people to pick up any

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.450
kind of a video camera or their
PDA with a video camera

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.780
in it and point it.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.380
They even sometimes
know how to edit.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:31.100
What we do have to do is to
teach them to be excellent

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.240
storytellers.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.410
We have to go back to that
basic equation--

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:39.730
audiovisually create empathy
and then couple it with the

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:40.900
action step.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.840
Now the action step is easier
said than done.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.640
The first thing is
don't be evil.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.610
Do no harm.

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.250
Very much aware of where
I'm standing and

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.210
what's written on the--

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.000
I actually didn't see
it on this trip.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.900
I don't know which wall it's
written on, the don't be evil.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.030
But I salute that.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.410
The first thing you have to do
if you want to be prosocial

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.720
media maker is you'd better do a
bit of research and work out

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.690
what the truth is.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.970
You have to validate what it is
you're persuading people to

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.900
do because God forbid that you
would have them do something

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.750
that would make things worse.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.070
You can't make a film about
autism without understanding

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.260
something, a lot,
about autism.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.949
Because it's the bully pulpit.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.510
People will think you must be an
expert because you made the

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.530
film, or you made
the webisode, or

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.810
whatever it may be.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.360
So don't be evil.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.719
Do your research.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.940
So one component of what we're
teaching undergraduate and

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.190
grad students is how to get your
issue right, where to go

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.440
and find the experts.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.010
This is where it's brilliant
being on a college campus

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.370
because we've got
all the experts.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:44.780
Walk 300 yards and there's an
expert in whatever it may be.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.150
So mission one, already
underway, is teach

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.760
undergraduate and grad students
how to be excellent,

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.690
motivated, proficient prosocial
media makers.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:00.250
It's that Venn diagram between
media generation and make the

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:01.200
world a better place.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.540
It's the lozenge in the middle
that we're teaching.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.400
The second thing, and this is
why I'm banging around raising

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.370
money at the moment, is we
want to do scholarships.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:16.010
We think that media is the
great transformer.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.950
It is the great leap from the
way things are to the

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.610
way they can be.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:26.090
So what we want to start
doing, increasingly, is

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.580
offering scholarships and other
student support where

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.570
basically we're saying to
underprivileged kids-- whether

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.550
they're inner city, whether
they are from the Native

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:40.650
American Navajo reservation,
wherever they may be where

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.660
things are not right, things are
not just, things are not

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.700
good enough, there is poverty,
there is deprivation, there is

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.400
inadequate opportunity.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.300
We're saying to them, OK.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.850
Come to USC.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.830
We will put you through
these courses.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:59.780
You will come out at the other
end as a proficient,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.220
prosocial, qualified,
trained media maker.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.700
And your part of the bargain,
the grand bargain, is that you

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.270
need to go back where
you come from--

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.720
perhaps not with
all your time.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.580
You go have a bang-up
commercial career.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.595
But with a significant
proportion of your caring and

00:36:17.595 --> 00:36:21.010
your time, you need to know that
you have an affirmative

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:25.520
moral obligation to make your
people have better lives.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.680
Go back where you came from,
a little bit like Teach for

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.540
America, and lift up
your community.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.410
So that's the second thing,
is student support.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.050
The third thing is everything
you can imagine that an

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.060
institute should do--

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.410
and that other institutes,
but not on this

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:46.190
subject, in fact do.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.320
What is the history of
prosocial media?

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.980
First of all, what is
prosocial media?

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.220
Lenny Riefenstahl, excellent
documentarian--

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.950
clearly not prosocial, made her
films entirely for Hitler.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.050
I don't think we would say
she was prosocial.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:01.730
What about Michael Moore?

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.080
Michael Moore makes films that
a lot of us agree with.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.410
But he never puts the other
side of the argument in.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.790
Do you need to do that or don't
you need to do that?

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.680
What is fair in the context?

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.150
Where is the line between
polemic, or political, and

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.930
truth in media?

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.130
What is your obligation?

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.830
Do you have one?

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.010
I'm not suggesting any
answers to that.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.230
But it is an issue that needs
to be endlessly debated.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.900
And you may have noticed that
universities are good at

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.020
debating things.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.520
It's something that has to be
front of mind when you, in

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.930
this case, don't put pen to
paper but put recording media

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.810
into camera.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.430
So, the history.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:46.450
Another whole area with this
huge and largely untapped is,

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:48.130
what is efficacy?

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:52.050
If it doesn't work, why do we
waste time, treasure, and

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.610
caring to do it?

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.190
When does it work?

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.560
There's all sorts of anecdotal
evidence that things work.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.180
And sometimes it's
been measured.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.670
We know that when the Felicity
Huffman character in the

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.190
prime-time soap "Desperate
Housewives--" that they gave

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.730
her breast cancer
in the story.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:16.420
And we know that mammograms in
America rose 30% in the month

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.720
following that first
broadcast.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.450
And we know that if you run
those numbers out, several or

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:26.260
many thousands of American women
did not die of breast

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.630
cancer because of early
diagnosis, which they got

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.430
because they were watching,
quote unquote, "a silly soap

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.790
opera," which is what reminded
them they needed

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.230
to go and get tested.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.860
So we know that these
examples exist.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.330
I would suggest to you there are
other examples where they

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:43.280
didn't move the needle at all.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:49.030
"Kony 2012--" so you can
quibble with content.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:52.240
Kony, at the time the film came
out in April last year,

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.450
hadn't actually been in Uganda
for three years.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.750
So what were we really
advocating?

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.620
That the Ugandan army should go
to a different country to

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.830
capture him?

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:02.440
Not sure.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.970
Furthermore, the Ugandan army
itself has child soldiers.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.930
So were we really advocating
that one lot of child soldiers

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.250
should go and catch and
liberate another

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:12.450
lot of child soldiers?

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.440
Not sure.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.950
You can quibble about content.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.680
But even if you just assume
that it was completely

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.010
accurate, what good did it do?

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:23.920
Is there actually one child
soldier in East Africa who

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.300
isn't a child soldier today
as a result of the most

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.400
successful viral video in the
history of the world--

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.240
100 million hits
in eight days?

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.420
Enormous success.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.080
I said to the managing
director or executive

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.470
director-- whatever he is--

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:44.780
of the organization that made it
that regardless of what he

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.400
did for Africa, I felt that his
gift to the world was that

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.790
he said to young videographers,
young

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:56.130
filmmakers, you know, you
actually could aspire to 100

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.430
million views for your video.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.600
And that might be.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.180
If you get it right, if you do
your research, if you do it

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.690
empathetically, you actually
could change the world.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.100
So I think that the great gift
of Invisible Children and of

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.810
"Kony 2012" is perhaps nothing
to do with Africa.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.360
It has to do with what I'm
talking about, which is that a

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.990
camera is more powerful
than a sword or a gun.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.350
But we need to get it right.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.360
And we need to do more
prosocial media.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.450
The other stuff that
institutes do are

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:31.420
seminars and colloquia.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:36.410
Our fourth thing that we're
doing is to really try to

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.860
introduce causes that
could use a little

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.400
help to media makers--

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.650
whether they're students
or professionals--

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.660
who could give them that help.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.920
There are too many secret causes
for good where, simply,

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.470
they don't know--

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:56.840
nobody out there knows what
the orphan cause may be.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:02.470
So that has to do with
introducing the foundation

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.250
that is trying to find a cure
for a disease to the show

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.430
runner of a television series
which could feature them,

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:12.170
which would then drive people
through the end credits or the

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.236
website of the--

00:41:14.236 --> 00:41:19.620
I did a thing last night for
Starlight where we approached

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.750
"The Bachelor." And you would
think that the ABC show "The

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.250
Bachelor--" not very
philanthropic.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:26.510
They actually said, oh, God.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.400
We would love to feature
Starlight.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.510
We've had a deluge, this
morning, of support and tweets

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.480
and so forth.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.120
Because last night two of
Starlight's special kids went

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.000
with on a date to
Magic Mountain.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.850
And they were on "The
Bachelor." And

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.600
it got great ratings.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.040
We can laugh about it.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.100
And we can say, well wouldn't
it be better to raise money

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.050
from foundations that give
to causes that support

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:55.950
seriously ill kids?

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:56.810
Yes, absolutely.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:57.940
We do all of that too.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.150
But actually, "The Bachelor" got
seen by, what, 1,000 times

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.250
more people than we would
otherwise be able to approach

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.380
in any given month?

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.190
It's a lot.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.270
It's powerful.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.010
It's the megaphone.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.520
So then the last thing that
we're working on, and we

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.720
haven't done it yet, is we want
to do a media awards.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.760
We think that in the run up to
the Academy Awards-- which, as

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.150
you well know, they're
next month.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.130
Every year they're
in February.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.540
And there are all those
other awards shows on

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.210
the way to the Oscars.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.050
There's the Golden Globes and
the National Board of Review

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.380
and all the rest of it.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.910
We think that there should
be the prosocial awards.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:42.000
We think that a university is
who should sponsor it, with

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.230
corporate help.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.210
In the end, maybe not
year one, we think

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.570
it should be televised.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.530
And we're talking about
the same categories.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.560
We're first of all talking
about motion picture,

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.910
television, interactive,
and online.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:58.430
And secondly, we're talking
about actor, actress, creative

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.730
team, production team, maybe
lifetime achievement, maybe a

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.270
corporate award.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:09.640
But everything measured
rigorously by prosocial intent

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.220
and prosocial efficacy.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.740
So we're pulling that together
at the moment.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.900
My life has completely been
turned upside down.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.210
I was a film producer.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:26.700
I'm now a recovering
film producer.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.580
I'm the managing director
of the Media Institute.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.300
I consider that I'm honored
and privileged, really, to

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.290
have been given this great
big bully pulpit of USC.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.030
USC is absolutely the
place to do this.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.210
One of the reasons why I'm
standing here is that

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:48.470
Stanford, by act of God,
has no film school.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.920
If it did, none of you would
be here because you would

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.510
already be involved somehow with
them if you cared about

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:55.980
these issues.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:01.250
The USC film school is either
coequally the best or the best

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.050
film school in the world.

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:06.750
It is certainly, indubitably,
the one that is the most

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.030
related to Hollywood.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:12.740
And our graduates are
everywhere, across the

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.240
broadest possible span of
professional, motion picture,

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.830
television, interactive, video
games, online, and all the

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:22.100
rest of it.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.320
The reason why I've thrown
over what was, as my wife

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.710
points out, a lot--

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.990
a really viable career--

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.600
and that I'm doing this is
it's the first time in my

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:39.410
whole life that someone has
enabled me to do, in one room,

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:43.120
at one time, the things
that I care about.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.100
I care about young people and
their future in the world.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.370
I care about media
and its power.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.880
And I care about making the
world a better place.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.240
For the very first time,
these things have

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.830
been brought together.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:01.690
I got a taste of it when Jeff
Skoll asked me to go on the

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:05.870
original three-person board
of Participant Media.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:09.670
And Jeff has made an enormous
success of that company.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.800
He has not only made the world
a better place, but he has

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.800
done it in the context of
actually earning money and

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.230
breaking even and doing
better than that.

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:21.020
So there is evidence
that this works.

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:25.270
I remember early in the life
of that company, sitting in

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:30.030
front of a major studio
president who said, I know you

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.090
are in good faith.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:35.910
Let me explain the motion
picture industry to you.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.740
People have miserable
little lives.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.380
They are largely unhappy.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:47.350
They go to a multiplex, and they
pay $12 or so to sit in

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.460
the dark for two hours.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.460
And we make them happy.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.890
And when they come out after
two hours, they go back to

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.630
their miserable, shitty lives.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.500
And we have their money.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.300
That is the motion
picture industry.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:08.590
And I said, what about
catharsis, Aristotle's

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.100
poetics, Shakespeare's
tragedy.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.090
He says, yeah.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.240
But not now.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.420
Motion pictures are an
escapist medium.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:20.190
No one will ever go to see
something with a message.

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.500
I believed then that
he was wrong.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.000
It was easier to believe it then
because Jeff Skoll had

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.140
the staying power to prove
that it was wrong.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.380
I do believe that we can teach
a legion of young people.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.390
Think of the leverage.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:38.610
If we turn out 200, 300,
400 students a year.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:43.730
If they each go off and in their
career make 100 or 1,000

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:50.425
pieces of output, and if each of
those is seen by 100,000 or

00:46:50.425 --> 00:46:54.810
a million or 10 or 100 million
people, this is an enormously

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.260
powerful initiative.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:02.990
So we'll go to a Q and A.
I hope I haven't bent

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.080
your ear too long.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.430
I'm watching the clock.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:11.320
My life at the moment is
passionately believing that we

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.970
can do something incredibly
important here with MISC, the

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.120
Media Institute for
Social Change.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.990
I do believe that here at
Google, there are people who

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:29.190
have personally taken part in
transformation or change.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:32.540
I would immodestly say to you
that the difference between

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.800
Google's effect on the world--

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.760
which has been radical,
dramatic, a multiplier, and

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.630
for the good--

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.640
and what we are doing in MISC
is as just started.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.570
And Google's been doing
it longer and

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.530
in a different direction.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.610
But I believe that in the end
of the end, there will be

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.890
these media institutes in film
schools around the world.

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:58.650
We will welcome them
copying us.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.850
I think we are inventing and
others will emulate.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.860
The world is a fractured
and broken place.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.410
But winning hearts and minds
is how we defeat

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.560
the sense of otherness.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.390
It is how we draw
people together

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:17.580
to find common solutions.

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:21.630
It is how we affect leadership
and compromise.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:25.290
That is what we are trying
to do with cameras

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.940
of one kind or another.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.530
I'm very grateful for your time
in listening to this.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:36.700
And I hope that there
may be some way--

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.660
I brought a pocket full
of business cards.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.740
You, especially those of you who
have participated in one

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.990
of the world's greatest IPOs--

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.810
should you believe that the
multiplier of media deserves a

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:53.300
bit of help and support,
I'm your man.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:57.450
If you have ideas on course
work, on partnership

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:00.110
opportunities, whatever,
I would love to

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.050
discuss them also.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.300
I'm coming back up
on February 15.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:10.360
I've actually been asked to show
my film, "Revenge of the

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.580
Nerds," at The Hub.

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:17.580
I'm incredibly trepidatious
because A, I haven't seen it

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.850
for 20 years.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:22.240
B, I do know that when we made
it in the mid-'80s, the

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.200
computers were the
size of a bus.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.760
I think it was before Kaypro
and Osborne, which was my

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.940
introduction to personal
computers.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.560
So God knows what is in it.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.670
I don't even know if
it's funny anymore.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.520
But we're going to show the film
at The Hub the evening of

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.970
February 15.

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.170
And then I'm going to be that
back up the week of March 5.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.550
We are very eager to work with,
quote unquote, "Silicon

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:50.520
Valley." You guys
need content.

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:54.550
You've got the hardware
and the software.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:59.540
In the area of content, I think
we can try and create

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.290
that Venn diagram of what does
good as well as what is

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.260
commercial.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:06.800
We can do what is noble and
honorable as well as what

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.140
makes a buck.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.800
So thank you very much.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.900
And if there are any questions,
there's a

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.680
microphone over there.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.050
And I'm sure I don't know
any of the answers.

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.040
But we can punt.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.310
AUDIENCE: As I sit here, I'm
just entranced with what

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.000
you've said.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.350
And I have a lot of questions.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.790
But the first one is, if you
were to construct a list of

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:29.080
the top three things that you
would want from a group like

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:32.260
this, what would those be?

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.340
What are you looking for?

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.320
PETER SAMUELSON: One--

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.350
and I'll just be transparent
and honest--

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:41.970
one, we are eight months
into our institute.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.100
We need money.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.820
Because the more money, the more
scholarships, the more

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:49.480
programs, the more research,
and so forth, which then

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.850
self-replicate.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.710
So we are, in my view, still
priming the pump.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:58.960
And the currency of acceleration
is money, like

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.340
most other things.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.880
Secondly, partnership.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:07.080
I'm particularly interested in
understanding how technology

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.480
can make the world a better
place when you

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.550
add into the trifecta--

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:16.100
technology, make the world a
better place, and content.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:21.030
How do we technologically move
hearts and minds by placing

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:26.070
content within the technology
that has that aspiration?

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:29.840
And then, also, I believe that
measurement is something that

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.710
a lot of people here
are very good at.

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:35.950
And I think we're not
necessarily good at

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.470
measurement yet.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:41.690
Psychologists measure all
sorts of human behavior.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.700
Not a lot of that has crossed
the street into the area of

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.640
prosocial media to try to
understand whether we are

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.800
being efficacious.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.160
A film like "The Blind Side--"
Sandy Bullock took a minuscule

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.910
fee, took a year of her life,
and made that film.

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.550
Did it to move the needle--

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.490
I'm not saying it did
or it didn't--

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:05.430
in race relations and in
understanding the challenges

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:06.780
of kids in the inner city?

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.440
What did it cost?

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.990
And what was its value
to the world?

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.310
And I don't mean
to pick on it.

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.970
It was a fine film.

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:14.810
I think we need to measure
this stuff.

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:20.270
And another thing that may be
possible is the Venn diagram

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:24.160
where technology and measurement
overlap.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.550
AUDIENCE: Just to follow on
that and I'll sit down.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:31.260
When you say partnership, is
it the big world of working

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.650
with technology developers to
try and create something

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:36.200
that's in your head?

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:41.720
Or is it more of an ongoing, how
do you disseminate some of

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.880
the ideas and finding a platform
by which it can get

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.710
out faster?

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.310
Or is it both?

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:49.170
PETER SAMUELSON: I
think it's both.

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:52.370
And if I knew exactly what it
was, I wouldn't be standing

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.860
here being deliberately
a little vague.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.030
I do believe that we have many
opportunities to take what we

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:04.060
know about content and what
you, for one, know about

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.710
technology and also about
the community up here.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:13.300
And the real excitement is
to say, here we are.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.560
Here is the effect we
would like to have.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:20.480
What are the technological,
financial, pedagogic, and

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.680
educational, generally,
things we can do with

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.410
technology-enabled media that
would actually shift that

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.970
needle and make the
world better?

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:33.230
Give you one example--

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:36.290
so , politics you may have
noticed, is completely screwed

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:37.900
up in the United States because

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.450
there's no middle anymore.

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:42.650
Everything I've ever led, what
the leader is supposed to do

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.230
is to find the middle.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:47.190
Everything worth doing, you
can't please everybody but you

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:50.160
find most common ground
in the middle.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.300
Well, people hate each other
now in Washington.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.520
They won't even sit next
to each other.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.700
How can we use media to
find that middle?

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.540
How can we help democracy
to flourish and

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:04.950
thrive using content?

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:09.770
And what is technology's place
as a partner in doing that?

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:10.170
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:12.250
Thank you very much.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.750
PETER SAMUELSON: I want to say
thank you to everybody for

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.180
your time and caring a little
bit about this.

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.760
I'm going to take an enormous
stack of business cards, and

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.820
I'm going to put them
on that podium and

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.800
keep a few in my pocket.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.500
If you would like to discuss
this further, one-on-one, I'd

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.610
be honored.

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:34.900
And, as I said, I'm back up here
for a couple of days that

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.690
include the day after
Valentine's Day.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.680
I have to be in LA for
Valentine's Day.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.180
But the next day, the 15th,
I will be back up here.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:46.730
And if you'd like to sit down,
have a cup of coffee, and talk

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:50.495
about this further, you are the
revenge of the nerds and

00:54:50.495 --> 00:54:51.550
I'd be honored to do that.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:52.800
Thank you.
