00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.755
Now we were discussing encoding, which is the first step in our ability to move

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:08.922
information from our short term to our long term memory. Now the second stage

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:14.280
in long term memory formation is consolidation. And consolidation is the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.026
process of establishing, stabilizing or solidifying a memory. If you'll recall

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:23.590
from our lesson on consciousness, you'll remember that sleep is essential for

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.132
our ability to consolidate our memories. In fact, sleep deprivation can

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:31.809
negatively affect our ability to remember. So as we stressed in the

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.226
consciousness lesson, it's important that we get the required amount of sleep,

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:38.199
so that we can consolidate our memories.
