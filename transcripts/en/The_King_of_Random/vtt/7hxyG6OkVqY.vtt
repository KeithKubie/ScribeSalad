00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.750
In today's video

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.520
We're going to be taking a look at how we built a propane based flamethrower that mounts to your arm and uses

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.650
electricity as an igniter

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.440
a

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.820
Few months ago grant told me about a video from a youtuber named

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.639
Darius of all where he made this whole big cool contraption that used propane and this whole

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.589
Tornado device he built to make a gun that shot like a tornado of spinning fire

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.889
It was a really really cool build and grant had the idea to try and build something similar but smaller that all fit on one

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.950
Arm, so if you like this type of build go check out his channel

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.509
He's got some really cool stuff and Jerry's of all, I promise I wasn't trying to steal your designs

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.600
We just happened to have a lot of the same and similar ideas

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.610
So there's some overlap but your super hero double flamethrower build not the same very cool

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:51.329
however

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.669
I'm now just going to show how I came about building this one and finishing it up to make it into a really cool

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.179
Fully functional flamethrower arm this is gonna be three parts today

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.829
We're gonna look at the build of the mechanics how I came about with the design that I have then in the next video

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.769
We'll look at fine-tuning and placing the parts in the right spot

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.189
And then finally, we'll look at making and decorating the housing for the unit

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.939
And of course if you haven't seen it already go check out our video where we test this thing out

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.349
But for today, we'll take a look at how to start putting things together. Let's get started

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.439
Here's what we're going for propane will flow down through a series of valves and tubes through a solenoid and out a nozzle

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.029
Will be ignited by the strong electric shock of being emitted from a Taser

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.830
We are trying to use propane as the fuel but what we want to do is get the propane out of this in a way

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.419
That we can burn it and not just like a little lighter style flame. We want like a flamethrower

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.519
Maybe not the same liquid stream that we get with the backpack flamethrower grant built

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.610
But something that really shoots out gets a flame at high speeds

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.129
So this hose this is designed to work

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.449
with these things and generally what you do is you attach it and then you have like a

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.890
Blowtorch or something like that that goes on the other end. It's good for a lot of different types of tools

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.679
let's take a look at how this normally works the nozzle for the propane tank has a little pin down inside that hole and you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.850
May not be able to see it super well

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.419
But to get the propane out that pin has to be pressed this nozzle that fits on threads over has a rubber seal in it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.030
that matches down right onto the bottle and so it doesn't leak anywhere and then there's a knob to control the flow coming out of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.200
It currently it sets off

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.810
I can thread my propane tank on now at this point if I turn the nozzle propane will actually fill the hose, but the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.090
Has another pin on the other side as a safety mechanism, so you aren't just venting propane into the air

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.579
So first step is I'm just gonna cut this end off of the hose now that I've disabled the valve

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.590
I'm gonna do something that's not very safe. And I'm just gonna show you that there is a propane flowing out of here

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.129
By blowing it right onto an open flame

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.299
You can see that propane lights on fire

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.969
we can see that propane is now flowing out this tube and we actually gonna want propane liquid not propane gas and the key to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.100
That is basically turning this upside down but we've got so much tube that has some heat in it that it just keeps

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.769
Evaporating the propane so it still comes out as gas

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.520
What we need to do is modify the valve itself so that we have a much higher volume

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.170
Propane definite now that way even if it passes through some tube will still get liquid spring

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.730
So now we have a valve that just opens directly and it's just putting propane out immediately

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.450
and at this point I think if I turn upside down we can actually see some of the liquid propane and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.460
That is what we want

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.260
More of this is dumping out just a little bit of propane at a time and we want a lot

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.719
Like a lot of propane so we're gonna take the direct route and we are just going to drill a hole

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.720
Straight through from one side out the other

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.120
We've now got a hole that goes right through this valve

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.950
Which would allow for just a massive amount of propane to be dumped out all at once. However

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.550
because of the way we've just

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.790
Modified this pin it no longer will come in contact with the pin inside the propane container

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.869
So there is another bit of modification we need to do and that's to add a cross piece

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.470
that goes from one side of this little pin to the other that's thin enough to still allow lots of propane through but is in

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.920
The middle so it will still hit that pin inside the propane cylinder

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.899
We've got our pin and we use two hacksaw to just cut a little notch down into it

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.049
This is a little scrap of copper pipe

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.429
We're gonna do is just cut a small piece off of this pipe that can fit down into that notch

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.799
And we're then going to solder it in place

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.549
We've got our little snippet of copper and it fits nicely into the notch that we've cut in the brass

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.130
We have maybe a little more than we need. So we'll try and cut that down a bit. So we have less extra

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.100
This basic design this using a piece of copper shim to plug up the drilled out valve

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.279
This is one of the things that I got from the Jarius of all channel now applying some flux. This is flux

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.559
that is normally meant for soldering copper pipes together and the two do not

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.540
Solder together quite as nicely as just copper and copper but I have had success

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.020
Melding these together with some solder

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.530
So there's a flux applied onto there the copper fit into place

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.290
And we've got our solder we're gonna try and heat this up to the point that it is nice and hot and add the solder

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.819
Onto the sides hopefully bonding that together without filling the inside channel too much

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.630
We got that little copper piece soldered on now. We want to clean it up using a file

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.630
So it's flush with the rest of the pin

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.270
While we're in modifying things

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.490
We also want to take off this knob and solder the peg on to the rest of the hardware the way that we've drilled things

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.080
Out can make it. So a little bit of gas can escape out that direction. We want to plug that hole up

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.880
So what we have is a little valve that automatically starts dumping propane as soon as it's attached to a cylinder

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.450
Now we're not trying to light the propane right as it comes out of our propane cylinder we want to direct it

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.019
So to do that we need to attach some kind of hose onto the end of this valve

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.120
Connecting into the back of this valve that we've created

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.700
we've got a

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.200
One-eighth inch - barb piece of hardware and this fits in pretty snug but we do want to make sure that no gas is leaking

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.309
Out so we got to use some thread tape fortunately. These small pieces often have tapered threads

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.209
So that even with the thicker thread tape, it'll go on pretty well. We do want it on there really nice and tight

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.200
It's got a stopped propane gas from leaking

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.469
The advantage of the barbed end is we can now add hose onto it and control how far it goes

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.749
We've got all this hose from the extender that we cut the valve off of earlier. That should fit onto this barb

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.010
There we go nice and snug

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.840
Now for the other end

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.580
I've got a piece that's a Barb and another barb on one side and this I'm kinda just gonna be using as a valve

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.650
So that is a good thing. We've got propane that sprays out the nozzle

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.379
We just have a very hard time controlling it so far

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.979
What we need is something that lets us turn the gas on and off

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.680
This is a 12-volt solenoid and here we have eight

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.439
One-and-a-half volt battery is giving us a total of 12 volts

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.600
So we should be able to connect the wires on the battery pack to the solenoid and have it open

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.389
The battery pack has a switch turn that on

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:05.070
And here that that is something inside the solenoid popping open when the solenoid is connected a small

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.770
Electromagnet pulls a small plunger against a small spring lots of small things going on at once and what it does

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.449
Is it move that plunger away from a seal so that when it's connected you can kind of even see it moving in there

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.559
We need to get the fuel from this nozzle into this nozzle to do that

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.650
We're going to use a series of more of these little brass fittings

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.100
first a threaded adapter

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.490
Then one that reduces down to a barb so it's kind of going to be mirror imaged and we're gonna be using this little barb

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.710
Because it perfectly fits onto the hose that came with the nozzle in the first place. We've got extra hose

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.600
We know it's designed for carrying propane

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.730
So we've already threaded that in let's add some more threads attach that to our solenoid and then the exact same thing on the other

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.460
side

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.699
Attach the hose on one barbed end

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.829
Feed that down to the solenoid following our arrow. This is the in

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.120
side and

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.770
Now in theory the solenoid is acting as a valve that will stop the propane from going out when we attach it to the tank

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.840
It's attached to the tank

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.520
I don't hear or smell any propane leaking out

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.320
Let's attach this to our battery pack and see if it suddenly lets out a burst of propane

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.010
Boom yes

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.160
Quite a bit. In fact, it seems

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.070
Alright one more thing. We're just gonna try turning this upside down and see what kind of spray we get. Oh

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:35.520
That is a lot of fuel dump it out at once we have propane spraying ethanol that's a little close to the solenoid

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.739
We're probably gonna want to add more hose on the front of that. So we have some control beyond the solenoid itself

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.479
Same thing when we open the valve all of our propane will blast out that little spot right there

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.340
The basic mechanics for how we're gonna get propane out of our tank is working now

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.979
What we need to do is light the propane we need a way to reliably ignite the spray as it's coming out of the nozzle

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.309
This is a personal defence taser

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.980
What we're gonna try and do is take this taser apart carefully

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.330
And what we want to do is take the leads out of the Taser and connect to the wires

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.280
That are currently connected to those leads. Well then use those wires to reroute somewhere else

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.519
So we don't have to have the teaser itself up inside the Jetta propane

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.549
But we'll be able to direct that arc right where we want it

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.860
All right, there's some extensions to my leads. And the other thing that I want to extend is the switch

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.890
I want to be able to activate this not at the Taser itself wherever that ends up in my arm, but in my hand

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.449
So now I need to connect to here and here everything else will just stay the same

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.140
All of the circuitry will work even the lights should end up still working

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:53.549
At this point we've redirected the leads of the Taser out front I've got some exposed wire

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.139
They're pretty close together. So it should be easy to arc and this right here should be the switch currently

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:03.989
It's set to OFF. So this isn't gonna do anything but once I set it on connecting these two wires should activate the Taser

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:06.029
Let's give this a test

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.189
little nervous

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.709
Hey, that's exactly what we want to see

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:20.429
Beautiful now we have electricity that should be intense enough to ignite some propane and I want to test that give it a shot

00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:27.269
Yeah

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.959
That is that a result I'm hoping for and I'm calling that a successful proof-of-concept

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.440
We did not want to leave the flamethrower mounted to a chair using duct tape, obviously

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.300
So what we wanted to do was build a frame that would hold it all using some aluminum slats

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.279
Some rivets a couple of nylon washers and a little bit of webbing

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:52.559
This is what we came up with now

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.899
I haven't done the entire how-to exact step-by-step because this was very much

00:10:58.329 --> 00:11:01.949
Just sort of figured out on the fly with a lot of trial and error

00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:05.249
But we can show you the basics of how it was done and it's super simple

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:11.760
We've got one larger piece of the bar. This is our inch and a half wide bar. We've got a piece that I curved

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.700
I literally just bent this on the bench vise at this end

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.609
I drill the hole through this slat and this slat and I just used you. There's four nylon washers

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.339
Propane tank and strapped to this side right here

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:24.190
a

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.489
Handle can be added right here with

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:33.569
controls for what the electricity and the propane and this little plate is just something I added on as a place to attach our

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:39.329
Stun gun, so that's just gonna go right there. Then you can see I've got some straps there very very basic

00:11:39.329 --> 00:11:44.849
They've got this one little knurled edge you fit the strap through here and it grips on they can't pull back

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.870
Against it unless you pop this back the idea. Is that it fits on about like this

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.029
Straps are holding on I can bend my arm

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:55.679
I don't even have to hold on to the handle stays attached mobility is decent not perfect

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.449
It does restrict my movement a little bit

00:11:57.449 --> 00:12:00.359
But for the most part it holds on and I can bend my arm. I can move my arm

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.760
I can aim wherever I want. That's the goal

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.360
So things are coming along nicely

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:10.349
But we've still got a ways to go check back tomorrow to see how we finish up the insides and go check out the test

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.829
Video if you haven't already

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:12.930
Hey guys. Thanks for watching

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.079
