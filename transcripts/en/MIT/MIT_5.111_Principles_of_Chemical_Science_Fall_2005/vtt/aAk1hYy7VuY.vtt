00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.155
We were talking about factors
affecting the rates of reaction.

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:26.000
And so we have gone through a
number of these.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.021
We talked last class about the
affect of temperature.

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:39.352
We talked about mechanism last
Wednesday, we talked about

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:43.373
nature of material and
concentrations in the lectures

00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:46.776
preceding that,
and now we are up to the last

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:49.714
thing that we had on our
original list,

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:53.272
which are catalysts.
Today we are going to talk

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:56.210
about catalysis.
This is on the lecture

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.000
summaries that will arrive for
you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.897
A catalyst is a substance that
takes part in the reaction but

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:09.469
is not consumed in the reaction.
It is a bystander of the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.836
reaction.
It will speed it up,

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:16.000
but it does not undergo any
permanent change itself.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.938
That is the definition of a
catalyst.

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:23.346
Catalysts, because they are not
changing in their form,

00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:28.000
are not part of an overall
balanced equation.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.256
Sometimes you will see a
balanced equation and a thing

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:35.308
over the arrow,
which will indicate the

00:01:35.308 --> 00:01:38.601
conditions in which the reaction
was done.

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:43.259
And often information about a
catalyst that was used in the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.917
reaction will be present there.
What are catalysts actually

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.647
doing?
Here is the potential energy

00:01:50.647 --> 00:01:53.458
diagram that we looked at last
time.

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:59.000
And in this diagram you have
some energy for reactants.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.488
Energy for products down here.
There is an overall change,

00:02:03.488 --> 00:02:07.188
delta E, between the reactants
and the products.

00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:10.811
And, again, delta E is very
similar to delta H.

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:15.220
It is only 1% or 2% off for
gases and almost the same for

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.842
liquids and solids.
It is information about the

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.755
thermodynamics.
This is a calorimetry,

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:26.244
a thermodynamic measurement.
And then we saw that there is

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:31.168
an activation energy.
This is at Ea for the forward

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:35.803
reaction that the molecules need
to overcome, a critical energy

00:02:35.803 --> 00:02:39.990
that they need to overcome
before they can go on and form

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.757
products.
That energy barrier is there

00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:47.018
because when molecules come
together and attempt to react,

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:51.355
usually there is some amount of
bond distortion that has to

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:54.570
occur, things are rearranging,
and you form,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.383
usually, some kind of
intermediate activated complex

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.667
or transition state.
And, when you get up there,

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:05.384
if the molecules have enough
energy to react,

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.719
then they can go to products.
If they don't have enough

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.498
energy to react,
if there is not enough energy

00:03:11.498 --> 00:03:14.833
to distort those bonds and form
this activated complex,

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:17.489
then they will fall back apart
to reactants.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.071
For an elementary reaction,
there is always some barrier to

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.356
overcome.
And I think about activation

00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:27.000
energy barriers in my own work
all the time.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.611
It seems like whenever I have
to sit down and do something,

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.852
start writing a paper,
write a grant,

00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:35.966
write the final exam,
there always seems to be some

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.705
activation energy barrier to
getting started.

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:41.881
And, once you get started,
if you get to this point,

00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:44.807
then it is all downhill,
and things go much more

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.737
smoothly.
But, in the beginning,

00:03:46.737 --> 00:03:50.286
it always seems like every
reaction or every task has some

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.341
kind of activation energy
barrier.

00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:55.205
Up at this top part there,
with this dash line,

00:03:55.205 --> 00:04:00.000
then there is a transition
state or an activated complex.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.880
And here is the barrier without
the catalyst,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.415
here is the energy barrier
without the catalyst and the

00:04:06.415 --> 00:04:10.146
line for the transition state.
And, again, if we go in the

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:13.747
reverse direction of this,
there is an activation energy

00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:17.413
for the reverse reaction here.
And these will all sum up,

00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:21.537
so delta E is going to be equal
to the activation energy for the

00:04:21.537 --> 00:04:24.875
forward reaction minus the
activation energy for the

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:29.000
reverse reaction.
What does adding a catalyst do?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.180
Well, adding a catalyst lowers
that activation energy barrier.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.153
That is shown here in the blue
line.

00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:39.786
And this is also in the
handout.

00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:44.712
This is the energy barrier with
a catalyst, so it is lower.

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:49.553
And then the transition state
with a catalyst will also be

00:04:49.553 --> 00:04:52.356
lower.
And so one way that you can

00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:57.027
think about this is that a
catalyst lowers or stabilizes

00:04:57.027 --> 00:05:00.772
the transition state.
All right.

00:05:00.772 --> 00:05:04.094
Let's add a few more things to
this diagram,

00:05:04.094 --> 00:05:06.799
then.
There will be a new activation

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:10.353
energy for the forward reaction,
shown in blue.

00:05:10.353 --> 00:05:12.748
It is not as high a barrier
now.

00:05:12.748 --> 00:05:15.916
It's lowered down.
And there will be a new

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:19.161
activation energy for the
reverse reaction,

00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:22.560
shown in blue.
These are the values then with

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.728
the catalyst.
A catalyst is going to lower

00:05:25.728 --> 00:05:30.209
both the activation energy for
the forward reaction and the

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:35.000
activation energy for the
reverse reaction.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.103
And that is what is said here.
It lowers both barriers,

00:05:39.103 --> 00:05:42.978
forward and reverse.
And another way to express this

00:05:42.978 --> 00:05:47.158
is that the catalysts stabilize
this transition state or

00:05:47.158 --> 00:05:50.577
activated complex.
They are going to lower the

00:05:50.577 --> 00:05:55.212
energy or stabilize this state.
And this way of thinking about

00:05:55.212 --> 00:06:00.000
this, we will come back to at
the end of the lecture.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.746
It is something that is used by
pharmaceutical companies in

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:09.657
terms of designing inhibitors of
enzymes to think about this.

00:06:09.657 --> 00:06:14.731
Catalysts have no affect on the
thermodynamics of the reaction.

00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:19.150
They are affecting the rate of
the reaction but not the

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.897
thermodynamics of the reaction.
You see that delta E is not

00:06:23.897 --> 00:06:27.580
changing in this at all.
It is the same energy

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.000
difference between reactants and
products.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.681
That term is not changing,
and also delta G would not

00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.832
change.
Delta G is a state function.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:45.144
It is independent of the path,
so it is not going to change.

00:06:45.144 --> 00:06:50.366
It does not care if it had to
go over a higher barrier or a

00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:54.237
lower barrier.
It is independent of the path

00:06:54.237 --> 00:06:58.199
of the reaction.
It just cares about where it

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.523
ends up.
Delta G is not going to change

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:06.476
with a catalyst.
Therefore, equilibrium constant

00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:09.672
is not going to change with a
catalyst.

00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:14.299
What you are changing is the
activation energy barriers,

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:19.345
again, the forward and reverse
reaction, and you are speeding

00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:23.299
up, then, the reaction.
The Chinese symbol for a

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:27.000
catalyst is a marriage
counselor.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.212
You can think about the
catalyst as really facilitating

00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:35.737
those molecules coming together
and having enough energy to

00:07:35.737 --> 00:07:38.390
react.
Say, if they were at a lower

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.914
temperature, it would be harder
to get over that activation

00:07:42.914 --> 00:07:46.035
energy barrier.
A catalyst, or a molecule

00:07:46.035 --> 00:07:50.794
counselor will help lower that
barrier and make it more likely

00:07:50.794 --> 00:07:55.397
for these molecules to have that
energy to react and go onto

00:07:55.397 --> 00:07:58.049
product.
And that will speed up the

00:07:58.049 --> 00:08:01.926
reaction.
We talked last time about if

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:05.091
you are at high temperature or
low temperature.

00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:08.600
If you are at higher
temperature, more molecules can

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.834
overcome the barrier.
Lower temperature makes it

00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:15.068
harder to do that.
A catalyst facilitates things

00:08:15.068 --> 00:08:19.128
by making the barrier lower.
That is what a catalyst can do.

00:08:19.128 --> 00:08:22.362
And, in terms of your own
thinking about things,

00:08:22.362 --> 00:08:25.527
if you have big activation
energy barriers for,

00:08:25.527 --> 00:08:30.000
say, studying for things or
writing a final paper.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.043
You can think of catalysts as
being the due date being the

00:08:34.043 --> 00:08:36.668
next day, so you have run out of
time.

00:08:36.668 --> 00:08:40.569
That can be a big catalyst and
lowering that barrier and

00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:44.187
helping you get started.
Caffeine works for a lot of

00:08:44.187 --> 00:08:48.018
people in terms of getting over
those activation energy

00:08:48.018 --> 00:08:50.855
barriers.
You can think about in your own

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:54.899
life, what are good catalysts
that help you get over those

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:55.892
barriers?
Okay.

00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:58.942
An inhibitor,
then, would be the opposite of

00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:03.506
a catalyst.
And it will slow the rate of a

00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:06.181
reaction.
And it can increase the

00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:10.944
activation energy barrier.
An inhibitor is going to be the

00:09:10.944 --> 00:09:14.119
opposite.
And, again, we will talk more

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:17.796
about inhibitors at the end of
today's class.

00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:20.888
There are a couple types of
catalysts.

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:24.147
You can talk about homogenous
catalysts.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:29.245
And that is when the reactant
and the catalyst are in the same

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:33.294
phase.
An example would be in the

00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:37.794
depletion of the ozone layer by
chlorofluorocarbons.

00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:42.911
Those are all in the gas phase,
so this acts as a catalyst.

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:48.205
It catalyzes the depletion of
ozone, which is why people have

00:09:48.205 --> 00:09:53.235
been very concerned about spray
cans and other things that

00:09:53.235 --> 00:09:58.000
release these molecules into the
environment.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.831
You can also have heterogeneous
catalysts, so something that is

00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:06.415
in a different phase as the
reacting molecules.

00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:09.922
And we are all familiar with
examples of this,

00:10:09.922 --> 00:10:13.038
like a catalytic converter.
In this case,

00:10:13.038 --> 00:10:16.545
your catalyst would be solid
metals, platinum,

00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:20.051
paladium, rhodium.
And they will help catalyze

00:10:20.051 --> 00:10:24.493
oxidation of hydrocarbons,
CO gases, reduction of nitrogen

00:10:24.493 --> 00:10:30.491
oxides, so to reduce pollution.
The reactant molecules are

00:10:30.491 --> 00:10:33.748
gases, but the catalyst is a
metal.

00:10:33.748 --> 00:10:38.251
It is heterogeneous.
It is in a different phase.

00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:43.233
So, these two examples.
I will just show you a little

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:46.299
movie of heterogeneous
catalysis.

00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:51.473
Could some of the TAs help?
The lecture notes are here.

00:10:51.473 --> 00:10:55.209
This movie is not in the
lectures notes.

00:10:55.209 --> 00:11:00.000
We have here a metal surface in
blue.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.762
And the metal is acting as a
catalyst.

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:07.220
And in gray we have these two
dots.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:12.305
Those are hydrogens.
What the metal did was help to

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:16.677
facilitate the dissociation 
of H two.

00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:22.067
H two, which is not so
reactive, has been dissociated,

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:27.254
and you have broken into the
two separate hydrogens.

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:31.627
And now if we bring in a
molecule of ethane,

00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:37.819
then it will react with this.
You have a molecule come in,

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:41.132
in a different phase.
And see how the hydrogens just

00:11:41.132 --> 00:11:43.406
kind of bop right onto the
molecule?

00:11:43.406 --> 00:11:47.240
The metal surface was acting as
a catalyst, making the H two

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.163
gas, I will just do that
one more time,

00:11:50.163 --> 00:11:52.957
more reactive by having it
dissociate first.

00:11:52.957 --> 00:11:55.621
Now they are sitting on the
metal surface,

00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:59.000
and the reaction is quite a bit
faster.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.557
That would be an example of the
heterogeneous catalysis.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:08.498
All right.
Now, I am going to talk about

00:12:08.498 --> 00:12:13.348
my favorite kind of catalysts,
catalysts of life,

00:12:13.348 --> 00:12:16.682
or enzymes.
Enzymes are catalysts.

00:12:16.682 --> 00:12:22.543
And if you are a biochemist,
enzymes are your favorite kind

00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:28.000
of catalyst.
An enzyme is usually a protein.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.756
There are some examples of RNA
catalyzing reactions,

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:36.393
but most enzymes are made up of
protein.

00:12:36.393 --> 00:12:39.471
And they are usually fairly
large.

00:12:39.471 --> 00:12:44.974
The sort of smallest molecular
weight you might see would be

00:12:44.974 --> 00:12:50.290
about 20,000 grams per mole.
Again, some people on Exam 3,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.139
I will just point this out,
when I asked for units of

00:12:55.139 --> 00:12:58.124
molecular weight,
grams per mole,

00:12:58.124 --> 00:13:04.000
some people didn't have the
right units for that.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.427
And that is the same molecular
weight if you are talking about

00:13:09.427 --> 00:13:13.519
a weak acid or you are talking
about an enzyme.

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:18.679
Same units but different size.
These enzymes are capable of

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:23.572
catalyzing a wide variety of
different reactions in your

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:26.775
body.
Proteins or enzymes are made up

00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:31.692
of amino acids.
And amino acids have carbon,

00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:35.153
nitrogen, oxygen,
and sulfur in them.

00:13:35.153 --> 00:13:39.673
And I will share with you a
little recent story.

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:43.423
We have a collaborator who is
in France.

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:48.711
They tried to send us some
protein to do crystallization

00:13:48.711 --> 00:13:52.365
experiments.
I got a call from Customs.

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:59.000
There was a Dewar with this
protein sitting in New Jersey.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.490
And Customs was calling me and
said, they couldn't release this

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.822
material from Customs without
more information.

00:14:06.822 --> 00:14:10.806
They said, it says here that
the Dewar contains protein,

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:14.282
and we need to know what that
protein is made of.

00:14:14.282 --> 00:14:18.411
And we also need to know who
had manufactured the protein.

00:14:18.411 --> 00:14:22.684
And so now you can all answer
the question if Customs calls.

00:14:22.684 --> 00:14:25.219
Proteins are made up of amino
acids.

00:14:25.219 --> 00:14:30.000
I am not really sure what they
were getting at here.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.909
And, in terms of who had
manufactured it,

00:14:32.909 --> 00:14:34.581
it was E.
coli bacteria.

00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:38.654
We were actually afraid of
saying that, because there are

00:14:38.654 --> 00:14:41.854
strains of E.
coli that seem to every once in

00:14:41.854 --> 00:14:46.436
a while make people very sick at
McDonald's and White Castle and

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:47.818
places like that.
E.

00:14:47.818 --> 00:14:51.309
coli has now become sort of a
dangerous bacteria,

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:54.872
so we said the protein was made
up of amino acids,

00:14:54.872 --> 00:14:59.381
like you buy at the health food
store, and the manufacturer was

00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:04.266
"natural sources."
The protein was released to us,

00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:08.067
but apparently the person at
Customs had not had much

00:15:08.067 --> 00:15:11.357
chemistry or biochemistry in
their background.

00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:14.208
All right.
Proteins are made up of these

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:16.694
amino acids.
Here is an amino acid.

00:15:16.694 --> 00:15:20.788
Professor Ceyer talked about
this before in terms of "bad

00:15:20.788 --> 00:15:22.396
hair days".
Amino acid.

00:15:22.396 --> 00:15:26.198
Here we have an amino group,
a carboxylic group and a

00:15:26.198 --> 00:15:30.000
carbon, which is called alpha
carbon.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.448
It is sitting in the middle.
And there is a group R,

00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:37.370
and that can be 20 different
kinds of side chains that make

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.225
up the 20 amino acids that are
commonly found in proteins.

00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:44.877
And so one amino acid gets
linked to another amino acid

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:48.258
through what is called the
peptide bond shown here.

00:15:48.258 --> 00:15:51.977
And so here we have our first
amino acid and our second.

00:15:51.977 --> 00:15:55.696
Again, you can have hundreds
and hundreds of amino acids

00:15:55.696 --> 00:15:59.145
connected to each other.
Then they fold up into some

00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:03.000
kind of compact structure for
the enzyme.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.482
In this particular case,
there are four different chains

00:16:07.482 --> 00:16:10.987
of peptides.
Each chain has 198 amino acids.

00:16:10.987 --> 00:16:15.551
Each chain in this picture is
shown in a different color,

00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:17.833
yellow, green,
red, and blue.

00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:22.072
And in these diagrams,
they don't show all the atoms,

00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:25.739
because that would just kind of
be a big mess,

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:30.857
if you showed all the atoms.
Instead, a ribbon is drawn

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:34.857
through the positions of the
alpha carbons of every amino

00:16:34.857 --> 00:16:37.285
acid.
And so these kind of squiggly

00:16:37.285 --> 00:16:41.571
things here are alpha helices,
which is one type of secondary

00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:44.285
structure.
You will learn about that in

00:16:44.285 --> 00:16:47.071
5.07 or 7.05.
Arrows are often indicated

00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:51.000
what's called beta sheets,
extended regions of the amino

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.571
acids.
And so think kind of gives you

00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:57.714
a general sense of what we call
the folds of the protein in

00:16:57.714 --> 00:17:02.289
these diagrams.
And so this gives you a sense

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:05.131
of how big this molecule
actually is.

00:17:05.131 --> 00:17:08.605
And we report things in
angstroms, typically,

00:17:08.605 --> 00:17:13.105
because that is a good unit of
measure that helps tell you

00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:16.815
about how far apart the atoms
are in structures.

00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:21.710
What is this particular enzyme?
Well, this particular enzyme is

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.526
involved in catalyzing the last
step in the biosynthesis of an

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:32.628
antibiotic called phosphomycin.
And so this is the reactant or

00:17:32.628 --> 00:17:35.607
substrate.
And this is the product,

00:17:35.607 --> 00:17:38.936
phosphomycin.
What phosphomycin does is

00:17:38.936 --> 00:17:44.456
inhibits cell wall biosynthesis
of bacteria and forms a covalent

00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:49.187
adduct with amino acid in the
active site of one of the

00:17:49.187 --> 00:17:52.954
important enzymes in cell wall
biosynthesis.

00:17:52.954 --> 00:17:59.000
And so a lot of antibiotics
target cell wall biosynthesis.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.043
It was first approved to treat
mostly like bladder infections

00:18:03.043 --> 00:18:06.817
and sort of more minor types of
infections, but recently,

00:18:06.817 --> 00:18:09.647
they found that it works
against strains of

00:18:09.647 --> 00:18:13.421
Staphylococcus aureus infection,
which is pretty serious.

00:18:13.421 --> 00:18:17.195
There are several strains of
staph infection now that are

00:18:17.195 --> 00:18:20.767
resistant to some of the
powerful kinds of antibiotics

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.608
that had been used before.
And so they are looking for new

00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:28.180
antibiotics that might be
successful in treating those

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.195
infections.
Antibiotic resistance of

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:37.042
certain kinds of bacteria has
become a really enormous

00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:40.152
problem, and is just getting
worse.

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:45.457
I always like to ask a crowd
like this, how many have taken

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:49.390
antibiotics zero times in their
life, first?

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.414
Never taken antibiotics.
I don't see anybody.

00:18:53.414 --> 00:18:55.975
How about once?
Three people.

00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:57.530
Twice?
A few more.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:02.293
Three times?
You probably don't remember.

00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:06.553
Say around maybe five or more
or something like that?

00:19:06.553 --> 00:19:07.782
OK.
You can see,

00:19:07.782 --> 00:19:11.223
from looking around,
why this is a problem.

00:19:11.223 --> 00:19:15.319
Bacteria are clever.
They figure out and try to get

00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:20.070
around ways, because they want
to survive, so there is some

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.494
nice natural selection going on.
And there are actually

00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:29.000
resistant strains to
phosphomycin as well.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.758
And what happens in that case,
as I said, is it works by

00:19:32.758 --> 00:19:36.653
becoming attached to an amino
acid, and then the enzyme is

00:19:36.653 --> 00:19:38.703
dead.
But if that amino acid is

00:19:38.703 --> 00:19:42.394
mutated, it is a cysteine.
If it mutates to an aspartic

00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:46.494
acid, then it can no longer be
inhibited by this and it still

00:19:46.494 --> 00:19:49.022
works.
It is not as good an enzyme but

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.824
still works.
If there is pressure applied,

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:54.011
natural selection,
die or mutate,

00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:59.000
a lot of things will be very
happy to mutate if they can.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.521
Some of the antibiotics,
if it mutates,

00:20:01.521 --> 00:20:05.105
only just one amino acid
changes, all of a sudden there

00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:08.622
is a resistance going on.
The more times that bacteria

00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:12.471
are exposed to antibiotics,
the more likely it is they will

00:20:12.471 --> 00:20:16.585
mutate in such a way that they
will be resistant in the future.

00:20:16.585 --> 00:20:19.837
This is a really huge problem.
If you're thinking,

00:20:19.837 --> 00:20:23.553
I'm interested in science,
what should I do with my life?

00:20:23.553 --> 00:20:28.000
This is one thing that you
might want to think about.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.098
A lot of what we take
antibiotics for used to be

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:37.068
conditions that were deadly.
If we don't have antibiotics,

00:20:37.068 --> 00:20:40.991
then life expectancy is quite a
bit different.

00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:44.915
Anyway, this is one of the
projects in my lab.

00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:49.623
We're looking at a number of
different enzymes that are

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:52.675
involved in antibiotic
biosynthesis.

00:20:52.675 --> 00:20:55.029
All right.
Enzyme catalysis.

00:20:55.029 --> 00:21:00.000
I am going to introduce you to
a few terms.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.883
And then what we are going to
do is we are going to use the

00:21:03.883 --> 00:21:06.964
things that you learned,
mostly last Wednesday,

00:21:06.964 --> 00:21:10.714
on mechanism of reactions.
And we are going to derive the

00:21:10.714 --> 00:21:13.794
Michaelis-Menten equations for
enzyme kinetics.

00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:17.343
You might not have realized
that on Wednesday you were

00:21:17.343 --> 00:21:21.026
learning all the sort of tools
you need in biochemistry,

00:21:21.026 --> 00:21:23.839
you weren't actually learning
biochemistry,

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:26.651
but you were.
And I think you will see that

00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:30.000
now.
First, a couple of new terms.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.549
I already introduced this a
little bit, but reactant

00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:36.821
molecules, we're always talking
about reactants.

00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:40.719
When you are talking about
enzymes, you are talking about

00:21:40.719 --> 00:21:43.016
substrates.
We no longer call them

00:21:43.016 --> 00:21:45.661
reactants.
We now call them substrates.

00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:49.628
Substrates bind to what is
known as the active site of the

00:21:49.628 --> 00:21:51.647
enzyme.
That is the site where

00:21:51.647 --> 00:21:53.944
catalysis occurs,
so it is active.

00:21:53.944 --> 00:21:56.102
That is pretty easy to
remember.

00:21:56.102 --> 00:22:00.000
Here is a very simple enzyme
reaction.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.759
And a lot of enzyme reactions
actually are fairly simple.

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:09.518
Here, you would have an enzyme
binding to your substrate.

00:22:09.518 --> 00:22:12.492
Enzyme called E.
Substrate called S.

00:22:12.492 --> 00:22:17.337
When the substrate binds to the
enzyme, it forms an enzyme

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:20.821
substrate complex,
which is known as an ES

00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:24.050
complex.
That enzyme substrate complex,

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.620
or ES complex,
will go on and form enzyme E

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:32.196
and product P.
Just to show that in cartoon

00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:36.588
form, and it pains me to do
this, to draw the enzyme like

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:39.411
this.
Because, as you saw in the last

00:22:39.411 --> 00:22:42.627
slide, enzymes are really quite
beautiful.

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:46.627
And this is a very sad
description of what an enzyme

00:22:46.627 --> 00:22:49.607
looks like.
Also, here the substrate is

00:22:49.607 --> 00:22:53.607
about the size of the enzyme,
which is also all off.

00:22:53.607 --> 00:22:58.000
But here is a substrate binding
the enzyme.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.589
This would be the active site
and would be designed just to

00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:05.674
fit the substrate in there quite
nicely.

00:23:05.674 --> 00:23:10.184
When substrate binds to the
enzyme, you form what is known

00:23:10.184 --> 00:23:13.745
as the ES complex.
And usually this binding is

00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:17.068
reversible.
Not all substrate that binds to

00:23:17.068 --> 00:23:19.995
the enzyme will go on to form
product.

00:23:19.995 --> 00:23:24.109
Some will go back and form free
substrate and enzyme.

00:23:24.109 --> 00:23:28.145
And, in this drawing,
then when the enzyme reacts on

00:23:28.145 --> 00:23:31.547
the substrate,
it will form product and free

00:23:31.547 --> 00:23:36.773
enzyme again.
And this is drawn with a single

00:23:36.773 --> 00:23:41.335
line as not being a reversible
step in the reaction.

00:23:41.335 --> 00:23:45.808
Here you see substrate,
and what this enzyme did is

00:23:45.808 --> 00:23:51.444
sort of make the substrate look
a little more like Mickey Mouse.

00:23:51.444 --> 00:23:54.217
There is our product coming
off.

00:23:54.217 --> 00:23:59.584
Now we can derive equations to
represent that reaction that I

00:23:59.584 --> 00:24:04.270
just showed you.
And we can use all the same

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:09.147
ideas that we had when we were
deriving mechanisms in class

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:12.174
last Wednesday and on Problem
Set 10.

00:24:12.174 --> 00:24:15.873
Again, the reaction is enzyme
plus substrate,

00:24:15.873 --> 00:24:20.750
E plus S going in a reversible
step to the enzyme substrate

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.543
complex ES,
and then going with a single

00:24:25.543 --> 00:24:30.000
non-reversible step to enzyme
and product.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.079
We can put this in two steps.
Step 1 is the reversible step

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:38.298
of enzyme and substrate going to
the enzyme substrate complex

00:24:38.298 --> 00:24:42.799
with rate constants k one
for forward step and k minus one

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:47.019
for the reverse step.
In Step 2, we have the enzyme

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:50.817
substrate complex going to
enzyme and product with rate

00:24:50.817 --> 00:24:54.123
constant k two.
These then are elementary

00:24:54.123 --> 00:24:58.413
reactions, and so we can write
the rate law for each step just

00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:02.000
based as how the reaction is
written.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.947
What would be the rate for the
forward reaction?

00:25:06.947 --> 00:25:12.105
k one times E times S.

00:25:12.105 --> 00:25:15.789
All right.
There is the rate for the

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:20.210
forward reaction.
Again, just based on rate

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:25.157
constant times the two things
that are reacting.

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:30.000
What about for the reverse
reaction?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.481
What's the rate constant?
k minus one times ES,

00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:41.158
right.
That would be for the reverse

00:25:41.158 --> 00:25:44.682
reaction.
And what about the rate for

00:25:44.682 --> 00:25:46.835
Step 2?
K two times ES,

00:25:46.835 --> 00:25:49.576
right. Okay.

00:25:49.576 --> 00:25:54.568
Now we can look at the rate of
formation of product,

00:25:54.568 --> 00:25:59.462
the overall reaction.
The rate of product formation

00:25:59.462 --> 00:26:04.259
can be expressed as the change
dP / dt, with time,

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:09.604
for product.
And also we can just write it

00:26:09.604 --> 00:26:14.453
from the second step in terms of
k two times ES.

00:26:14.453 --> 00:26:19.840
That is the
rate of formation of product.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.355
Are we done?
No, because why?

00:26:22.355 --> 00:26:27.024
There is an intermediate,
so we have to solve for the

00:26:27.024 --> 00:26:30.548
intermediate.
Again, this should seem

00:26:30.548 --> 00:26:32.972
familiar.
It is all the same stuff we

00:26:32.972 --> 00:26:36.540
were talking about last week.
We need to solve for the

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.502
intermediate.
We are not given anything about

00:26:39.502 --> 00:26:42.599
fast and slow steps,
so we are going to use the

00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:46.706
steady-state approximation which
is going to tell you that the

00:26:46.706 --> 00:26:50.342
net formation of intermediates
is pretty much constant.

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:54.112
It is in the steady-state.
Another way to express that is

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:58.287
that all the steps that form the
intermediate are equal in rate

00:26:58.287 --> 00:27:03.000
to all the steps that get rid of
that intermediate --

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.720
-- either consume it or
decompose it.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.255
First, we need to look at what
all the steps are that have to

00:27:10.255 --> 00:27:13.883
do with the intermediate.
Here is the rate of the

00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:18.191
formation of that intermediate.
And so that is going to be

00:27:18.191 --> 00:27:22.348
equal to the steps involved in
forming the intermediate.

00:27:22.348 --> 00:27:26.959
And it is only formed in that
first step, forward direction of

00:27:26.959 --> 00:27:31.365
the first step.
Its rate k one times the

00:27:31.365 --> 00:27:34.952
concentration of E times the
concentration of S.

00:27:34.952 --> 00:27:38.768
That's the rate 
of formation.

00:27:38.768 --> 00:27:42.889
And then, we are going to
subtract from that steps that

00:27:42.889 --> 00:27:46.094
are involved in the
decomposition or in the

00:27:46.094 --> 00:27:50.826
consumption of the intermediate.
The intermediate decomposes in

00:27:50.826 --> 00:27:54.642
the reverse direction of Step 1.
That is this rate,

00:27:54.642 --> 00:28:00.614
k minus one times ES.
And it is also consumed in this

00:28:00.614 --> 00:28:03.987
second step.
It is consumed by the rate k

00:28:03.987 --> 00:28:08.289
two times ES.
Again, this is exactly the same

00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:12.843
as what we looked at last week.
Now we can consider the

00:28:12.843 --> 00:28:17.650
steady-state approximation,
and we can set that whole term

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.433
equal to zero.
Steady-state again,

00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:25.493
the net rate of formation of
the intermediate is equal to the

00:28:25.493 --> 00:28:30.554
net rate at which it goes away.
The whole equation can be set

00:28:30.554 --> 00:28:35.040
equal to zero.
We can do that here,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.000
set this term equal to zero.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.015
Now, there is a slight change.
It is not 100% what we did

00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:48.310
before.
There is a slight change.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.681
And that comes out of a
practical consideration.

00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:55.697
When you are doing these
experiments, in the term that we

00:28:55.697 --> 00:29:00.000
had, you usually don't know how
much enzyme is free.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.395
And it is hard to figure that
out, at any one time,

00:29:03.395 --> 00:29:06.654
how much enzyme is not reacting
with a substrate.

00:29:06.654 --> 00:29:10.524
It is much easier to know how
much enzyme you added to the

00:29:10.524 --> 00:29:13.783
reaction to begin with.
That is a number that you

00:29:13.783 --> 00:29:16.296
should know.
You should have carefully

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:20.438
figured out how much enzyme that
you were going to use in your

00:29:20.438 --> 00:29:23.782
experiment.
Instead of solving for the

00:29:23.782 --> 00:29:27.622
intermediate in terms of the
free enzyme, it is easier to

00:29:27.622 --> 00:29:30.434
solve for it in terms of the
total enzyme,

00:29:30.434 --> 00:29:34.480
which we are going to call E
nought, how much enzyme you put

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.359
into the equation.
The total enzyme that is

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:41.542
reacting with substrate that you
put into the experiment would

00:29:41.542 --> 00:29:45.725
equal the amount that is free,
the amount that is not reacting

00:29:45.725 --> 00:29:49.017
at any given time or that just
finished reacting,

00:29:49.017 --> 00:29:51.897
and the amount of the enzyme
that is bound.

00:29:51.897 --> 00:29:54.365
It is only going to be free or
bound.

00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:58.000
The total enzyme equals these
two.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.025
And so you can go back to your
other equation,

00:30:01.025 --> 00:30:03.378
right now.
And whenever you had free

00:30:03.378 --> 00:30:07.210
enzyme, you can substitute in
terms for total enzyme minus

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.436
bound, because that is going to
be equal to free.

00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:14.672
Again, this is just a practical
consideration that it is easier,

00:30:14.672 --> 00:30:17.294
if you are doing these
experiments, and,

00:30:17.294 --> 00:30:20.386
again, biochemistry is an
experimental science,

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:24.151
to know how much enzyme you
started with than to know how

00:30:24.151 --> 00:30:26.705
much is non-reacting at any
given time.

00:30:26.705 --> 00:30:31.782
This is just a practical thing.
And for all the other things we

00:30:31.782 --> 00:30:34.599
worked on, you are always
wanting to solve for the

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.934
intermediate in terms of things
you could measure like rate

00:30:37.934 --> 00:30:40.924
constants and concentration of
reactants or products.

00:30:40.924 --> 00:30:44.201
It is a similar kind of idea.
You want to be able to solve

00:30:44.201 --> 00:30:47.535
for things in terms of stuff
that you can actually measure.

00:30:47.535 --> 00:30:50.180
Now we can go back.
Again, this is the equation

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.537
that we were solving for our
intermediate.

00:30:52.537 --> 00:30:54.895
If you use the steady-state
approximation,

00:30:54.895 --> 00:30:58.000
you set the whole term equal to
zero.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.962
Now we can take this term and
substitute.

00:31:00.962 --> 00:31:05.111
We are going to replace this E,
and that is the only free

00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:08.296
enzyme that we had in this whole
expression.

00:31:08.296 --> 00:31:12.666
We are going to replace this
now with total enzyme minus the

00:31:12.666 --> 00:31:15.777
bound enzyme.
We are going to put that term

00:31:15.777 --> 00:31:18.740
in here, and that gives us the
following.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.370
Now we have k one S
times, in parentheses,

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.370
this term, which equals free
enzyme, total minus bound.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:30.000
And now we can multiply that
out.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.765
K one S times total enzyme
here.

00:31:33.765 --> 00:31:40.202
And then there is a minus here.
We have k one ES times

00:31:40.202 --> 00:31:46.396
substrate, over here.
And these parts are unchanged.

00:31:46.396 --> 00:31:53.076
Now we can solve for ES.
Here is our expression from the

00:31:53.076 --> 00:31:57.935
last sheet.
Now we can rearrange to solve

00:31:57.935 --> 00:32:01.859
for ES.
We are going to put all the ES

00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:04.276
terms onto one side.
Here is an ES term,

00:32:04.276 --> 00:32:07.004
here was an ES term,
and here was an ES term,

00:32:07.004 --> 00:32:10.475
so we moved those down to the
other side of the equation.

00:32:10.475 --> 00:32:13.202
It gets rid of the negative.
Bring that over.

00:32:13.202 --> 00:32:16.115
Bring that over.
And the only thing on the other

00:32:16.115 --> 00:32:19.648
side of the equation is this
term here, k one times

00:32:19.648 --> 00:32:22.685
total enzyme times substrate.
Now we can go ahead,

00:32:22.685 --> 00:32:25.475
as we did before,
and pull out all of these ES

00:32:25.475 --> 00:32:30.000
terms and come up with an
expression that solves for it.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.421
So we are going to solve for
ES.

00:32:32.421 --> 00:32:34.140
We pulled out ES,
here.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.437
We have k one S,
we have k minus one,

00:32:38.437 --> 00:32:42.578
and we have k two.
We have this expression over

00:32:42.578 --> 00:32:44.843
here.
And now we can take this

00:32:44.843 --> 00:32:47.500
expression and divide by that
term.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.625
And so this gives us an
expression, then,

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:53.828
for the concentration of our
intermediate.

00:32:53.828 --> 00:32:57.812
Now we are going to do one
other thing that is a bit

00:32:57.812 --> 00:33:02.328
different.
This term has a lot of k's in

00:33:02.328 --> 00:33:04.335
it.
And so we are going to

00:33:04.335 --> 00:33:09.394
substitute these k's for another
term that is more convenient to

00:33:09.394 --> 00:33:12.846
measure than any of these are by
themselves.

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:16.058
Again, this is a practical
consideration.

00:33:16.058 --> 00:33:19.912
You want to be able to use
these equations to get

00:33:19.912 --> 00:33:22.562
information about enzyme
kinetics.

00:33:22.562 --> 00:33:27.299
And so the term that we are
going to introduce is called big

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:33.000
K to the little m,
the Michaelis-Menten constant.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.210
And so the Michaelis-Menten
constant, we will talk about

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.947
what this really means,
what this constant means in

00:33:42.947 --> 00:33:48.347
practical terms in a couple
minutes, Km equals k minus one

00:33:48.347 --> 00:33:53.936
plus k two divided by k one.
Now we somehow want to get this

00:33:53.936 --> 00:34:00.000
term into this expression.
Here is the expression again.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.718
We want this term in here.
If you notice at the bottom

00:34:04.718 --> 00:34:09.970
here, there is a k minus one and
a k two, just like there is

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.908
here.
If we divided these two by k

00:34:12.908 --> 00:34:16.290
one, we would have Km
over here.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.741
But, if we do that,
we have to divide everything by

00:34:20.741 --> 00:34:24.391
k one.
Let's divide everything by k

00:34:24.391 --> 00:34:30.000
one and turn this part of the
expression into a Km.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.054
If we do that,
we divide the top term by 

00:34:34.054 --> 00:34:37.747
k one, we divide this term
here, k one S,

00:34:37.747 --> 00:34:41.621
by k one, and we divided these
two by k one.

00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:46.486
We do that because now this is
going to be equal to Km.

00:34:46.486 --> 00:34:49.189
All right.
We can simplify this

00:34:49.189 --> 00:34:52.882
expression.
We have various things that we

00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:55.405
can cross out.
If we do that,

00:34:55.405 --> 00:35:00.000
you can cross these two out,
up here.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.491
You can also cross these two
out, down here.

00:35:03.491 --> 00:35:06.090
And what does that leave us
with?

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.176
That leaves us with this.
The top term,

00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:13.155
we have total enzyme
concentration times substrate

00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:17.703
concentration over substrate
concentration plus this term

00:35:17.703 --> 00:35:21.438
here, which is Km.
We have taken something that

00:35:21.438 --> 00:35:26.310
was a little bit more clunky and
turned it into an expression

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:30.533
that has fewer terms,
including this new term that is

00:35:30.533 --> 00:35:35.000
used for enzyme kinetics,
this Km term.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.841
Now, we can finally go back and
take our term for the

00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:44.403
concentration of the
intermediate and plug it into

00:35:44.403 --> 00:35:47.848
our rate law for formation of
product.

00:35:47.848 --> 00:35:52.782
Again, this was our expression
for the rate of product

00:35:52.782 --> 00:35:57.065
formation, k two times the
concentration of ES.

00:35:57.065 --> 00:36:02.000
And we can take this and plug
that in here.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.523
And that gives us this term,
k two, times total enzyme times

00:36:06.523 --> 00:36:08.976
substrate over substrate plus
Km.

00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:12.119
And this is the
Michaelis-Menten equation.

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:15.033
We used the steady-state
approximation.

00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:19.633
We solved for an intermediate.
We did two things differently.

00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:22.010
We didn't solve for free
enzyme.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:27.173
We solved for total enzyme.
And we also introduced this

00:36:27.173 --> 00:36:31.921
term, Km, and took out some of
the individual rate constants

00:36:31.921 --> 00:36:35.463
and expressed them in terms of
this constant.

00:36:35.463 --> 00:36:39.487
Here is our rate equation for
formation of product.

00:36:39.487 --> 00:36:43.270
Now let's think about what this
equation can do,

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.570
what it means,
what happens when enzyme is

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:50.112
making product,
is acting as the catalyst and

00:36:50.112 --> 00:36:52.848
turning our substrate into
product.

00:36:52.848 --> 00:36:58.000
Here would be a graph of what
it might look like.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.250
You have, here,
the rate of formation of

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:06.000
product expressed as dP / dt.
That is just rate of product

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.333
formation versus substrate
concentration.

00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:13.833
And you see that the curve goes
up and then levels off.

00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:18.250
What is happening in this case?
Well, at low substrate

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:22.333
concentration and down here,
this is low substrate

00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:25.833
concentration,
when you add more substrate,

00:37:25.833 --> 00:37:32.000
the rate goes up quite quickly
and then starts to level off.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.091
And at low substrate
concentration,

00:37:34.091 --> 00:37:36.920
adding more substrate increases
the rate a lot,

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.810
because there is a bunch of
enzyme that is free,

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:43.070
that is just hanging out.
And it is not making product

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.346
because it doesn't have any
substrate.

00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:48.913
But you give it substrate and
it will quickly make product.

00:37:48.913 --> 00:37:52.234
That is what is happening.
You have lots of free enzyme

00:37:52.234 --> 00:37:54.264
around.
It is ready for substrate.

00:37:54.264 --> 00:37:56.293
When you add substrate,
it reacts.

00:37:56.293 --> 00:38:00.634
Lots of product is formed.
Why would it level off?

00:38:00.634 --> 00:38:04.686
Well, it will level off at
higher substrate concentrations

00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:07.742
because, at higher substrate
concentrations,

00:38:07.742 --> 00:38:11.012
there really is any free enzyme
around anymore.

00:38:11.012 --> 00:38:14.495
Adding more substrate,
when the enzyme already has

00:38:14.495 --> 00:38:17.622
substrate bound,
is not going to increase the

00:38:17.622 --> 00:38:20.536
rate at which the product is
being formed.

00:38:20.536 --> 00:38:23.024
We say that the enzyme is
saturated.

00:38:23.024 --> 00:38:28.000
The enzyme already has as much
substrate as it can use.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.191
And you just have to wait until
it finishes the reaction to

00:38:32.191 --> 00:38:35.298
product before a new substrate
can be bound.

00:38:35.298 --> 00:38:38.477
The rate is going to level off
at some point,

00:38:38.477 --> 00:38:41.223
because there is no free enzyme
around.

00:38:41.223 --> 00:38:43.608
You have saturated with
substrate.

00:38:43.608 --> 00:38:46.137
Adding more does not help your
rate.

00:38:46.137 --> 00:38:50.111
We can think about this in
terms of the Michaelis-Menten

00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:52.424
equation.
We can think about when

00:38:52.424 --> 00:38:56.687
substrate concentrations are
really high, when you have lots

00:38:56.687 --> 00:39:01.211
of substrates.
And we can think about that in

00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:05.341
terms of this value for Km.
Again, we are looking here at

00:39:05.341 --> 00:39:09.322
the bottom of this equation,
and we are thinking about,

00:39:09.322 --> 00:39:12.419
how big is this term compared
to that term.

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:16.105
Under conditions of the
experiment, where substrate

00:39:16.105 --> 00:39:19.423
concentration is a much bigger
number than Km,

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:23.479
we can get rid of the Km term,
so we can cross this out.

00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:28.050
Again, if you have a really big
number in the denominator added

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:33.435
to a much smaller number.
The much smaller number is not

00:39:33.435 --> 00:39:37.981
really contributing much,
and you can just get rid of it.

00:39:37.981 --> 00:39:41.147
Now, we can simplify this
equation then,

00:39:41.147 --> 00:39:44.800
if we did that.
What else could we cancel out?

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.129
We can cancel out S.
We can get rid of our

00:39:48.129 --> 00:39:51.214
substrate.
And that leaves us with this

00:39:51.214 --> 00:39:55.177
expression.
That the rate of formation of

00:39:55.177 --> 00:39:59.833
product under these conditions,
when substrate is a much bigger

00:39:59.833 --> 00:40:03.814
number than this Km term,
then we get this expression,

00:40:03.814 --> 00:40:08.169
that the rate is just equal to
k two times the total enzyme

00:40:08.169 --> 00:40:11.774
that we had in our reaction.
And this has a name.

00:40:11.774 --> 00:40:15.604
It is called V(max).
V(max) equals k two times total

00:40:15.604 --> 00:40:19.660
enzyme, and V(max) is the
maximum rate of the reaction.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.339
And so, when you have lots and
lots of substrates,

00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:27.695
you are under these conditions,
where you can determine the

00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:33.019
maximum rate of the enzyme.
The V(max) of the enzyme.

00:40:33.019 --> 00:40:37.785
And it is only equal to this k
two times how much enzyme you

00:40:37.785 --> 00:40:40.451
had in that particular
experiment.

00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:45.298
Again, the maximum rate of the
enzyme under these conditions.

00:40:45.298 --> 00:40:49.256
Again, that would be up here.
The rate levels off.

00:40:49.256 --> 00:40:52.649
When you have high substrate
concentration,

00:40:52.649 --> 00:40:55.233
then you are at the maximum
rate.

00:40:55.233 --> 00:41:00.000
The enzyme cannot go any faster
at that point.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.352
The rate depends on how much
enzyme you have and the k two

00:41:04.352 --> 00:41:07.100
term.
Now, let's consider this

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:11.834
scenario, where these two terms
at the bottom of the expression

00:41:11.834 --> 00:41:15.576
are equal to each other,
when substrate equals Km,

00:41:15.576 --> 00:41:18.630
the concentration of substrate
equals Km.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:22.295
If those are equal,
we can get rid of the Km term

00:41:22.295 --> 00:41:26.647
and put in another substrate
term, because they are equal.

00:41:26.647 --> 00:41:31.000
We will just put in another
substrate term.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.793
Then we can simplify again.
Two substrates are down here.

00:41:36.793 --> 00:41:41.344
One is up here.
We can cancel one of them and

00:41:41.344 --> 00:41:44.655
get the following.
We cancel one.

00:41:44.655 --> 00:41:50.241
We have one-half k two
times the total enzyme

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:54.896
concentration.
And this would be then the half

00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:58.931
maximal rate.
The maximal rate was k two

00:41:58.931 --> 00:42:04.000
times the total enzyme
concentration.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.694
Half maximal is half that rate.
And now we can finally define

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:13.595
Km.
We can define Km as the

00:42:13.595 --> 00:42:20.400
concentration of substrate for
which the rate is half maximal.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:27.318
The concentration of substrate,
when you have this half maximal

00:42:27.318 --> 00:42:31.000
rate.
That is what Km is.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.442
And so this is a term that is
easy to measure,

00:42:34.442 --> 00:42:36.584
then.
That is why we did some

00:42:36.584 --> 00:42:41.327
manipulations to get it into our
equation, because it is a term

00:42:41.327 --> 00:42:44.617
where you can find the answer,
the Km value.

00:42:44.617 --> 00:42:49.054
If you know the maximal rate,
you can find the half maximal

00:42:49.054 --> 00:42:53.109
rate and figure out what
substrate concentration gives

00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:57.316
you that half maximal rate.
And that is just going to be

00:42:57.316 --> 00:43:00.657
your Km.
In some problems that you are

00:43:00.657 --> 00:43:03.228
going to have,
and the extra problems that are

00:43:03.228 --> 00:43:06.485
posted, it may tell you the
maximal rate and then tell you

00:43:06.485 --> 00:43:10.085
the substrate concentration that
gives you the half maximal rate

00:43:10.085 --> 00:43:13.057
and you have to find the Km.
Well, that is not a hard

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.171
problem.
If you are told the substrate

00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:18.028
concentration that gives you the
half maximal rate,

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:20.599
that is the Km.
It is just a matter of knowing

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:23.228
the definition.
The levels of problems that you

00:43:23.228 --> 00:43:26.428
have in your chapter on enzyme
kinetics are really pretty

00:43:26.428 --> 00:43:28.142
simple.
If you know some of the

00:43:28.142 --> 00:43:33.454
definitions, you are all set.
Finally, let's just look at

00:43:33.454 --> 00:43:36.545
inhibitors in the last few
minutes.

00:43:36.545 --> 00:43:41.636
This is a very simplistic view
of an inhibitor situation.

00:43:41.636 --> 00:43:46.545
If your inhibitor is I,
it may bind to your free enzyme

00:43:46.545 --> 00:43:51.363
to give you an EI complex,
an inhibitor bound complex.

00:43:51.363 --> 00:43:55.363
If the inhibitor is bound in
the active site,

00:43:55.363 --> 00:44:00.272
and it is bound pretty well,
substrate is going to come

00:44:00.272 --> 00:44:03.804
along.
But it cannot bind,

00:44:03.804 --> 00:44:09.503
so you cannot make any product.
The inhibitor has stopped the

00:44:09.503 --> 00:44:13.208
activity.
That is just a very simplistic

00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:18.812
scheme of what can be going on.
Many pharmaceuticals work on

00:44:18.812 --> 00:44:22.517
enzyme inhibitors.
That is what they do.

00:44:22.517 --> 00:44:26.031
They stop enzyme biological
catalysts.

00:44:26.031 --> 00:44:31.540
The way in which they work,
often, is that the inhibitor is

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:38.000
designed to mimic the transition
state of the reaction.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.861
If you have things coming
together and they form an

00:44:42.861 --> 00:44:48.013
activated complex or a
transition state before they go

00:44:48.013 --> 00:44:53.555
on to, say, form products,
often the inhibitor is designed

00:44:53.555 --> 00:44:59.000
to look like that transition
state that is formed.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.193
The reason why it would do this
is because molecules that

00:45:03.193 --> 00:45:07.685
resemble the transition state
should bind more tightly to the

00:45:07.685 --> 00:45:11.280
enzyme than either the reactants
or the products.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.949
Therefore, they can serve as
effective inhibitors.

00:45:14.949 --> 00:45:19.142
If you just recall what we
showed at the beginning of the

00:45:19.142 --> 00:45:22.512
talk, catalysts work by lowering
this barrier,

00:45:22.512 --> 00:45:25.357
or by stabilizing the
transition state,

00:45:25.357 --> 00:45:30.000
bringing the transition state
to a lower energy.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.633
And so, often,
inhibitors that look like a

00:45:32.633 --> 00:45:36.102
transition state will bind to
the enzyme quite tightly.

00:45:36.102 --> 00:45:38.800
And you want the inhibitor to
bind tightly,

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.012
because you don't want
substrate to be able to come

00:45:42.012 --> 00:45:44.068
along and displace the
inhibitor.

00:45:44.068 --> 00:45:47.216
If you are trying to stop the
enzyme from working,

00:45:47.216 --> 00:45:50.813
you want a tightly-bound
inhibitor, so they often look to

00:45:50.813 --> 00:45:53.961
the transition state.
And let me just give you one

00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:57.558
example that has been pretty
successful, and that is with

00:45:57.558 --> 00:46:02.416
protease inhibitors.
Protease inhibitors are used in

00:46:02.416 --> 00:46:06.470
the treatment of HIV.
The proteases are enzymes which

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:10.134
cleave peptide bonds.
And so we talked about the

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:14.110
formation of a peptide bond.
This is a reaction that

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.865
catalyzes the reverse process,
breaking down the peptide bond.

00:46:18.865 --> 00:46:22.919
And so here might be a
simplified reaction mechanism.

00:46:22.919 --> 00:46:25.959
You have something coming and
attacking.

00:46:25.959 --> 00:46:31.511
Here is your peptide bond.
You are forming a tetrahedral

00:46:31.511 --> 00:46:35.754
intermediate here.
And what would be the angles of

00:46:35.754 --> 00:46:38.611
a tetrahedral intermediate?
109.5.

00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:43.634
And then this would break down
and you would form these two

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:47.703
products, so the peptide bond
then gets cleaved.

00:46:47.703 --> 00:46:52.726
And so designers of inhibitors
or pharmaceutical drugs have

00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:58.181
tried to mimic this tetrahedral
intermediate to try to get tight

00:46:58.181 --> 00:47:01.876
binding.
You have the idea that

00:47:01.876 --> 00:47:06.738
molecules with this stable
tetrahedral site that cannot be

00:47:06.738 --> 00:47:11.855
cleaved could bind to the enzyme
more tightly than substrate.

00:47:11.855 --> 00:47:16.547
And this is just one example of
a drug that inhibits HIV

00:47:16.547 --> 00:47:21.323
protease that has that stable
tetrahedral site where that

00:47:21.323 --> 00:47:24.308
cannot be cleaved.
I am almost done.

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:29.000
Here is a picture of it bound
to the enzyme.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.053
Here is the inhibitor bound to
the active site.

00:47:32.053 --> 00:47:35.506
It fits quite well in there.
And let me just mention,

00:47:35.506 --> 00:47:39.290
finally, that one problem with
designing inhibitors toward

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.414
enzymes, there are,
in this case,

00:47:41.414 --> 00:47:44.402
many proteases.
You might not want to stop all

00:47:44.402 --> 00:47:47.854
proteases from working.
You only want to stop the HIV

00:47:47.854 --> 00:47:51.174
protease from working.
There are a lot of issues of

00:47:51.174 --> 00:47:53.165
specificity.
That is one of the

00:47:53.165 --> 00:47:56.153
complications of drug design.
And that, again,

00:47:56.153 --> 00:48:01.000
is another important area for
you to think about doing.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.545
There is still a huge problem
with HIV.

00:48:03.545 --> 00:48:06.694
Not as much in the U.S.,
but in other countries.

00:48:06.694 --> 00:48:09.910
That is something else you can
think about doing.

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:11.776
All right.
See you Wednesday.
