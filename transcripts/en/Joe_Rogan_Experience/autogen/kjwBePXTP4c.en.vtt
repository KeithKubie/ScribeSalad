want to go down this road so I was in I

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380
want to go down this road so I was in I
 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860
want to go down this road so I was in I
tell the story in the book and so I was

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870
tell the story in the book and so I was
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.939
tell the story in the book and so I was
in the Air Force

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
in the Air Force
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.740
in the Air Force
back in the 80s like you mentioned about

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
back in the 80s like you mentioned about
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.330
back in the 80s like you mentioned about
crack cocaine so I was in the Air Force

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
crack cocaine so I was in the Air Force
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.120
crack cocaine so I was in the Air Force
over in England 86 87 88 and crack

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
over in England 86 87 88 and crack
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.099
over in England 86 87 88 and crack
cocaine was a big deal in the United

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
cocaine was a big deal in the United
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529
cocaine was a big deal in the United
States as you point out and I grew up in

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
States as you point out and I grew up in
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.560
States as you point out and I grew up in
the hood in Miami and Miami was a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
the hood in Miami and Miami was a
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630
the hood in Miami and Miami was a
cocaine capital in the United States and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
cocaine capital in the United States and
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.360
cocaine capital in the United States and
and so things that were happening in my

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
and so things that were happening in my
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.270
and so things that were happening in my
community that were not good high

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
community that were not good high
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.240
community that were not good high
unemployment crime all of these kinds of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
unemployment crime all of these kinds of
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.510
unemployment crime all of these kinds of
things

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
things
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060
things
I blame crack cocaine for that and so I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
I blame crack cocaine for that and so I
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.299
I blame crack cocaine for that and so I
thought that if I go to school and get a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
thought that if I go to school and get a
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400
thought that if I go to school and get a
degree in order to study drugs the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
degree in order to study drugs the
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.650
degree in order to study drugs the
effects of drugs on the brain I could

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
effects of drugs on the brain I could
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.049
effects of drugs on the brain I could
solve the problems that face my

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
solve the problems that face my
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670
solve the problems that face my
community or problems that I thought

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
community or problems that I thought
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130
community or problems that I thought
were in the community particularly those

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
were in the community particularly those
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349
were in the community particularly those
related to drugs and so I began studying

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
related to drugs and so I began studying
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600
related to drugs and so I began studying
drugs as an undergraduate and then went

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
drugs as an undergraduate and then went
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.450
drugs as an undergraduate and then went
on to graduate school to study drugs on

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
on to graduate school to study drugs on
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000
on to graduate school to study drugs on
the brains of animals and to try to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
the brains of animals and to try to
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.080
the brains of animals and to try to
figure out the neurobiological

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
figure out the neurobiological
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120
figure out the neurobiological
mechanisms that were responsible for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
mechanisms that were responsible for
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.210
mechanisms that were responsible for
addiction she just got fascinated by

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
addiction she just got fascinated by
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.300
addiction she just got fascinated by
this idea of fixing this issue that you

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
this idea of fixing this issue that you
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.010
this idea of fixing this issue that you
saw in your community and then you just

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
saw in your community and then you just
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.590
saw in your community and then you just
fell into a rabbit hole yeah so when I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
fell into a rabbit hole yeah so when I
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.620
fell into a rabbit hole yeah so when I
started along my journey my path I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
started along my journey my path I
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719
started along my journey my path I
actually got in education and you know

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
actually got in education and you know
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.109
actually got in education and you know
so as James Baldwin said you know the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
so as James Baldwin said you know the
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.899
so as James Baldwin said you know the
the paradox of education is precisely

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
the paradox of education is precisely
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.390
the paradox of education is precisely
this as one begins to become educated

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
this as one begins to become educated
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300
this as one begins to become educated
and conscious one begins to question the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
and conscious one begins to question the
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160
and conscious one begins to question the
society in which he's being educated and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
society in which he's being educated and
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.139
society in which he's being educated and
that's what happened with me and so

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
that's what happened with me and so
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.999
that's what happened with me and so
along the way I discovered things like

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
along the way I discovered things like
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280
along the way I discovered things like
hmm the majority of people who use these

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
hmm the majority of people who use these
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.020
hmm the majority of people who use these
drugs are not addicted that was one

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
drugs are not addicted that was one
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700
drugs are not addicted that was one
thing I discovered I discovered that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
thing I discovered I discovered that
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.170
thing I discovered I discovered that
many of the things that we said about

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
many of the things that we said about
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.999
many of the things that we said about
crack about crack cocaine were just

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
crack about crack cocaine were just
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.580
crack about crack cocaine were just
simply not true like the cold crack baby

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
simply not true like the cold crack baby
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.459
simply not true like the cold crack baby
myths and people said that when that our

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
myths and people said that when that our
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.410
myths and people said that when that our
generation beep should be prepared to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
generation beep should be prepared to
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.679
generation beep should be prepared to
have an army of kids who couldn't learn

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
have an army of kids who couldn't learn
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.540
have an army of kids who couldn't learn
because of being exposed to crack

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
because of being exposed to crack
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880
because of being exposed to crack
cocaine that just simply wasn't true

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
cocaine that just simply wasn't true
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.100
cocaine that just simply wasn't true
when all the data came out there

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
when all the data came out there
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.590
when all the data came out there
beginning in the mid-1990s we realized

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
beginning in the mid-1990s we realized
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.270
beginning in the mid-1990s we realized
that that simply wasn't true

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
that that simply wasn't true
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.580
that that simply wasn't true
other things that I learned that just

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
other things that I learned that just
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.480
other things that I learned that just
simply wasn't true things like one hit

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490
simply wasn't true things like one hit
 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.340
simply wasn't true things like one hit
of crack cocaine you're addicted not

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350
of crack cocaine you're addicted not
 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.290
of crack cocaine you're addicted not
true that crack cocaine was different

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300
true that crack cocaine was different
 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.600
true that crack cocaine was different
from powder cocaine not true all of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
from powder cocaine not true all of
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.670
from powder cocaine not true all of
these things I discovered of long way

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
these things I discovered of long way
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.470
these things I discovered of long way
that they won't they weren't true and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
that they won't they weren't true and
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.590
that they won't they weren't true and
not only that I discovered that this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
not only that I discovered that this
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.340
not only that I discovered that this
wasn't new I went back to the early

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350
wasn't new I went back to the early
 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.300
wasn't new I went back to the early
1900s and saw the same sort of hysteria

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310
1900s and saw the same sort of hysteria
 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.680
1900s and saw the same sort of hysteria
mainly race-based hysteria surrounding

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
mainly race-based hysteria surrounding
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.460
mainly race-based hysteria surrounding
drugs occurred even then and so I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
drugs occurred even then and so I
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.979
drugs occurred even then and so I
thought what's what's going on and then

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989
thought what's what's going on and then
 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.990
thought what's what's going on and then
that helped me to be more critical about

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
that helped me to be more critical about
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.199
that helped me to be more critical about
my issue is there a difference in the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209
my issue is there a difference in the
 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.510
my issue is there a difference in the
the effect of crack cocaine the physical

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
the effect of crack cocaine the physical
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.750
the effect of crack cocaine the physical
effect and and and cocaine and heroin so

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
effect and and and cocaine and heroin so
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.490
effect and and and cocaine and heroin so
let's think about crack let me not not

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
let's think about crack let me not not
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.590
let's think about crack let me not not
here on rather how to conquer powder

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
here on rather how to conquer powder
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.000
here on rather how to conquer powder
yeah let's think about crack cocaine and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
yeah let's think about crack cocaine and
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.050
yeah let's think about crack cocaine and
powder cocaine let's just think about

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060
powder cocaine let's just think about
 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.940
powder cocaine let's just think about
the chemical structure the only

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
the chemical structure the only
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.440
the chemical structure the only
difference between crack cocaine and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
difference between crack cocaine and
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.880
difference between crack cocaine and
powder cocaine is that the powder

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
powder cocaine is that the powder
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.380
powder cocaine is that the powder
cocaine has this thing called the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
cocaine has this thing called the
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.570
cocaine has this thing called the
hydrochloride salt attached to it that

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580
hydrochloride salt attached to it that
 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.120
hydrochloride salt attached to it that
salt prevents it from being smoked

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130
salt prevents it from being smoked
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.340
salt prevents it from being smoked
now you can dissolve the powder cocaine

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
now you can dissolve the powder cocaine
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.770
now you can dissolve the powder cocaine
and in water and in shooting in your arm

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
and in water and in shooting in your arm
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.410
and in water and in shooting in your arm
and so you have the effects of cocaine

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
and so you have the effects of cocaine
 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.350
and so you have the effects of cocaine
the onset of the effects within seconds

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360
the onset of the effects within seconds
 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.229
the onset of the effects within seconds
the same is true with crack cocaine the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239
the same is true with crack cocaine the
 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.720
the same is true with crack cocaine the
effects are onset of a sex effects are

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
effects are onset of a sex effects are
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.720

within seconds now the biological

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730
within seconds now the biological
 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.539
within seconds now the biological
activity of cocaine is at the base not

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549
activity of cocaine is at the base not
 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.789
activity of cocaine is at the base not
that so that hydrochloride portion on

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799
that so that hydrochloride portion on
 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.430
that so that hydrochloride portion on
the on the cocaine powder on the powder

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
the on the cocaine powder on the powder
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.680
the on the cocaine powder on the powder
cocaine has no biological activity

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
cocaine has no biological activity
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.199
cocaine has no biological activity
whereas so that means that crack and

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209
whereas so that means that crack and
 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.770
whereas so that means that crack and
powder are the same drug they are

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780
powder are the same drug they are
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.300
powder are the same drug they are
exactly the same drug the same effect

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310
exactly the same drug the same effect
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.670
exactly the same drug the same effect
same drug Wow so it's indistinguishable

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
same drug Wow so it's indistinguishable
 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.430
same drug Wow so it's indistinguishable
to the user indistinguishable now why is

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
to the user indistinguishable now why is
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.350
to the user indistinguishable now why is
it that they prepare it that way like

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360
it that they prepare it that way like
 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.000
it that they prepare it that way like
what's the benefit of preparing it it's

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
what's the benefit of preparing it it's
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.070
what's the benefit of preparing it it's
just so delivery quicker great question

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080
just so delivery quicker great question
 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.250
just so delivery quicker great question
so one of the things that you you might

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260
so one of the things that you you might
 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.350
so one of the things that you you might
recall Richard Pryor back in the days

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360
recall Richard Pryor back in the days
 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.970
recall Richard Pryor back in the days
when he got he burnt and he burnt

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980
when he got he burnt and he burnt
 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.580
when he got he burnt and he burnt
himself with smoking so he was

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590
himself with smoking so he was
 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.390
himself with smoking so he was
freebasing

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400
freebasing
 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.740
freebasing
and so he was removing that

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750
and so he was removing that
 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.380
and so he was removing that
hydrochloride portion of the salt off of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
hydrochloride portion of the salt off of
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.210
hydrochloride portion of the salt off of
the off of the cocaine base so he could

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220
the off of the cocaine base so he could
 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.450
the off of the cocaine base so he could
actually smoke it now he was using ether

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
actually smoke it now he was using ether
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.840
actually smoke it now he was using ether
which

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850
which
 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.060
which
is highly flammable with crack cocaine

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070
is highly flammable with crack cocaine
 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.760
is highly flammable with crack cocaine
you don't now you no longer need the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770
you don't now you no longer need the
 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.560
you don't now you no longer need the
ether you just mix it up with baking

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570
ether you just mix it up with baking
 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.320
ether you just mix it up with baking
soda and water and the cocaine and you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330
soda and water and the cocaine and you
 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.390
soda and water and the cocaine and you
mix it up and you get rid of that salt

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400
mix it up and you get rid of that salt
 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.940
mix it up and you get rid of that salt
so ether is no longer needed and it's

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950
so ether is no longer needed and it's
 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.950
so ether is no longer needed and it's
not as dangerous so that's one of the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960
not as dangerous so that's one of the
 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.110
not as dangerous so that's one of the
reasons that we have crack cocaine as a

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
reasons that we have crack cocaine as a
 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.560
reasons that we have crack cocaine as a
result of that and it also it made it so

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570
result of that and it also it made it so
 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.290
result of that and it also it made it so
you could sell them in unit doses to

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300
you could sell them in unit doses to
 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.060
you could sell them in unit doses to
make the drug appear to be cheaper

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070
make the drug appear to be cheaper
 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.040
make the drug appear to be cheaper
because you also might recall in the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050
because you also might recall in the
 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.190
because you also might recall in the
early 1980s 1970s you had to buy cocaine

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200
early 1980s 1970s you had to buy cocaine
 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.290
early 1980s 1970s you had to buy cocaine
powder in bulk and that made it more

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300
powder in bulk and that made it more
 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.050
powder in bulk and that made it more
expensive crack cocaine made it a lot

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060
expensive crack cocaine made it a lot
 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.690
expensive crack cocaine made it a lot
more simple simple for people to buy it

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700
more simple simple for people to buy it
 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.680
more simple simple for people to buy it
who didn't have the kind of a expendable

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690
who didn't have the kind of a expendable

income that was required before the mid
 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.750
income that was required before the mid
1980 so essentially they just brought it

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760
1980 so essentially they just brought it
 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.490
1980 so essentially they just brought it
down to bite sized portions that's right

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500
down to bite sized portions that's right
 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.450
down to bite sized portions that's right

Richard Pryor changed his story as he
got older and actually said that he

now once crack cocaine hit the markets

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160
now once crack cocaine hit the markets
 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.129
now once crack cocaine hit the markets
what happened was that people were

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139
what happened was that people were
 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.230

yeah you're going to get some violent
 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.200

people up for selling these drugs for
using these drugs in the process what

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:18.459
using these drugs in the process what
 

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.579
using these drugs in the process what
you do is you create jobs for a select

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:20.589
you do is you create jobs for a select
 

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.380
you do is you create jobs for a select
group of people and then you don't have

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.390
group of people and then you don't have
 

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.780
group of people and then you don't have
to deal with the real issues the real

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:24.790
to deal with the real issues the real
 

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.269
to deal with the real issues the real
issues of unemployment of deprivation

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279
issues of unemployment of deprivation
 

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.040
issues of unemployment of deprivation
all of these things you don't have to

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.050
all of these things you don't have to
 

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.510
all of these things you don't have to
deal with they're far more complicated

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:30.520
deal with they're far more complicated
 

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.240
