00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt; Will China pull us out of the economic
crisis? I don't really think so. I think it

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.530
will pull itself out of the economic crisis
since it's doing a very good job of that but

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.540
more or less, each country needs to deal with
its own problems. They can export, they can

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.890
benefit from what other people are doing,
but in the end you can't rely on some other

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.550
country to do it for you. So China's mission
and China's attention most properly is going

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.620
to be focused on getting itself out of the
economic crisis. The rest of the world needs

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.550
to look at China and understand that the Chinese
economy is going to be larger then every other

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.879
economy in the foreseeable future because
it's such a large country. But the goal of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.409
economic success is not to be bigger then
China. It's to be appropriate to your own

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.749
population. So China is going to be a bigger
and bigger part of the world but each country

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:00.639
has to do it's own bit.
