00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.260
Famous Hollywood actors are sometimes thought
of as superstars, but when it comes down it

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.490
they are just humans like everybody else.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.400
And just like anybody else, they are subject
to fears and phobias that can interfere with

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.860
their daily lives.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.050
We have gathered some of the strangest fears
for famous actors like Channing Tatum, Scarlett

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.780
Johansson and many more for our list of 10

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.530
Channing Tatum – Porcelain Dolls
If you take a look at Channing Tatum, you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.490
would probably think that he is one macho
man who is not afraid of anything.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.329
Whether he is dancing in Magic Mike or wrestling
in Foxcatcher, Tatum seems to always be playing

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.410
a seriously jacked up man.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.450
But just like Superman, Channing Tatum seems
to have his own kryptonite and for him it

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.000
is his crippling fear of porcelain dolls.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.590
He says he is totally freaked out by them
and always has terrifying images of them turning

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.909
their heads around.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.100
This fear sounds like the plot of a early
2000’s horror movie that we are sure Tatum

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.759
would not have wanted to star in.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.170
Billy Bob Thornton – Old Furniture
Billy Bob Thornton is looking pretty old and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.900
beat up these days and his latest acting choices
have certainly not been his best.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.759
From what we’ve heard, Thornton can be sort
of weird to work with, but the weirdest part

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.579
about Billy Bob might be his peculiar fears.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.520
The Bad Santa actor is, believe it or not,
afraid of antique furniture.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.850
He claims that he is spooked by the old furniture
and feels like he is unable to breathe around

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.850
it.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.399
His friends have even suggested to him that
he had a traumatic experience with some antiques

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.779
in a former life.

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:53.979
On top of that one, Billy Bob Thornton is
also afraid of bold colours.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.729
Could you imagine what a wreck he would be
around a 300 year old bright red chair?

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.020
Orlando Bloom - Pigs
In the early 2000’s, Orlando Bloom was one

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740
of the hottest and biggest male stars in Hollywood.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.789
With leading roles in both the Pirates of
the Caribbean and the Lord of The Rings franchise

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.000
it seemed like he could take on anything.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Anything except for…pigs.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.300
Yes, the swashbuckling, arrow slinging Orlando
Bloom has a serious phobia of pigs.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.200
We are not sure where this fear comes from,
as pigs are actually some of the smartest

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.370
and most loving animals on the planet.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.140
Bloom has not shared any real insight or background
on this fear and it is definitely one of the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.440
weirder ones on our list.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.630
Carmen Electra – Water
Although Pamela Anderson is probably the blonde

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.340
bombshell that people think of first when
it comes to talking about Baywatch, Carmen

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.010
Electra was right there with her on that beach
looking just as good.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.900
It turns out that the filming of this often
ridiculed was actually very difficult for

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.940
Electra as she has a serious fear of water.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.320
She has said that water, specifically open
water, gives her a real sense of danger and

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.440
that being near it can send her into a full-blown
panic attack.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.630
We haven’t heard any specific behind the
scenes Baywatch stories, but from the sounds

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.730
of it, it may have been pretty difficult to
be on set with Carmen and her aqua-fear.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.220
Helen Mirren – Answering The Phone
Helen Mirren’s weird fear is actually something

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.850
that is becoming more and more common these
days.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.550
As texting becomes more popular, a lot of
people seem to afraid of talking on the phone.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.640
As it turns out, the revered actress has had
a fear of phone calls for years and has even

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.510
publically shared that she never calls anyone
back.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.510
She says that phone calls make her feel panicked
and uncomfortable.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.160
Luckily, she has a team of assistants around
her to take her calls for her.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.040
Matthey McConaughey - Tunnels
In the last few years Matthew McConaughey

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.450
has transformed himself from a rom-com hunk
to a seriously respected Hollywood actor with

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.670
great performances in Dallas Buyers Club,
Interstellar and True Detective.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.750
The middle-aged stud seems to have gotten
past his goofy type cast, but it sounds like

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.780
he still has some strange fears he needs to
face.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.020
McConaughey has let it slip that he has a
serious fear of both tunnels and revolving

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.020
doors.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.430
We are guessing this could be considering
some type of claustrophobia, but we aren’t

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.430
sure.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.319
All we know is that you probably won’t catch
McConaughey driving a Lincoln through a tunnel.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.319
Uma Thurman - Claustrophobia
Uma Thurman is as gorgeous as she is badass

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.470
and her iconic roles in Tarantino’s classics
have made her a legend in Hollywood.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.320
As it turns out, some of the great acting
that she brought to Kill Bill: Volume 2 may

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.590
have been more authentic than people thought.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.430
Thurman told the press that her screams were
completely real in the scene where she is

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:37.870
being buried alive, as this is one of her
great fears as a person with claustrophobia.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.520
Thurman is brave for facing this fear in the
name of her art and the final product was

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.520
awesome.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.610
We just hope that she wasn’t left too traumatized
after shooting the scene.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.000
Johnny Depp/Daniel Radcliffe - Clowns
Johnny Depp and Daniel Radcliffe are two huge

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.430
names in Hollywood who have both played iconic
roles in fantastical films.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.330
Their shared fear of clowns, although strange,
is quite understandable, as we have to agree

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:21.180
that clowns can be creepy.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.380
Depp has said that it is the make-up as creepy
smiles that get him, which is a bit weird

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.490
when you consider that that is what a lot
of his characters looks like in their movies

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:40.010
(Edward Scissorhands, Willy Wonka, The Mad
Hatter, etc).

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.249
Woody Allen – Everything
Woody Allen is one of most prolific writers,

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.949
directors and actors that Hollywood has ever
seen and the Academy has not been shy to nominate

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.710
his work year after year.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:59.069
Woody’s personal life has always been rather
strange and borderline creepy so it only seems

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.949
fitting that the peculiar man would have the
longest list of strange fears we have ever

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:03.949
seen.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.569
Over the years he has admitted that he is
seriously afraid of insects, sunshine, dogs,

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:14.599
deer, bright colors, children, heights, small
rooms, crowds, cancer and anywhere except

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:15.740
Manhattan.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.290
That is a long list of things to avoid so
we can understand why Woody Allen spends so

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.509
much time cooped up alone.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.610
They say the most brilliant minds are the
strangest ones, and that seems to be the case

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:35.780
here!

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.060
Scarlett Johansson – Birds
ScarJo is one of the most beautiful and sought

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.520
after actresses working in Hollywood today.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.409
Her recent movie roles range from a superhero
spy to and flirtatious artificial intelligence

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.120
and everything in between.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.219
Not only is Johansson a great actor, she also
brings a seriously stunning confidence to

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:57.689
each of her movie appearances but as it turns
out there is one thing that can shake that

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:00.000
confidence, and that is birds.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.909
That right, if you are around Scarjo you better
make sure there are no flying and flapping

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.879
creatures around her or she may just freak
out.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.809
She claims that this fear runs in her family
as her uncle also has a serious phobia of

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:14.029
birds!

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:23.059
So there’s our list of ten popular actors
who have some seriously weird fears and phobias.

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.199
Which one of these surprised you the most?

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.619

list?
