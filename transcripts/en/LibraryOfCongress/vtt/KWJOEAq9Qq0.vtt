00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.070 position:73%
Periodically I'll be putting in links to the
presentation today so that you can follow along

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.340
and get a deeper look at some
of the items that are discussed.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.960 position:59%
So today's presentation is, excuse me,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.280
today's presentation is Charles
Hamilton Houston and World War I.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.700 position:66%
Before Charles Hamilton Houston became the
chief attorney for the NAACP and a mentor

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.640
to Thurgood Marshall, he
was a young officer serving

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.070
in a segregated military
during the First World War.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.260
Curator Ryan Reft will discuss
Houston's wartime experiences

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.190 position:61%
and their influence on his way to work.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.180
A little bit about Ryan.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.210 position:66%
Ryan Reft is a historian of Modern America

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.040
in the Manuscript Division
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.840 position:73%
He is responsible for overseeing the Manuscript
Division's collections related to 20th

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.440 position:66%
and 21st Century law, journalism, domestic
policy, and in some instances culture.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.660 position:63%
Ryan was part of the team for the
Library of Congress World War I exhibit,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.620
Echoes of a Great War: American
Experiences of World War I.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.100
I'm going to go ahead and hand
over the presentation to Ryan.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.270 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.180
Thanks for coming.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.120 position:64%
Let me just get out the application here.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.650
So let's get started.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.800 position:75%
We will be talking about Charles Hamilton
Houston, Black military service for World War I.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.230
And I will scroll down to
this picture of him from 1939.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.620 position:70%
Obviously 20 years after his wartime service.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.390 position:72%
We're going to use Charles Hamilton Houston to
talk about 3 major issues during this period.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.310 position:63%
African American life in Washington, DC,
both before, during and after the war.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.580
The wartime experience of African
Americans both domestically

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.860 position:61%
and overseas Charles Hamilton Houston
will have to juxtapose with the context

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.970 position:64%
of African Americans who stayed stateside
to work in factories or elsewhere.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.740 position:72%
Obviously [inaudible] with his experience
overseas fighting, well, in the States serving

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.330 position:59%
in the military and trench [phonetic].

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.430
And finally Civil Rights.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.240 position:67%
We'll interweave Civil Rights throughout,
but we'll definitely come around to the end

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.600 position:59%
to discuss how the war shaped him, not
only him but also other Black veterans

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.450 position:59%
and even those people who didn't go to
war overseas but rather stayed to work

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.670 position:61%
in domestic industries towards the war.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.480
So what you have here is a letter
from William Le Pre Houston,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.710
Charles Hamilton Houston's
father, and dated September 1918.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:48.620 position:70%
You see the inset picture of Charles
Hamilton Houston is during his training camp,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.320
his officer's training camp, which
we'll touch on a little bit later.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.050
But I want to draw your attention
to the second page on the right.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.850
I want to draw your attention
to the second page on the right.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.530 position:56%
Right next to where you see his face
you see no one has ever left home

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.580
where parents had greater pride
in him than we have in you.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.430 position:58%
That's his father writing to his son,
and I guess it's indicative of a part

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.330 position:70%
of African American life you don't always see

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.420 position:64%
in this period particularly rising middle
class and civil [phonetic] relations.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.310 position:56%
Let me tell you about the Houstons
just to give you a sense of the kind

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.570 position:70%
of family Charles Hamilton Houston came from.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.710 position:66%
So, William Le Pre Houston was his father.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.720 position:59%
Now William Le Pre Houston was the son
of T.J. Hunn, Thomas Jefferson Hunn,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.700 position:58%
he was an escaped slave from Kentucky
who walked to freedom and then worked

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.320 position:56%
on the Underground Railroad a
couple of years through happenstance

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.330 position:59%
and serendipity crossed paths with
Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.130
Grant took a liking to him and he
became an unofficial body guard

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.040
to General Grant during the war.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.440
After the war he meets Katherine
Theresa Kilpatrick.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.740
She is also an escaped slave.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.010
So right off the bat you see
these 2 people who are not willing

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.700 position:64%
to stand for anything less than equality.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.970 position:70%
They both escaped slavery, they get
married, they have 5 children, [inaudible] 5.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.680 position:75%
Eventually they settled in the [inaudible] area,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.430
the area around DC, Maryland,
Washington, Virginia.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.200 position:72%
He establishes, Thomas Jefferson Hunn that is,
established a thriving ministry in Maryland

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.610
such that when he dies over
1,000 people attend his funeral.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.810 position:61%
His wife, Katherine, is a distinguished
hairdresser such that she is,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.110 position:72%
one of her clients is Grover Cleveland's wife.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.200
He had a thriving ministry,
she was a great hairdresser.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.960 position:64%
William Le Pre Houston himself eventually
moves away and then comes back to DC.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.920
Now why DC?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.880 position:56%
After the Civil War DC is, you know,
proximate location to both the north

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.970 position:56%
and the south particularly for freed
men and women, whose slave ended.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.060 position:70%
They moved north often to DC plus you had a
Republican government in control at the time.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.240 position:72%
The Democrats had been kind of traposed
[phonetic] during the war eventually come back

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.450 position:66%
obviously, but the Republican government
which had been friend to African Americans

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.240
and freed men and women is
a source of employment.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.310
Not great employment.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.880 position:66%
There will be racism within the government

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.290 position:61%
such that African Americans really only
get custodial clerk type positions,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.190 position:75%
but nonetheless a steady paycheck
particularly in an era when economic segregation

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.730
and discrimination and unemployment
was more than rampant.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:21.920
The movement of African Americans
to DC is pretty significant.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.180 position:72%
By 1890 you have 75,000 African Americans
living in the city of a population of 225,000.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.910 position:75%
So when William Le Pre Houston moves back to DC,
we gets a job in the War Department as a clerk.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.320
He makes money during the day and
at night goes to Howard Law School

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.390
and eventually establishes a
fairly thriving law practice.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.870
During this time he meets a Mary
Hamilton Houston, they get married.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:52.110 position:58%
She like William Le Pre Houston's
grandmother has a gift with cosmetics

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.370
and hairdressing she becomes
a hairdresser to many

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.090
of the elite white Washingtonian
diplomats, senators and such.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.970 position:75%
She made everyone call her Mrs. Hamilton Houston
and she always used the front door and refused

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.230 position:70%
to use the service entrance with her clients.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.540 position:59%
A further demonstration of the kind of
family that the Houston's were from.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.740
What W.E.B. Du Bois, the Black
leader, would call the Talented 10.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.050 position:56%
Now some people don't like that
term because it's somewhat classist,

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.070 position:56%
but nonetheless this kind of
assertive rising Black middle class.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.290 position:67%
That brings us to Charles Hamilton Houston.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.980 position:66%
He goes to instate school and graduates at
the age of 15 and becomes the only student

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.200 position:69%
at the time, only Black student at the time,
to attend Amherst College in Massachusetts.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.690 position:70%
Now what's going on at the same time that
Hamilton Houston is having these experiences?

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.970 position:61%
Well, as early as 1910 you have African
Americans from the south looking

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.330
to move north for jobs in industry.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.990 position:70%
When the war starts in 1914, that accelerates
because immigration is stopped during the war

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.310 position:75%
so the kind of labor that northern factories are
depending on was gone so they needed more labor.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.810 position:61%
They look south African Americans and
many African Americans also just wanted

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.920 position:64%
to escape Jim Crow's racism in the south.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.560 position:63%
That's not to say that there wasn't
racism in the north there certainly was,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.640 position:61%
but one primary difference between the
north and the south is that if you move

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.010
to a northern state like
Chicago or Detroit or St. Louis

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.330
as many African Americans
did, you had voting rights.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.430 position:58%
They will become a major voting block

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:20.290 position:67%
in urban elections once the great migration
kind of starts, accelerates and ends.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:25.960 position:63%
Now keep in mind this begins around 1910
and doesn't end until around 1960, 1970.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.940
Both World Wars are involved in it
and both World Wars accelerate it.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.060
This letter from Fred White to
the Baptist Association kind

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.750 position:66%
of demonstrates this larger thrust written
in 1917 before the end of the war keep

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:46.090 position:70%
in mind America had gone from being a debtor
nation to a creditor nation well before 1917,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.700
before the war, so they're
making a lot of money.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.440 position:75%
You see in this letter any information
regarding condition will be greatly appreciated.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.590
I want to get away from here
as early as possible.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.810
Let me hear from you soon.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:06.280 position:73%
If you go to this slide, as African Americans
moved north and south and keep in mind like 90%

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.890 position:56%
of them lived in the south and rural
areas before the great migration.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:16.040 position:67%
The work is moving to cities like St. Louis
and elsewhere and they start competing

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.890 position:73%
with working class whites for housing and jobs.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.080
This causes a backlash among
the white community both

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.940 position:59%
because of the economic considerations
but also because whites racism.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.590 position:66%
In St. Louis in June of that year, there's
a massive attack on Black communities

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.230 position:75%
such that 50 African Americans are killed and
millions of dollars in damage or property damage

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.370
and the Black neighborhood is
basically burned to the ground.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.480 position:64%
This happens in some other places as well
but this is the most prominent example

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.290 position:72%
and this march organized NAACP to protest that
and to bring awareness to it is indicative

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.970 position:59%
of these larger, these larger issues
going on within America due to the war

00:09:52.970 --> 00:10:01.240
but also the movement of
peoples as a result of the war.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.340 position:75%
What about people like Charles Hamilton Houston?

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.160 position:72%
Well, there was debate in the Black
community about, well, it's fine to move north

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.130
and get a job to make money and for
the war, but what about service?

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.910 position:73%
There was a debate in the Black community about
whether or not it was a good idea to volunteer

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.250 position:70%
for the government or volunteer to have to go
to war since they weren't getting the right

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.930
of citizenship they've been
guaranteed in the 14th Amendment.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.800 position:69%
But you have here a picture of the 15th
National Guard Regiment going to Camp Upton.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.120
There were camps across the
US they were segregated.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.840 position:66%
The 15th National Guard is famous for
becoming part of the Harlem Hell Fighters,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:41.900 position:63%
which are known for both their feats of
bravery and battle but also for the fact

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.890 position:61%
that [inaudible] we'll talk about later
was a member and he was a leading,

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.350 position:70%
he led their jazz band which regimental bands

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.730
from the AF spread jazz throughout
Europe as a result of the war.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.190 position:75%
Mostly these are African American musicians and
soldiers participating or playing in these bands

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.080 position:63%
and the 15th is just indicative of that.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.900 position:75%
Now what about there are others who said well I
want to serve but I want to serve as an officer.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.390 position:75%
Charles Hamilton Houston is one of these people.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.550 position:63%
The NAACP students at historically Black
colleges and universities we call HBCUs

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.480 position:64%
like Howard or Tuskegee are advocating
that there be an officer's training camp.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.370 position:59%
Now they wanted integrated camp but
that's not going to happen in this era

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.110 position:75%
and so they eventually do get a segregated camp.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.870
Now this letter that you see here
from William August Pollard we sent

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.140 position:70%
to Mr. J.E. Steinard [phonetic], Mr.
Steinard was one of the co-founders of NAACP,

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.430 position:58%
and he had asked prior to US entrance
into the war for volunteers or people

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.400 position:67%
who were interested in serving in the camp.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.880 position:58%
When the war comes many more
volunteer they get hundreds of these,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.620
we have hundreds of these in
the NACCP papers collection.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.020 position:73%
And as you can see Pollard himself is a lawyer.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.850
He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.570
They wanted men from ages 25 to 35.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.060 position:56%
They felt that a more mature group
of men would be better for officers.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.370 position:64%
I will say that when you go through these
applications and these are not official

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.800 position:58%
because this is not really how they
selected the officer's training camp,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.540
but these were early indications
of a willingness

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.700 position:69%
by many African Americans particularly among
both the working class like carpenters,

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.570 position:61%
plumbers and other skilled artisans and
workers and even those you might call

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:24.690 position:58%
in more white collar jobs, but they
were going to serve in this capacity.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.040 position:66%
And, again, the NAACP is front and center.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:34.680 position:73%
The war really does accelerate NAACP's role in
guaranteeing Civil Rights for African Americans

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.300
and really they're placed in
the larger American society,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.360
which we'll kind of talk
about a little bit later.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.070 position:61%
So, just to give you a sense of things.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:51.810 position:69%
Roughly just under 400,000 African Americans
will serve overseas in the military.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:57.480
Most of them will be [inaudible]
farm, excuse me, camp laborers,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.710 position:61%
clerks because white Americans had kind

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.180
of a schizophrenic relationship
to Black military service.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.830
On the one hand, they didn't
want them carrying guns.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.650 position:63%
In fact, they even left more uniforms in
some of the camps in the south to risk

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:14.440 position:63%
of offending southern sensibilities, but
there were about 450,000 that do serve

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.240
under French [phonetic] troops
and some under white troops,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.700 position:66%
white American officers who do see combat.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.270
So out of that 400,000 there
is a large percentage

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.690 position:70%
that do see combat, but many of them did not.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:29.930 position:72%
Their work was absolutely vital and essential,
but because of white Americans reservations

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.220 position:73%
about African Americans carrying guns they were
trying to diminish that as much as possible.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.120 position:73%
Now what you have here is William Leroy Parker.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.500
He was actually, just to give
you a sense of the other branch

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.030 position:66%
of government now remember there is no Air
Force yet; however, you do have the Navy

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.350 position:64%
and the Navy did have some Black members,
they did have mixed crews but, again,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.640 position:56%
they were occupationally segregated.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.850 position:63%
What I mean by that is African Americans
can only have the most menial positions

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.950
and we're not going to be making
any kind of officer class.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:58.810 position:59%
And after the war basically the Navy
boots out its African American sailors

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.460 position:58%
and doesn't accept new sailors that
are African American until the 1930s.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.340
The Marines don't even take
African American applicants.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.740
So the Army which was undoubtedly
racist in this period

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.150
and segregated is actually somewhat
more progressive you could argue

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.760
than the other 2 branches of
the military at this time.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.050
So just to show you that
the way these policies kind

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:24.780 position:72%
of expressed themselves is different according
to the context of the military service.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:31.440 position:69%
Now there are men as noted the NAACP college
students like Charles Hamilton Houston

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.000
and also things like the Committee
of 100, which was this collection

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.390
of 100 African American leaders
across the nation

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.660
who were advocating for an
officer's training camp.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.800
This is a letter from Secretary
of War Newton Baker

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.300 position:75%
to President Wilson basically saying look we are
going to do this to see if there's a reference

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:54.030 position:67%
to the Committee of 100 in the second line,
but if you look at the selected text there

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.760 position:58%
after considering the request I came
to the conclusion that training camps

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.800 position:67%
for colored people ought to be established.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.560 position:66%
It has now been definitely fixed that Fort
Dubuque, Iowa, with the full concurrence

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.820 position:64%
of the authorities of Howard University,
Hampton Institute and Tuskegee Institute.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:13.080 position:58%
Again, 3 examples of HBCUs that were
involved in advocating for this camp.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.930
Here you have picture of the camp.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.370 position:67%
You see Charles Hamilton Houston in the
inset at the lower right in the second row.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:24.210 position:64%
About 1,200 men entered the camp, roughly
700 or so graduated from the camp then

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.810 position:63%
about 639 officers some of them captains
mostly first and second lieutenants

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.630 position:61%
and these are mostly for just infantry.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.570 position:69%
There was no artillery training at the camp.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.920 position:70%
The camp officials themselves under General
Belluh [phonetic] were not exactly respectful

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.510 position:72%
of the Black trainees, which was not lost upon
men like Charles Hamilton Houston and others

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.480 position:72%
who did not love the camp but at the same time
did want to serve their country and did want

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.800 position:66%
to demonstrate their right to citizenship.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.200
Now, Hamilton Houston is kind
of disillusioned by the camp.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.420
So he goes off and gets artillery
training after this camp.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:02.020 position:70%
So what you see here are his buttons and his
dog tags and a bullet from the training camp.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.990
He will actually get artillery
training and go to Europe

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.250
as a Second Lieutenant in
Artillery following this.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:13.000 position:64%
Now I'm going to scroll through a couple
of pictures of Black soldiers and sailors

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.540 position:64%
from this period that we, that a donor,
Mr. Lindquist, was so generous as to give

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.340 position:61%
to the Library for our second rotation.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.970
[Inaudible], excuse me, I
mispronounced his name.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:30.970
I think what's worth noting
here is a couple of things.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.390
In France, and keep in mind France
had its own ideas about race.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:40.670 position:61%
They had, you know, colonies in Africa
and Asia and Vietnam famously, Algeria,

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:47.480 position:63%
but African Americans who were serving
in the military overseas found the lines

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.180 position:64%
of racial segregation drawn less starkly.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.310 position:58%
They could date French white women
without any attitude from the French.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.170
Now their white counterparts in
the Army were not happy about it

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.830 position:61%
and made their reservations very vocal.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:07.550 position:66%
Charles Hamilton Houston himself witnesses
a rather unpleasant exchange in France.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:13.200 position:72%
He's walking to the town center, he sees these
2 French women with these 2 white officers.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.770 position:58%
They peel off and these officers talk
to these 2 African American soldiers

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.030 position:70%
who spoke French and they kind of hit it off.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.540 position:69%
This, of course, angers the 2 white officers

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.940 position:70%
and what happens is basically you get African
American soldiers and white soldiers kind

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.130 position:72%
of crowing around the scene and things getting
very, very tense in such that violence was

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:36.460 position:56%
about to break out until an MP shows
up and tells them all to go home.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.930 position:64%
Long story short Charles Hamilton Houston
is embittered by these experiences,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.540 position:72%
these attitudes he encounters, and by the fact
he sees this other vision of what's possible,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.260 position:64%
this kind of less starkly racial culture.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.230 position:67%
That's going to make a mark on him and many
of the other veterans who serve in the war

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.930 position:64%
and that's just one illustration of this.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:18:01.540 position:67%
I think he famously says at one point the
battleground for me was American not France

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:07.160 position:70%
and that the war in some ways erased the last
vestiges of faith in the US that he had had.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.210 position:58%
Now, I think that was probably some
despair going on because as we'll see

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.370 position:63%
in a second he does go on to really work
towards a better America after the war

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:23.820
as were several other volunteers
and enlistees from the war.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.810
In relation to this, it's worth
noting that James Reese Europe,

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:35.030 position:63%
who was part of that 15th National Guard
I mentioned earlier and became part

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.780 position:63%
of the Harlem Hell Fighters you see
there the 369 US Infantry Hell Fighters.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.430
And this is something that Charles
Hamilton Houston will encounter,

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.430 position:59%
and I'll demonstrate this in a moment.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.890 position:56%
On the left in France, you see James
Reese Europe conducting his band,

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.440
on the right you see a play bill
from one of the performances.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.130 position:63%
What's very interesting about the war is

00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:00.370 position:61%
that despite the discrimination African
American troops brought jazz to Europe.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.740 position:67%
A musical form that is distinctly American.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:09.620 position:63%
Some people say it's one of America's
cultural contributions to world culture.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.670 position:66%
And despite the levels of discrimination
against them they create this musical form

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:19.160 position:72%
that will eventually bring whites and Blacks
into the same space to enjoy culture together.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:19.890
This takes time.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.000 position:72%
It's kind of like the way you might want think
of rap in the 1990s, this is kind of the role

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.170 position:72%
that jazz played, but nonetheless it's African
American regimental troops like the band led

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.210 position:56%
by James Reese Europe that do this
despite the discrimination going on.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.540 position:56%
So spreading American values culture
in a different way besides the idea

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.060 position:66%
of democracy also occurred in World War I.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:47.390 position:63%
Hamilton Houston this is not lost on him
in his diary from 1919 January in Paris.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.620 position:56%
He notes that Paris has taken to our
jazz band and our style of dancing,

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.470
notice our style of dancing
[inaudible] referenced

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.020 position:61%
to African Americans or just Americans.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.070
Colored boys are all the go.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.810 position:73%
French girls are coming up and talking to them.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.680 position:67%
So this is just a further demonstration of
the kind of world that it opened up to many

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.000
of these soldiers by going
overseas and that's not to say

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.030 position:66%
that white soldiers didn't have similar
experiences about their kind of world view

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.710 position:64%
after World War I, but it's particularly,
they did, but it's particularly stark

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:18.280 position:61%
for African Americans who are kind of
trapped in this situation in the States

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.620
where they were being discriminated
against both north and south.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.890 position:75%
Now, what does this mean for returning veterans?

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.630
Well, there's a couple of issues.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.240
One, Black veterans were
targeted for violence in parts

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.650 position:69%
of the country particularly the south
particularly if they were in their uniforms.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.090
This is one of the things
that leads the NAACP to engage

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.440 position:67%
in a anti-lynching campaign during the 20s.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:47.160 position:66%
The NAACP itself will increase 6 fold
from roughly like 9,000 members to 63,000.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.050
Many of the AF Black veterans
will join the NAACP

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:55.710 position:69%
and become Civil Rights activists
themselves besides Charles Hamilton Houston.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:02.350 position:66%
There are other examples such as Louis T.
Wright a famous doctor who served overseas

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.000
and comes back and works for
the League for Democracy.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.600 position:72%
Othello McCain another one, Aiken August Pope.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.130 position:64%
These are just 3 other men who came back
and dedicated themselves to Civil Rights.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.270 position:67%
Now what they come back to is an economy
entrenchment [phonetic] such that something

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.070 position:58%
like 40% of veterans were unemployed.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.510
You can, if it's 40% of all
veterans, you can probably assume

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.630
that for African American veterans
that number was much worse.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:31.390 position:59%
Also the summer of 1919 you had over
a dozen race riots in different cities

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.690 position:70%
such that the NAACP Secretary James Weldon
Johnson calls it red summer for all the blood

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.480 position:64%
that flowed, for all the deaths occurred,
for all the property damage as well.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.720 position:73%
This inspires Charles Hamilton Houston who had
before the war thought about becoming a pianist

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:50.720 position:73%
or some kind of artist to dedicate himself to
law and fighting segregation and discrimination

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.910 position:63%
such that he goes to Harvard Law School.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.530 position:72%
After graduating, he spends a year or two in
Europe studying international law, comes back,

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.330
becomes Dean of Howard Law School,

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:05.580 position:59%
trains a cadre of Civil Rights lawyers
most notably Thurgood Marshall.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:11.040 position:63%
They both, he will be hired by the NAACP
in the mid to late 30s to lay out a plan

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.380
for working towards desegregation
and integration.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.020 position:59%
He will bring Marshall into the NAACP.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.250 position:70%
In the 30s, he argues in front of the Supreme
Court a number of cases that will strike

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.600
down segregation statutes in
law schools and elsewhere kind

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.270
of building precedence that
they'll build upon later.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.270
He will gain the nickname
the man who killed Jim Crow.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:44.020 position:64%
Now he unfortunately dies in I think
1949 or 1950 so he never gets to see 1954

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.650 position:72%
in Brown v. Board of Ed but Thurgood Marshall,
who he brought into the NAACP who he trained

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:57.010 position:61%
in the first place, will be the one who
makes the arguments for Brown v. Board

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.170 position:59%
in front of the Supreme Court in 1954.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.840 position:61%
So, it kind of comes full circle there.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.880 position:73%
And that's just some of the ways that World War
I affected not only Charles Hamilton Houston

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.220 position:66%
but the larger African American community
and the Civil Rights movement to the NAACP

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.410 position:67%
to the movement of African American peoples
from the south to the north and west

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.350 position:67%
and to the changes in laws that eventually
culminated in Brown v. Board of Ed in 1954.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.000
And with that I'm open to taking
questions if you guys have any.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.700 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: Thank you, Ryan.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.490
That was wonderful.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.570
This is Kathy.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.180
As you can tell, we changed desks.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:35.750 position:69%
I want to ask a question about if one wanted
to spend more time researching this topic,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.400
what sources would you recommend?

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.350
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: I would recommend
the book by Chad Williams.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.240 position:56%
I'm forgetting the name of the book.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.720
Adrian Lynn Smith also has a
book called Freedom Fighters.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.440
[Inaudible] book on the larger
military I think is very good also.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.470 position:64%
I would say those 3 authors have a pretty
good handle and very readable styles.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.290
Yeah, that's where I would start.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.960
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: Ryan, I'm not
sure that you heard my question.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.120
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: No, I didn't.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.430
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: Okay,
I'm sorry about that.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.590
So, how did, we have a question
that came in from Jane.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.680
She asks how did the experience

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:19.150 position:75%
of African American soldiers during the Spanish
Flu outbreak differ from that of white soldiers?

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.760 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: Well, I'm not sure that it did.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.090 position:70%
I guess the one thing I would say is that
the Spanish Flu affected everybody regardless

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:31.210 position:69%
of race, but I would say that if you were at
the front and you were actually in combat,

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:37.150 position:69%
you were probably, particularly for European
combatants, they were often malnourished

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.850
and in conditions that made
catching the flu more likely

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.530
because there were few African
Americans who were actually

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.060
at the front necessarily
like on the battle lines.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.320 position:69%
That's not to say that there weren't because
even ones that weren't fighting who were

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.340 position:75%
in advanced positions, in logistical positions,
they were still at the front, but many were not,

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:57.290 position:69%
you know, like I said about 40,000 to 50,000
actually saw combat in the actual trenches.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:02.470 position:66%
Those 40,000 to 50,000 might be because of
malnourishment and conditions of being wet

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.920
and cold in the elements they
might have been more susceptible

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.220 position:70%
to getting Spanish Flu otherwise, but I don't
think there would have been anything due

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:16.030 position:64%
to race itself other than were they were
placed because of discriminatory policies

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:19.010 position:59%
that would have made them more or less
likely to have contracted the flu.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.620
The flu by the way kills vastly
more people than the war.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.860 position:56%
I think I've seen, and the estimates
are very big from 20 million

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:32.730 position:75%
to 60 million they really don't know, but the
flu is certainly of, of all the things that came

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.470
with war was the most deadly
aspect of it in that regard.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.200 position:64%
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: Thank you for that.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.050
I'm going to put in a survey if
you don't have any more questions.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:51.770 position:75%
I'm going to ask that you please fill out our
survey with the link that I'm going to give you.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:58.930 position:67%
And, Ryan, I want to thank you so much for
this wonderful program and hanging in there

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:05.690 position:73%
with all the technical challenges, but this
was very enlightening and very important topic.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:13.660 position:75%
So I want to thank you for your research on this
and sharing your knowledge about this topic.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.450
There is a question that came
in from Sheila and I'm not sure

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:22.600
that I understand it, but
it is what was the income?

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: Oh, right, do you mean
what were they paying the soldiers?

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.520 position:70%
Well, I know that, I'm pretty sure Black
soldiers made the same pay as white soldiers.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.800
I don't remember what it
was during the war exactly.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.200 position:56%
I do that when they do the
pensions it's a dollar for every day

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:44.800 position:75%
if you were assigned domestically and a $1.25
for everyday you were assigned overseas in terms

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.320
of the pension, the bonus pension
that was paid out in the 30s.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.080 position:64%
Off the top of my head, I don't remember
what pay was for white and Black soldiers

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:58.060 position:66%
in the military though I'm sure that
officers made more and privates made less.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.910
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: And what
about when the soldiers returned

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:04.670 position:64%
in terms of the treating of the veterans?

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.000
What was the differences there?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.890 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: Oh for, you mean in terms,
you mean in terms of rehabilitation?

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.410
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: Yeah.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.920 position:61%
Yeah, the services that were available.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.360
Was there a marked difference?

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.310
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: Right, good question.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:23.840 position:63%
So, disability is one of the things that
really kind of pops up out of the war.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.330
You had the really, I wouldn't
say it's the first modern war but,

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.910
because some people have
cited the Russo-Japanese War,

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.750
but this is really the first
time you have people surviving

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.320
with wounds we had not expected.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.220 position:66%
So you do have a lot of people coming
back with limbs that are amputated or gone

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:48.470 position:67%
and the government does make efforts to set
up rehabilitation in 1918 but really a lot

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:54.600 position:69%
of the war only about 156,000 veterans who
suffered disabilities take advantage of that

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.230
and many of them white and
Black alike complained

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:02.140 position:75%
that when they were undergoing rehabilitation
the person assigned them to try and get them to,

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.110 position:61%
for training for a new vocation many
of the soldiers, again white and Black,

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.180 position:59%
complained that the person didn't
listen to them and tried to force them

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.420 position:70%
into service vocations based on kind of class

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.910
and racial prejudices they had
been carrying with them already.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.240 position:56%
Black soldiers though are treated
worse in the rehabilitation process.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.300
They complain about just
general racial disrespect.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.570
They sometimes had to pay out of
pocket, their housing was often not

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.650
as good as that of white veterans.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:33.990 position:64%
There's also the in 1917 the Red Cross
establishes an institution for disability

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.480
in New York City though it was not
initially established for the war.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.910 position:56%
Because it's established around 1917
many soldiers will actually go there

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.290
for rehabilitation as a result.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:49.310 position:72%
So that is a lucky accident, but that was a
non-government entity that was supplying that.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.130
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: Interesting.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:50.790
Thank you.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.350 position:67%
We had another question come in from Craig.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:58.380 position:58%
He asks does the Library have photos
from any of the other training camps?

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.850 position:70%
One of my great uncles trained at the 17th
Provisional Training Camp at Fort Des Moines.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.650
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: I can't comment
on what training camps we have.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.600
I think there are several.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.600
I think we probably have more like
Camp Upton and places like that.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.620 position:69%
We actually have post cards from other camps

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.360
but I don't remember seeing
one from Fort Des Moines.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.790 position:58%
In general, that's something I have
to check with Prints and Photographs.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.090
We did look at some camp photos for
sure in some of the collections.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.260
We do have them.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:28.360 position:72%
We don't have them such that they're displayed
necessarily in the exhibit however I got

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.290
with other means of kind of
conveying that information.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.190
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: That's great.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:37.890 position:67%
And the thing that I'll add to that is that
on every single page at loc.gov at the top

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.670 position:75%
of the page there is Ask the Librarian function.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.770
And there is a section for
Prints and Photographs.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:51.230 position:58%
So if you have a question specific to
format, specific to particular topic,

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:57.700 position:70%
you may submit the form and you'll get a
response within 5 business days and that goes

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.450
for where Ryan works with the
Manuscripts Division as well

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.420
so that you can ask a researcher
at the Library of Congress.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.910 position:59%
We have another question that came in.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.600
Was the Red Cross originally
founded as an American organization

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.920
and then expanded internationally
or was it originally set

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.930 position:56%
up as an international organization?

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.880 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Ryan Reft: That's a good question that I'm
not sure the answer of for the first part.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.460 position:70%
I don't, I know that it becomes International
Red Cross and I know that it happens,

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.680 position:70%
this all happens in a period where there are
more organizations that are starting to think

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.310
about international realities
and creating themselves as kind

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.810 position:56%
of these transnational international
organizations.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:38.150 position:63%
I have a feeling it started in the US
but I can't say that with any authority,

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.470 position:58%
but this is the period where the Red
Cross does become more international.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.240
So, and that's just due in parts

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.210 position:75%
of the war itself creating a more international
world even though there is a lot of retrenchment

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.560 position:75%
after the war in terms of protectionism
particularly in the United States and elsewhere.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.460 position:64%
It does ultimately lead to a more
international world full of organizations

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.760
like the Red Cross particularly
post-World War II.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.550
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: That's great.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.390
Thank you, Ryan, thank you, J.K.,
Craig, everyone for your questions.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.640
This is going to conclude
our program for the day.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.110
As I mentioned before, it is being
recorded and we will have it posted

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.400 position:73%
to the exhibition site within the next 2 weeks.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.900
I want to thank you for joining us
and I want to especially thank Ryan

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.950 position:63%
for a really wonderful discussion today.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.020
Thank you all.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:30.100
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.470
