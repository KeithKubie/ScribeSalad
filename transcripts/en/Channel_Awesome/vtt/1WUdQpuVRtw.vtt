00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.840
Hello. I'm the nostalgia critic.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.980
I remember it so you don't have to

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.860
Let's talk about White washing.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.340
STOP

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.000
obviously this is a subject everyone has a strong opinion on.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.540
especially given the news recently

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.060
two big movies have just done previews

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.120
a trailer for marvel's Dr. Strange

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.280
and a still from Paramount's remake of ghost in the shell

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.040
the internet flipped

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.280
as both films were accused of whitewashing

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.280
which for those who don't know

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.020
is when a person who's supposed to be of a certain ethnicity

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.680
is suddenly played by a white person

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.900
in ghost in the shell's case

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.040
people were upset because Scarlett Johansson was playing

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.540
what was originally an asian character

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.840
and in Dr.Strange's case

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.680
a Tibetan man is now being portrayed as a Celtic woman

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.840
played by Tilda Swinton

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.000
this is a touchy subject that's making

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760
a lot of people feel enraged

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.920
white washing is an art that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.580
let's face it white people

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.200
have mastered bullshitting for years

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.480
which is all the more reason to get upset

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.600
people can't belive that it's still going on

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.400
is America? home to so many different cultures and races,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.540
still resorting to the same offensive tricks?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.680
have things really gotten better or have we just

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.060
disguised our hippocrasy even more?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.080
well for Ghost in the Shell originally

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.680
a Japanese property

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.960
there is one group of people for the most part

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.100
doesn't seem to have that big a problem

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.700
the japanese

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.860
granted we obviously can't speak for all of them but

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.040
when asking random Japanese people on the street

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.020
what they thought of the casting of the film

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780
most of them seemed pretty okay

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.900
not only did they say she looked like th character

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.020
but they also knew it was an american film

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.880
and american films have mostly white actors

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.640
I guess in hindsight if japan did

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.680
their version of say superman

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.100
and they casted a japanese actor in the role

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.520
Americans probably wouldn't care

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.560
I think most people are assuming to that because

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.620
the film is made by americans it

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.520
it probably woudn't take place in japan

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.200
the same way the ring or the grude were asian properties

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.120
but weren't filmed in asia or starred asian people

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.160
or the same way they remade 7 samurai in the old west

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.360
uh the first time

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.520
in fact there's tons of remakes

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.380
or foriegn films that have done this as well

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.260
as replace the actors with white americans

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.120
but it never got criticized

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.680
even to this day

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.360
so why is this one getting so beaten up?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.320
well there could be a couple reasons

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.800
one could be the character struck such ac cord with

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.880
anime fans that the identitiy was so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.700
tied to her Japanese heritage

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.740
or most likely too America

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.180
has so many Asian-American actors

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.220
some of which are even featured in the film

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.820
that it seems pointlessly silly not to cast

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.360
one in a leading role

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.760
they are still after all americans

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.880
I also keep hearing that there's no Asian-American

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.360
actors big enough to gurrantee a good box office

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.600
first of all there's tons of Asian-American actors

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.520
and many of them are very sucessful

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.960
but i know what they mean  when they say none of them are "as big as scarlet johanson"

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.440
sure star power is important but

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.840
guess what some of the highest grossing movies

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and franchises don't have huge names as the main characters

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.640
who heard of Daniel Radcliffe before harry potter

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.800
who heard of Christopher reeve before superman

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.060
most of the names in avatar aren't that huge

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.040
Harrison Who?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.120
Star What?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.860
Bomb!

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.320
But what about Dr.Strange's case?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.280
is there really a bias against Tibetan actors?

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.640
Well

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.700
yes but not in the way that you think

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.260
you see 18% of Marvel's motion picturing comes from

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.120
China

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.880
And guess who China is not exactly the biggest fan of?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.980
correct

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.500
so the choice was made to change the character so much

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.780
from a male Tibetan to a Celtic female

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.220
the hopefully it would be so different that nobody would notice

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.000
You have totoally underestimated

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.440
You're geeky fanbase

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.940
we get upset when a good locking white man

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.340
plays a good looking white man

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.840
on the one hand it's good to know that the American

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.200
filmakers don't have any real anti-Tibetan

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.840
agenda, I mean, they want their bussiness

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.260
to make as much money as they can but

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.460
on the other hand it's still ethically wrong

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.440
they're putting a prejudice ahead of not making more money

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.380
but let's be honest this happens a lot in business

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.560
like all the time

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.880
and let's also be honest

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.900
we've let very simmilar choices

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.340
slide recently

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.980
[mocking voice] oh what you mean blackface or that slanty eye make up that

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.780
never fooled anyone come on

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.580
that's not us that's the generation before us

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.440
that stuff is but you've been okay with a lot more than you think

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.660
in fact we've grown up with it mostly in cartoons

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.960
Apu and Dr.Hibert white guys

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.920
Aladin and Jasmine White people

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.900
Hey you remember all those animes staring Japanese people?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.160
practically all of them are re-dubbed by white Americans

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.120
in fact there was even a Cowboy Bee Bop movie in the works

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.480
for a while that was going to star Keeanu Reeves

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.000
And people were actually excited about it

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.840
well wait a minute

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.640
how come this gets a pass but

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.280
Scarlet johanson doesn't

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.920
But it doesn't stop there

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.820
Belle's not french

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.820
Tina's not a girl

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.720
tommy's not a boy

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.240
Neil Patrick Harris isn't straight.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.500
Robin Williams isn't gay

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.760
and speaking of comedies

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.140
I don't think the cast of life of brian are actually

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.360
Israeli

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.700
In fact Britan and a lot of other countries have

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.920
posed as us a lot

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.200
Some of our most famous American roles are

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.580
played by actors who are not American

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.660
and it even works the other way around

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.780
Preformers like Alfred Molina or Roma Maffia

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.300
They've played almost every ethnicity there is because

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.000
they look like almost ethnicity there is

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.960
infact something that's getting a lot a praise is

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.940
when a role that's meant for a white actor

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.560
is suddenly being played  by a person of color

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.980
and I know what you might be saying

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.080
how is a person of color playing a white person's role

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.060
any different from a white person

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.180
playing a person's of color role?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.840
STOP

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.000
I'm not going where you think I'm going

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.100
the answer is obvious

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.240
BECAUSE of the white washing we've had in the past

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.960
America clearly hasn't had the best record

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.900
in terms of treating people equally

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.320
and it's obvious that there has been years of

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.600
keeping women, foreigners and anybody of color as somehow

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.680
lower than white men in both society and our media

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.520
because of this we're more open to allowing

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.240
the gender or race of what was a white male change

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.240
to refelct the growing enviorment

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.640
but even taking race out of it

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.240
there's tons of simmilar white washing going

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.000
on that we've just allowed

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.100
I was actually shocked when they did Lord of the Rings

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.060
and they didn't hire little people for the job

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.100
now don't get me wrong the actors were all great

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.860
I had no problem with their preformances

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.480
but the only time little people were used was when you saw the back of their heads

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.200
Why are we okay with that?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.040
They can play supportive munchkins or

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.960
elves but starring roles was

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.360
asking too much?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.900
There's plenty of actors who are little people

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.640
and it's not like these were gigantic names

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.340
I mean nobody's going to see the Lord of the Rings because it starred Elija Wood

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.260
They're gonna see it because it's lord of the rings

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.720
This is still a very simmilar form of

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.760
white washing

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.820
Height washing?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.380
Copyright!

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.360
You probably don't think this is a Big deal

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.880
but if we kept to this exact way of doing things

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.360
We wouldn't have the 31 flavors of kickass that

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.340
is Peter Dinkladge

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.100
This guy is so popular

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.920
now that they're writting him in roles

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.360
that weren't even meant for a little person

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.600
if your were to recast Peter Dinklage's role

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.620
on Game of Thrones with say

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.180
David Tenant on his knees

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.280
Even though that's a brilliant actor

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.440
people would be offended to no end

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.840
we love Peter Dinklage

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.420
and the idea NOW of putting

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.060
of putting David Tenant in there

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.000
would be insulting and bad taste

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.160
Yet we just gave the hobbit trilogy

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.720
millions of dollars and complained about differences

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.680
from the book

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.720
rather than the fact that we're spending god knows how much

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.420
to have people walk on their knees and

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.580
and do opticall illussions because we just didn't

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.460
put a real little person in there

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.940
however as much as those prejudices

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.020
seem really worthy of anger

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.660
it's hard to tell where to draw the line

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.760
more transgender roles are opening up

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.580
not all of them played by real transgenders

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.480
though many say they should be

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.360
well I guess okay that seem legit

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.040
but there's also Deaf roles out there

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.120
and shouldn't they be played by real deaf actors?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.200
well I guess that's a good point Marlee Matlin won an oscar

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.960
and she's Deaf

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.600
how about Jamie fox in Ray, in fact

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.840
most blind roles

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.640
shouldn't they be played by real blind people?

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.420
I guess- how many blind actors are there?

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.400
how about switching out gary scennese in forest gump with a person who doesn't actually have legs

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.480
that seems like a very narrow field.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.140
Mr. Garrison on south park is a gay

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.640
man who had a sex change

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.140
and turned lesbian

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.700
shouldn't she be represented by an actor

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.580
who is the exact same thing

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.700
on occasion i think you've just gotta act

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.820
again it's not always easy to figure out

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.380
what's gunna be crossing an ethical line

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.160
there's not rule book for this kind of stuff

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.320
and the world is constantly changing

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.780
and it's not always easy to know what's acceptable or not

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.920
acceptable and by how many

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.720
a small minority? or mass majority?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.880
does that even matter?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.640
the best way I can think to deal with it

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.660
is treat it similar to when we cast adults as children

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.520
would we prefer children? yes

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.880
but we also understand child labor laws the fact

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.760
that they grow up and their voices change

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.740
so we're not as hard on people as

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.680
an adult steps in to voice them

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.520
but really we could be if we wanted too

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.160
there's lots of child actors looking for work

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.220
so is this a prejudice against children?

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.400
by now you're probably figuring out that white washing

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.120
height washing gender washing - whatever your load of clothes is.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.000
it's all kinda selective

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.540
I love a lot of these preformances and actors

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.480
even if they're not technically what the character is supposed to be

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.100
we  love to point to our slippery slopes and

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.600
this will lead to anyone getting offended and

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.200
anyone pretending to be someone else

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.800
or the slipper slop that white people will be playing

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.320
all roles untill the end of our days

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.040
I don't think either will happen because that line

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.960
we're apearently never supposed to cross

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.880
has never fully been drawn

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.820
there's pros and cons we can see past race

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.400
and gender and open our minds to a good preformance

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.760
but we can also feel really uncomfortable when someone

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.440
can't see what they're doing can be really harmful

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.280
maybe it all comes down to intent but

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.940
even that seems kinda political

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.720
The Wachowskis did a movie about reincarnation called cloud atlas

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.360
where every person plays every gender and ethnicity you can imagine

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.440
people are still on the fence about whether this is brilliant

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.440
or amazingly uncomfortable

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.100
or even coherent but that's a different matter

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.280
It's made even more interesting though seeing how both directors

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.640
have come out a transgender women

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.560
so to their credit is any famous director

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.840
know anything about living in another body it's these two

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.640
but what if other transgender or ethnicities are offended

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.640
by what they do

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.400
is it suddenly nonsense?

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.520
have we just made these two the official voice on the subject?

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.800
again there's no clear answer

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.920
with that said it seems very unlikely that

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.840
the makers of Ghost in the Shell and Dr.Strange were trying to

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.960
push any pro-white agenda

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.160
people making these kind of movies hate bad press and

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.080
they don't want that kind of bad press attatched

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.800
they probably just thought of all the times people were okay with it

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.760
especially in the last couple years and decided "eh

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.680
they'll probably be okay with it this time too"

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.920
that doesn't make the issue go away but if

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.640
you want people to be fair and open to what the problem is

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.720
you also have to be fair and open to what caused it

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.840
so what exactly am I saying?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.400
we should be okay with roles played by white people even though they're not meant for white people?

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.200
Hell no this is America

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.440
A growing Hodge Podge of variety and diversity

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.560
and we should explore it as much as we can

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.640
if you see a problem where those possibilities are being limited

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.600
bring them up.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.000
we deserve to see every opportunity that can be made available to us

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.120
I guess what I'm saying is

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.120
don't act like you've never been guilty of it

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.640
because we all have

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.960
we're trying to get better and we're trying to see things from a reasonable point of view

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.200
but nobody is perfect and nobody is going to accurately represent

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.960
everybody's feelings on everything

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.680
we've all overlooked things for our benifit

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.480
whether it's been in media or even in real life

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.920
we know we should do better and we're trying to do better

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.120
but we can't act like our acceptance of it in the past hasn't

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.840
somehow played a part in all of this still happening

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.960
it's not likely either of these movies want bad press

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.520
so letting them know our concerns will certainly help them change in the future

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.360
the sad fact is relations with anybody different

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.360
is always going to be a complicated issue

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.600
even if we don't want it to be

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.720
and with so many in America celebrating

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.880
the growth of limitation and

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.680
and dis interest in variety

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.760
it looks like it's going to stay complicated for a while

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.840
all we can do in media is make people aware of even more opportunities

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.920
without claiming that we're higher than them for noticing it

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.600
because clearly we don't notice everything

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.240
we do let things slide and not always for the right reason

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.960
all we can do is try our best and encourage others to try their best

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.360
in a country that's still 63% white people chances are

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.160
there's still going to be white washing in the near future

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.440
and bring up the mistakes that you see

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.320
but always remember you've probably made them at some point too

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.560
and if we want human beings to change you have to

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.760
acknowledge  that you yourself are a human being

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360
well that was uncomfortable.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.300
umm

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.520
boogers

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.480
[Laughing]

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.400
still got it

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.320
I'm the Nostalgia Critic I remember it so you don't have to.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.960
coming next week- it's the film that brought 3D back to the cinema

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.840
even if you didn't want it to be

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.320
it's spy kids 3D game over

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.320
but you can see it now under Vessel's ad-free early acess

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.320
just $3 a month to see tons of people's videos

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.760
early as well as other extra features

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.400
cheack it out and get the early scoop

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.900
Hey this is Doug Walker doing the charity shoutout

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.060
You want to help out with a charity that Mara Wilson is a part of?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.040
of course you do this is project "UROK"

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.680
This is a none profit organization who's mission is to

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.480
who's mission is to create a catalog of accessible funny meaningful videos

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.400
for teens struggling with mental health issues

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.640
done by adults who have been there before

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.040
in doing so they provide practical assistance

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.000
but also and perhaps more importantly

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.960
a sense of comfort belonging and hope

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.080
there's a ton of videos you can check out done by a variety

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.600
of people. you can either donate to their cause

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.120
watch and get some information for a possible problem you may have

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.560
or even make a video

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.040
you can help by giving advice on something

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.280
that was tough to go through but you survived

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.920
and can help others to live with

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.560
Mara Wilson did one about OCD and depression

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.840
Will Wheaton did one about Anxiety

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.760
the list goes on, it's a really cool

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.240
creative idea with a bunch of ways that you can contribute

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.480
click on their site or youtube page to see how you can be helped

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.360
or you can help out yourself
