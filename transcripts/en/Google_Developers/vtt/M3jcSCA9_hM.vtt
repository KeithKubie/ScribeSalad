AMIT FULAY: Good afternoon, and
welcome to the session.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.100
My name is Amit Fulay.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.690
I'm the product manager
for Google+ Hangouts.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.880
And I'm going to be joined
here today by

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.340
Pamela Fox from Coursera.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.980
We have a great session for you
today, because I'm really

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.260
excited to talk about two
areas that have seen an

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.270
amazing amount of innovation
happen in the last few years,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.070
online education and social,
specifically Google+.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.030
This is what you can expect
in the next 30 minutes.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.880
I'm going to talk a little bit
about the profound change that

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.000
we're witnessing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.710
Then, I'll jump into some of the
Google+ features that can

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.260
help, and we'll look at a couple
of case studies of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.190
actual implementation of
some of these ideas.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.610
So let me start by reflecting
a little bit on the change

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.360
that we've all seen.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.239
We've gone from an era of
traditional classrooms to

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.910
connected classrooms, from a
time when all of us carried

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.960
huge amounts of textbooks in our
backpacks to a time when

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.820
we carry a small number of
devices in our pockets.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.910
We can now learn at our own pace
and only advance once we

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.100
are sure of having mastered a
concept, and we can pretty

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.060
much do that from anywhere.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.260
This change has been
revolutionary.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.810
It has brought the costs
of education down.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
And not just for a lucky and
privileged few, but for

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.380
everyone, without ever
compromising on

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.630
the quality of content.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
But the change has not
all been easy.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.240
There are challenges with
online education.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.580
And if you were to talk to some
of the students who've

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.520
taken these courses, who tried
to study these concepts, these

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.260
are the common refrains you're
going to hear from them.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.960
They will say, this is hard.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.980
A lot of times, this is a
very lonely experience.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.940
And honestly.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.790
it's incredibly boring
at times.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.280
Now, if you were to look at the
data, that's the picture

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.010
you would see.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.450
This is a typical dropout funnel
for an online course.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.020
At the top, you have the number
of students entering

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.290
and enrolling.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.320
And as you progress through
these tasks, as you go on with

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.060
the course, only a
small number--

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.880
staggeringly, only 5% of the
students who enroll--

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.820
actually end up completing
the course.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.200
Right?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.660
That's a huge problem.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.170
As it turns out, learning still
requires certain basic

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.330
elements that we were used to
in the physical classroom

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.870
experience.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.210
It requires help and direct
connection with your tutor.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.720
You need help.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.960
You need to go up to a teacher,
ask about your hard

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.530
questions, about
your problems.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.890
You still need hands-on
experience.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.010
And collaborating and studying
in a peer group is always much

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.850
better, both for your learning
and for the fun aspect, than

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.100
doing it all alone.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.550
So as you heard in the keynotes
today, we at Google

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.220
are very passionate about
online education, about

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.460
learning in general.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.300
And so some of us on the Google+
product team and the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.610
engineering team, we really
started thinking about these

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.890
problems hard and said, what
are the tools that we can

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.510
build that can help people who
are actually innovating in the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.500
education space?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.070
And social learning is the term
that's kind of talked

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.040
about a lot, but the whole
idea is simple.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.710
While we've see the benefits
of online education--

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.170
whether it's bringing down the
cost, providing access to

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.740
people who would have never
dreamt of getting education

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.230
from Stanford and MIT if they
were not in this country,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.190
we've brought that access.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.779
That's been all positive
change.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.490
But there are certain social
aspects that are critical.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.360
The engagement that we had in
the class, in the peer group,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.470
out of the class--

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.440
that was very critical to the
whole learning experience.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.930
So how do you do that?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.100
How do you mimic that positive
aspect of a classroom

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.790
experience and bring it to
the online education?

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.680
So first, let me talk about a
few features that we have in

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.400
Google+ that can help.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.400
I'm not saying they'll solve it
all 100%, but that can help

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.930
provide that virtual classroom
feel when you're doing an

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.800
online course.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.110
So the first one is Hangouts,
and we had a big launch today.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.930
It's the communications
product that we have.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.910
You can message.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.700
You can do multi-way video chat
with up to 10 people.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.600
Now, imagine a study group,
which has students from Asia,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.260
Africa, all studying the
same course online,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.740
from the United States.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.250
How do you interact
face to face?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.730
This is one tool that
can really help.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.740
And we'll see in the second part
of the session some of

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.110
the experiments that we did and
kind of the learnings we

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.750
had from that.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.970
The other product that
we have is what we

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.150
call Hangouts On Air.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.880
This is our broadcast product.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.490
You can have a conversation with
up to 10 people, but you

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.450
can stream it live over YouTube
using this product.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.730
It's the same setup.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.910
It's easy to use.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.370
You don't need a studio
environment.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.440
You don't need any production
work that you need to do in

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.980
order to create one of
these broadcasts.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.340
Now, this product, it turns out,
is really helpful if a

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.970
teacher wants to interact with
certain students and others

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.650
want to tune in.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.410
So you can imagine during office
hours that a professor

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.430
sets a time, takes questions
from the students.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.810
They all come in, but there's
a lot more students who can

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.370
watch that live or watch that
recording archived.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.070
Because through this product,
we actually

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.510
put it back on YouTube.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.160
We archive those clips
on YouTube that you

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.410
can go back and see.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.420
Google+ Sign In actually gives
you a single, unified identity

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.700
that you can carry across all
of these things, whether you

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.170
have an app, whether you're
using Drive, whether you're

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.190
doing Hangouts.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.060
All of that is just enabled
by the single sign on.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.296
And there's another feature that
we have in Google+ called

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:44.200
Communities.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.150
We launched this a few months
ago, which enables people,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.510
based on certain common
interests, to come together.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.960
These are not people who are
your friends or you know

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.130
necessarily in your real life.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.030
But you share a common thread
with which you can interact in

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.730
this Groups kind
of environment.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.050
And again, we'll see examples
how this has proved to be

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.650
really popular with
students as well.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.070
So instead of talking a lot
more about these features,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.970
what I'm going to do is
show you an example.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.070
And this example is from
MIT Media Lab.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.800
They have a course around
creative learning, which

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.750
traditionally was never held
online, which they

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.470
collaborated with Lifelong
Kindergarten,

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.190
and they put it online.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.390
And here's what the
professors did.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.290
They first created a lightweight
sign up.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.950
Just put in your email address,
and you sign up for

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.200
the course.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.130
None of the registration
deadlines, submitting forms,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.930
none of that stuff.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.350
So it's really easy.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.600
Then, they created a Google+
Community for these students,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.400
and almost 10,000 of these
students who enrolled for the

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.540
course actually became members
of this community.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.330
And it became a rich forum for
them to feel like they're part

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.550
of a class.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.570
So they would post things,
interact, ask questions, all

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.130
of that stuff through
this Community.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.930
And the third thing that the
professor did was actually

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.740
start streaming all his seminars
at Hangouts on Air.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.320
So anybody can tune in.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.570
If they miss a particular a
seminar, they can go back to

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.130
YouTube and watch it.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.290
And again, it plays well
with the whole

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.640
self-paced learning module.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.400
You only proceed once you've
mastered the concept.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.955
You can pause, rewind, do it
at you own pace pretty much

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:34.169
from anywhere.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.390
The second interesting thing
that happened when these

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.049
professors did this was how
students reacted to that.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.940
And it turns out that if you
give tools in the hands of

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.520
students that are going to help
them create classroom

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.600
experiences, they're going
to really run with it.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.340
So students in this particular
class created more than 450

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.100
Google+ Communities.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.640
Think of these as study groups
that we were all accustomed to

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.740
when we went to school.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.760
Here's a map showing that class

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.050
enrollment across the world.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:09.070
And the reason I put it up here
is it's very important.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.530
All of online education
is pretty much

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.710
geographic by nature.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.210
You have students enrolling
from different

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.170
parts of the world.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.090
This is what your typical
class would look like.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.610
And that's where the challenge
and the tools come into play

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.820
when you want to create a more
cohesive community and provide

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.950
the classroom feel.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.912
What else did the students do?

00:09:30.912 --> 00:09:32.510
You know, when you
give them tools,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.660
they'll do creative things.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.420
So here was the attempt of all
these students to get to know

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.890
each other.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.190
They created these
intro videos.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.110
They put it on YouTube,
and they kind of

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.750
shared with each other.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.066
So now, you can imagine you're
taking a class by MIT.

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:51.220
You don't live in the US.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.160
Your students who are actually
enrolled with you are from

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.250
different parts of the world.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.450
You've never met them, but you
have some tools in your hands

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.150
to be able to mimic
that experience.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.290
Here's what the MIT professors
in the Media Lab told us about

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.440
their experience with
these tools.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.120
These are quotes from them.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.370
I'm not going to read them.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.100
As you can see, these are the
tools that will help them

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.290
actually make the transition,
bridge the gap between online

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.610
and offline learning
experience.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.170
We've worked with a number of
partners who've been using

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.880
Google+ features in some form or
the other, integrating some

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.550
of these things that
we've done.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:44.190
But I specifically want to call
Pamela from Coursera to

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.910
come and talk about
her experience.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.880
And the reason we kind of chose
Coursera to try out a

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.920
bunch of things is they share
a common passion with us in

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.150
making improvements, but
also the philosophy

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.610
around let's tweak.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.410
Let's iterate.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.160
Let's learn, and let's get to
a place where our tools can

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.360
actually add a lot of
value to the users.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.300
So Pamela's going to talk about
what experiments they

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.050
did with us, what their
learnings were.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.210
Take it away.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.460
PAMELA FOX: Hi, everyone.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.350
How are you?

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.670
Yay.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.240
All right.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.900
Cool.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.470
So I'm a product engineer
at Coursera.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.110
I work on the student-facing
features, which is perhaps

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.950
what you would experience
if any of you have

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.190
actually used it.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.530
Can you raise your hands
if you have?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.130
Wow.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.360
All right.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.385
I've never had that many people
raise their hands.

00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:33.150
I guess we're kind of
mainstream now.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.030
Only in San Francisco.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.510
Everywhere else, no
one's heard of it.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.360
So for people in other parts
of the world, Coursera is

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.910
massively open online
courses offered by

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.540
universities and partners.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.250
We actually have courses from
the Exploratorium in San

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.710
Francisco, which I think is
awesome, for any of you guys

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.290
who've actually gone there
and wandered around.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.900
So we have a huge range
of courses.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.670
My mom just finished
Heterogeneous Parallel

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.860
Programming and got 110%.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.260
And we also had a bunch of
people just finish Canine

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.330
Theriogenology, which is, I
think, dog reproduction.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.200
But I haven't taken the class,
so I'm not an expert.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.710
But the point is that we've got
courses across a bunch of

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.090
different genres and a lot of
different sorts of students

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.810
taking them for lots of sorts
of different reasons, right?

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.140
And there's usually about 50
going on at any time, because

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.520
our courses do actually
run on a schedule.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.400
And we do that on purpose
because, actually, of social

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.030
learning, right?

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.640
So if there are people taking
a course at the same time as

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.240
you, you're more likely to
actually be able to form a

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.410
cohort and feel like there's
other people doing it, right?

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.490
So when I tweet out that I'm
working on my homework for a

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.990
class, I'll just get people who
randomly tweet back that

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.490
they are too.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.690
And it's like, oh,
right, right.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:44.120
I forgot.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.130
There's actually people
doing it with me.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.380
This is cool.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.040
However, we've got
tons of classes.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.900
And in any given class, we've
got between 30,000 and even up

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.500
to 160,000 students enrolled.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.830
And they're from all
over the world.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.870
But when you get into
the class, this is

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.850
what it looks like.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.470
It looks like a class.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.610
It looks like it's
got lectures.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.970
It's got assignments.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.500
It's got a lot of text.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.190
And you look at it, and you
don't see people, right?

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.940
You just see stuff
you have to do.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.310
Which is cool, because the
classes can be quite

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.800
interesting.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.560
But we need a people aspect to
everything we do, right?

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.730
So we've been trying to figure
out how can we actually help

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.130
students feel a connection to
other people inside this

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.730
learning experience, right?

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.040
And we can think of this in a
few different axes, right?

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.250
So what are the different
forms of

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.810
communications that we have?

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.660
So we have synchronous
communication, where we can

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.230
talk back and forth
very quickly.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.710
And that's good for having
very excited, energetic

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.530
discussions.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.850
We've got asynchronous
communication, so we can post

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.520
in a forum thread, and then a
few hours later, somebody else

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.250
posts back.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.760
And we can take our time to
come up with responses--

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.320
also known as email.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.190
And these are both valuable
forms of communication, and

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.620
they both have their uses.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.290
I used to work on Google Wave
in Australia, and it did an

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.890
awesome job at having both
asynchronous and synchronous

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.780
communication, despite
everything else we

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.500
can say about it.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.560
PAMELA FOX: But the point is
that we need both of those

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.800
forms, right?

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.210
And we also have the difference
between in-person,

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.470
face-to-face communications
and online, potentially

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.190
faceless communications,
right?

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.080
And we love these in-person,
face-to-face communications,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.150
because it's like, wow, I
can actually see you.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.420
And I know there's people
watching me, which feels a lot

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.090
better than giving
a talk to no one.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.140
So you feel much more intimate
when you can

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.700
actually see somebody.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.210
You have this whole
different level of

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.870
intimacy with them, right?

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.900
But then, you can have this
other approach where you're

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.090
online, maybe you're even being
anonymous, and there's

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.710
actually good reasons for
having that as well.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.740
Maybe you are in a controversial
class.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.900
We have classes on AIDS and
reproduction, contraception,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.830
all sorts of things that
people don't always

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.230
necessarily want to be
forthright with their person.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.860
Because there are weird people
in the world that might do

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.250
stuff to you.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.890
OK.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.940
So we want both of these
axes in terms of

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.990
communication, right?

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.580
So what do we have there?

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.750
We've got our forums
and wikis.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.540
Some people form online
chat rooms.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.160
They use stuff like StudyRoom.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.660
We encourage people to go to
meetup.com and actually create

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.620
meetups and meet up in person.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.876
That, of course, doesn't scale
that well, because there's not

00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:26.580
going to be somebody in every
single part of the world--

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.790
not yet.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.580
So where does Google
Hangouts fit in?

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.140
It's synchronous communication,
right?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.360
We can talk back and forth
over the video.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.220
And it's also kind
of in between

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.170
being online and in-person.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.300
It's almost like it's
in person, right?

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:45.290
So me and Amit, we actually
never met until an hour ago.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.880
But it was OK, because I have a
Hangout with him every week.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.070
And I feel like I know him,
because the Hangout software

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.450
doesn't have that skin softening
thing yet or

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.350
anything, so I am really
familiar with his

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.468
wrinkles and stuff.

00:15:55.468 --> 00:15:57.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.670
PAMELA FOX: So it's cool.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.810
So it's so close to being in
person that I've actually lost

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.590
track of who I know in
person and who I've

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.910
just seen in a Hangout.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.160
So it's this really interesting

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.920
part of the axes here.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.890
So we're interested in using
Google Hangouts to help our

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.970
students connect in a
few different ways.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.860
So first, we want to help
students connect to teachers.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.520
So unfortunately, we
have a massive

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.930
student-teacher ratio, right?

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.170
In a typical class, like when
I teach classes on the

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.020
weekends, we usually try
to have 1 to 10 ratios.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.160
That's a good ratio.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.140
Online, we've got ratios like
1 to 25,000, right?

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.490
Which is kind of huge
and ridiculous.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.770
How can students feel connected
to a teacher when

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.870
they're just one of thousands
and thousands of students?

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.570
So one of the things that
teachers do is they hold these

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.740
Google Hangouts On Air.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.310
So a specific example here.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.680
This is from the Irrational
Behavior class.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.900
And that class had this peer
assessment, and people weren't

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.860
particularly happy with the way
that they got graded by

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.450
their peers.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.630
And they had a lot of questions
about how the system

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.550
worked and about the rubric, and
there was a lot of angst

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.960
going on in the forums.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.829
And so the professor, he did
respond in the forums, and he

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.150
did post some announcements.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.020
But he just wanted to make
sure that students were

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.310
actually feeling like he
was listening to them.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.930
So he put together a Google
Hangout, and we also had a

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.920
Coursera guy in there as well.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.170
He invited 10 of the vocal
students from the forums in

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.099
there, and he invited everybody
else to watch this

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.319
Hangout and invited everyone to
submit questions via Google

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.190
Spreadsheet.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.390
So this really helped students
feel like Dan was actually

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.870
listening to their questions.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.670
So just like Larry Page finished
the keynote by just

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.690
saying, hey, if you have a
question, come ask me, that

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.760
kind of helped us feel more
connected to Larry, right?

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.970
Like, oh, wow, Larry is just
going to respond to us just

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.130
live like that?

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.140
So the same thing here.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.890
It helped students feel like the
professors actually care

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.540
and like they potentially
could have a

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.410
connection too, right?

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.690
If you see another student
connecting,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.290
you're like, oh, wow.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.240
OK, they're just like me.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.560
I guess we're all on
the same level.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.380
And so we have lots and lots
of professors that do these

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.630
Google Hangouts and solicit
questions beforehand

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.260
and stuff like that.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:07.300
And generally, everyone
loves this format.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.520
So that's cool.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.100
But there's a harder problem,
and that's how do we help

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.350
students connect to
other students?

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.780
And the reason this is hard is
because we've got thousands

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.330
and thousands of students,
right?

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.230
And I actually wrote JavaScript
to try and generate

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.280
as many dots as I could
to get on this slide,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.390
but that's only 25,000.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.610
I'm sorry.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.550
So we wanted to help students
connect to each other, but the

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.600
problem is that they obviously
can't connect to every single

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.680
other person.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.810
So how do we get them
into groups?

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.760
Or how do we decide which clumps
of them are actually

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.780
going to connect, right?

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.650
Because for something like a
Hangout, the ideal number is

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.240
somewhere between 5 to 12.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.740
You don't want to have 25,000
people in a Hangout.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.730
That would be a really, really
interesting experiment that we

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.530
could try maybe later today,
but not for this.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.530
So let's go over a few
things that we tried.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.580
So our first experiment was in
the Think Again class, which

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.400
is a class on reasoning
and arguing.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.110
So it kind of made sense that,
hey, these people might be

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.020
interested in having
some discussions.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.350
They are in an entire class
about discussing.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.200
So what we did is that we
created these Hangout rooms.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.850
And we had three rooms that were
persistent, so they were

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.520
always there, which was
Meet Someone New.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.760
And we tried to encourage people
not to use pickup lines

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.040
in that one, but, I mean, if two
people are going to meet

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.385
in Coursera, I think that's
also cool too.

00:19:27.385 --> 00:19:29.140
So let me know if that
happens to you.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.770
I think that's why my mom
is taking the Parallel

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.890
Programming, honestly.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.210
We have Talk About the
Class, and then we

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.130
have Discuss Lectures.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.470
Those are our general rooms.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.770
And then, the professor would
actually come up with

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.450
discussion questions relevant
to each week, and we would

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.890
create five new rooms each
week about that.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.210
So at any point, the students
could go into these Hangout

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:54.150
rooms, and whoever was there,
they could chat with, right?

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.410
So that was interesting.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.270
And in terms of code,
it was pretty easy.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.890
We just used some JavaScript,
and we stuck a few divs on the

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.030
page and had the JavaScript
populate those divs.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.590
And the Hangouts team helped
make these widgets for us to

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.170
try this out.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.030
Now, for our second experiment,
we did this in the

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.690
Irrational Behavior class.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.570
And I was excited about this,
because I actually did take

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.440
this class.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.150
I finished it last night at 2:00
AM, the first class I've

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.570
ever finished.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.090
So that was really exciting for
me, to use my own product.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.630
So we had 140,000 students
enrolled in this.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.670
And here, what we did is we did
scheduled Hangouts, right?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.330
So the first experiment was
like, OK, what happens if we

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.290
just have rooms that you can
just enter all the time?

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.120
And we saw problems there with
the timing in terms of people

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.280
entering at the wrong times
and being out of sync.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.190
So we did these scheduled
Hangouts.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.310
And here, you could actually
see a list of upcoming

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.590
Hangouts, and the TAs would
come up with lots of cool

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.320
ideas for interesting
Hangouts.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.590
And you could say,
I want to attend.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.620
You would get a thingie
on your calendar.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.350
You would get a reminder
from your calendar.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.280
And you go and enter the
Hangout and chat with

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.050
everybody who is there, right?

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.390
So that definitely helped a lot
in terms of getting people

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.540
all there at the same time.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.780
So the class is officially
over as of last night.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.630
And there were 65 Hangouts over
six weeks, and every user

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.120
saw an average of five other
users during those Hangouts.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.590
Pretty cool.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.410
In terms of the code, once
again, really simple

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:22.960
JavaScript.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.300
I'm kind of embarrassed
to put the code here,

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.140
because it was so easy.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.060
And I was like, thank you,
Google, for making it this

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.820
easy, so I can go into
other things.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.680
And we also experimented
with letting

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.710
students schedule Hangouts.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.375
And we would actually prompt
them in the forums to say, oh,

00:21:37.375 --> 00:21:40.690
hey, maybe you'd like to start
a Hangout on this topic.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.870
And that would just link to this
page that would tell them

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.160
how to start a Hangout, right?

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.280
So we didn't actually
see as many students

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.290
doing this, very few.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.600
And we're not sure exactly
why that is.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.960
Maybe they're intimidating.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.320
They don't feel like they have
the authority on it.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.470
They seemed to much prefer
joining the Hangouts that were

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.400
started by the TA.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.520
So here's what we learned.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.200
So students really, really liked
being able to visualize

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.670
their classmates, right?

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.910
The fact that they could
actually see other people in

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.900
the class was like, oh, wow, I'm
really in a class, right?

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.320
So in San Francisco, I have the
fortunate ability to just

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.020
walk around and find people that
are using Coursera, which

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.810
is really cool.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.540
But if you're walking around
Chile or Argentina, you may

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.760
not just randomly find
Courserians on the street.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.680
So being able to actually see
that there's other people

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.050
doing it along with
you was really,

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.090
really powerful, right?

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.230
Even for the people who didn't
even have good conversations,

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.360
they were like, it
didn't matter.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.360
It was just cool that
I could see people.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.040
There were people.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.880
I guess we're all just really
lonely on the internet now.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.630
And they also really liked
diverse opinions.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.080
Both in our forums and in our
Hangouts, we hear this a lot,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.790
that students really, really
appreciate getting thrown into

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.230
these situations where they're
kind of forced to hear other

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.800
people's opinions.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.320
Because they just happen to be
in a class with these other

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.450
people, and they can't help but
hear from people from all

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.130
over the world.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.650
So the Hangouts help with that
quite a bit as well, because

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.800
you actually get to have real
discussions with people from

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.880
all over the world and learn
quite a bit about how things

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.840
work everywhere.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.800
So that's what they loved.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.050
But we also learned a lot
about what made for good

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.660
Hangouts and what would improve
the experience.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.470
So this is what good
conversations need.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.750
I could not be talking about
Hangouts, and all of these

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.310
things would still
be true, right?

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.350
So you need etiquette.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.220
You need some sort of rules that
you're following to have

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.380
good conversations.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.530
Now, you might think
it's obvious.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.440
But remember, we have people
from all over the world.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.370
So the etiquette that we may
have for our conversations may

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.020
be different from the etiquette
that they have for

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.360
conversations in other
countries.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.880
So we would actually have people
write these wiki pages

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.690
and forum posts with suggestions
of etiquette, and

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.780
people would banter back and
forth about what the correct

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.840
etiquette was.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.440
And that's where the discussion
came up about is it

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.690
appropriate to pickup
people in Hangouts.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.060
Because in some countries,
maybe it is, right?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.200
So etiquette is actually
increasingly important when

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.910
you're doing something online
in a massive setting.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:02.890
Shared language.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.965
It seems obvious, but if you
get on a Hangout, and you

00:24:04.965 --> 00:24:07.060
don't speak the same language
as the other person, it's

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.385
going to be a little hard
to communicate.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.060
So that just makes everything
harder.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.960
Focus.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.520
So this is why we tried to have
Hangouts that were around

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.280
particular topics.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.990
When we just had really general
Hangouts, like the

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.540
Discuss a Lecture, people didn't
necessarily know what

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.240
to talk about.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.940
But when the Hangouts were like,
hey, design your own

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.940
irrationality experiment
following this rubric here and

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.080
talk about what you're
going to test, it's a

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.050
very focused topic.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.210
And people come in there, and
they know that they're there

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.770
for a reason, right?

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.580
Flow--

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.390
so flow is something that's
difficult to have in

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:43.070
conversations, right?

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.720
I'm sure we've all been in
awkward conversations where

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.760
it's like, it's going
really great, really

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.400
great, really great.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.890
And then suddenly, it's
like [RASPBERRY].

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.260
And you're like, aww,
this is awkward.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.930
So that can be even worse
online, because you can't kind

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.500
of wander away and regroup
and join other groups.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.520
You're kind of just sitting
there, staring at each other,

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.420
going like, OK, all right, we've
got to get this flow

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:02.860
back, right?

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.450
And it's just something that
happens with human

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.560
conversations.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.090
It's not always got that
perfect flow, right?

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.310
So people found it helped when
there'd be somebody there who

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.130
was really good at guiding
the conversation.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.740
And that's sort of a certain
personality type, the people

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.965
that are really good at
realizing that a conversation

00:25:18.965 --> 00:25:21.360
is about to dip and kind of
bringing it back up, maybe

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.410
bringing it back into
focus on something.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.490
And that would make for much
more successful conversations.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.330
Now, of course, timing.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.142
As I was saying, when we just
did the rooms that you could

00:25:30.142 --> 00:25:34.260
just enter at any time, we found
that people would just

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.010
enter at any time,
and it would just

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.120
always be off, right?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.780
So you want to try and get
people starting that Hangout

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.420
at roughly the same time, so
that they're not sitting

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.530
around and waiting.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.550
I mean, any of you guys who've
had a video conference

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.280
probably know what I mean
about timing, right?

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.850
You really want to get that
timing really well.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.570
And finally, comfort.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.960
Some people may not feel
comfortable suddenly being on

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.720
video alongside five other
people, video faces that

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.390
they've never seen
before, right?

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:05.060
So how can we make people
feel more comfortable?

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.920
Maybe having the TA there helps,
or maybe having them

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.120
meet those people in the forums

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.780
before, maybe that helps.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.520
So that's something we found
as well is that the comfort

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.270
level was not always there.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.480
But those are just some
experiments that we've done

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.370
over the last few months.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.720
And we want to do a lot more
experiments, right?

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.710
That's kind of what we do.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.810
We just keep doing experiments
to see what works and learn

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.640
and try and do the
next experiment.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.460
Because every time we do an
experiment, we think we're

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.250
going to have a result.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:35.960
And we're like, oh.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.500
Oh, I see.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.210
We got something we
didn't expect.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.780
Because here's the thing about
humans-- they just do the

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.150
damnedest things, right?

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.260
Especially in groups.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.020
Actually, just any time.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.220
So we've got a few ideas in mind
for what we want to do in

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.060
the future.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.580
So one thing that would be
great is to actually time

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.880
Hangouts around watching
lectures.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.930
So if you're watching a lecture
say, hey, there's also

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.200
five other people watching
this lecture.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.230
Maybe you want to discuss
it afterwards, right?

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.070
And there, you've both
got the timing, and

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.330
you've got the context.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.420
You've got something to discuss,
and you've got people

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.630
discuss it with.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.870
And luckily, I think in a lot
of our classes, we do have

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.650
enough people watching lectures
at the same time that

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.490
we might be able to do that.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.650
Another thing we can do is
having Hangouts more strictly

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.090
around discussions and say,
hey, there are five people

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.760
that are actually on this thread
watching it right now.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.680
Maybe you'd like to just jump
into a real-time Hangout and

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.540
just chat it out there.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.060
Especially for these threads
that just get

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.450
really long, right?

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.980
It'd be much better just to
do that face to face.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.090
And finally, I really want to
improve the comfort level

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.280
people have by actually
creating

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.540
groups inside our classes.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.660
So we don't really have
groups right now.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.170
People can create groups on
social networks if they want

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.440
to, but we really want
to start creating

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.590
groups for our students.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.100
Like say, hey, we found 10
people in San Francisco that

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.600
seem to be on the same
commitment level of you.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.670
Maybe you'd like to
form a group.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.970
Here's some forum threads.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.140
Here's some Hangout tools.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:55.710
Go at it.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:56.620
Do something, right?

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.773
Because when you're in a group
with people, and you're kind

00:27:58.773 --> 00:28:03.440
of in a persistent group,
then all these things

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.280
are going to be better.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.850
Because you're going
to start to feel

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.060
comfortable with each other.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.780
You'll start to have
a shared etiquette.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.150
When you decide to have a
Hangout together, you'll all

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.650
actually show up, because you
have a social pressure to

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.000
actually feel like you're
supposed to be there.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.730
So all of that can actually
improve everything that we've

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.190
talked about.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.480
Now, the Google Hangouts team
didn't tell me that they're

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.240
also adding chat to it, so I
just added this slide in.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.200
So the interesting thing is now
Google Hangouts actually

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.930
will encompass from synchronous
to asynchronous,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.780
because we've got this chat
tied into it too, right?

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.150
And I think that will be
really interesting to

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.820
experiment with and see, hey,
what happens if we give

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.470
students rooms where they can
start off in a chat mode and

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.820
then go into video mode once
they feel comfortable, right?

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.540
Because I think that could
help with ramping up our

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.760
comfort level and helping people
find a topic, right?

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.000
You start off chatting.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.960
You realize there's actually
something that you do want to

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.040
chat about with the other people
in the chat room, and

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.780
then you go into that
Hangout because

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.390
you've decided on that.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:05.760
So I'm excited to experiment
with that once the team gives

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.010
me access to it.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.280
So generally, what I learned
at Coursera and what I keep

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.930
learning is that it's really
important to experiment and

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.650
try and come up with lightweight
experiments.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.740
So I wrote as little code as I
could in order to come up with

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.790
these experiments.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.350
And track everything.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.870
You'll learn from students,
and you'll learn that

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.160
communities interact in very,
very interesting ways.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.340
And it's a pretty cool
thing to do.

00:29:38.295 --> 00:29:41.869
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:41.869 --> 00:29:45.290
AMIT FULAY: So I think
we're right on time.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.300
That brings us to the end
of this presentation.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.160
I do want to emphasize the
last point that Pamela

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.390
referred to, which is this is
broadly applicable to all the

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.660
online communities
that you have.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:00.050
So while we talked a lot about
online education and learning

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.910
and students and professors, I
think if you have a community

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:07.850
of developers, sites where you
have people discussing health

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:13.460
issues, sports fans, whatever
community it is that is

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.060
geographically distributed, is
tied together by a shared

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.610
interest, I think we have
features like Google+

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.920
Communities and Hangouts that
can help you bridge that gap.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.600
So we would definitely love more
of you to participate in

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.170
kind of experimenting these
things with us.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:34.420
And there's a short link here
where you can submit a form if

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.920
you're willing to kind of work
on some of these things.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.580
If you have ideas, get
in touch with us.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.980
We have a team that kind
of does partnerships.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.310
They'll be monitoring this.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.720
We would love to
work with you.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.600
With that, I want
to leave a few

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.800
minutes here for questions.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.713
So if you can use the mic,
that'd be great.

00:30:54.605 --> 00:30:55.100
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.470
My name is Jan.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.890
I liked your early presentation
with a lot of

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.180
photos of smiling kids.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.420
However, a lot of them seemed
to be under 13.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.730
Can you comment on under 13?

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:13.930
What's Google+ doing, Hangouts
availability in K-12?

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.270
AMIT FULAY: There's nothing
I can add beyond what our

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.982
established policies are, which
is you need to be 13 or

00:31:18.982 --> 00:31:22.290
over for signing
up for Google+.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.110
So I don't think we're
changing any

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.360
of that right now.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.250
AUDIENCE: The information on the
lessons learned, did that

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.525
come from surveys distributed
after the course, or was there

00:31:32.525 --> 00:31:35.670
a Hangout extension that you
use to measure people's

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.955
responses to the questions
asked?

00:31:37.955 --> 00:31:41.910
How did you gather the data that
you used to say, these

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.160
are people's responses?

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.100
AMIT FULAY: So if I get your
question correctly, how did we

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.130
get the data on how
the Hangouts were?

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.900
AUDIENCE: In how people were
using the system, what they

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.600
liked about it, what they
didn't like about it.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.880
AMIT FULAY: So we did a
combination, as we do in all

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.820
the products that we do at
Google, a combination of

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.230
quantitative, looking at
metrics, as well as

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:04.570
qualitative studies.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.010
So we actually had a form that
we asked students to fill

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.770
every time they did a Hangout
on the Coursera site, so we

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.750
got some amount of
data from that.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:17.350
We looked at our metrics, kind
of how many students would

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.630
initiate a Hangout, how long
they stayed, how big the

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:22.720
sessions were, what were the
number of students in every

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.410
given Hangout, and was there a
correlation between number of

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.060
participants and the length
of the Hangout.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.590
We also talked to
the professors.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.740
We talked to the TAs and kind
of got data from them around

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.970
what their experience was,
what could be better.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:42.710
So we used multiple channels
here to collect data.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:43.240
Go ahead.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:43.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.990
I'm part of a group of
Australian teachers that use

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:49.930
Hangouts to talk about cool
stuff every week, and we

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.820
really want some way of
having a back channel.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.610
So there's 10 of us in the
Hangout, and we're discussing

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.430
things between us.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.390
Only one of us is talking at the
time, but then there are

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.896
lots of other teachers who are
using Hangout on Air who want

00:33:01.896 --> 00:33:03.080
to ask questions as well.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.450
At the moment, they're sort
of half on Twitter.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.050
You mentioned there's a Google
Spreadsheet the professor used

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:08.920
to ask questions.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.340
Is there any better way of doing
this, or can I hope for

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.840
one to come?

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.570
AMIT FULAY: That's
great feedback.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.790
We've actually heard that, not
just in the education space,

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.670
but from a lot of folks who've
been using Hangouts On Air,

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.110
whether it's in media
or other celebrities

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.320
doing Hangouts on Air.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.430
And one of the things that they
have asked for is how can

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.020
we better interact with people
who are watching on.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.910
And so, we've got that feedback,
and we'll definitely

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.158
try and solve that.

00:33:32.158 --> 00:33:32.570
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:36.010
So I'm with a start-up that
works on helping students take

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:41.240
notes on videos on sites like
Coursera, and it leverages

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.020
Google Docs.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.620
And we're wondering what Google
would be doing for

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.520
start-ups that try to build
these on this ecosystem.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:49.980
AMIT FULAY: Absolutely.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:55.890
So we actually have a platform,
an API set that,

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.790
just like Google Docs, is an app
that you can run within a

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.710
Hangout or YouTube,
for that matter.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.925
We have an API that's
available publicly.

00:34:03.925 --> 00:34:05.880
We launched it last year.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.130
So you can use that to write an
app, a note-taking app or

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.590
whatever you want to do to
enhance that learning

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.570
experience.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.090
We actually do have a session
later in the day at 4:00 PM on

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.719
some of the changes we've done
in that Hangouts platform,

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:21.000
which I highly recommend
you should attend.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.389
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Christine
from Scoot &amp; Doodle.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:28.449
And we have been building inside
Google's Hangouts API,

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.060
and I was hoping you can share
with all of the other

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.400
developers that are looking to
hear more about what you're

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.800
doing with the Google
Hangouts API.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.449
AMIT FULAY: We have a
lot more to share.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.110
I actually just did a
post with all the

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:39.940
changes we've made.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.080
We're moving to a new, faster
development model, and there's

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.679
a lot of new functionality
that we've added.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.310
Again, there's a session by
Richard Dunn, who's a

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.199
technical lead on the platform,
later in the day at

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:51.960
4 o'clock today.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.469
I think you should attend.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:54.199
And thanks for your work.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.730
Scoot &amp; Doodle, for those of you
who don't know, was one of

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.610
the early partners we had
building on top of the

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.830
Hangouts platform, and they
have a great app.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:05.540
So great to see you,
Christine.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.280
I have a question for Ms. Fox.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:13.000
You had there a lot of
feedbacks, and some of them

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.540
were surprising, and I didn't
have a chance to read it all.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.280
Could you share your really
surprising insights and

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.980
feedbacks on what was quite
unexpected results of your

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.590
experiments?

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.570
PAMELA FOX: Well, I guess we'll
be sharing the slides

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.480
later so that you can
look over the actual

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.520
quotes I had on there.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:40.410
I pulled them out of forums
and out of surveys.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:46.340
I think the things that we were
surprised at was the kind

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:51.372
of ways that students wanted to

00:35:51.372 --> 00:35:51.700
participate in the Hangouts.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.560
So we see a lot of students
want to participate in

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.260
Hangouts, but they don't
necessarily want to be the

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.180
ones that start one.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.440
So we kind of expected to see
a lot more students want to

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.320
start Hangouts.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.150
So I think what I've learned
there is that I want to do

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.980
more experiments where
actually the

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.260
professor kind of says--

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.900
because we do have this one
professor in psychology that

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.490
he wants to end every week by
saying, all right, this is

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.560
what we talked about
this week.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.930
Now, go sign up for a slot and
discuss this for 30 minutes.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.830
So he's actually going to
direct his students.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.850
He wants to direct them to do
it, because it's exactly what

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.730
he does at college.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.890
At college, he'll have a
physical sign-up sheet around

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:29.380
there, right?

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.680
So there, you would feel more
license to actually be signing

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.300
up for it, because somebody has
told you this is something

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.530
we want you to do.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.600
It's really intimidating to be
the one that says, I'm going

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.550
to start a conversation.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.780
That's hugely intimating,
right?

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.010
When I'm at a party, I

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.070
literally hide in the bathroom.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.010
Because it's scary.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.570
But if somebody goes and invites
me into conversation,

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.610
and says, hey, this is Pamela,
she's part of the group.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.250
I'm like, all right, cool.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.500
I will totally participate.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.440
So it is very scary to be the
initiator of anything.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.540
So if we can license people
and enable students to do

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.930
that, I think that they'll
end up having really good

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.780
experiences that they
want to have.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.610
I think it's like a lot
of social experiences.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.190
If it was up to me, I would just
spend all my time being a

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.910
hermit and not going outside.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.930
But then when I do outside, I
actually quite enjoy myself.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.660
But somebody has to give me that
license and has to enable

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.025
me, so I want to enable more
students to do that.

00:37:22.025 --> 00:37:22.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.950
AMIT FULAY: And just to add to
that, I think that was one of

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.450
the big surprises
for me as well.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.530
Which is, as engineers, we're
just trained to think about

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.490
how to solve certain things
technically, like what are the

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.180
features I can add, how can
I do things that's easier.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.040
But there are some real social
kind of issues, like if

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.540
students are shy to speak up, if
there's a language barrier,

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.250
they feel awkward, they don't
want to turn on the camera.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.180
And those are much tougher
problems to solve.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.030
So I think that's both daunting
as well as exciting,

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.060
because we need to figure
out how to do that

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.170
in an online world.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.760
Go ahead.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.340
My name is Belle from
Cal Poly Pomona.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.630
I'm an instructions designer for
university higher ed, and

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.590
I really liked about the
Google+ Community part.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:08.560
But we are actually big
in accessibility part.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.890
I know that you guys do
a lot of the video,

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.670
audio, those thing.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.620
Can you guys talk about some
kind of accessibility, like

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.740
how to integrate with the
closed captioning?

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.350
If there's a video synchronous,
asynchronous, or

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.820
anywhere, Hangouts
on Air and stuff.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:25.430
AMIT FULAY: So as you know,
Google has Translate and a lot

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.080
of the technologies.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.680
On YouTube, we have
closed captioning.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.560
So some of these broadcasts,
when they're archived, we can

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.860
turn on the closed captioning.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.400
So that's one solution
that exists.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:39.570
In terms of real conversations
and how do we bridge that

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.130
language barrier, I think that's
a much tougher problem.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.850
But there's a lot of people at
Google who are looking at it.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.890
You saw some of the
conversational search stuff

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.530
that we are doing.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:52.530
You can imagine using some of
that technology that we have

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.970
and see how we can kind of
bridge the language barrier.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.490
But it's not something that's
going to happen overnight.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.240
But there's folks working
on that problem.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.710
PAMELA FOX: I think with our
videos, because we actually

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.530
have an accessibility contract--
since we work with

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.480
universities, we have
to be accessible--

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.420
so all of our videos must
have English subtitles.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.420
So I think what happens for some
of the Hangouts is that

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.930
they get recorded on Air, so
they can download the video.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.890
So I think they upload them to
our platform, which then kicks

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.660
off a subtitling job with the
subtitle service we use.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.930
So I think actually for a lot of
the office hours that they

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.875
do with Hangouts on Air, the
professors do create

00:39:28.875 --> 00:39:29.270
subtitles for them.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.760
So you could still create
subtitles using

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.315
other services as well.

00:39:35.315 --> 00:39:35.762
AMIT FULAY: All right.

00:39:35.762 --> 00:39:37.740
It's showing me 30
seconds left.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.950
If there are other questions,
we've got a

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.730
short amount of time.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:41.600
I can take one more.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.510
If not, thanks a lot for
attending the session and

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.670
coming

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:50.958
to Google I/O. [APPLAUSE]
