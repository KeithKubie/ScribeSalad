00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.980
Pulling this all together. The problem is that design is tough. And design

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.790
mistakes can be costly. Our chief weapons against complexity are abstraction and

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.470
refinement. So we must make sure that our refinements do what we expect. One way

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.040
to do this is, is to systematically think about what refinements must guarantee.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.560
Here they are, the top level specification, matches the requirements document.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.773
Operations at each level preserve invariants. Each refinement is adequate.

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:31.877
Each refinement is total. And the concrete operation preconditions and

00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:34.960
post conditions model their abstract counterparts.
