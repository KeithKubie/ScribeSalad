00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.620
In summary then, the organization of a

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.270
computer system is consistent enough that many of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.810
the key operating system concepts apply to all

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.670
of them regardless of size and capacity. On

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.970
the other hand, these differences should not

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.660
be ignored and advances in hardware have helped

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.630
drive innovation in operating systems, so that we

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.690
can get the most out of their capabilities.
