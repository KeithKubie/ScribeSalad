- ON BEHALF OF THE FBI,

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.038
I'D LIKE TO THANK
ALL OF YOU ABDUCTEES

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:08.308
FOR BEING HERE AND PARTICIPATING
IN THIS STUDY.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.911
WE ARE HOPING
THAT YOUR COMBINED EXPERIENCES

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.846
CAN CLEAR UP
SOME OF THE MYSTERIES

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.184
BEHIND THESE DISTURBING
ANAL PROBE ABDUCTIONS.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.186
WE WANT TO KNOW WHY.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.187
WHY?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.355
[echoing]
WHY?

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.090
- I'M GONNA BE RICH.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.625
OH, THIS IS
THE GRAVY TRAIN, MAN.

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:27.194
I'M GONNA HAVE SO MUCH MONEY,
MAN.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:30.330
I'M GONNA DO A BUTTER CARVING
OF MOUNT RUSHMORE

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.299
IN MY BACKYARD.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.066
WHAT THE [bleep]
IS THAT?

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:41.308
[screams]

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.377
- HERE'S THE NEW
TRACKING DEVICE.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.945
- WHERE ARE WE PUTTING IT?

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.780
- THREE GUESSES,
AND WHO'S "WE"?

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.782
- [sighs]

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.784
THIS IS WHY I MAKE
THE BIG BUCKS.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.818
- OH!

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.620
- WHAT THE--THIS--

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:54.354
THERE'S SOMETHIN'

- [groans]
- AH!

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:56.957
- OH.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.724
- SOME SORT OF BAG.

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.726
- HMM.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029
IT APPEARS TO BE
A ZIPLOC POLYMER.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.297
[slurping]

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:06.166
JACKPOT!

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.705
- THIS SHIT'S GOOD.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.341
[laughs]

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.078
- OH, SUCH SMOOTH SKIN.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.852
- YOU THINK SPACE
JUST STOPS SOMEWHERE?

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.454
- WHOA!

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.156
- [purrs]

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.058
SHH, DADDY'S HERE.

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:36.296
- THAT WAS AWESOME!

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.331
- WE NEED MORE.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.403
- KEEP LOOKING!

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.406
TELL ME IT WAS NOT JUST
A STATISTICAL ANOMALY!

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.307
MOTHER[bleep]!

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:50.177
- WE WANT TO KNOW WHY.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.745
WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY
BE LOOKING FOR

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:55.282
THAT COULD JUSTIFY THE PAIN
AND HUMILIATION.
