00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.500
The Miami Dolphins are a
team extremely rich in history.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.710
The Chicago Bears are one
of the two oldest teams who

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.040
are still playing in the NFL.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.380
In my opinion, any
time the Eagles lose,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.960
that's a good thing.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.670
RICK HARRISON: Earlier, a
guy brought in some playbooks

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.040
from the 1966 Miami Dolphins.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.000
It's an awesome piece
of football history.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.710
But it's so unique, I really
don't know how to price it.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.250
So I asked my guy Jeremy to
come down and help me out.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.750
The Miami Dolphins are a
team extremely rich in history.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420
And to see a playbook
from their days

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.420
when they joined the
AFL is really cool.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.420
It was guys like Bob
Griese, Larry Csonka,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.040
and legendary coach,
Don Shula, who

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.710
has won more than any
other coach in the history

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.170
of the NFL, and went on to
accomplish what no other team

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.080
has accomplished before,
the perfect season, which

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.750
they did in 1972.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.920
Playbooks themselves, they
date back over 100 years.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.880
And in a sense, they contain
all of the team's secrets.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.580
It's literally like
learning another language

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.330
between all the blocking
assignments, and

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
different routes, and packages.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.670
What is something
like this worth?

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.170
I mean, is there even
a market for this?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.080
Itinerary and all, you're
looking at about $400.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.540
RICK HARRISON: Thanks
man you're the best.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.040
You bet, Rick.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.250
RICK HARRISON: So how
much do you want for them?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.960
How about $275?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.540
How about $200?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.040
CUSTOMER: How about $270?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460
Oh, yeah, you're
really going down.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.080
Well, they're probably
worth more now than they

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.080
were when they were printed.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.620
No, no, when
they were printed,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.790
they were probably worth a
lot of money to somebody.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.960
[laughter]

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.420
I guess you have
a point there.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.210
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you $250.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.790
And I don't even know
why I'm going that high.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.710
$260?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.710
$250.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.960
They are going to
sit for a while.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.120
That's a deal.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.620
All right.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.790
All right Man, let's go
do some paperwork, buddy.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.540
COREY HARRISON:
Earlier a guy came

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.250
in with a football signed by a
bunch of the '67 Chicago Bears.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.620
Before I can make
an offer, I've got

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.500
to make sure these
signatures are legit.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.330
So I called in Jeremy
to help me out.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
The Chicago Bears are one
of the two oldest teams who

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.000
are still playing in the NFL,
and as far as fan bases go,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.170
they have one of the most
loyal fan bases of any team

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.330
out there.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.670
What concerns you have?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.580
There's a lot of
signatures on this ball.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.500
Plus, I don't know what to
price it as because they're

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.960
relatively famous players.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.620
Absolutely.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.420
And as we all know, Brian
Piccolo isn't around anymore.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.330
Now, if we were dealing
with an official ball, mint

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.620
condition signatures,
we'd be talking

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.000
several thousand dollars.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.420
Now, I'm looking at
some of the signatures.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.580
We have to determine
whether or not

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.170
these are even authentic ones.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.000
Those signatures, they are
100% spot on exactly what

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.170
I want to see in a 1967 ball.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.500
Now, the other
signatures, you've

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.830
really got to focus
on the characteristics

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.290
of the autograph.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.830
If you compare the Brian
Piccolo signature here

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.540
to the one on the
football, these

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.790
are contrasting signatures,
very typical for what you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.460
see in a clubhouse signature.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.790
They were signed by somebody
else other than the athlete.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.790
The Sayers, like the
Piccolo, in my opinion,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.120
these are clubhouse autographs.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.830
Considering the
kind of ball it's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.880
on, which ones are real versus
which are in the clubhouse,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.540
you're looking at
maybe tops $1,000.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.380
COREY HARRISON: Jeremy, man,
I appreciate you coming in.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.330
Any time, Corey.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.120
All right, see ya later.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.710
All right, man,
so you heard my guy.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.790
He says, it's worth
probably around $1,000.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.960
I mean, I've got
a feeling this is

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.380
going to sit around for years.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.790
I'd offer you
around $100 for it.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.620
I'll just keep
holding on to it.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.500
Right on, man, appreciate it.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.170
RICK HARRISON: Earlier a guy
brought in a 2004 New England

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.540
Patriots Super Bowl ring.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.000
But the manufacturer's
mark doesn't look right.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.540
So I called in my buddy who's
an expert to take a look.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.920
Super Bowl 39, this is
the Super Bowl where

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.080
they beat the Eagles 24-21.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.710
And in my opinion, any
time the Eagles lose,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.750
that's a good thing.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.080
[laughter]

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.880
What I know of Ricky
Bryant, he actually

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.920
pretty much was on the practice
squad for most of the season.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.080
RICK HARRISON: But
he was a player.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.580
Right.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.920
Even guys in the practice
squad do get rings.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.540
At this point, this
ring was the heaviest,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.420
and it was the most expensive
ring that they had ever

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.750
made for any Super Bowl game.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.830
It's cast in 14k white gold.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.000
It's got 124 diamonds, and
also, it says three out of four.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.330
Unfortunately, anytime you
have a high profile item,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.750
counterfeiters figure
out creative ways

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.460
to pass off fakes.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.960
OK, I see we've got Jostens.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.420
Usually you would
see that in not only

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.880
in a different
location, but it looks

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.580
to be actually hand
engraved rather than

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.290
actually out of the machine.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.420
But this thing was so enormous,
it didn't fit inside Jostens'

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.040
normal ring engraver.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.710
They actually had to have
somebody laser engrave each

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.080
and every ring as you see here.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.580
So this ring is 100% legit.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.210
And it's pretty awesome.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.250
Sweet.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.750
So what do you think it's worth?

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.460
Super Bowl rings from
players such as this sell

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.460
from about $30,000 to $35,000.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.620
Nice, nice.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620
Thanks, man, you're the best.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.290
You bet.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.460
RICK HARRISON: So how much
do you want for this thing?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.460
$22,000.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.290
$18,000.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.920
I'd go $21,000.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.250
- I'll give you $20,000.
- Pass.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.170
20 grand-- cash.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.830
If you'd go $20,000
you'd go $21,000.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.500
- Deal.
- Deal.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500
COREY HARRISON: All
right, write him up, Chum.
