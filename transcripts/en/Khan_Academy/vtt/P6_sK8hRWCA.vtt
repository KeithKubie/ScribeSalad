00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.690
Let's say that you
started off with 3 apples.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.680
And then I were to give you
another 7, another 7 apples.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.030
So my question to you-- and
this might be very obvious--

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.930
is how many apples
do you now have?

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.910
And I'll give you a second
to think about that.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.420
Well, this is fairly basic.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.344
You had 3 apples.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:25.760
Now, I'm going to
give you 7 more.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.370
You now have 3 plus 7.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.030
You now have 10 apples.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.770
But let's say I want to do
the same type of thinking,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.352
but I'm too lazy to
write the word "apples."

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.310
Let's say instead of
writing the word "apples,"

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.840
I just use the letter a.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.330
And let's say this is,
say, a different scenario.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.450
You start off with 4 apples.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.220
And to that, I add
another 2 apples.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.570
How many apples do you now have?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.650
Instead of writing apples, I'm
just going to write a's here.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.260
So how many of these
a's do you now have?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.320
And once again, I'll
give you a few seconds

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.819
to think about that.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.200
This also might be a little
bit of common sense for you.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.960
If you had 4 of these apples or
whatever these a's represented,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.220
if you had 4 of them and
then you add 2 more of them,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.410
you're now going to
have 6 of these apples.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.660
But once again, we
started off assuming

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.180
that a's represent apples.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.140
But they could have
represented anything.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.030
If you have 4 of whatever
a represents, and then you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.670
have another 2 of
whatever a represents,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.980
you'll now have 6 of
whatever a represents.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.896
Or if you just think of it if
I have 4 a's, and then I add

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:34.520
another 2 a's, I'm
going to have 6 a's.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.490
You can literally think of 4
a's as a plus a plus a plus a.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.320
And if to that, I add another
2 a's-- so plus a plus

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.310
a, that's 2 a's
right over there--

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.030
how many a's do I now have?

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.400
Well, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.717
I now have 6 a's.

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:57.800
So thinking of it that
way, let's get a little bit

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.210
more abstract.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.840
Let's say that I have 5
x's, whatever x represents.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.510
x could be some number.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.940
So I have 5 of whatever
that number is.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.590
And from that, I subtract 2
of whatever that number is.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.310
What would this evaluate to?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.110
How many of these
x's would I now have?

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.760
So it's essentially 5x minus
2x is going to be what times x?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.280
Once again, I'll give you a
few seconds to think about it.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.350
Well, if I have 5 of something
and I subtract 2 of those away,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.050
I'm going to have 3 of
that something left.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.720
So this is going
to be equal to 3x.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.984
5x minus 2x is equal to 3x.

00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:46.900
And if you really think
about what that means,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.490
five x's are just x plus
x plus x plus x plus x.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.900
And then we're going to
take away two of those x's.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.490
So take away one x,
take away two x's.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.328
You are going to be
left with three x's.
