00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.210
Kim Huskey: I have a sister who's making a
difference.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.040
And her name is Kristine Huskey.
She is author of the recently published,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.680
"Justice at Guantanamo: One woman's odyssey
and her crusade for human rights.”

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.780
She's an attorney, she's a law professor,
and she is codirector of the National Security

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.650
Clinic at the University of Texas School of
Law, which she established in 2007 and served

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.110
as director for two years.
So, I'll let her take over.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.750
Thank you again for coming.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.170
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.750
Kristine Huskey: Oh, she does.
Well, thank you for that very warm welcome.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.969
And special thanks to my sister and your colleague,
Kim Huskey.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.829
She really is a great person.
And for her support in bringing me here and

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.760
to Google's support for bringing me here,
and to all of you for showing up -- whether

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.309
out of friendship for Kim or your interest
in the book.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.130
So thank you.
So first, I'm going to tell you a little bit

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.820
about the book -- and you can all hear me,
right?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.840
Tell you a little bit about the book, read
a passage -- maybe two -- depending on the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.250
time, and then take questions.
So, what is the book about?

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.890
It's really two stories.
And the first story is my personal -- and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.900
what some people might say "unconventional"
or some people might say "strange" -- journey

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.189
from being a reckless dancing-on-bars bartender
and model with my sister in New York City

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.920
to being part of a legal team before the Supreme
Court on a, you know, high-profile, very controversial,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.369
internationally-known case that was being
heralded as one of the most significant human

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.350
rights -- civil rights -- cases since Brown
v. Board.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.020
You could imagine how long and strange that
journey might have been.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.670
The second story is the story of Guantanamo.
And it's not the story you might read in the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.860
newspapers -- New York Times, Washington Post.
It's not the story you might read in a Harvard

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.159
Law Review with 300 footnotes.
So it's not a legal story; it's not a policy

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.139
story.
It's a story of Guantanamo from a human perspective

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:29.579
and from what it was like just a few years
out of law school really representing suspected

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.939
terrorists at Guantanamo having grown up in
Alaska with parents and grandparents who were

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.980
in the military.
And if asked, they probably would have said

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.449
they were Republicans -- and my sister is
rolling her eyes -- and all of a sudden, here

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:50.389
I was representing suspected terrorists.
So that's the second piece, and it's interwoven

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.859
with my personal journey.
It's really the human side -- hopefully the

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:02.529
human side -- of Guantanamo and how it started.
So the book opens with me 18 years old in

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:10.029
New York City, living with Kim in a basement
apartment, and I somehow move to Angola, Africa

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:15.480
 -- 18 years old.
And Angola was in the middle of a raging civil

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680
war.
I learned to live without running water, I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.939
learned to speak Portuguese; there were curfews
and travel restrictions.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:29.339
And the book starts with this 'high adventure'
 -- hopefully, and kind of keeps the reader

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:34.280
through one adventure after another, talking
about my adventures there in Angola, and taking

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.919
me back to New York -- that's the reckless
part.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.889
I will say, as an aside, my editor asked me
when I was writing that chapter, on New York,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.360
"Can you put some more detail in there?”
And I said, "I'm a lawyer, and I might have

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.229
a career ahead of me.
So, we'll leave those details out.”

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:55.529
If you want more details, you can ask Kim
 -- for the reckless details part.

00:03:55.529 --> 00:04:00.559
So after really, a year of sort of "Bright
Lights, Big City" -- if anybody remembers

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:08.109
that movie -- I really pulled myself together,
inspired really by my sister to go to Columbia.

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.150
We went to Columbia, and we both graduated
with high honors.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.130
And it sort of tells the story of what it's
like to live in New York City working, bartending,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.710
putting yourself through school, trying to
make something of yourself really.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.150
And then, my life sort of took another turn,
and I decided to model after graduating from

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.291
Columbia with high honors.
I guess maybe that's another part of the strange

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:38.449
journey.
And found myself modeling in videos.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.259
And one, in particular -- again, some of you
might be too young to remember this, but -- there

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.199
was an MTV video called, "Knockin the Boots.”
Yeah, okay.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.310
So I was in that video.
So that's really Part One of the book.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.729
It's all those adventures, modeling, Columbia,
bartending, all these crazy things.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.199
And finally, I decide to really be a professional.
And so, that's the majority of the book is

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.419
about my professional life as a lawyer and
about Guantanamo.

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.860
And so, I go into law school, of course, wanting
to save the world.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.349
And I come out of law school, and what do
I do?

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:21.389
I work for a big law firm which represents
evil corporations -- as my sister used to

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.979
describe me -- and I did that for couple years,
and somehow found myself, shortly after starting

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.580
work at this law firm that's headquartered
here in New York, representing Guantanamo

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.199
detainees.
And this was more than seven years ago, and

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.610
just six months after 9/11, which, you know,
if anybody was in New York at the time probably

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.689
remembers it very vividly.
I was actually here on a case staying at the

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:50.409
Waldorf.
And I was at this law firm, and the law firm

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:57.629
was approached by a couple of Kuwaiti families
who were looking for their sons.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.469
Now, if anybody remembers -- back then, Guantanamo
was a big secret.

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.159
And the administration wanted to keep it that
way.

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.949
And it was a legal black hole and there were
no lawyers allowed there and there were no,

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.999
you know, really no outside organizations
other than the Red Cross.

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:20.409
And any information that came out about Guantanamo
was, "Oh, these guys are all terrorists.

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.080
And they chew through hydraulic cable to kill
American men and women.”

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.599
Well, those were my clients.
And the Kuwaiti families basically said, "We

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:37.169
can't seem to find our sons who'd been overseas.
Nobody in the American embassy will talk to

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.470
us.
Nobody in the U.S. government will talk to

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.080
us.
And so, we decided that we would have to file

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.159
a lawsuit against the U.S. government in order
to force the government to come forward and

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:54.029
just confirm that they had custody of these
Kuwaiti citizens.”

00:06:54.029 --> 00:07:02.740
And so, we filed a lawsuit in May of 2002.
And I thought, you know, the lawsuit was basically,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.419
"These guys deserve due process.
What about the Fifth Amendment?

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:12.779
They should have charges and trial."
And I thought, "Who can be against due process?

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:15.949
What judge is going to turn that down?”
We weren't asking them to be released.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.849
We were just asking that they be charged,
given a trial, a chance to prove their innocence.

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:27.759
And you know, shockingly enough -- back then,
to me, it was shocking -- now, the world seems

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.180
to be somewhat different.
The judge agreed with the government.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.430
And what the government said was not that
they don't get due process -- what the government

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:43.110
was saying is that Guantanamo is not the U.S.
and those men there are foreign citizens.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:50.539
And so, not even the U.S. courts should be
overseeing the custody of these people who

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:58.340
are human beings -- that no U.S. court was
allowed to have authorization to hear claims

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.150
by these men.
And to me, that was just an astounding thing.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.689
I mean, we wrote in this first brief -- we
said, "The government, essentially, is taking

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:12.150
the position that they could go around the
world and pick up people off the streets and

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.750
put them at Guantanamo and torture them.”
Well, actually, now we sort of know that's

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.770
what they did.
But back then, we sort of asked it as a rhetorical

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:26.479
question, "How could this possibly be?”
But the Court agreed with the government that

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:31.710
the men at Guantanamo should not even have
a right to be in court and challenge their

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:36.669
detention.
They didn't have a right to have a trial -- that

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.229
they could be tortured without even going
into court and complaining about it.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:48.190
I mean, you know, either I was naive, or the
world really had changed.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:54.020
I think more so -- as somebody mentioned,
Phil here -- that the U.S. changed, and we

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.230
were in a different time and in a different
place than the rest of the world.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:04.029
So the book goes on -- the story goes on -- about
the litigation that I did and fighting in

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:10.050
the courts and as a young attorney, all of
a sudden finding myself at the Supreme Court

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:16.020
and doing these 'moots' -- they're called
'moots,' where you practice arguing -- you

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.480
know, with law professors.
And here I was just out of law school and

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.079
we're about to go in front of the Supreme
Court.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:27.990
So that was, you know, it's from the book
and the story is from the eyes of a young

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:34.000
lawyer who's sort of taking this all in and
taking in what's going on, you know, at Guantanamo

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.850
and around the world.
Now, during that time, we were not allowed

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.550
to even meet with our clients or even talk
to them on the phone, because the government

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:50.300
had control of these people.
And it was sort of an eye opener for me.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:58.000
What I realized was just really how much control
the government can have over the life of a

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.310
person.
And without, I think, people interjecting

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:12.709
or bringing litigation, they can just take
them to some, you know, Caribbean Island and

00:10:12.709 --> 00:10:16.940
do whatever they want with them.
So that was sort of a big lesson for me to

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:23.279
learn how much control the government has.
So we get to the Supreme Court and, lo and

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:27.600
behold, we actually win.
And this is the well-known Rasul case that

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.389
came out in 2004 and was the first case in
which the Supreme Court said "The detainees

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:36.970
at Guantanamo are entitled to challenge their
detention.”

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:42.149
They are allowed to go into court and say,
"You've got the wrong guy.

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:47.680
You made a mistake." or, "The law doesn't
support me being here.”

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.279
And just, essentially, challenge their detention,
something that goes back to the Magna Carta,

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:58.220
which we -- I think, under the Bush Administration
 -- had just really thrown to the side, this

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.180
idea of the rule of law.
So after the Supreme Court came out was the

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.250
first time we were then allowed to go visit
our clients in Guantanamo.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:15.209
And so, the passage that I'm going to read
is about my first trip to Guantanamo two-and-a-half

00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:20.940
years after beginning the representation of
them.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.880
Okay.
[reading] Those first meetings with our clients

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:31.079
at Guantanamo in which we played the DVD from
their families, introduced ourselves to them,

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:35.790
and began the long process of getting to know
them were epic moments in my legal career

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.399
 -- in my life.
It was unlike any other client meeting I'd

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:43.480
ever had.
Indeed, the last time I'd met with a client,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.120
I'd been sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons
in New York, because I represented 'evil'

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.000
corporations.
Neil, Tom, and I – [talking] that was the

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.579
three people -- Neil and Tom are my colleagues
at the law firm of Shearman and Sterling who

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:00.660
are also on the legal team –
[reading resumed] Neil, Tom, and I had spent

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:05.360
more than two years of our lives working upon
behalf of these men that we'd never met, and

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.589
it felt strange to know 'of them', but not
to know them.

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:13.610
We were brought into an interview room at
Camp Echo -- this is at Guantanamo -- where

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:19.120
we found one of our clients sitting at a small
card table, handcuffed and chained to an O-ring

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.572
bolted to the floor.
Suddenly, seeing a real person in front of

00:12:22.572 --> 00:12:27.369
me, I realized that until that moment, I'd
thought of our clients as a faceless group

00:12:27.369 --> 00:12:31.519
 -- the twelve Kuwaitis -- like some forgotten
religious order.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:35.380
And they were forgotten, in a way.
Sometimes, I even thought of my client as

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.829
being the 'rule of law', as that was often
how I tried to explain my work to the press

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:46.829
and other audiences.
After meeting them, though, and putting faces

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:49.620
with names, I'd never be able to think of
them that way again.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.250
They were people too.
And even though I'd known it all along, it

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:58.300
had become a distant fact after months filled
with litigation, when any rare time to myself

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.750
had been filled with enjoying my American
freedoms.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.100
Meanwhile, these men -- my clients -- were
being held as criminals, accused of nothing,

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.959
and yet certainly suspected of much.
[talking] So that was the first trip to Guantanamo.

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:16.250
And thereafter, I would take at least 15 or
16 trips to Guantanamo.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:21.649
The most recent being in April.
And every time I'd go, I'd learn something

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:28.459
new from my clients, whether they'd tell me
of some abuse they'd been through while they

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:34.020
were held in Bagram or in Guantanamo or I'd
be subject to some new rule.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.690
You know, one time -- in the beginning of
those visits -- we were allowed to go to the

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.040
public library on the base; and then thereafter,
we weren't allowed to go to the public library.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.529
We were never explained why.
But this whole process was teaching me so

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:55.779
much about, again, the power of the government,
and how it affects real people.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:02.060
And that was something that I learned sort
of in that moment was, the rule of law is

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:07.440
so important to us as -- in America this idea
of the rule of law.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.889
And we sort of talk about it and Obama talked
about it a lot.

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:17.930
But the import of that is that, it affects
real people -- real human beings.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:24.230
And it protects us, as well as people who
are at Guantanamo, who are foreign citizens.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:31.870
But I think the hardest visits that I had
at Guantanamo were when my clients were on

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.839
hunger strike.
And they were hunger striking for a couple

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:38.140
of reasons.
One, they were hunger striking to protest

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:45.040
their conditions.
They felt they were not being treated humanely.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.470
And indeed, in the beginning of their stay
at Guantanamo, I learned that they had exercise

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.230
20 minutes a week.
That they weren't allowed any reading materials

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.399
except for the Quran, which actually wasn't
even provided to them until several months

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:02.129
after they'd been there.
That they'd been subject to interrogation,

00:15:02.129 --> 00:15:09.140
sleep deprivation, hot and cold extremes.
That they really were treated not like 'suspected'

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.680
terrorists, but like terrorists.
And they'd never had a trial.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.889
And this went on for a very long time, this
sort of treatment.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:20.269
So I learned all of this.
They were protesting that.

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:25.129
They were also protesting just the fact that
they had not been charged.

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:29.079
And I had this one client who used to say,
"Just give my a trial.

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:32.370
Just give me the chance to prove that I'm
innocent.”

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:37.750
And people used to ask me at that time, "You
know, are your clients innocent?”

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.990
And I said, "Well, give them a trial, and
we'll find out.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.870
If they're not innocent, we'll hang them up
by their toes.”

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.640
But the whole point is to let them try to
prove their innocence.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:54.550
The whole point is to have a process whereby
you sort out the guilty from the innocent.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:01.430
And that was always what we were litigating
about and what the Guantanamo detainees were

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.360
protesting about.
So they went on this hunger strike.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.490
At the height of the hunger strike, there
were probably 150 detainees on hunger strike,

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.589
not eating, protesting their conditions and
the lack of trial.

00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:23.430
So, next passage is from that experience,
which was really quite traumatic for me, and

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.590
I wasn't even on hunger strike.
[reading] I thought about Fouzi -- one of

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:31.620
my clients -- and the other hunger strikers
who said they would rather die than eat.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.550
What that meant for Fouzi was -- if he got
his way, if his feeding tube was removed and

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.240
he continued his hunger strike -- he would
die.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.779
And by the looks of him, I didn't think it
would take very long.

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:46.670
It was pretty obvious to me that the only
thing keeping him alive was that feeding tube

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:52.209
and he wanted to be rid of it.
[talking] As an aside, the Guantanamo health

00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:56.689
professionals had basically forced them to
eat, because they didn't want them to die.

00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:59.950
Meanwhile, they were torturing them on the
side.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.009
So a lot of the detainees were subject to
feeding tubes.

00:17:03.009 --> 00:17:07.700
[reading resumed] We were his lawyers.
We were supposed to be working on his behalf,

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.290
in his best interest.
Shouldn't we be petitioning the court to stop

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.790
the force feeding?
"If Fouzi wants to die," I said back in D.C.,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:20.060
behind the closed doors of Tom's office -- again,
Tom was the law partner I worked with on this

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.150
case -- "we should let him die.”
I was devastated, but firmly believed that

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:28.850
it should be Fouzi's right to determine his
fate should he decide to see his hunger strike

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.650
through to the end.
It had only been a week since we'd been back

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:37.060
from Guantanamo, and the shock of seeing five
of our clients on hunger strike, two of them

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.690
dangerously close to death or serious illness,
had not left either of us.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.590
Tom didn't want to see Fouzi die either and
was just as determined to save him.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.670
"That's not what the families want, Kristine,"
Tom said.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.500
"I know, Tom, but who's our client here?
Is it Fouzi or his family?

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.100
What about what Fouzi wants?”
"What are we going to do?

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.050
Ask the Court to let him die?”
Tom was shouting.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.790
I shouted back, "Who are you to decide what's
best for Fouzi?

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.580
Who made you God?”
And suddenly, I was crying too.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.130
And Tom jumped up to hug me.
Now, mind you, something -- this is a 'no

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.050
no'.
In a big law firm, you don't do that, but

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:14.190
Tom and I were human, and we were upset.
Tom and I both knew that we had an ethical

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.240
obligation to do as our client wished, and
yet, we couldn't bring ourselves to be the

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.200
ones to seal Fouzi's fate -- a slow death
in a cell at the Guantanamo Bay Detention

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.180
Center.
Had we known we'd be having a conversation

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.640
of this magnitude when we first met with the
Kuwaiti families, in which someone's life

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.890
was in our hands, maybe we wouldn't have agreed
to take their case.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:39.000
But there we were, neck-deep in a case that
seemed impossible at every turn where every

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.350
decision we made seemed to have either substantial
consequences or no impact at all on somebody

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:50.630
else's welfare.
It was just getting to us.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.200
[talking] I think, now is a good time to answer
questions.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:02.690
Oh, yes. You must use that microphone.
You must use that microphone.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:18.550
Somebody must have some question.
Kim, you're supposed to -- oh, sorry -- yes.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.400
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:29.900
Q Testing. If you had to guess, What percentage
of the prisoners that you saw at Guantanamo

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.950
bay would you say were guilty?

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:38.790
Kristine Huskey: Well, now, that's a good
question.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.290
I mean, like I said, in the beginning when
I first started this representation, a lot

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.801
of people asked, you know, "Are they guilty?
Are they innocent? Are your clients?”

00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:56.920
You know, the truth is, in some ways all that
 -- the seven years of litigation -- was always

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.940
about whether or not the courts even had the
authority to hear these claims, right?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.760
So it wasn't until recently that the lawyers
were even allowed to ask for discovery of

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.760
the evidence, which was supposed to prove
that they were guilty or not guilty.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.830
So it's really only in the last year that
lawyers who represent the detainees are actually

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:24.750
getting documents, you know, notes of interrogations
and such like that.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:30.950
So from sort of a practical standpoint, if
you'd ask me that question a year ago, I would

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.670
have said, "I have no idea.”
But the truth is -- So, since in the last

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.970
year -- they're called habeas cases, right?
'Habeas' means the right to challenge your

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:46.100
detention, the writ of habeas in our Constitution,
not to be suspended.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.880
There have been 33 actual habeas cases, which
means the lawyers went in and tried to prove

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.630
that they were innocent and the government
went in and tried to prove they were guilty.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:21:01.080
Out of the 33, 28 federal judges granted the
writ of habeas, which means that they are

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.200
innocent.
So I mean, that's a sort of astounding statistic.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:12.851
I think another interesting point to follow
up on that is, you know, back -- again when

00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:16.851
I'm saying back in 2002 when they were talking
about "All these terrorists at Guantanamo,"

00:21:16.851 --> 00:21:24.820
this, that, and the other -- eventually it
came out, based on the Department of Defense's

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:30.820
own statistical information that only five
percent of the people at Guantanamo -- and

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:36.430
at that time it was about 400 -- five percent
had actually been picked up by U.S.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:43.340
forces.
The other 95 percent were picked up by Pakistani

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.420
officials -- either military, or even just
police.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:54.400
Some had been turned over by villagers or
Northern Alliance or Afghan local authorities.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.080
So I think that's a big, you know -- when
you ask the question, "How many are guilty?”

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:07.680
You start with that sort of statistic, and
you think about, How can it be that with that

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:14.710
chain of custody in mind, that every single
person who's at Guantanamo is guilty of terrorism?

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:22.200
Of course, as a good lawyer, I would never
tell you what I think about my clients.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.610
[laughter]

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.020
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:35.530
Q Yeah. I wonder if it even matters at all
if any of them are guilty.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.920
Because that's not really the fundamental
issue.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.050
I mean, it's really unfortunate for some of
the individuals if they happen to be innocent

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:47.330
and they're there, but there's a small number
of them.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.551
The real problem to me seems to be that the
system has changed.

00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:58.480
When I was a kid, I grew up mainly overseas.
We were always being attacked by people for

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.530
being Americans and the rest.
Well, my parents were always able to tell

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.800
me, you know,
"We don't start wars without provocation.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:12.600
We treat prisoners well. We don't torture.”
This whole long list of things that -- even

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.040
if we were being criticized for things -- you
could still hold your head up for being an

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.290
American, because being an American stood
for something.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.100
Unfortunately, I have a daughter today who
comes to me and asks me questions about the

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.470
country, and I can't tell her the same things
my parents told me.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:31.490
Something changed fundamentally at Guantanamo,
also Abu Ghraib and some other such things.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:38.020
But Guantanamo was a really important one
in that, sort of, our expectations of what

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:44.420
we do in conflicts are now different.
It used to be, you'd have a war, you get prisoners,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.070
and there were some rules in prisoners.
You can't photograph them.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.490
You've got to treat them nice.
You let their officers have a role in the

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.970
community.
Basically, you're just warehousing them until

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.470
the conflict is over and then you send them
home.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.159
And you're not allowed to torture them.
And you got to feed them well and all the

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:01.230
rest. That sort of stuff.
At least those were the rules that we had.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:05.840
But now, we're making the distinction between
what's a 'prisoner of war' and what's a 'terrorist'.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.620
And terrorists, apparently, we can do strange
things to that we couldn't do to prisoners

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.601
of war.
And guys who seem like they should have been

00:24:13.601 --> 00:24:17.840
prisoners of war are being terrorists etc.
Anyway, you all went to court.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.650
You had a bunch of things changed.
But, what were you not able to fix?

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:29.270
How is our system different today after Guantanamo
than it was before?

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.790
What have we lost?

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:36.100
Kristine Huskey: Well, you raise many good
points and some which I should have hit on

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.290
in the beginning talking about Guantanamo.
You know, one of the original problems of

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.000
Guantanamo -- like I said -- was, it was a
legal black hole.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.660
And what that really meant was, the Bush Administration
was saying, "They're not prisoners of war.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.050
And so, the Geneva Conventions don't apply,
which are the set of international rules which

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:58.890
sort of govern how we treat prisoners when
we're in a conflict.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:05.960
And they're terrorists, but they're at Guantanamo,
so Federal U.S. law doesn't apply.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.420
And you're right.
I mean, the issue -- the real issue -- is

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:16.421
that, you know, Guantanamo has sort of become
a symbol for how the U.S. has changed.

00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:23.870
I don't know if the world -- I think the world
has changed some, with respect to how we look

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.990
at terrorism, preventive detention, the laws
of war.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:34.040
But, I think the U.S. changed the most, in
part because of 9/11.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:41.151
So, the issue has become -- and it's an issue
now that's being debated by the Obama administration

00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:44.310
 -- that's something I think we all need to
think about.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:51.550
Do we sort of go back to pre-9/11 and we say,
"Listen, if they're accused of being terrorists,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:59.620
we have criminal laws that we've used in our
courts -- in New York actually several terrorism

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.130
cases, and they were convicted.
And they're serving in maximum security prisons.”

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:11.580
And that's sort of the pre-9/11 paradigm.
Or do we have something that -- as I mentioned

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:17.080
as being sort of contemplated -- is this idea
that you could have suspected terrorists who

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.850
aren't charged with terrorism.
They're not in a law-of-war paradigm, because

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:27.240
they're not really in a traditional armed
conflict.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:33.400
And so, therefore we will detain them, because
we're afraid they might commit some terrorist

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.560
act.
And that is what's being -- as I said -- seriously

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:45.290
considered by the Obama administration.
So that, I think, is what has changed fundamentally.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.780
Is this idea that we no longer can apply the
traditional laws of war.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.790
We possibly can't apply our U.S. criminal
laws, antiterrorism laws.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:02.790
And we're sort of now in this kind of middle
course contemplating holding people, because

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:08.030
we 'think' they might do something bad or
wrong.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:12.130
And they're grappling with, Are there laws
that support that?

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.970
So, go back to I think your second, or maybe
third, question.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.620
You know, What didn't we fix?
Well, a lot. A lot.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:24.680
There's still people at Guantanamo, although,
you know, thankfully Obama came out and said

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:32.380
he's going to close Guantanamo.
But I think that's sort of the biggest piece,

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:38.550
you know?
The biggest piece is that somehow maybe we

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:44.701
weren't able to show -- to demonstrate -- how
terrible it is to have a legal black hole.

00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:49.640
How terrible it is not to have laws that apply,
such that they're now seriously considering

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.230
preventive detention. You know?
And I agree with you.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:57.950
In the beginning, we used to talk about, How
could this be that we do not have the application

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:03.290
of some kind of law here?
Because what brings us together in America

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:08.860
as citizens and residents, you know, is not
that we have Coke and Levi's -- although that's

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:15.760
certainly an American thing -- but it was
being so proud of our system, our democracy,

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.370
our justice system.
We have one of the best justice systems in

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.790
the world.
And you know, now that's changed.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.240
You know? That's changed.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.880
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:36.760
Q Hi. You've talked a little bit about how
this whole experience made you realize just

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:42.040
how much power the government has.
And how long it took for the courts to come

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.390
through and say, "Yes, the law does apply
to these people.”

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.700
Years and years and years.
So, I'm curious what your thoughts are -- and

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:56.620
you can talk a little bit about -- what you
feel that the role of the courts 'should be'

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.050
versus what 'it is'.
Whether you think they should have more power

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:08.450
to affect what the president's doing, whether
they should be able to act more quickly as

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.120
opposed to kind of the glacial pace they move
at now.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.500
Whether they should have jurisdiction over
more areas like these kind of legal black

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.520
hole areas that they don't seem to be able
to touch.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.160
That's kind of open-ended.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.491
Kristine Huskey: No. I mean, as a young lawyer,
when I started doing this litigation, it was

00:29:27.491 --> 00:29:33.730
 -- every step of the way was sort of eye-opening.
And starting at the lower court and finally

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:37.881
making your way up to the Supreme Court.
You know, as you said, everything sort of

00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:41.020
moved so glacially.
And I just thought, "Geez," you know?

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.380
"Even if we win, it will be two-and-a-half
years later.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.370
And these guys will spend an important part
of their life there.”

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:54.320
So part of me says, "It should be faster.
The courts should have more power.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:01.450
They should be able to do something faster."
But another part of me really respects that

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:10.640
it is -- part of it is such a slow process
because the goal is to let each party take

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:18.110
the time to brief everything and look at the
law and for the judge to ponder it, give the

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:24.730
government a chance to possibly change its
ways or put forward its reasoning.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:30.180
And then you have the whole system of appeals,
which -- in our case -- that was terrible.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.650
It sucked.
"Oh, we got to go to appeal.”

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:39.000
But if you think about it from the reverse,
if you were -- let's say you were convicted

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.900
of something and you were innocent.
And you were maybe sentenced to the death

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.970
penalty, you would want all those -- you want
a chance to keep appealing and appealing.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:56.240
So, I guess I go sort of both ways.
I agree with you, "Oh, it's too slow."

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.440
But at the same time, I really do have great
respect for our justice system which really

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:11.810
seems to give an opportunity to find the truth.
And sometimes finding the truth can take a

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.250
long time, because you give a chance for all
parties to weigh in.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:21.650
And then you go to the next court.
And then you do it all over again, and you

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:25.220
go to the next court.
So a good example, while we were going up

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:32.250
to the Supreme Court -- sorry, after the Supreme
Court -- and the Supreme Court had ruled and

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:37.360
we were going to Guantanamo, we learned all
these things about -- they wanted to have

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.780
more reading materials and they wanted to
have more exercise.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:47.320
And then, they wanted to have this sort of
scholarly commentary on the Quran.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.920
And we petitioned the court for all this.
And basically -- because the government said,

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.470
"No way.
They don't get that. They don't get that.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.130
Nope, nope, nope.”
And the court -- you know what the court did?

00:31:55.130 --> 00:32:00.120
It just ignored our motions.
Which was devastating.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.120
Devastating.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.990
Q Hi. Thanks a lot.
This is very fascinating stuff.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.040
Kristine Huskey: Thank you.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.250
Q Couple of questions.
Do you think there are other black holes like

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.800
this in the world?
Because I would certainly suspect that there

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.060
are.
And to address earlier comments about believing

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:26.350
in America and 'all things American' being
good, I grew up in that sort of, you know

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:30.570
 -- as the offspring of the Golden Generation
of the United States and believing all those

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:36.980
things -- but Vietnam pretty much nailed that
box shut for me.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:45.610
With recent events like Laura Ling and Euna
Lee with North Korea, the hikers in Iraq/Iran,

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:49.690
other taking of individuals.
Do you think the U.S. was using Guantanamo

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.380
Bay as sort of a collection of bargaining
chips?

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.830
Like, "We're going to gather a bunch of people
and use them if we need to, to negotiate some

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.830
sort of balance."?

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:04.540
Kristine Huskey: I mean, there definitely
was -- at some point what they had -- what

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:11.110
they were called the CIA 'black sites', where
they did bring -- and this sort of came out

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.680
after Guantanamo had come out, right?
And so, we're looking at Guantanamo like,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.380
"Oh, it's this legal black hole.”
And then we find out there's sites that are

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:25.850
even more of a legal black hole than Guantanamo.
Which is just, "What?!" you know?

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:32.180
And then it was during the Bush Administration
that he said he was going to shut them down.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.700
And actually, before -- in 2006, Congress
passed a law about the military commissions

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:43.110
 -- and, you know, what I think was in sort
of a manipulative move -- moved a lot of the

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:48.760
detainees from these 'black sites' to Guantanamo
and said to Congress, "Okay.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.280
Now you have to pass this law, because now
all these high-value detainees are there,

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.390
and they should be put through some sort of
system.”

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:02.290
You know, throughout the seven-and-a-half
years that I've been litigating and representing

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:06.360
detainees and working on these issues, every
time something happens -- you know, when Abu

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.929
Ghraib came out and the black sites, you say,
"Oh, it can't get any worse.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:15.619
There can't be another breaking news story
about what this government is doing with national

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:19.740
security and our rights.”
But then it came out that they were wiretapping

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:28.179
American citizens, you know.
So I'm sort of very happy with how the book

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:32.029
ended, because it ends with the Obama administration
coming in and I say, you know, I have hope

00:34:32.029 --> 00:34:39.829
 -- of course, that's his catch phrase -- but
so, I hope that we don't have those black

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:44.460
sites anymore.
But in some ways, you can't really be sure

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:50.639
until you sort of find out.
I think -- whether or not Guantanamo was a

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:55.589
bargaining chip.
I would say during the Bush administration,

00:34:55.589 --> 00:35:01.740
it probably was, to some degree.
I feel, for me, I'm still sort of waiting

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:06.140
to see what the Obama administration does,
how they handle certain things.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.480
I think they're scrambling.
Most recently, they were supposed to come

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.630
out with a report on how they're going to
handle the detainees at Guantanamo.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.190
What they were going to do with them.
Whether or not they would have some sort of

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.500
preventive detention.
And they -- basically, the task force came

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.599
out and said, "It's going to be delayed.
It's going to be another six months.”

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:30.890
Which in another six months Guantanamo is
supposed to be shut down.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:36.769
So I think it really remains to be seen what
the administration is going to do with a lot

00:35:36.769 --> 00:35:43.720
of these issues.
Hope I answered your question. Thank you.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.650
Q Sort of affiliated to some of the previous
questions.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:57.010
What is your experience and opinion about
how all this affected the international opinion

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:06.390
about the U.S. justice system both technically
 -- so, What are the laws?

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:14.670
Or What have U.S. changed?
And more like politically or perceptionwise?

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:20.710
And related to this -- it's a technical question,
because I don't know anything about law -- when

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:30.890
in 2002, the judge agreed with the government
that they cannot be sued in U.S. Court, did

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:35.019
you consider suing the United States in International
Court?

00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:41.609
Kristine Huskey: We did. I mean, the international
book from the legal and the policy perspective

00:36:41.609 --> 00:36:48.300
is very interesting.
I think, from just a policy perspective -- and

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:55.310
I've traveled overseas a lot, for my business
and also just for fun -- the response from

00:36:55.310 --> 00:37:02.520
the international community, I think, has
largely been disappointment, disbelief, you

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:07.140
know, the U.S. used to hold itself out as
the champion of human rights.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.970
And people would say, "You know, how can we
hold our heads up?”

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:15.700
It was something that was mentioned earlier.
And the international community -- again,

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:21.720
from a policy perspective -- was like, "Now
you can't really tell us what to do." Right?

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:31.710
From a legal perspective, there's been just
a lot of criticism about the numerous violation

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:36.910
of international treaties by the United States.
I mean, they've signed on to the torture against

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.609
convention.
They've signed on to the Convention of the

00:37:39.609 --> 00:37:44.500
Rights of the child.
And, lo and behold, the U.S. had several children

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:49.119
under the age of 16 at Guantanamo detained
with adult people.

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:54.650
They signed on to the International Covenant
of Civil and Political Rights.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:38:00.299
And that, quite honestly, just -- and I think
the Bush Administration really, quite frankly,

00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:04.319
didn't give a damn about international law.
And it just sort of went out the window.

00:38:04.319 --> 00:38:11.950
But a lot of international lawyers were very
concerned, because the U.S. was always a leader

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:16.720
in international law in getting other countries
to sign on to these treaties that were so

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:22.119
important, right?
And the interesting thing about sort of the

00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:25.730
international aspect of it is that -- from
what I hear.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:33.920
This is a little bit of gossip and rumor -- many
U.S. officials who were in power during the

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:39.289
Bush administration are afraid to travel overseas,
because there's this concept of 'universal

00:38:39.289 --> 00:38:45.269
jurisdiction', which means if you've committed
war crimes and you're in a country that believes

00:38:45.269 --> 00:38:50.650
in universal jurisdiction, the Spanish authorities
can arrest you and put you in a trial in their

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:53.440
courts.
And so, I hear that a lot of the U.S. Bush

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.380
officials will not travel to Italy or Spain
or anywhere in the E.U.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:07.000
And recently, Italy indicted eight CIA agents
 -- they were not in Italy at the time, but

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.220
they basically sort of put out a E.U.-wide
warrant for their arrest, saying these eight

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:22.099
CIA agents were in Italy and I think kidnapped
individuals and brought them to either, you

00:39:22.099 --> 00:39:26.230
know, Bagram or Guantanamo or one of these
other black sites.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.560
Did I answer your second question?
Okay. Thank you.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.259
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:39:33.259 --> 00:39:41.609
Q I have one follow up question to the previous
question.

00:39:41.609 --> 00:39:47.170
So, you mentioned that Guantanamo was this
black hole of a kind, and you hope that there

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:51.930
would be no more black holes like these.
But, when you look at it, it seems essentially

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:58.180
that, after 9/11, it turned out that the Constitution
and the laws are more or less quite malleable

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:04.329
in the sense that you can justify quite a
lot of things by saying, you know, the executive

00:40:04.329 --> 00:40:08.529
branch basically has the right to do quite
a lot of things.

00:40:08.529 --> 00:40:15.530
And I just wonder if you feel there's anything
which could be done to amend this system to

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.070
make sure that things like this could not
happen in the future?

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:24.390
Because while there was a Supreme Court decision
which made some progress, but essentially,

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:30.460
it seems like these things -- there isn't
like a black wall put in the past which would

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.010
guarantee that such things couldn't occur
in the future.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:40.620
Kristine Huskey: No, that's, I mean, one of
the big criticisms of the Bush Administration

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:45.910
 -- among others -- was the sort of abuse
of executive power.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:51.300
And they sort of became inflated with this
idea that Bush was the executive.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.309
"It's a national security crisis, I can do
anything.”

00:40:56.309 --> 00:41:03.070
But I think they really took it quite far.
And they had lawyers who would write long

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:08.549
legal opinions -- just like you said -- about
how it was justified, how it really was legal,

00:41:08.549 --> 00:41:15.990
and that it wasn't a violation of the Constitution.
Well, you could take the view of Shakespeare

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.579
who said, "Kill all the lawyers.
Then you wouldn't have legal opinions backing

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:27.480
that up.”
But -- that was a joke -- but, you're right.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:33.220
It's both a problem and a great thing about
this country though is, we have the Constitution,

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:38.760
which has been called -- it's a 'living document',
right? which means that it changes with the

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.990
time.
Some of the Supreme Court opinions, you know,

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:47.960
about discrimination are vastly different
from 1918 in the Dred Scott case to Brown

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.999
v Board.
So the fact that it's not 'hard and fast'

00:41:53.999 --> 00:41:57.890
has allowed great things in this country,
but at the same time has allowed terrible

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:10.230
things to happen.
So, I think it is in many ways something that

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:18.690
points to, We have to really hold officials
accountable, because I think that's really

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.320
the solution.
I don't know that we could pass a law that

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.160
would change the Constitution.
In some ways, I think that might come back

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:33.440
to hurt us to have a hard and fast rule.
I think it means holding officials -- whether

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:40.670
it's your state representative or your representative
on the Hill in Washington to the President

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:46.930
 -- holding them accountable as a people.
Because the Constitution is supposed to protect

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:51.769
us, not the executive branch.
So I know that doesn't sound like a very easy

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:58.140
solution, but I think in some ways to me,
that would be my preferred solution.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.339
&gt;&gt; I think we're going to wrap it up.
Kristine is going to hang around if you want

00:43:03.339 --> 00:43:07.450
to ask her some more questions, or she can
sign your book if you'd like.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:08.469
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

00:43:08.469 --> 00:43:09.469
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:43:09.469 --> 00:43:09.473
Kristine Huskey: Thank you.
