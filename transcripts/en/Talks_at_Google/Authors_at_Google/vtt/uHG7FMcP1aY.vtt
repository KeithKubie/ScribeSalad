00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:06.610
JEREMY HEIMANS: Well, hello.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.650
It's fantastic to be here.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.020
And we're going to
talk to you today

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.070
about how we can all be more
powerful but hopefully in a way

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.600
that also makes
for a better world.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.970
And so to get started, we're
going to talk about two

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.900
very different--

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.140
HENRY TIMMS: I love
how you got stuck

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.875
right next to Harvey Weinstein.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:25.020
JEREMY HEIMANS: I know.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.340
HENRY TIMMS: I chose the
right side of the stage.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.480
JEREMY HEIMANS:
--doppelgangers really.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.563
HENRY TIMMS: So think about
what Harvey Weinstein.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:33.040
Think about the way he exercised
power in the world, right?

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.610
So for decades he was
literally atop Hollywood.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.980
There was a researcher
who looked back

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.450
over who had been
thanked the most

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.000
times from the
stage at the Oscars,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.510
and there was a tie for first
place between Harvey Weinstein

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.516
and God.

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:48.640
That's how powerful he was.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.070
And the way that he
controlled Hollywood was he

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.740
had the, kind of, currency
of power in his hands.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.120
He could make or break movies.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.710
He could make or break careers.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.940
He could squelch things.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.050
He could keep things down.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.850
He could command.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.030
He could control.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.944
It was a very definitive
type of power.

00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:04.569
And the movement that
played a big role

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.090
in finally toppling him
thought about power really

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.090
very differently.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.100
JEREMY HEIMANS: So
the Me Too movement

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.266
emerged about a decade ago,
as some of you may know.

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.110
A woman called Tarana
Burke had this idea

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.110
for this kind of hashtag,
this owner-less, decentralized

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.570
movement that
people could adopt.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.025
And it got some traction.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:25.150
But then in November of
last year, if you remember,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.810
it just took off like wildfire.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.060
And let's think about the
properties of that movement.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.950
So if you think of Harvey as
using power as a currency,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.040
you can think of the Me Too
movement as power as current.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.730
So no one can actually control
or shape fully that current.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.700
It surged across the world.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.500
Many leaders emerged, right?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.150
So Tarana was the instigator.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.970
But then many leaders emerged as
the movement goes from country

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.870
to country.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.945
In France, it becomes
Denounce Your Pig,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.195
which I think is a very
creative application of the Me

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:55.769
Too frame.

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:56.810
HENRY TIMMS: Very French.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.040
JEREMY HEIMANS: Very French.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.430
It moves from
industry to industry.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.690
So it came to tech.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.430
It came to politics
all over the world.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.460
And as it does,
it changes shape.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.039
And as the current
sort of surges,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.370
it's the voices of many
that unlock people's ability

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.540
to give their testimonies.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.020
Because for so long what
had been under the surface

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.647
was that people were
unable to come forward,

00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:21.730
because they didn't see
the people around them who

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.850
were coming forward also,
which created that safety

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.022
and created that swell.

00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:27.730
So these are just two
very different ways

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.790
to think about power and how
it works in the world today.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.990
HENRY TIMMS: Here's another
variation on that theme.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.070
So it was in California.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.486
There was some legislation
coming down from the government

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:40.899
there which was going to
curtail the way that Airbnb

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:41.440
did its work.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.810
It was going to make it much
harder for Airbnb to run.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.910
They did the thing you would
always do if you are Airbnb;

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.920
they got their lobbyists
and got their lobbyists

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.200
to be influential
over the government.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.914
But Airbnb did
something else too.

00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:53.830
JEREMY HEIMANS: So what
was really interesting

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.770
was the way they
mobilized their hosts.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.810
So imagine Hilton Hotels.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.040
If Hilton Hotels had
a regulatory problem,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.520
none of us as prior
guests of Hilton Hotels

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.400
would, kind of, rally to
do their lobbying for them.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.530
And yet here is this
multibillion-dollar company

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.370
that managed to
get its hosts, who

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.810
sort of share in the economic
value created by that platform,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.220
out to lobby for them.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.442
So they knocked on 200,000
doors in San Francisco.

00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:19.900
And in that particular
moment, they

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.490
won and defeated
this legislation.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.940
So it teaches us something
interesting about the way

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.340
some platforms are,
kind of, building

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.057
community in a different way.

00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:31.390
HENRY TIMMS: And one more story.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.884
So this was a
schoolgirl we learned

00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:37.300
about when we were researching
a book called Aqsa Mahmood.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.980
And she went to a school, a good
school, in Glasgow in Scotland.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.870
And she loved Harry
Potter, and she

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.850
was described as
somebody who wouldn't

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.550
be able to find her way to the
center of Glasgow on a bus.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.390
But in the evenings, she
had been radicalized online.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.260
And one day she
simply disappeared.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.470
And the next her parents heard
from her was three days later,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.130
and she was on the border
heading into Syria, telling

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.220
them that she was making jihad
and she was never coming home.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.120
But that wasn't the
end of her story.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.397
JEREMY HEIMANS: So she
had been recruited online,

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:09.730
and then she became one of
the most effective recruiters

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.990
for the Islamic State.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.640
And we sort of
studied her methods.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.620
And really what's
interesting about the way

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.709
the ISIS kind of
ideology metastasizes

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.620
is that it allowed
her to perfectly adapt

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.250
a message for luring other
teenage girls like her

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.900
from the West to Syria.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.160
So we looked at her Tumblr.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.040
And it's full of these emojis
and these memes and, like,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.380
these really
friendly tips for how

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.200
to prepare for coming
to Syria, like always

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.520
bring extra toiletries.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.620
They're not widely
available here in Syria.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.390
And you know, it seems banal.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.750
Organic coconut oil was
her particular preference.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.880
It seems banal, but
it was perfectly

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.840
adapted to creating that kind of
peer-to-peer intimacy and sense

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.870
of belonging that helped
people get over the line.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.829
And so she did that.

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:55.870
She brought a number of
other girls from the West

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.836
over to Syria.

00:04:56.836 --> 00:04:58.210
And we contrast
that with the way

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.600
the US government responded
to the threat of ISIS.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.760
HENRY TIMMS: So here's
what the government does.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.190
They fly a bomber
over Syria and Iraq,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.950
and they drop cartoons out
of the back of the bomber.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.230
And these cartoons
show how awful life

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.640
will be if you make jihad.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.860
And they literally float
down from on high and land

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.540
on the heads of the
civilian population.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.680
And this tactic was first
used 100 years before then

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.714
in the First World War.

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:23.380
They then finally got
smart and realized

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.060
that just dropping
paper leaflets alone

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.390
wasn't going to do the job.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.580
So they decided to make
the leap into social media,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.360
and they got to this.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.130
JEREMY HEIMANS: "Think
again, turn away,"

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.710
which was an extremely
bossy Twitter account

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.980
in English designed to
dissuade potential jihadists,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.740
where they picked just the
perfect messenger, the US State

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.970
Department, which is clearly the
way you dissuade someone just

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.740
on the brink of radicalization.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.650
So again, here we have these
two very different applications

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.380
of power.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.160
We have the US government
literally raining their ideas

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.450
down from on high.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.800
You have this young
girl with a fraction

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.900
of the resources of
the US government

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.920
being very effective at
spreading her ideas sideways.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.210
HENRY TIMMS: So the work we've
been doing together really

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.010
grew out of trying to
create a frame which

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.714
more accurately described
what was changing in the world

00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:16.630
and give that frame for
practitioners to think

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.546
about their own world.

00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:20.110
We all remember being
asked questions like,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.030
did Twitter cause the
Arab Spring, right?

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.810
We've got these changes.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.820
And they were always quite
reductionist questions,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.236
which got to a question about
how technology was changing.

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:29.740
But the frame that we put forth
in our work and in our book

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.050
is to say that we need to
think a little bit less

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.200
about how technology is changing
and think a lot more about how

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.159
power is changing.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.200
So the two forces we see
playing out in the world

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.200
right now we think of as
old power and new power.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.760
So let's start, because Jeremy's
on that side of the stage,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.260
with Jeremy talking
about old power.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.760
JEREMY HEIMANS: Well, thanks,
and make me the old power guy.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.670
So as we talked about earlier,
this analogy of currency

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.710
current and think
again about the way

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.700
those two scenarios with
Harvey and Me Too play out.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.280
But you think about it
along other dimensions.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.390
These new power models are
reliant on our energy, right?

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.810
So if you think of new
power as this critical skill

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.820
in our century,
which is the ability

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.610
to harness a connected
crowd to get what you want,

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.590
if you think about
Facebook, for example,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.500
it's an empty vessel without
all of that participation.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.950
So those models are based
on many of us participating.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.560
They're based on upload.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.714
They're often based on
sharing and peer dynamics.

00:07:26.714 --> 00:07:28.380
HENRY TIMMS: And
there's a real contrast

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.460
we can see playing
out across all

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.470
of our lives between the
way that new power works

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.790
and the way that old
power works, right?

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.980
This is part of the battle
and balance of all times,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.920
is how these two forces fit
together and where they're now.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.230
And the argument that we
make isn't an argument

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.930
to say we need to get rid of
all these old power forces

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.790
and throw them out and replace
them all with the new power

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.210
forces.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.626
Our argument is
the people who are

00:07:46.626 --> 00:07:49.320
going to end up on top are those
who can blend power together,

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.540
so those who understand
how new power and old power

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.470
fit together.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.870
And the place to start
developing those skills

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.336
is in double clicking on this
and thinking more about values.

00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:00.210
So what we've been
thinking about in our work

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.501
is to say, well, look, with
the rise of this new power,

00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:04.950
with all of this, kind of,
expectation of participation,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.202
is provoking a shift in the
kinds of values people hold

00:08:08.202 --> 00:08:09.910
and the way that they
approach the world.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.880
And we can see a real
difference between a set of what

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.338
we think of as, kind of, old
power values and a set of what

00:08:14.338 --> 00:08:16.140
we think of new power values.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.760
JEREMY HEIMANS:
So we can say this

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.970
along a bunch of dimensions.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.280
And I think as
Googlers, you'll sort of

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.720
recognize some of the values,
particularly these new power

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.170
values as probably values
that at least are stated here,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:26.670
right?

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.730
So this is preference
for more informal, more

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.510
networked governance
over more formal,

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.720
institutional, and
managerial structures.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.179
There's this tension
between competition.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.409
Think of Donald Trump, right?

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:43.110
His world view is the
world is zero sum.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.060
It's divided into
winners and losers.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.680
No one can win together.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.780
You can only win
against someone.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.310
Whereas these new
power models tend

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.542
to supercharge collaboration.

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:54.750
That doesn't mean that
necessarily that collaboration

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.180
is altruistic.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.280
But you think about how
you're successful on Airbnb,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.880
you're successful on Airbnb by
being good at collaboration,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.115
not by good at undermining
the apartment next door.

00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:07.740
HENRY TIMMS: And some
of these tensions

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.720
really play out in
interesting ways.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.600
You think about the way people
think about the workplace now.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.960
And you'll see a
lot of people come

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.490
in the workplace, a lot
of people in this room,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.800
will have high expectations
around transparency, right?

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.546
You expect to know
what's going on.

00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:20.920
Many workplaces people expect
to know everybody's salary.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.910
They need to see into
the institutions.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.040
It's a big clash with the world
that really prioritized things

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.684
like confidentiality
and discretion.

00:09:27.684 --> 00:09:29.100
JEREMY HEIMANS:
There's a story we

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.850
tell in the book of a politician
who's currently running

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.647
for governor of Colorado.

00:09:35.647 --> 00:09:37.230
And he's sort of
gotten ahead of this.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.460
He's like, OK, I get this.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.750
Things have changed.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.120
I'm going to really embrace
radical transparency.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.640
So there's a section
on his website called

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.620
Scandal and Controversy,
in which he self

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.740
declares his entire--

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.130
quite interesting, I
might add-- sexual history

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.550
in elaborate detail and
just says, yep, I'm proud.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.750
I'm happy.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.460
I wish everybody
else, basically,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.524
has as much fun as me.

00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:02.690
HENRY TIMMS: He did seem
to have quite a lot of fun.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.300
JEREMY HEIMANS: He did.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.050
There was a lot.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.430
There were many things.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.070
I encourage you guys
to check this guy out.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.500
HENRY TIMMS: It
wasn't a short entry.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.041
JEREMY HEIMANS: No,
it's fascinating.

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:13.470
So this is a very
different way to think

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.280
about engaging with the world.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.710
HENRY TIMMS: And I think we also
want to make an argument, too,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.480
which is to say
that we also don't

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.051
think that we should give up
on a lot of these old power

00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:21.550
values.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.670
So for example, you can
see the tension right now

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.220
between expertise and
the maker culture.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.870
You saw in the
Brexit debate, right,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.800
we've had enough of expert.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.450
This is a real kind
of zeitgeist-y tone

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.367
around this right now.

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:32.783
But actually there's
lots of areas

00:10:32.783 --> 00:10:34.880
we think we really deeply
care about expertise.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.240
So I had my appendix
out four weeks ago.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.640
The last thing in the
world I would like

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.670
is a group of makers, kind
of doing a do-it-ourselves

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.025
appendectomy, as hipsters
from Brooklyn who

00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:48.900
got together and got
some tools of off reddit

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.290
and took out my appendix, right?

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.340
I clearly one Dr. Chu
over here, who's got

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.299
15 years of experience.

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.464
So we very deeply feel that
there are some old power

00:10:56.464 --> 00:10:57.840
values that really matter.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.340
But we think something else too.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.169
We think things like experts--

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:03.210
you think about the role
of experts in the world.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.239
If they are simply holding on
to their power as a currency,

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:08.280
which is they've got it
and other people haven't.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.863
And they're not
entering a world where

00:11:09.863 --> 00:11:12.930
they need to work how the ideas
move like a current flowing

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.680
through the world.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.159
If they don't make
that transition,

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:17.700
they'll be lost in a world with
all the righteousness and all

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.989
the facts and all the
peer reviews in the world.

00:11:19.989 --> 00:11:21.780
But their ideas simply
won't break through.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.196
JEREMY HEIMANS: So imagine,
the stakes here are very high,

00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:26.010
and they're playing
out all around us.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.180
You think of the
climate scientist

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.390
up against the climate denier.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.930
And I think the mindset is
often like, well, I'm right,

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.400
and that should be enough.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.150
But it just isn't enough.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.790
And so one of the
reasons we wrote

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.850
this book, really the
most important reason,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.580
is that we wanted to get these
new skills of how you build

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.240
movements, how you spread ideas,
how you create communities, how

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.860
you lead in a different way into
the hands of the right people.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.310
And so think about that
tension between the doctor

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.540
and the anti-vaxxer.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.460
So these are the stakes,
right, in a world

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.800
in which misinformation
is spreading much, much

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.020
more quickly and,
frankly, more effectively

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.780
in many cases than the sort
of enlightenment values

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.850
that people here
generally, I think,

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.410
would probably subscribe to.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.870
HENRY TIMMS: So let's now
shift and ask all of you

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.880
a question about Google.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.220
When we first did this
work, we wrote a piece

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.570
for "Harvard Business Review."

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.129
And you're basically
legally obliged,

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:22.920
if you write for "Harvard
Business Review,"

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.300
to at some point do
a two-by-two matrix.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.270
So here's our two-by-two
matrix that we put together

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.070
for "Harvard Business Review."

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.290
We started to help people
think through where

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.160
their organization
stands in the world.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.210
So it maps two things.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.657
The first thing
it maps is values.

00:12:36.657 --> 00:12:39.240
Are you an organization with all
old power values or new power

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.880
values?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.592
The second thing it
maps is your model.

00:12:41.592 --> 00:12:43.300
Do you have an old
power model, or do you

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.634
have a new power model?

00:12:44.634 --> 00:12:46.300
JEREMY HEIMANS: And
so just a quick tour

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.160
around this compass--

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.790
Apple.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.680
So obviously, there's
a lot of dinosaurs

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.840
here, but then we
also identify Apple.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.680
So one of our points is being
a technology company does not

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.910
make you a new power company.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.610
This is really about
your model, how much

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:05.470
it depends on peer dynamics,
and what your mindset is.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.750
So think of Apple,
Apple's business model

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.570
is based on the genius
product designer in Cupertino

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.540
who decides what we need
before we know we need it.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.240
And then the product descends
without the headphone jack,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.172
and we go and buy it, right?

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.380
That's the fundamental model.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.200
HENRY TIMMS: You really
haven't gotten over that.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.990
JEREMY HEIMANS: I'm not over it.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.435
HENRY TIMMS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.050
JEREMY HEIMANS:
I'm very irritated.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.300
No, actually, that's not true.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.240
I quite like the ear pods.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.470
But also, if you think
about Apple, its mindset,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.580
right, it's not a
good collaborator.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.560
It's very secretive.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.450
It runs in a pretty
old power way.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.840
The only new power
flank of Apple arguably

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.014
is that App Store, right?

00:13:39.014 --> 00:13:40.930
But even then, if you
compare it, for example,

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.005
to the way Google has done,
has entered this foray,

00:13:44.005 --> 00:13:45.880
it's quite different,
right, because you guys

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.750
lean much more heavily into open
source with Android, et cetera.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.760
So that's an example
of where we're not

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.907
trying to say anything
that's new is new power.

00:13:54.907 --> 00:13:56.740
And then we can talk
about the cheerleaders.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.300
HENRY TIMMS: So we see a
lot companies in this space

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.760
right now, which these companies
who essentially have old power

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.380
models, like Patagonia
is a good example, right?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.921
They essentially
sell clothes, right?

00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:04.840
That hasn't changed.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.134
But they've got increasingly
new power values.

00:14:07.134 --> 00:14:09.175
So they're thinking much
more about transparency.

00:14:09.175 --> 00:14:11.770
They're thinking much more
about things like collaboration.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.855
Interesting, too, you're
seeing Patagonia now take

00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:16.190
on some quite campaign
activist-y moves.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.250
They're creating a kind
of activist platform

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.386
to engage their customers as
activists in their causes.

00:14:21.386 --> 00:14:23.010
And you can see
Patagonia making a move

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.820
we see a lot of companies
making now, which

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.790
is they start by kind of sending
a lot more new power signal.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.637
And then they start
to change their model

00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:31.720
to move up into what we
call the crowd's quadrant.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.620
JEREMY HEIMANS: So
the crowd's quadrant,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.661
there's a lot of variety
in this quadrant, right?

00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:36.460
But it goes from
companies like, say,

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.900
an Airbnb, that we would
contrast to Uber, sort

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:46.390
of, largely based on values
and ability to deploy the base.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.860
So if you think
of Uber's drivers,

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.550
they're unionizing against it.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.940
And Airbnb's community
has been better managed,

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.662
and there's something there
that is meaningful to draw out.

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:58.120
But also, in that
top right, you've

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.830
got folks like
Black Lives Matter.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.330
And these are very
different, right?

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.860
These are radically
decentralized.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.470
They are what we might
think of as "leaderfull."

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.040
They come with
lots of advantages.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.123
We talk a lot about Black
Lives Matter in the book

00:15:09.123 --> 00:15:11.710
and spent quite a lot of
time with the founders.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.210
But they've also
got real challenges

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.950
that comes with that
degree of new power

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.980
without some of the, sort
of, strength and structure

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.601
that old power produces.

00:15:22.601 --> 00:15:25.100
And I think that brings us to
the most interesting quadrant,

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.620
which are the co-opters.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.565
HENRY TIMMS: So these are
the organizations, arguably,

00:15:29.565 --> 00:15:31.690
the strongest organizations
in the world right now,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.850
who have worked
out how to master

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.420
new power in their model,
but actually their values

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.040
are tending towards old power.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.999
So Facebook is obviously
in the news right now.

00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:42.706
And I think there's
a moment of, kind of,

00:15:42.706 --> 00:15:45.070
political consciousness
amongst the users of Facebook

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.860
right now to recognize
the tension here

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.070
between an organization, which
can get to such amazing scale

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.510
with our, quote, "power
to share," close quote,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.260
and their openness and
their connectivity,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.552
or the kind of the framing
of the Facebook argument.

00:15:58.552 --> 00:16:00.760
But there's a real tension
that people recognize now,

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.970
that actually the value created
by all of our participation

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.800
is extracted by Facebook.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.840
Also, to think about the
governance of Facebook

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.530
is actually quite shrouded,
as indeed is the algorithm.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.030
So there's a real realization
that there are co-opters here,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.113
people who are grabbing
all of this new power, all

00:16:15.113 --> 00:16:16.630
of this thirst
for participation.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.600
And they're actually pushing
it towards their own ends.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.080
JEREMY HEIMANS: And
one of the things

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.390
we do toward the end of the
book is sort of re-imagine

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.020
what these platforms
could look like.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.000
So we describe Facebook in the
book as a participation farm.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.960
And what we mean by
that is that we're

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.700
all the animals on the farm.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.190
And we're very
delighted and distracted

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.860
by all the participation
that we're doing on Facebook.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.170
But ultimately, the farmer is
extracting all of the value,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.670
right?

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.020
And we have very little agency.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.550
And we're fenced in
by that structure.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.760
And so at the end of the
book, I think the, sort of,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.710
nerdiest bit of
the book is talking

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.380
about how would we
re-imagine platforms to make

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.210
them more interoperable.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.850
How would we think about a
public interest algorithm?

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.699
So we can come back
to that in the Q&amp;A.

00:16:56.699 --> 00:16:59.240
HENRY TIMMS: We're going to take
a lot of time for Q&amp;A today.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.746
But before we do that,
I want us to tell--

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:03.370
I'm going to flip
through some slides--

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.450
the most interesting
and fascinating story

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.000
that we learned about when we
were writing this book, which

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.670
was the story of a video
game called "Star Citizen."

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.619
Does anyone know "Star Citizen?"

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.990
So in "Star Citizen,"
there is a man

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.900
called Chris Roberts, who was a
legendary creator of PC games.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.579
He created the legendary game--

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.614
PC-- "Wing Commander," which
was a huge hit back in the day.

00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:29.030
He finished this
game, and then he

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.080
disappeared and went
off to Hollywood

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.371
to make movies for a long time.

00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:33.590
And during the time
he was in Hollywood,

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.270
the PC game fell by the wayside.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.669
It was the era of "Angry
Birds" and "Candy Crush,"

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:39.460
and that was what was
getting all the heat.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.784
And PC games really weren't
the force they wanted to be.

00:17:42.784 --> 00:17:44.450
But he had no idea
for a new video game.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.575
And he wanted to come back.

00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:48.170
So he had this idea of this
game called "Star Citizen."

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.740
It was going to be
a PC-based game,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.900
and it was going to
be a world that people

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.980
would invent together.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.820
It wouldn't be a
game which was just

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.069
dropped down on people's head.

00:17:54.069 --> 00:17:56.210
But it would be kind of
co-created by the crowd.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.460
He shopped it around to
the traditional funders.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.477
They all said no.

00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:01.310
So eventually he went
to South by Southwest,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.057
and he did a talk at
South by Southwest.

00:18:03.057 --> 00:18:04.640
And he started talking
about this game

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.290
and said, well, here's
how it could look.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:07.660
And you can imagine
your own ships,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.660
and we could build
them together,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.290
and we could create
this new world

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.990
and think of all the
things that could happen.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.270
And he had these amazing
visuals that he went through.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.770
It was a very
powerful presentation.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.282
And about halfway
through he says, look--

00:18:17.282 --> 00:18:19.865
and he kind of-- he lost some
of his confidence at this point.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:20.990
It was a very
powerful presentation.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.114
He got a bit "unconfident."

00:18:22.114 --> 00:18:24.780
And he said, well, you know, if
you wanted to help support it,

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.020
you could help me crowdfund
it and put a very simple

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.560
ask out to crowdfund it.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.510
And he set a goal, I
think, of $500,000.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.230
By the end of this presentation,
15 minutes later, his website

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.390
had crashed because of the
volume of people donating.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.870
And by the next day, he
had hit his initial goal

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.910
for crowdfunding the game.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.494
And then it didn't
stop raising money.

00:18:45.494 --> 00:18:47.451
They said they would try
and raise-- $3 million

00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:48.980
was their goal,
to set $3 million

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.440
to really make the
games hugely successful.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.020
And in no time at all,
they had raised $3 million

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.780
from their crowd to
make this game together.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.060
But they didn't stop
raising money at $3 million.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.518
JEREMY HEIMANS: So
the dynamic that

00:19:00.518 --> 00:19:03.620
kicks in at this point is
that, essentially, they

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.300
start selling future assets in
this world that does not yet

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.110
exist.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.380
So they start
selling, like, ships.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.890
And there are
these great moments

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:19.490
as the target goes up and up
and up, like you could buy--

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.450
what were those things?

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.283
HENRY TIMMS: Decals.

00:19:21.283 --> 00:19:23.570
JEREMY HEIMANS:
Decals, like, sort of,

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.790
animal decals for your ship.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.430
You could buy
insurance for a ship

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.399
that exists in this new world.

00:19:30.399 --> 00:19:31.440
And if you imagine this--

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.510
HENRY TIMMS: Just to be
clear about that, what

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.400
you're essentially purchasing--

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.680
insurance for an imaginary
ship that doesn't yet

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.600
exist for the
condition in the future

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.560
that it might get
into an accident.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:40.800
JEREMY HEIMANS: Right.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.020
HENRY TIMMS: It's very
important to understand.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.910
JEREMY HEIMANS: Yeah, #youngmen.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.730
And so basically, long
story short, this target

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.950
goes up and up and up,
until it eventually

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.970
reaches $150 million.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.060
HENRY TIMMS: This is now the
biggest crowdfunding game--

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.750
this is the biggest crowdfunding
campaign in history.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.000
They've got now, here we are--

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.780
JEREMY HEIMANS: Oh, 160 million.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.571
HENRY TIMMS: It's
actually even higher now,

00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:09.320
1.8 million star citizens,
$160 million raised.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.409
And there's an amazing,
inventive world

00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:12.325
around "Star Citizen."

00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:14.210
So this is one of
the citizens says--

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.860
the Imperial News Network--

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.200
this is one of the people
who is playing the game, who,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.783
with his friends,
created his own news

00:20:19.783 --> 00:20:21.630
network around "Star Citizen."

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.463
And the whole thing is
amazing, because it's

00:20:23.463 --> 00:20:25.910
full of all this kind of ideas
about how things could be.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.022
And the fan forum is
very busy, and there's

00:20:28.022 --> 00:20:29.480
all these amazing
things happening.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.820
There's this incredible creative
community around the game "Star

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.364
Citizen."

00:20:33.364 --> 00:20:35.030
But there's one really
interesting thing

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.700
about all of this and all this
money and all these people

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.740
and all of this excitement.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.960
The game doesn't yet exist.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.770
It's over three years later.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.430
So the game that all
those people funded back

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.990
in the day, the
game that they said

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.540
they were buying on
Kickstarter, that game

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.920
still hasn't been delivered.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.970
It still hasn't shipped.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.140
And in fact, as we
speak today, there

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.610
seems to be no immediate
prospect of the game arriving.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.500
JEREMY HEIMANS: So you might
think these 1.8 million

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.740
star citizens would
be up in arms, right?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.320
They put all this
money into this game.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.595
And there was this
moment when the game

00:21:08.595 --> 00:21:09.830
is a couple of years late.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.970
This guy emerges from that
crowd called Derek Smart.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.840
And he says, listen,
there's no insight into how

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.020
this money's being spent.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.020
And some of the spending
was like really absurd.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.270
It's like we're going to get
Gillian Anderson and Mark

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.670
Hamill to record the
voices of these characters.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.180
They were spending
money like crazy.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.770
And he said, listen,
we want accountability.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.930
We want deadlines.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.310
We want our money back.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:38.130
And instead of the crowd
rallying around him,

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.970
he was, like, shouted
down by the other people.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.300
And we did these interviews with
some of these star citizens.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.570
And the line that really
came out and struck

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.520
us coming out of
that was one guy

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.880
said, listen, I pay to dream.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.750
And what he was really saying
was he pays to participate.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.450
And the participation
is the economic value.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.030
HENRY TIMMS: So you can
see this obviously--

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.819
an easy story to be
dismissive of, right?

00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:06.360
It's an easy story
to just say, well,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.430
this is just a Ponzi scheme.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.660
But actually what
it's telling us

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.493
is something quite
important about how money

00:22:10.493 --> 00:22:11.750
flows in the new power world.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.249
And so we put
together this equation

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:16.262
to try and unpack what's
going on behind "Star Citizen"

00:22:16.262 --> 00:22:17.720
that we see it
actually playing out

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.430
much more widely in society.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.820
There are three parts of
this participation premium

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.240
that we're thinking about here.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.781
JEREMY HEIMANS: So
the first is there

00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:27.125
has to be something in return.

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:28.840
So you think about
these new dynamics,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.180
these crowdfunding
sites, et cetera.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.066
You're not just investing
in the Red Cross

00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:34.690
and hoping that
something good happens.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:35.940
You're getting something back.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.430
So these people are
buying their ships.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.830
They're getting these
material or, in these cases,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.139
immaterial benefits
from the transaction.

00:22:45.139 --> 00:22:47.430
The second thing they're
getting is a sense of purpose.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.110
So the way Chris
Roberts builds this up

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.770
is he creates this mythology
where "Star Citizen" is

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.520
about group identity and it's
about us versus the world,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.270
because these PC-space sim
games had been forgotten.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.160
So as absurd as it might
sound if you're not into them,

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.210
this was incredibly motivating
to the people who then got

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.620
involved with "Star Citizen."

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.060
But there's this extra element.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.740
There's this
multiplier effect which

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.630
I think we've described,
which we think

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.360
really unlocks this
willingness for people

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.320
to spend huge amounts of money
on something that is delivering

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.260
them certainly ambiguous value.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.020
HENRY TIMMS: And this
equation isn't just

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.537
playing off in video
games, like "Star Citizen,"

00:23:28.537 --> 00:23:29.620
but also in big companies.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.150
There's a company in
China called Xiamoi,

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.310
which is a phone company.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.970
It's a startup.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.770
It was founded in 2010.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:41.154
And it's been valued at
$45 billion, with a B.

00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:43.570
They set a world record for
the most phones sold in a day,

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.480
selling 2.1 million
phones in a single day.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.670
What's so interesting about
how Xiaomi works is they

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.710
have built the company around
the participation premium.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.420
So they have three
things going on.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.980
First, they have
something in return.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.917
They sell very good, cheap
phones that people like.

00:23:57.917 --> 00:23:58.750
So, so far, so good.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.370
It's a good economic
transaction.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.744
But secondly, they have a
real sense of higher purpose.

00:24:02.744 --> 00:24:04.660
JEREMY HEIMANS: So they've
cultivated, again--

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.640
and we can look
at this cynically.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.390
But it's very meaningful to
the people who are involved.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:13.630
The company actually is
a Chinese colloquialism

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.350
for the word "millet," which
basically means revolution.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.250
It's a colloquialism
for revolutions.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.537
Obviously, it's not the
political revolution

00:24:21.537 --> 00:24:22.870
that some people might hope for.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.530
But these people have this
countercultural community

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.280
ethos.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.570
They gather all over China.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.570
There are thousands of
these Mi fans gatherings.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.160
They've got this
unbelievable group

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.150
of basically QA, volunteer
QA people and people

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:37.840
on their forums.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.210
They've got 40 million
people on their forums.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.770
And I think at any
given moment, when

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.712
they release their weekly
updates to the software,

00:24:44.712 --> 00:24:46.420
they have hundreds of
thousands of people

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.510
doing voluntary
testing on it, unpaid,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.190
like it was Habitat
for Humanity.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.120
And so they built this
very clever community,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.276
and they've also been
quite smart about the way

00:24:57.276 --> 00:24:58.900
they've gotten their
consumers involved

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.070
in product development.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.910
There's a particular story that
we tell in the book about a guy

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.580
gets drunk, stumbles home.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.310
He realizes there's a
problem with the flashlight.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.770
And that causes a
change in the product.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:15.022
And that story then gets told
to the rest of the community.

00:25:15.022 --> 00:25:16.480
HENRY TIMMS: Please
do two things--

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.540
in fact, three
things with the book.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.248
First, if you haven't
been given a copy--

00:25:19.248 --> 00:25:20.380
some people were here--

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.080
please buy it.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.754
We launch today.

00:25:21.754 --> 00:25:23.420
So this is our very
first talk in the UK

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.836
here at Google,
which is terrific.

00:25:24.836 --> 00:25:25.840
So please buy the book.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.330
The second thing is please
respond to the book.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.621
One of the things we really
wanted to do with this book

00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:32.150
wasn't simply have
people read it,

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.010
but have people build on it.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.930
Think about how it
applies to your own work.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.490
Think about ideas
that you can share.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.870
We've seen a lot of
user-generated content

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.250
already, which has
been super cool.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.416
And then number three,
again, a very new power idea,

00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:42.152
share the book.

00:25:42.152 --> 00:25:44.110
If you have a copy today,
give it someone else.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.000
Make sure your copy doesn't
end up on your library

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.110
but give it on,
because we really

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.910
wanted to start moving
around these ideas,

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.200
because we need the
right people to start

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.310
taking these issues up.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.350
It's been lovely to
be here at Google.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.410
And we appreciate
the invitation.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.910
JEREMY HEIMANS:
Thank you very much.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.730
[APPLAUSE]
