00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.450
Okay, and the correct answer is, as you may have

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.092
suspected, all of these. There are many different factors in each

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:10.596
website, is a little bit different. And, you know, different website

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:15.111
may have different needs. some, some websites you know, video websites,

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:18.710
like YouTube or Justin TV. Bandwidth was a major factor

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.580
because video takes a lot of bandwidth. And you have to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.470
figure out, you know, how you can support that much bandwidth.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.210
You know, you're sending a lot of data over the wire,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.680
over the Internet. Machines, computers very often CPU's a limiting factor. if,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.300
if your website does a lot of computation you know, you may need

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.850
a lot computers to handle all of the traffic, to do computation

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.940
for everybody. Or maybe you're running out of memory. You know, you're storing

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.740
a lot of data or you're caching a lot of data in

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.580
memory. You may need to store that data across many computers to, to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.850
make it work. Power, you know, if you're adding a lots of

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.870
computers, power is actually something you

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.079
need to start thinking about. You know,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.291
I've visited Google once and it was cool that had a,

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:56.284
a map on the wall of where the big power plants

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:59.620
in the world were. They are building data centers in near

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.010
power plants so they could always have powers. And storage, of course,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.580
is similar to memory. You know, memory, disk space, or technologies

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.040
that fall in, in between. You know if, if you're storing a

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.600
lot of data. You know many websites store a lot of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.309
data. If users are submitting content to you, photos and status updates,

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:18.011
and, you know, comments and that sort of thing. That

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.261
starts to become a big factor in, in your decision making,

00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:23.790
and how do you store all of that data. Facebook

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.310
has so many photos, they have to. They've unbelievable amount of

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.820
disk space required to, to manage all that information and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.328
you know Google has basically the entire internet indexed and you

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:37.107
know that they have to store, they basically Google's [INAUDIBLE] entire

00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:40.420
internet across all their machines so they can do searches quickly.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.390
So all of these are things you need

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450
to scale and of course there are other, other

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.710
things as well but I just want you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.730
to keep in mind that every website is different.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.140
Every website has different needs and different limiting,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.290
limiting factors whether it's machines or bandwidth or power.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.080
Anything can be the, the, the culprit when it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560
comes to keeping your website online, stable and fast.
