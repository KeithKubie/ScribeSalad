HANNAH FRY: So today we're going to talk about rock-paper-scissors

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.640
and I reckon everyone knows how to play it

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.200
Scissors beats paper, paper covers rock, rock blunts scissors, so three--

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.160
BRADY: Wait, I always thought it smashed them?
Dr. FRY: Oh, I thought it blunts them

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340
Actually, if anything, it would probably sharpen them, right?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.360
There are three strategies, each one of them loses once and wins once

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.720
So it looks like there's no strategy that you can play to win, but I'm going to show you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.260
about a new paper that had just come out where it gives you some top tips of how to win

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.300
So it's a group of Chinese scientists, where they run an experiment

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.800
where they got 360 students to play games of rock-paper-scissors with one another

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.760
300 rounds in every game, which took up to 2 hours,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.760
which is astonishing, students playing 
rock-paper-scissors for 2 hours

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.000
Okay, so normally if you have rock-paper-scissors

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:01.040
and some of you had rock (R) up there, and rock is beaten by paper (P), which is then beaten by scissors (S)

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.940
So none of these strategies dominate the other,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.540
so really all you can do is play each strategy with an equal probability: 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, okay

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.540
Now, if you were playing against a computer, who was choosing these perfectly randomly,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.500
then that would be the best thing for you to do -- just to pick each strategy with equal probability

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.340
But the thing is, humans are quite predictably irrational, so to say, in the way they choose their strategy

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
So, in recording what one of these students did in playing rock-paper-scissors

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.060
the scientists came up with two quite important findings of how people try to beat each other

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.020
Okay, so the first one is that people who win tend to repeat their strategy

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.020
So, for example, if I beat you by playing rock, there is a very high chance, or high probability

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.300
that I will play rock again the second time. If it worked once, it's going to work again, right?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.860
The second thing that they found out is that losers change

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.560
BRADY: To anything in particular, or...?
DR. FRY: Well,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.720
so this is a thing that you can exploit, essentially

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.960
so if you know-- so this gives us, I suppose, two strategies that we can use

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.520
So the first tip is that if you lose, that means the other person just won, right?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.600
So let's imagine that your opponent won by playing rock

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.800
Now, the chances are that they're going to play rock again, you should then play paper

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.560
so you just lost on scissors, so you should play paper

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.200
which means that, basically, even though paper beats rock

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.920
(so the cycle goes around like this: paper beats rock and so on)

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.720
you should go the other way around the triangle

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.600
Let's imagine that you played scissors, the other person played rock,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.660
what you should do is you should go backwards around this triangle and play paper the next time

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.940
because of the high chance that they're going to play rock again

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.320
So that's the first thing: Go backwards, I guess

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.120
Or another way to say it is -- essentially, you've just played scissors, they've played rock

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.720
so play the thing that didn't come up in that, if you lose

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.280
Now the second thing, is that if you've just won

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.360
now, they're going to expect you to play the same thing again, right?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.240
which means, that they're going to play the thing that you would beat the thing that you just played

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.720
so you need to play the thing that would beat that would beat the thing that you just played

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.000
which is equivalent to saying, you need to play what they just played

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.080
you want to [laughs] let's go again

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.400
[both laugh]

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.640
BRADY: I like the easy way better, so you should play what they just played

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.200
DR. FRY: You should play what they just played, yes

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.160
So let's imagine, then, you just won -- you played rock, right? -- and you just won on rock

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.520
that means that they played scissors, now they're going to think that you're going to play rock again,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.600
which means that they're going to play paper, which means that you should play scissors

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.320
and so again, you basically end up going backwards around the triangle

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.080
so play what they just played, and the game go backwards

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.680
or an easier way to say it then is to play what they just played.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.320
So in general, if you're cycling through rock-paper-scissors, your best strategy is to go backwards

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.360
and go scissors-paper-rock, and cycle through that way

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.200
BRADY: How much-- Is this mathematics or is this psychology? This is--

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.720
I can't tell if this is all to do with probability, or it's just about knowing how humans think

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.160
DR. FRY: Well, I think that a balance of the two, so it's rooted in game theory

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.000
which is the mathematics of looking at decisions and strategies,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.200
so in any situation where you're competing against someone,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.760
and you best move is dependent on what the other person is playing, you can frame in game theory

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.600
