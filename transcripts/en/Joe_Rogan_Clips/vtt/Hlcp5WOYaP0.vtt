1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.800
Yeah.
And I think like I still have,

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.530
have you ever heard of what's called like user dreams?
No.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.890
Where like I think I've fucked up and I was smoking weed again and then I wake

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:10.620
up and I'm like,
oh my God,
how am I going to stop?
Cause I love,

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.590
I love smoking so much.
You know,
or whatever your vice was,
you know,

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.760
if it was like whatever was,
yeah,
you're just like,

7
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:21.540
you wake up and you think you're doing it again and then you realized nom I'm

8
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.300
all good.
I used to have dreams like that where I had to go back to high school.

9
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.960
Really?
I just have dreams for years.
Man.

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.200
Did you hate high school and fucking hit me too.
I don't think anyone likes it.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.150
And you're like,
you know,
soon to be a professor fucking doctor or something.
But

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.710
<v 1>well I just had no idea what I wanted to do for a living and I was just like,</v>

13
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.420
being trapped in a classroom constantly was excruciating.

14
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.070
I must've had I,
I mean I probably do have like some crazy form of add.

15
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:52.760
I don't know.
I've never been diagnosed and never been to a shrink.
But if I did,

16
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.690
I,
I mean I'm sure they'd probably try to put me on something if I tried to tell

17
00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:59.270
him what's going on in my head all the time,
they'd be like,
Jesus,
sit down,

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.620
hold on,
take these,
take these whatever you do.
It is bad.

19
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.310
But when I was in highschool,
I fucking hated it and I barely got by.

20
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.200
And then when I got out of high school,

21
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.980
I would have these dreams where I'd wake up in the middle of the night and I

22
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:15.260
didn't have enough credits to graduate and you have to go back.

23
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.780
And I was sitting there in my bed,

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.100
but before I woke up trying to decide whether or not I was just going to fucking

25
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.430
drop out and not graduate from high school,

26
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:30.431
not have a high school diploma or go back and do another fucking year of hell.

27
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.760
And it was my,
my guts would turn and I'd wake up and Oh my God,
I graduated,

28
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.340
<v 0>I graduated.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was the worst I did.
I was the same way,
man.</v>

29
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:44.110
I just like just barely got by high school.
Did you go to school out here?
Well,

30
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.900
I grew up in like Fontana.
Okay.

31
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.940
Riverside County yet fallen Tuckey shout out to double dose more tie out there.

32
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.030
Yeah.
So people like to fight in Fontana.

33
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.240
People like to fight everywhere.
Um,
now you either fight Beverly fighter,

34
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.200
play football in Fontana?
Yeah.
Oh,
he's on meth.
Yep.
But uh,

35
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.760
yeah,
it was the same way.
Just,

36
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.030
just skated by high school and then I remember I didn't even want to walk.

37
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:11.170
I fucking hated it so much.

38
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:15.160
I actually rode my skateboard with my friends that were like much older than me

39
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.720
that I go skateboarding with every day.

40
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.050
And we were skateboarding by the high school is everyone walked and got their

41
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:24.100
diploma.
That was just,
did you get your diploma?
That yeah,
they sent it to me,

42
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:26.080
but I mean to,
I didn't want to fucking be there,

43
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.950
<v 1>go to my graduation and I'm like,
I'm gone.
Yeah.
I'm like,</v>

44
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.800
this is once I got through,
I'm like,
you don't have me anymore.

45
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.940
I can be free.
It took me a while to figure out what the fuck to do next.

46
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.610
<v 0>Yeah.
I would sit there and they would be like,
so what do you want to do?</v>

47
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:43.430
Like talk to counselors.
And I was like,
I just want to play drums in a band.

48
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.310
Really?
And they'd be like,
well that's not an option.

49
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:50.620
Like what college are you going to?
And they would talk to me like,
I was like,

50
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.180
just insane.
Isn't that crazy?

51
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:55.550
That there's so many bands and there's so many drummers?

52
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.150
Why is that not an option?
Yeah.
Why is that not an option?
It'd be better.

53
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.120
They just said,
well,
you know,
like,

54
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:04.330
I don't know if they motivated you to actually do what you're passionate about

55
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.090
instead of just being,
well,
well that's not gonna happen.

56
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.080
So what do you want to do?

57
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.470
<v 1>Fucking people that probably wanted to be drummers and just never got a push and</v>

58
00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:16.320
never,
never,
you know,
never made it through.

59
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.060
But then there's the other argument that if you really want,
you'll find a way.

60
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.300
<v 0>Yeah.
You,
you got to do it.
I mean,
my dad used to tell me the same thing.</v>

61
00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:27.750
He'd be like,
you gotta have a plan B.

62
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.910
And I'd be like,
well if I have a plan B,
I'm not going to try that hard.
Yeah.

63
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.940
I started thinking in my head and then that's when I just said Nah,
fuck that.

64
00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:43.440
Like I'm,
it's only this,
no matter if I'm rich or poor,
whatever,

65
00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:46.110
whatever the circumstances,
this is what I'm doing.

66
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.480
Like I don't give a fuck with the outcome is

67
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.190
<v 1>I think that's the right mindset.
Yeah.
I don't think people get by that well.</v>

68
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.690
Like when I was uh,
just starting to do stand up,

69
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.890
there was a lot of guys who had full time jobs and they got degrees and you
know,

70
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.370
they would work their full time job and then they would just do stand up like a

71
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.630
couple nights a week.
They never made it.
Yeah.

72
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.270
Cause the obsessed guys and women,
the people that were just like I,

73
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.320
this is my fucking life.
This is what I do.
I'm going to do this.

74
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.610
Those are the ones that do it.

75
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:17.610
The no safety net people and the ones that made it.

76
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.050
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
it's gonna fucking happen.
You just have to,</v>

77
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.730
you have to stick with it.

78
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.990
I feel like the people who really stick with it and give it like 110%,

79
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.340
your time will come.
It's w however big or small it is,
something will happen,

80
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.070
you know?

81
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.150
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah.</v>

82
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:36.720
If you figure it out and keep improving and keep learning and learn from your

83
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:38.540
mistakes and learn from your setbacks and,

84
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.780
and keep trying to push and get better and improve.
If you do,

85
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:46.920
all those things is as hopeless and helpless as it seems.

86
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.950
If you continue to improve,
you've got to get to a better place.

87
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.480
You've got to get better and one day you'll be undeniable.
And if you don't,

88
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.490
and if you just fall back on that safety net,
you're always gonna wonder.
Yeah.

89
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.440
You're always going to look at Travis Barker goal,

90
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.150
fucking ham on the drums and going,
shit,
that could've been me,
dude.

91
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.050
<v 0>I almost did it.
I actually at one point in my pops and my pops is awesome,
but,</v>

92
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.960
um,
he's like Vietnam vet and you know,

93
00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:15.320
wrote him a Harley his whole life and he just basically said to me,
he's like,
Yo,

94
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:18.880
you gotta either got to start paying rent at the house cause you,
you know,

95
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.360
you're not in high school no more or,
and get like a 60 hour a week job,

96
00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:26.750
like a real job or you need to go,
you know,

97
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.390
go fucking play drums but you're not going to do it here in my garage.

98
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.810
So I was like,
okay.
And it was probably the best thing that was ever said to me,

99
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:34.610
you know,
as harsh as it was or whatever.

100
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.830
And then I had actually caved in and I just told my,
my friend Nola,
I was like,

101
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.300
you know what,
I think I'm just gonna,

102
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.020
I'm going to get this fucking job cause I just somehow got a job.
But mate,

103
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.650
you know,

104
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.400
in a warehouse it was like target warehouse making pretty good money compared to

105
00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:53.720
what I was making at the time.
And,
um,
and he hit me the next day and he's like,

106
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:55.220
I think you're making a big mistake.

107
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:58.760
I think you're very fucking talented and think you'll regret this and you can

108
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:03.110
get this bullshit job any anytime down the line,
come live with me on,
you know,

109
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.690
stay at my house.
You could sleep on the floor,

110
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.410
the couch and let's play in this fucking band and do it.
And I did it,

111
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.660
you know,
I was like a trash man in Laguna beach,

112
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.080
lived in like this studio apartment with a couple other guys and just fucking

113
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:20.510
took off like I had to like,
I mean there was like humility too,
you know,

114
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:24.710
there was like playing bar after bar and you know,
you know,

115
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.370
but I was eating,
I was eating,
I was,
you know,
I,

116
00:06:27.371 --> 00:06:29.480
I was skateboarding every day and I was living at the beach,

117
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:32.930
playing in a band with my friends.
So for me,
I had already made it.

118
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.380
Those are the best stories.
Yeah,
they're the best stories.

119
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.770
And I think back even to this day,
I go to the gunas sometimes I'm like,
wow,

120
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.160
that was kind of one of the best moments of my life besides my children being

121
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:47.870
born like poor no money but like happy as fuck.

122
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.080
Like can't even think of another time I was that happy,
you know?

123
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.200
<v 1>Yeah.
That's cool.</v>

124
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.250
Well the only pressure is the pressure of trying to succeed.

125
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.660
There's not the pressure of already succeeding in the overwhelming pressure that

126
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:04.560
you must experience now.
Yeah,
those are great stories man.

127
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.060
The stories of like where you didn't know if it was going to work.
Yeah,

128
00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.980
you figured it out and clue those stories.

129
00:07:10.981 --> 00:07:14.820
Right now some kids are listening to those stories right now listening to you

130
00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:18.820
say this and they're like,
fuck man,
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to go forward.

131
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.050
Like who knows how many rock stars you're making right now just saying this.

132
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.080
Cause a lot of them are

133
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.350
<v 0>teeter tottering like am I going to do it?
Am I not going to do it even,
I mean,</v>

134
00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:30.010
I was at the time,
you know?
And you just have to,
you know,

135
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.220
don't worry about being cool or being fucking rich or having money.

136
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:38.221
Just be passionate about what you're passionate about and fucking dedicate 100%,

137
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:39.060
you know?

138
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.400
<v 1>Yeah.
There's those moments,
man,
when you're first starting out,</v>

139
00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:45.320
anything where it's not sure.
Yeah.
It's not a,

140
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.890
it's not a definite thing.
You were in this weird limbo space like,
man,

141
00:07:49.891 --> 00:07:52.740
am I going to be a loser my whole life?
Like what's going to happen to me?

142
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.390
And those moments,
man,
when you look back and you realize you could acquit,

143
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.170
but you kept going,
you figured it out,
you sucked it up,

144
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.630
you worked your way through it,
you improved.
He kept moving.
Yep.
Yeah.

145
00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:10.770
That's,
that's life,
man.
Yeah.
That's what defines you,
ma'am.
Yeah,
it really does.

146
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.990
I just love those fucking stories.
I can never get enough of them,
man.
The dirty,

147
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:20.030
grimy,
and then finally you make it story.
Yeah.
Fast.
