00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.091
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Slope intercept form is a great way to write the equation of a line, but it

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:09.082
isn't the only way. In the previous question, one of the equations was 2x plus

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:13.516
3y equals 6. This is an example of equation written in standard form. Standard

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:17.611
form has the variables on one side of the equation with coefficients, and then

00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.797
other side is usually constant. In standard form, we actually usually list the x

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:26.040
variable first, followed by the y term. I want to talk more about this equation,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.478
specifically the slope of this line. But first, let's think back to the previous

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:34.738
lesson and see if you remember how to calculate the x and y intercepts. So fill

00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:38.872
in the missing numbers. Where does the x intercept occur and where does the y

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:39.895
intercept occur?
