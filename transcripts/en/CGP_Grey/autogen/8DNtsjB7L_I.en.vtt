00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.850
one of the simplest if not the best ways

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860
one of the simplest if not the best ways
 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.860
one of the simplest if not the best ways
to do a proportional system is to have

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870
to do a proportional system is to have
 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.930
to do a proportional system is to have
voters simply put an X next to their

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940
voters simply put an X next to their
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.519
voters simply put an X next to their
favorite party and then you take those

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
favorite party and then you take those
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.410
favorite party and then you take those
results from the citizens votes and you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
results from the citizens votes and you
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.450
results from the citizens votes and you
try to match your representatives to

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
try to match your representatives to
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.549
try to match your representatives to
that as closely as possible given the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559
that as closely as possible given the
 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.020
that as closely as possible given the
number of seats that you have in your

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
number of seats that you have in your
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.550
number of seats that you have in your
legislative branch but one of the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
legislative branch but one of the
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.109
legislative branch but one of the
philosophical problems that you might

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
philosophical problems that you might
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.820
philosophical problems that you might
have with such a system is that the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
have with such a system is that the
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.400
have with such a system is that the
citizens aren't voting for individuals

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
citizens aren't voting for individuals
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.259
citizens aren't voting for individuals
in particular they're voting for the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
in particular they're voting for the
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.269
in particular they're voting for the
party in general and what that means is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
party in general and what that means is
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.950
party in general and what that means is
there needs to be a meeting that happens

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
there needs to be a meeting that happens
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.210
there needs to be a meeting that happens
somewhere at the party headquarters

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
somewhere at the party headquarters
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.849
somewhere at the party headquarters
where they determine who their favorite

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
where they determine who their favorite
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.580
where they determine who their favorite
candidates are and so when the monkey

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
candidates are and so when the monkey
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500
candidates are and so when the monkey
party gets told that they have three

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
party gets told that they have three
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.959
party gets told that they have three
seats they have already made a list of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
seats they have already made a list of
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.030
seats they have already made a list of
who gets the first seat the second seat

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
who gets the first seat the second seat
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740
who gets the first seat the second seat
and the third seat proportional systems

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
and the third seat proportional systems
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360
and the third seat proportional systems
do have the advantage that their

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
do have the advantage that their
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.819
do have the advantage that their
explicit goal is to try to match the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
explicit goal is to try to match the
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.590
explicit goal is to try to match the
legislative branch of the government as

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
legislative branch of the government as
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.869
legislative branch of the government as
closely as possible to how the citizens

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
closely as possible to how the citizens
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420

is not its goal its goal is actually

trying to make sure that as many

trying to make sure that as many
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270
trying to make sure that as many
citizens as possible have local

citizens as possible have local
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910
citizens as possible have local
representatives that they voted for and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
representatives that they voted for and

also to minimize the number of unhappy

also to minimize the number of unhappy
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.830
also to minimize the number of unhappy
voters and as a side effect you get a

voters and as a side effect you get a
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109
voters and as a side effect you get a
roughly proportional legislature but not

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
roughly proportional legislature but not
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.659
roughly proportional legislature but not
exactly
