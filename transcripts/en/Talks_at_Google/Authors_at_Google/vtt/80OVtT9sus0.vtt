&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hello everyone.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.680
I'm Winnie Lam.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.139
It is my absolute honor to welcome Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen
to Google today who's gonna talk to us about

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.180
her new book, Giving 2.0.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.009
Laura is the founder and chairman of the Stanford
Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.669
She's also founder, former chairman, and chairman
emeritus of the Silicon Valley Social Venture

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.810
Fund.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.499
She teaches philanthropy at Stanford University
and at the Graduate School of Business.

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:36.090
It is my absolute honor to welcome her to
Google today to talk about her new book.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.060
So without further ado please give a really
warm welcome to Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.520
[applause]

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.230
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Thank you Winnie.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.050
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.240
Thank you all so much for taking the time
out of your chaotic schedules to join us here

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.240
today.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:07.330
As I was prepping for this event, I went onto
the Google Authors site and was watching many

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.650
of the different presentations: extraordinary
politicians, extraordinary business leaders,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.490
extraordinary academics, extraordinary philanthropists.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.000
And there was one session that I watched in
particular that I wanted to draw attention

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.159
to because I think there are so many similarities
between me and this individual who is of course,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.690
it goes without saying, Lady Gaga.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.979
We have so much in common.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.590
As you can see both of our maiden names end
with aga --

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.590
[laughter]

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.930
which is important.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.930
[laughter]

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:03.260
If you Google Lady Gaga, there are about almost
500 million search results and if you Google

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.569
Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen there are almost
500 million less search results.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.829
[laughter]

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:18.650
Additionally we both wore black mini dresses
to our Google talks which I think is very

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.159
important.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:28.519
And additionally Lady Gaga was selected as
one of Time's most influential people in the

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.420
world and I read that issue.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.829
[laughter]

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.709
But on a serious note, the one thing, the
one thing that Lady Gaga and I do have in

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.870
common is that we both have philanthropic
foundations and we are both fiercely committed

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.680
to access to opportunity and equality for
all.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.389
And that is really the core purpose of the
work that I'm doing in philanthropy and my

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.269
inspiration for creating Giving 2.0.

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.809
[pause]

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:13.600
In each of our lives, we have these moments,
whether it is a disturbing article that we

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.419
read in a magazine about the state of public
education here in this country, whether it

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:27.809
is a personal experience we've had perhaps
having access to knowledge through our public

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:33.480
library as a child, or well I guess that was
true for my generation but perhaps not true

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.120
for the generation of every single person
in this room.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.939
Or being the beneficiary of somebody else's
generosity like through a college scholarship

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:51.989
or it could be something that we learn about
in the world that horrifies us, that upsets

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:03.749
us such as famine or abuses to women and children
in a particular country or simply not having

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:05.669
freedom of expression.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:14.150
But each of us has these experiences that
inspire us to realize that there is this whole

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.989
world outside of ourselves.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.759
And these experiences inspire us to want to
reprioritize and to want to make a change

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:32.210
and to start living in service of others;
to give.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.520
And for me my giving story began with my parents.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.670
I am extraordinarily blessed to be the daughter
of two amazing philanthropists.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.990
My father, John Arrillaga, Senior has dedicated
easily upwards of half of his time and financial

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.000
resources over the last two decades to his
philanthropic work.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.400
But in particular I want to tell you about
my late mother, Frances Arrillaga.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.100
This is Frances.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.909
She was my best friend and my soul mate.

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:23.470
She was filled with a radiant grace and generosity
and she expressed her generosity in how she

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.560
chose to live her life every day.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.300
During the last two decades of her life, she
sat on dozens of non-profit boards, she co-founded

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.310
two non-profits, she ran our family foundation,
but most importantly she was an extraordinary

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.090
community volunteer.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.680
She is my role model.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:56.139
It's probably not surprising that this woman
birthed a daughter who also shares the giving

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:04.209
gene along with, as you can see from this
photo, a lifelong love of wearing mini dresses

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:05.209
--

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:06.209
[laughter]

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:08.009
starting at age two, critically important.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:16.840
But it was the giving gene that she gave me
that was activated at a very specific time

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.280
in my life.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.750
It happened in 1993.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.090
I'd just graduated from Stanford, I was working
at a really exciting high tech company here

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.340
in the Valley that unfortunately was not Google,
and I had just been accepted to Stanford Graduate

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.570
School of Business.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.460
All of my dreams were coming true.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.910
Three weeks later we found out that my mother
had cancer.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:52.539
That day I quit my job and I deferred business
school and I stayed at home and became her

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.410
primary caregiver.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:02.410
And this was a journey that lead me for the
20 months during her illness, prior to her

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:09.919
passing, to understand for the very first
time what human suffering was, and to live

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:16.120
for the very first time completely in service
of another human being.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.319
And that was the most profound, meaningful
experience of my life.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:28.250
And I realized during this time of essentially
becoming a mother to my own mother in her

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:37.110
time of greatest need that the very purpose
for my life was to live in service of others.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:47.129
And ultimately, ideally was to help other
people understand ways of giving that can

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:54.430
be deeply meaningful not only to the organizations
and people that each of us aspires to help,

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.729
but also deeply meaningful to ourselves.

00:07:57.729 --> 00:07:58.729
[sound of pages being turned]

00:07:58.729 --> 00:07:59.729
[pause]

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:11.110
So how many people here in this room find
giving deeply meaningful?

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.460
How many people find that giving makes you
happy?

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.889
If giving makes you happy clap your hands.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:18.889
[clapping]

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:20.150
Clap your hands.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.410
Thank you so much.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.669
Happy Holidays and I'll --

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.669
[laughter]

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:25.669
be signing books in the back.

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:34.150
Okay, so every single person in this room
is a giver; not only is a giver, but you give

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.160
joyfully.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:42.780
How many people in this room self identify
as a philanthropist?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.290
Raise your hand.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.370
[pause]

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:53.790
Okay, so only a handful of people in this
room self identify as philanthropists, yet

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:59.040
every single person in this room gives.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.670
That's an interesting disparity.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.340
And I think I know why that is the case.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:15.070
Because you might feel like self identifying
as a philanthropist is too self promotional

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:24.020
or you do not fit the mold, or you do not
have enough money to consider yourself a philanthropist.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:32.710
For me, I believe the very idea of what a
philanthropist is is ripe to democratized.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:40.150
Philanthropy actually derives from the Greek
word philanthropis which means love for human

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.810
kind.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:47.930
There is no mention of money in this definition.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:58.030
The only thing that you need to have to be
a philanthropist is generosity; the only thing

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.960
you need to have.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:09.980
I believe that a philanthropist is anyone
who gives anything: time, money, experience,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:19.150
skills, networks, passion, compassion in any
amount to create a better world.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:25.830
In the 21st century, this definition is a
redefinition of this word.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:32.940
It's a departure from what we've traditionally
thought about as a philanthropist.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:42.310
In the 21st century there's actually an enormous
spectrum of what a philanthropist is.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:49.310
If you volunteer at Hospice, you are a philanthropist;
if you write a fund-raising campaign or an

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:56.140
awareness-building campaign on Facebook, oh
I mean Google+, you are a philanthropist;

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:03.830
if you walk for a cure, if you donate even
ten dollars to provide vaccines for children

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:09.740
in developing countries, or if you have the
opportunity to donate a million dollars to

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.040
your alma mater, you are a philanthropist.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.070
What is so important to remember about the
philanthropic spectrum is that there is no

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.620
financial hierarchy; there is no financial
hierarchy.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:34.120
If a gift is significant to you, whatever
form and whatever size it takes, it will be

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.790
significant to somebody else.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.930
[pause]

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:46.810
Democratizing philanthropy, I believe, is
a critical need both for our society and for

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.580
our world.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:56.160
I want to call out specifically though the
power of the individual giver, the power of

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.040
individuals like every single person in this
room within the broader context of the philanthropic

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.450
sector.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.770
This is a pie chart.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.570
Okay that was really funny!

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.570
[laughter]

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.060
I've been gearing up for this one slide for
like three weeks.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.520
Come on people!

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.240
I need you on my team here.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.240
[laughter]

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.960
This is actually a pie that I made for Thanksgiving
this year which is actually a lie because

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960
--

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.000
[laughter]

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.270
my beloved has actually banned me from the
use of both the oven and the gas stove at

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.140
home due to several kitchen fires --

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.140
[laughter]

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.640
that may or may not have been instigated by
myself.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:49.170
Consequently I've developed extremely advanced
microwaving skills, but that being neither

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.520
here nor there, I digress.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.060
Last year U.S. philanthropy totaled in excess
of $290 billion.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:06.630
And you are probably going to be a little
bit surprised to hear that individuals made

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.780
up over 80 percent of this giving.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:17.650
It's not the major foundations and it's not
corporations who drive American philanthropy,

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:23.300
it's individuals like each one of you.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:30.980
Last year in fact three out of four American
households made a philanthropic gift.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.540
[pause]
And when we look at who in fact is giving

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.040
and how much they are giving it is actually
the people who have the very least to give

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.070
who are giving the very most.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:53.120
Additionally last year almost 63 million Americans
volunteered their time.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120
Yes?

00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.060
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Is that the percent of their
income that they give or is that that percentage

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.060
that [unintelligible]?

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.450
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: This is the
percentage of income that on average each

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.230
give.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.440
Sixty three million Americans volunteered
their time --

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.950
&gt;&gt;Female #1: [unintelligible]
[laughter]

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.750
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: I need to get
back to you on that?

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.030
But thank you for that question.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.600
Sixty three million Americans volunteered
their time.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:33.220
Those efforts totaled in excess of 8.1 billion
hours.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:40.730
If you value each of those hours at what is
probably a grossly low $20 per hour, that

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:47.530
totals almost 170 billion dollars in value.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:55.440
You can see from this data that it is in fact
ordinary Americans with extraordinary generosity

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.870
who are driving American philanthropy.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:07.180
Philanthropy here in this country is actually
about the 99 percent not the one percent,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.810
which are typically the people that we read
about.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:19.000
That being said, giving at a time right now
may seem like an economic paradox.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.500
It's a time where in any given state unemployment
is wavering between 8.5 and 13 percent.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:36.120
Now more than ever we need to do more with
less.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.720
Let me show you why.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.760
[sound of pages turning]

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760
[pause]

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:49.190
Globally 2.6 billion people are living on
less than $2 a day.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:54.190
Two dollars is less than the price of a loaf
of bread at Safeway.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.450
[pause]

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:05.110
Two point six billion people globally do not
have access to basic sanitation and 1.1 billion

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:12.850
people entered the 21st century unable to
read or write their own names.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:20.210
Here in this country, nationally, one in six
Americans is living in poverty.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:28.510
And poverty is being defined at just over
$22,000 a year for a family of four.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.840
That's about the same cost as a low end Prius.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:43.810
Additionally, every 26 seconds a high school
student drops out of high school here in this

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:44.810
country.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:51.980
So during the course of our hour together,
about 125 students will drop out of high school.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:57.120
High school dropouts in this country are eight
times more likely to go to prison and they

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.390
are not eligible for 90 percent of jobs.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:10.780
Locally here in California one in four children
live in poverty; one in four children.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:18.170
And 1.2 million students dropped out of school
in the last year.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.959
Right up the road about five minutes up the
road in East Palo Alto, only 18 percent of

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:30.530
people over the age of 25 have a high school
diploma.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:36.120
These are horrifying realities.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.860
And what's equally horrifying is the fact
that we are not solving these social problems

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.020
with the way that we have been giving to date.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:53.070
We have to start giving in a way that matters
more.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.940
[pause]

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:05.620
A recent study, in summer of 2010, estimated
that 65 percent of all gifts by individuals

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:13.750
were based purely on emotion; they had no
research behind them.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:20.650
When a gift is based purely on emotion you
ultimately have probably no understanding

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.880
of the impact that that gift has.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.630
You have no understanding of the meaning of
your gift in the organizations that you are

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:37.010
trying to support and in the lives that you
are ultimately trying to touch.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.810
Which gift would be more meaningful to you?

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:46.710
If you were giving $1,000 would it be more
meaningful for you to give that gift to end

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:54.390
poverty or would it be more meaningful for
you to know that because of your gift of $1,000,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:19:01.870
ten unemployed veterans were able to participate
in a job training with the ultimate goal that

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:07.170
seven out of those ten had a new job within
six months?

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:13.210
I want you to take five seconds and just close
your eyes or look down and think about what

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:20.880
gifts you've given whether it's your time
or your influence or your dollars.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.980
Which gifts have you given have been most
meaningful to you?

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:33.860
Just think about it for a second.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.620
[pause]

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:43.550
My guess is that the ones that are most meaningful
to you are ones where you did understand the

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:53.180
meaning that your gift has and where you didn't
just give your dollars but you rather engaged

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:59.780
all of your resources: you gave your passion,
you gave your time, you gave your influence

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:08.820
as well, you gave your portfolio of resources
to that specific cause.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:18.260
So my question, my daily question to myself
and my question today to all of you, is why

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:27.480
wouldn't we put the same amount of time and
effort and thought behind every single social

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:36.580
investment that we make as we do behind every
single for profit investment that we make?

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.790
[pause]

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:47.940
The problem that we have is that Americans
give a huge amount of time and money every

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:53.270
year, but we are not giving to our fullest
potential.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:21:00.410
We are giving largely based on emotion and
passion when in reality we need to marry our

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.290
hearts with our minds.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:10.300
We need to choose the issues that drive our
philanthropy based on our passion but we need

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:16.940
to choose the organizations that we fund based
on our intellect.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.540
So how do we actualize our philanthropic potential?

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.760
How do we, as I like to say, get from 1.0
to 2.0?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.910
Let me suggest a basic roadmap for you.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.740
[pause]

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:38.940
First and foremost we need to shift our giving
from reactive to proactive.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.210
So what does reactive giving look like?

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:49.360
Reactive giving is when it's the holiday season
and on our kitchen counters at home, we have

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.430
dozens of mail solicitations from very worthy
non-profit organizations which we may or may

00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:03.520
not know anything about and we make our giving
decisions based on those mail solicitations.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.140
Or at the end of the year when we're looking
back at everything that we've given we realize

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:15.790
that over half of our giving was based on
what other individuals, what our friends and

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:21.980
co-workers asked us to give to as opposed
to our own passion.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.150
Reactive giving is something you feel like
you should do.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:36.560
Proactive giving is when your giving is based
in your particular passion or passions.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:45.420
It's when you invest not just your dollars
but also your time, your influence, your networks,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.260
and your expertise.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:56.640
Reactive giving is when you give to causes
that move you deeply and that's what enables

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:04.620
you to engage your intellect to have the understanding
that makes your giving not just something

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:11.970
that's momentarily gratifying, but something
that contributes to your life long happiness.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:17.510
Proactive giving is something that you want
to do and when you want to do something as

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:22.780
we all know you're much more likely to do
much more of it.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:27.660
We need to shift our giving from sympathetic
to strategic.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:37.960
Sympathetic giving is when you give based
on, for example, a late night television ad

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.040
that shows a hungry child in need.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.690
While your intentions are very much in the
right place you're essentially giving into

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.960
a vacuum.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:55.620
You have no idea if any of the money that
you're giving will ultimately get to the child

00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.650
who inspired you to give in the first place.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:09.640
I would argue that it actually benefits us
greatly to extract a bit of the emotion that

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:15.860
drives our giving and replace it with a bit
of learning and knowledge.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:24.360
When we give strategically we are actually
balancing our personal passions and we are

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:30.730
balancing the pull on our heart strings and
the emotional drive to give with an understanding

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:40.440
of core public needs and where our dollars
can be most effective; sympathetic to strategic.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.179
And finally we need to make a shift from isolated
to collaborative.

00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:53.120
Isolated giving is when we do our giving sitting
at home, at our desk, writing checks, mailing

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.990
them off and that constitutes our philanthropy.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:03.370
Isolated giving is when we give $20 into the
collections basket at our place worship once

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.440
a week or once a month or once a year.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.080
When you give in isolation you're actually
drastically limiting the potential impact

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.700
of your gift.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:20.910
So we need to shift from isolated to collaborative.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:28.230
When you choose to give collaboratively you
have a whole new world of possibilities both

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:35.360
for the strategic and the personal or social
benefit that your giving can have.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:42.170
When you give with other people you are essentially
sharing your passion and you're sharing the

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:49.240
experience of expressing your generosity,
you're sharing something that makes you happy.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:55.800
When you give collaboratively you also have
the potential to benefit from each other's

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.350
knowledge and learning.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:07.190
So I encourage everyone to consider coming
together in a giving circle, formally or informally,

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:14.320
with members of your family, close friends,
members of your place of worship, co-workers,

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:21.740
and do research together about something you
share passion for together.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:27.600
Calling local experts and understand what
are the most critical needs in your particular

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:35.130
issue area and then make your giving decisions
collaboratively.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:43.679
Reactive to proactive; sympathetic to strategic;
and isolated to collaborative; giving 1.0

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:45.840
to giving 2.0.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.330
So let me bring these core tenants to life
with a few examples.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:27:00.200
This is a tax return like the ones that were
prepared with love and joy for free that helped

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:07.580
low income families save more money for back
to school clothes for their kids and healthier

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.870
meals on the table.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:16.700
These tax returns are like the ones prepared
by Hector Chau.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:23.830
Hector is a retiree who lives on his pension
in Western Los Angeles.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:29.610
Hector does not have financial resources to
give, but what he does have to give are his

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.140
time and his expertise.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.100
Hector was a tax accountant for 20 years.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:42.560
Hector volunteers with the AARP's Tax Aid
Program which every years harnesses the time

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:52.010
and expertise of over 30,000 volunteers and
together they prepare tax returns, free tax

00:27:52.010 --> 00:28:01.710
returns, for about 2.6 million families at
an average tax return prep cost of $229, that

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:06.440
totals about $600 million in value.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:15.940
So Hector's time and expertise translates
directly into money saved for low income families.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.650
Hector Chau is a philanthropist.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.930
[pause]

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:30.059
This is a laptop like the ones that were used
to provide computer training for a young girl

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:38.240
in Guatemala, who through this computer training
suddenly had access to knowledge from all

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:45.730
around the world which she can use to pursue
her lifelong dream of becoming a teacher.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:55.380
This computer training was provided with a
$40 gift by a young professional in Seattle,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.179
Washington named Seema Bhende .

00:28:58.179 --> 00:29:04.540
Seema is passionate about global poverty and
education.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:11.630
Seema is building on generations of volunteerism
and social justice work of her parents and

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:17.050
her grandparents in her native country of
India.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:22.600
Seema selected this gift which she made through
a funding intermediary called The Jolkona

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:29.740
Foundation because of the role that computer
training played in the development of her

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.920
own career.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.170
Seema guides her giving by strategy not sympathy.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.870
Seema is a philanthropist.

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.050
[pause]

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.050
This is a soccer ball --

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.570
[pause]

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:53.070
like the ones that are used to teach a group
of East San Jose girls a new sport and in

00:29:53.070 --> 00:30:01.500
turn a new confidence in themselves which
helps them thrive both in school and in life.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:08.920
And across the field, their mothers are leaning
exercise in a simultaneous program.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:15.700
They're also learning about nutrition and
how to cook healthier meals for their children.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.970
Through this program, through the Bay Area
Women's Sports Network, an entire family's

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.580
well-being is improved.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:34.210
And this non-profit is funded through a giving
collaborative that includes Joon Yun and Kimberly

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.210
Bazar.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:42.890
Joon and Kimberly, a married couple who met
in medical school, are partners at SV2, the

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.120
Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:52.780
They are passionate both about women's rights
but also about philanthropic innovation.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:31:02.320
So they choose to give not only their expertise
and their time but also their resources to

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:11.810
give collaboratively through SV2 and in turn
are part of a larger portfolio of 35 early

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.359
stage innovative non-profits.

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:23.010
And through their collaborative giving these
non-profits are able to ultimately touch many

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.810
more lives.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:27.210
[pause]

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:35.680
These stories teach us, I believe, a powerful
lesson about how philanthropy is being democratized.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:43.260
There are countless opportunities now for
us as individuals to have tangible, meaningful

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:50.910
impact with all of our gifts, again whatever
their size and whatever their form.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.910
[pause]

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.900
[sound of pages turning]

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.710
So what can you do and what can you do right
now?

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:04.530
What can you do when you go back to your desks
and you pretend that you're working when in

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:10.520
reality you really want to be completing all
of your holiday shopping online?

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:20.540
Sitting here in Silicon Valley, you are at
the epicenter of technology and technological

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.540
innovation.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:30.360
In my mind this is the most exciting place
to be in the world primarily because of how

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.100
technology is democratizing things.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.920
Technology democratizes entire nation states
as you know, but what I find most beautiful

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.720
about technology is how it's democratizing
philanthropy.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:55.750
Four ways, four of countless ways, that it's
doing this: number one, technology is providing

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.960
access to information.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:07.100
Any individual who wants to be a philanthropist
can now go online and have access to the funding

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:15.280
portfolios and due diligence of many of the
most highly staffed, professionalized philanthropic

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.309
foundations in the world.

00:33:17.309 --> 00:33:27.440
This is like having direct access into super
high performance money manager portfolios.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.490
This access to information gives us the power
to shift from not just being charitable but

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.679
being strategic philanthropists.

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:43.510
Technology also gives us access to unique
giving opportunities.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:51.650
Technology connects individuals across states,
across countries, across oceans with unique

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:58.820
giving opportunities and an understanding
of how your gift is directly impacting somebody

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.860
else's life in another part of the world.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:09.979
So a lawyer in Kansas City or an engineer
here at Google could be directly connected

00:34:09.979 --> 00:34:16.960
and make a gift to fund a young girl's education
in Afghanistan or make a $200 gift to provide

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:25.679
a prosthetic limb for a manual laborer in
Bangladesh; access to unique opportunities.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:33.179
Through social networks, individuals are now
able to self-identify by the organizations

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.169
and issues that we are most passionate about.

00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:42.049
And with five or ten minutes of your time
you can create a fund raising campaign or

00:34:42.049 --> 00:34:48.009
an awareness building campaign or an entire
movement and with the click of a mouse send

00:34:48.009 --> 00:34:54.349
it out to your entire social networks; powerful.

00:34:54.349 --> 00:35:00.289
And technology also provides us access to
problem solving.

00:35:00.289 --> 00:35:09.410
Now through creative swarms and crowd sourcing,
individuals who are otherwise completely disconnected

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:17.229
can collaborate online to solve some of our
world's most pressing social problems like

00:35:17.229 --> 00:35:20.950
famine in East Africa.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:32.200
These are just four simple examples of an
entire world of opportunity that technology

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.930
is creating for social change.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:44.740
It's extraordinary to me that what's happening
right now at this moment is creating an entire

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:53.700
new platform that has potential to in turn
create an entire new culture for the philanthropic

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.950
sector; a culture of innovation.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:05.979
And in my mind it is the individual donors,
who as we saw earlier, make up upwards of

00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:14.380
80 percent of all giving, who have the responsibility
to drive this new culture of innovation.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:19.619
The onus is on us to innovate in our philanthropy.

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:21.200
[pause]

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:29.980
Every single person in this room has the potential
and has the intellect and the resources to

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.910
be innovative in your giving.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:40.819
And its innovation, I believe, this incessant
learning and evolution which is what will

00:36:40.819 --> 00:36:45.779
ultimately drive each of us reaching our own
philanthropic potential.

00:36:45.779 --> 00:36:51.359
When I think of innovation I think of three
different things: the creation of something

00:36:51.359 --> 00:37:01.380
new; the renewal of something that already
exists; and new thinking around existing processes

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.869
and systems and problems; the creation of
something new.

00:37:06.869 --> 00:37:13.849
For example, peer to peer giving sites like
the Jolkona Foundation and Donors Choose didn't

00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:18.499
exist 10 or 11 years ago.

00:37:18.499 --> 00:37:22.420
Donors Choose was created by a former teacher.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:27.789
Jolkona Foundation was created by a former
Microsoft programmer.

00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:36.289
Donors Choose in the last decade has channeled
over $100 million directly into core needs

00:37:36.289 --> 00:37:40.640
in public education classrooms around the
country.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.640
[pause]

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.249
Whoops, wait, we didn't mean to do that slide
quite so quickly.

00:37:46.249 --> 00:37:47.249
[pause]

00:37:47.249 --> 00:37:53.119
The suspense is killing you, I know.

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:56.210
The renewal of something that already exists.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:03.869
For us as individual givers, we are constantly
coming together in groups whether it's a religious

00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:14.079
studies group or it's a work group or you're
part of a book club or an investment club.

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:23.700
You have these built-in micro social networks
that you can expand to help improve your philanthropy.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:30.749
You can take any of these clubs, any regular
gathering that you have with your friends

00:38:30.749 --> 00:38:37.250
or other members of your social network and
you can create a philanthropic element to

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.190
this group that already exists.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:47.279
On my website at www dot giving 2 dot com,
starting in January, I will be providing free

00:38:47.279 --> 00:38:55.579
agendas and resources to help you take any
group and have a giving club component to

00:38:55.579 --> 00:38:59.539
it for 2012.

00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:06.880
And new thinking around existing problems
and systems and processes.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:14.910
I challenge everyone in this room, myself
included, to make a New Year's resolution

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:22.650
that you're going to approach your philanthropic
giving with the same degree of seriousness

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:27.420
as you do your for profit investments.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:36.670
With philanthropy individual lives are at
stake so why wouldn't we require an expected

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:45.940
return for every single investment that we
make in other people's lives and in our broader

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.920
society?

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:55.530
These are just three types of ways that we
innovate probably things that you do on a

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.950
regular basis in your own careers.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:04.059
So these are things that are very familiar
to you.

00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:11.319
But what's important when we go back to thinking
about the role of the individual giver, individual

00:40:11.319 --> 00:40:18.440
givers, yourselves included, gave $235 billion
last year.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:28.910
Imagine the potential of those dollars coupled
with volunteer efforts if we applied innovation

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.049
to our giving.

00:40:32.049 --> 00:40:34.569
[pause]

00:40:34.569 --> 00:40:40.619
So what is your Giving 2.0 going to be?

00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:48.579
I believe that what it is we do for other
people during the course of our lifetime ultimately

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:53.029
defines who we are as people.

00:40:53.029 --> 00:40:58.960
What's amazing is that every single one of
us has the ability to write the chapter of

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.839
our lives that is our giving legacy from start
to finish.

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:09.289
There are so many things in our lives that
we cannot control.

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:17.319
I cannot control the fact that I lost my mother
to cancer, but what I can control is how I

00:41:17.319 --> 00:41:23.490
choose to celebrate her legacy through my
giving.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:30.970
Giving is one of the few things in your lives
that you can completely control; you get to

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:37.130
make every single decision yourself.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:45.440
Every person here has the potential to be
an extraordinary philanthropist, but what

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.431
you choose to do with that potential is ultimately
up to each of you.

00:41:50.431 --> 00:41:59.900
So as you go forth and you be philanthropic
I encourage you to always remember that it's

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:05.349
not about what you give but rather it's about
how you give.

00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:07.440
Thank you.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.530
[applause]

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:15.800
Yeah, lunch time!

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.890
[laughter]

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.980
[laughs]

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.069
[pause]

00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:29.180
&gt;&gt;Male #1: We do have a mic if you have any
questions for Laura.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180
[pause]

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.049
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thank you so much for the presentation.

00:42:33.049 --> 00:42:34.200
That was wonderful.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.950
You talked a lot about accountable giving
and knowing where your dollars are going.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:43.400
I'd be curious if you could provide some comments
on indices or benchmarks or types of metrics

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.450
people are able to look at when really knowing
where their dollars are going.

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:53.559
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: It's a fantastic
question and a question that every single

00:42:53.559 --> 00:42:59.859
person I know in the philanthropic sector,
myself included, struggles with every single

00:42:59.859 --> 00:43:00.859
day.

00:43:00.859 --> 00:43:09.619
One of the trickiest parts about metrics for
giving is the fact that it is virtually impossible

00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:17.710
to create generalized metrics even across
social issue areas because every non-profit

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.599
organization has a unique model.

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:31.619
What I can say is that, for you as an individual
philanthropist, if you've seen one non-profit

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:34.670
you've seen one non-profit and that is it.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:40.950
So every non-profit you will need to do research
on yourself.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.410
[pause]

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:50.839
There, so there are lots of different online
assessment tools that are, assessment organizations

00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:52.529
that have been created.

00:43:52.529 --> 00:44:00.210
There's GuideStar, GreatNonprofits, Philanthropedia,
GiveWell just to name a few.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:07.789
I would encourage you though, for every non-profit
that you're making a gift if that gift is

00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:15.859
significant to you, I would go and read their
annual report or even better, read their 990

00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:22.890
report so you can see exactly how their finances
are breaking down.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:30.410
Anybody who claims that having minimal overheard
is a sign of an effectively run non-profit,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.960
I believe, does not know what they're talking
about.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:40.559
There are grass roots advocacy organizations
that are going to have upwards of 80 percent

00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:45.079
of overhead and that's gonna be fine for that
particular model.

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:51.940
Then there are major endowed institutions
who technically are not gonna have any expenses

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:58.170
every year that they have to raise through
overhead line items.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:02.450
Again it's totally specific; I think specific
to the non-profit.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:12.339
I think that if an organization cannot tell
you specifically what success looks like in

00:45:12.339 --> 00:45:17.930
the short term and the intermediate term and
in the long term, that is how they know if

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:23.079
they're achieving their mission, then I would
not invest in that organization.

00:45:23.079 --> 00:45:30.240
You should be able to easily answer the three
following questions: how many, how deeply,

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.240
how much?

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:39.569
So how many people are being touched, how
deeply are they being touched by a specific

00:45:39.569 --> 00:45:45.549
dollar amount, that is how holistic is the
approach of this particular non-profit, and

00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:55.349
how much does it cost them to serve each individual
life that they aspire to transform?

00:45:55.349 --> 00:46:02.019
And finally, I think that just as leadership
plays a critically important role, actually

00:46:02.019 --> 00:46:06.509
two final points, just as leadership plays
a critically important role in the for profit

00:46:06.509 --> 00:46:09.940
sector, the same is absolutely true of non-profits.

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:16.640
So I invest in some non-profits who have extraordinary
leaders even when their particular mission

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:21.519
and isuary is totally outside of my area of
passion.

00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:29.690
And then also I think it's so critically important
that every non-profit involves their ultimate

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:37.390
customer, that is the people who benefit from
the services, in the creation of whatever

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:42.440
their service model is; so involving the customers
in the products.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:49.349
Winnie was just telling me that Google's holiday
gift to all the employees was the new phone

00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:56.569
that you guys have which my beloved actually
got on Friday and is incredibly excited about.

00:46:56.569 --> 00:47:06.200
But what's so cool about that strategic corporate
gift is Google now has the feedback loop of

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:11.859
individuals who would be in their customer
base in terms of what features work well,

00:47:11.859 --> 00:47:16.539
what isn't working well, what's appealing,
what isn't appealing, what's useless, what's

00:47:16.539 --> 00:47:17.539
useful.

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:21.490
The same needs to be true of how non-profits
create their products.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.920
That was a very short answer --

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.920
[laughter]

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.920
to that simple question.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920
[pause]

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.099
Yes, thank you.

00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:35.479
&gt;&gt;Female #3: I have a question about how you
feel disaster relief efforts fit into this

00:47:35.479 --> 00:47:40.519
strategic planning about how you wanna give
and where to give to in times of disaster?

00:47:40.519 --> 00:47:43.420
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Yeah, in general,
you're speaking in general, right?

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.640
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Well yeah, in general but in
the past few years there've just been so many

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.640
and it feels--

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.640
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Yeah.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.130
&gt;&gt;Female #: like you're inundated with pleas
to give to different regions of the world

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.130
who all --

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:54.130
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Yeah.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.209
&gt;&gt;Female #3: equally have an urgent requirement.

00:47:55.209 --> 00:47:58.430
It's very hard to understand where you make
the most impact.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:59.930
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Thank you.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:05.799
So I believe I read about a week ago in the
New York Times or the Wall Street Journal

00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:16.740
that last year alone natural disasters and
catastrophes totaled about 300, it's either

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:24.299
300, and I know this is a huge different,
or 390, Zack to you remember, billion dollars

00:48:24.299 --> 00:48:31.069
in damage which is obviously in excess of
all philanthropic dollars that were given

00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:32.630
in the United States.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.319
I think it's really important when you're
approaching philanthropy that you think of

00:48:37.319 --> 00:48:39.809
it in terms of a portfolio.

00:48:39.809 --> 00:48:45.739
And I think the most significant amount of
that portfolio should be driven by your personal

00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:46.739
passion.

00:48:46.739 --> 00:48:54.109
That being said, I also think it's really
valuable to have a friends' fund where you

00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:59.059
allocate a certain percentage of what you're
gonna give every year to what friends and

00:48:59.059 --> 00:49:03.279
co-workers etcetera want you to share with
them.

00:49:03.279 --> 00:49:10.259
But I also think it's important, if emergency
services and disaster relief is not your personal

00:49:10.259 --> 00:49:18.549
passion, I think it's important to allow for
space in your giving portfolio for those needs

00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:28.690
because the reality is when a natural disaster
happens or when a man-made disaster happens

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:38.440
or when an individual is attacked or a woman
is raped or a house burns down, that is the

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.079
greatest equalizer in our world.

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:50.440
Like, it does not matter who you are, where
you work, what education you have, we are

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.119
all equal in that situation.

00:49:53.119 --> 00:50:02.460
And I, personally, believe that emergency
services and disaster relief is a critical

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:08.950
component of what we all should be doing;
it's actually the primary issue area that

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:17.020
my beloved and I fund with our philanthropy,
primarily because it's the single most underfunded

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:23.549
area in medicine, in institutional medicine.

00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:31.900
But I always encourage everyone to participate,
but do so only through pre-vetted institutions.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:37.339
So if you choose to give to the Red Cross
do so with full awareness of the fact that

00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:42.160
the Red Cross when it's raising money for
any given disaster will be keeping a portion

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:48.710
of that money so that it has immediate funds
that can get right into the hands of the people

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:52.719
that need them the most when the next disaster
happens.

00:50:52.719 --> 00:51:00.719
Another great way to meet core community needs
and critical needs through a very secure --

00:51:00.719 --> 00:51:04.479
[pause]

00:51:04.479 --> 00:51:10.269
pre-vetted type of organization is giving
through local community foundations.

00:51:10.269 --> 00:51:16.410
So when Hurricane Katrina happened or --

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:20.240
[pause]

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:26.599
when 9/11 happened it was the United Way of
New York City and the New York Community Trust

00:51:26.599 --> 00:51:30.329
that came together and created the September
11th Fund.

00:51:30.329 --> 00:51:37.729
And that ultimately was one of the most, was
probably the most successful effort that met

00:51:37.729 --> 00:51:44.709
not only short term but also immediate term
needs for that particular crisis and did so

00:51:44.709 --> 00:51:47.930
in a way that broadly defined who the victims
were.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:48.930
[pause]

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.410
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Hi --

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.280
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Hi.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.710
&gt;&gt;Female #4: thanks so much for being here.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:02.079
My question is about the idea of program funding
versus unrestricted funding.

00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:06.400
And I know nowadays obviously program funding
is really sexy, everyone wants to give to

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.160
programs because you can see your direct impact,
you can see the people that you're helping,

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.920
you're buying supplies, blankets whatever,
but that the reality of many non-profits is

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.329
that the kind of funding they really need
is unrestricted funding for their general

00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:21.769
operating budget.

00:52:21.769 --> 00:52:25.940
What's your, what kind of advice do you give
to donors to get them to understand the importance

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.940
of that?

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.529
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: That's one of
my very --

00:52:28.529 --> 00:52:30.160
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Versus like seeding --

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.540
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: favorite topics.

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:40.589
One of my personal goals is to make general
operating grants even sexier than program

00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:47.829
grants, because program funds are the single
easiest funds for any non-profit to raise

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:58.430
primarily because if you do a bit of research
you can connect directly with a teen, a troubled

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:06.219
at risk youth, who you're helping to get an
education or a family that you're helping

00:53:06.219 --> 00:53:13.069
through providing transitional housing to
or a specific number of individuals who are

00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:17.170
getting treatment for a particular disease.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:25.670
But in reality none of those programs would
even exist if organizations did not have the

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:32.950
general operating funds that provides the
core infrastructure for all of their service

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:33.950
provisions.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:40.289
At SV2, the Silicon Valley Social Venture
Fund, we actually only give organizational

00:53:40.289 --> 00:53:48.019
capacity building grants and we do that primarily
because those are the single hardest funds

00:53:48.019 --> 00:53:50.269
to raise.

00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:56.119
The only type of grants that my husband and
I give through all of our philanthropy, and

00:53:56.119 --> 00:54:02.390
same with my family's philanthropy, are general
operating grants.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:13.819
So I would encourage you to understand the
impact that a non-profit has, but don't impose

00:54:13.819 --> 00:54:24.579
your personal needs or ego or idea of what
the organization needs on that organization;

00:54:24.579 --> 00:54:29.519
make an investment in the leadership team
and let them allocate those funds.

00:54:29.519 --> 00:54:30.519
[pause]

00:54:30.519 --> 00:54:33.489
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Hi.

00:54:33.489 --> 00:54:36.469
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Hi.

00:54:36.469 --> 00:54:43.170
&gt;&gt;Male #2: My name is Sebastian and I work
in a team that actually seeks to provide non-profits

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:48.010
with AdWords advertising so I'm particularly
inspired in a way I see us trying to connect

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:52.709
NGOs with those millions of givers out there
so thank you for the talk.

00:54:52.709 --> 00:54:56.859
It's great to see that you're educating these
givers and you're getting much more of them

00:54:56.859 --> 00:54:58.960
onto giving.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.440
What I wanted to ask and something that I
struggle is to in trying to get a more holistic

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.259
picture of the whole non-profit sector, so
what are the ways I mean understanding the

00:55:08.259 --> 00:55:12.359
different players, different types of NGOs,
umbrella orgs?

00:55:12.359 --> 00:55:17.430
And you touch upon some of that from a particular
angle in your book, but are there any courses

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:21.769
out there or here in the area that we can
take to keep furthering our understanding

00:55:21.769 --> 00:55:22.769
of the non-profit sector?

00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:23.769
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Ahh --

00:55:23.769 --> 00:55:25.069
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Any suggestions?

00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:28.989
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: That's such
a fabulous question.

00:55:28.989 --> 00:55:30.660
[pause]

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:37.529
You know what I would love to do is if you
wanna give me your card and Winnie, perhaps,

00:55:37.529 --> 00:55:40.920
we can work with you in this.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:48.819
Why don't I and my team, my two former star
students, Stacy Walder from the Business School

00:55:48.819 --> 00:55:53.729
and Zack D'Angelo from my undergraduate class,
why don't you give us a couple weeks and we'll

00:55:53.729 --> 00:56:02.920
put together like a big bibliography of resources
that you can tap into to help further your

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.920
work.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.190
&gt;&gt;Male #2: That'd be amazing.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.699
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Okay, great.

00:56:06.699 --> 00:56:07.699
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thank you very much.

00:56:07.699 --> 00:56:08.699
&gt;&gt;Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen: Sure.

00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:09.699
Thank you all so much.

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:09.700
[applause]
