00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:14.789
Duct tape, originally called “Duck” tape,
was originally invented by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.460
Permacel division during WWII for the military.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.140
The military specifically needed a waterproof
tape that could be used to keep moisture out

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.300
of ammunition cases.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.079
This is why the originally Duct tape came
only in army green.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.570
As to why it was originally called “Duck”
tape by the soldiers isn’t entirely known.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.590
It is commonly thought that because it was
green and shed water, like a duck, the soldiers

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.550
took to calling the tape “Duck” tape.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.550
An alternative theory is that they called
it thus because it resembled strips of cotton

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.640
duck.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.740
Soldiers began noticing the tape wasn’t
just good for waterproofing ammunition casings,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.440
but also worked great for repairing things.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.160
They began using it for repairing jeeps, guns,
and aircraft.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.870
Due to its waterproof nature, strength, and
built in adhesive, they even began using it

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.960
as a temporary means to close up wounds in
emergencies; this is fitting because the closest

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.990
predecessor of duct tape was also a Johnson
&amp; Johnson medical tape product.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.380
So how did “Duck” tape eventually come
to be known as “Duct” tape and be sold

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.150
primarily silver in color instead of army
green?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.930
When the soldiers of WWII came home, they
brought “Duck” tape with them.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.000
Shortly after their return, the housing market
was booming.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.750
Some manufacture then got the bright idea
to start using the tape as a means to connect

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.130
heating and air conditioning ducts; this idea
caught on among home manufacturers and they

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.549
started using it in many of the new homes
being built.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.891
To allow for this usage, the tape’s primary
color was switched from green to silver, so

00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:43.530
that it would match the ducts.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.220
Soon, the tape began being referred to as
“Duct” tape instead of “Duck” tape.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.549
Ironically, researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory, Environmental Energy

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.670
Division concluded that you should never use
Duct tape to seal ducts.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.420
Their tests showed that under typical duct
conditions, duct tape becomes brittle and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.420
will fail quickly.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.340
Duct tape also can catch on fire or just smolder
and produce toxic smoke.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.439
Because of this, it’s usage on ducts has
been prohibited by the state of California

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:26.859
as well as in building codes in most 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:35.719
of 
the U.S.
