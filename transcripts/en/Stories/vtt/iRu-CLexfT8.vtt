00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.080
NARRATOR: The Sahara hasn't
always been a desert.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.200
At one time it was a savanna.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.620
Now I could cite a bunch of
statistics about rainfall,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.210
but just look at this
satellite photo of Africa.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.390
That's all sand and rock.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.597
But 7,000 years ago it was
a very different story.

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:18.680
There are cave drawings
from that period featuring

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.210
cows and elephants.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.690
It was a grassland.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.320
But those pictures
of cows eventually

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.330
gave way to pictures of camels.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.370
The weather changed, the
rain slowed and then stopped,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.220
and the desert took over.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.120
We know about the
Sahara's ancient history

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.190
because of those small,
scattered cave paintings.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.420
But for more recent
history, for the story

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.170
of man's place in the desert,
we have towns like this one--

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.905
though we may not
have it for very long.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.280
Michael Huniewicz was planning
a trip through Mauritania,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.260
through the thick of the Sahara
desert, when he found something

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.089
worth checking out.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.880
MICHAEL HUNIEWICZ: Went
to my local library

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.870
looking for a guidebook
on Mauritania,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.390
which they didn't have.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.030
But they had one on West Africa,
and it had maybe two pages

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.209
dedicated to Mauritania.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.920
And there it was, "The Forgotten
Libraries of the Sahara."

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.602
What can possibly sound
more romantic than that?

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.060
NARRATOR: The
guidebook was talking

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.640
about this town, Chinguetti,
and the forgotten libraries

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.980
there, which are
a local treasure.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.740
Back in the 13th
century, the town

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.540
was a major stop for caravans
hauling wool, barley, dates,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.490
ivory, ostrich feathers,
gold, and slaves

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100
along the well-worn trade route.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.975
And apparently there are
written records of this.

00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:32.850
MICHAEL HUNIEWICZ: They
describe the caravans

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.830
coming in and out
of the city back

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.880
in the day, some of the
mentioning tens of thousands

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.440
of camels daily.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.460
NARRATOR: Those records
are just one part

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.525
of the forgotten libraries,
because as all the goods passed

00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:47.980
through Chinguetti over the
centuries, as did knowledge,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.670
scholars here collected books
on math, language, astronomy,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.620
and law.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.980
A mosque was built, and some
of the earliest Koranic texts

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.960
found their way to
these libraries.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.440
Chinguetti quickly became
known far and wide as an oasis

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.580
and learning in a vast
and hostile desert.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.570
But eight centuries
later, Michael

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.389
arrived to find a
very different place.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.050
Chinguetti feels
like a ghost town,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.320
and it's really hard to
believe that supposedly

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.580
4,000 people live there.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.460
I'm not sure what they do.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.830
Some of them work
in the libraries.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.860
Some of them work
in the local schools

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.811
for children called "madrasa."

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:29.310
NARRATOR: The
libraries are now what

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.760
put Chinguetti on most maps.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.490
And they've earned it a place on
UNESCO's list of World Heritage

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.440
Sites.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.620
Day to day, though, it's up to
the small army of librarians

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.656
to protect the books and share
their knowledge with visitors.

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:42.280
MICHAEL HUNIEWICZ:
There are librarians

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.480
who are kind enough to show
you the books, many of which

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.540
are centuries old.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.820
The librarians handle
the books using gloves.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.910
But you get the impression
that it's not the safest way,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.760
and indeed many of the books
are literally falling apart.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.200
NARRATOR: And sadly, that
might be an apt metaphor

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.930
for Chinguetti itself.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.410
The librarians do their
best to keep the town going,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.210
but they get little help from
the Mauritanian government,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.060
which has its hands full
dealing with Al Qaeda factions

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.420
within its borders.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.220
And most importantly, they must
fight the desert which is ever

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.077
encroaching on the town.

00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:17.660
Michael left Chinguetti with a
sense of impermanence weighting

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.357
on him.

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:20.940
MICHAEL HUNIEWICZ: No one knows
how much longer than libraries

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.580
will stand, as the
population is dwindling,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.020
the state of the books
is deteriorating,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.210
and the sand is slowly
taking over the town.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.780
NARRATOR: As cities
continue to grow,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.670
small villages and
towns like Chinguetti

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.670
are disappearing
at a rapid rate,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.580
alongside the last
nomadic tribes who

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.010
lived in these spaces.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.026
Watch this episode
to find out more.

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:45.650
Photographers have
been taking pictures

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.360
of disappearing cultures since
the early 1900s, when Edward S.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.600
Curtis started documenting
some American Indian tribes

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.757
before their traditional way
of life disappeared completely.

00:03:56.757 --> 00:03:57.590
