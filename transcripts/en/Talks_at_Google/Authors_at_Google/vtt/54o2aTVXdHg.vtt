00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:04.690
HAL VARIAN: My
name is Hal Varian.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.320
I'm the chief economist
here at Google.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.080
And it's my great pleasure
to introduce my friend

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.970
and colleague Glenn
Hubbard, who was named

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.120
Dean of Columbia Business
School on July 1, 2004.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.410
So he's been a dean
for nine years.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.690
As a former dean, I can tell
you that's a lot of fortitude.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.160
I'm very impressed.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.510
He's been a Columbia
faculty member since 1988,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.650
and he's the Russell
L. Carson Professor

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.940
of Finance and Economics.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.690
He holds A.M. And Ph.D.
degrees in economics

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.490
from Harvard University.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.810
In addition to writing more
than 100 scholarly articles

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.840
in economics and finance,
he's the author of two leading

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.700
textbooks on money
and financial markets,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.870
as well as a author/co-author
of several other books.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.216
And his commentaries appear
frequently in "Business Week,"

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:55.840
the "Wall Street Journal," "New
York Times," "Financial Times,"

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.920
"Washington Post" and
several other publications.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.650
In government, Professor Hubbard
served as a Deputy Assistant

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.230
Secretary of the US Treasury
Department for tax policy

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.910
from 1991 to 1993.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.190
And he was also chairman of the
US Council of Economic Advisers

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.640
under President George W. Bush.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.370
So when we invited
him to come out,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.560
I explained that this
was Halloween or nearly

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
Halloween week.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.660
And I said when you come,
wear an outfit that's

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.090
really kind of
different and scary.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.310
And so he said, I know,
I'll wear the outfit

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.290
from when I was at
the tax policy group.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.795
And sure enough, it gave
me a start when I saw it.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:37.560
So, Glenn.

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:42.040
GLENN HUBBARD:
Yeah, apologies in

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.730
advance for being
dressed like a banker.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.820
Being before you, I have
a lot of Columbia events

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.280
while I am out here.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.330
It's a real treat to get to
talk about "Balance" with you.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.100
And I'll say a bit,
but I am happiest if we

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.610
have a conversation about it.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.770
I'll say a little bit about what
the book isn't and what it is,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.530
at the beginning.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.820
What it isn't is yet
another decline-ist screed

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.450
from an economist,
historian, political science

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.370
about what's wrong with America.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.710
That's not what the book is.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.032
What it is is a
fantastic Christmas gift.

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.490
If you want to buy 500 copies,
give it to all your friends,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.190
that that's just terrific.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.780
And I should say
that unless you want

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.430
to talk with me about short
term policy issues in Q and A,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.450
this is going to be really
a book about the long view.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.280
I mean, George Bush
once said about me

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.310
that Glenn can't even
predict the past.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.020
And I think what he meant by
that was data get revised.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.300
But I'm not going
to sit here and talk

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.960
about forecasts over the year.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.512
I'll do whatever
you want in Q and A,

00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:46.210
but that not why I'm here.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.700
I wrote the book "Balance"
with a fellow economist

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.490
named Tim Kane, because
it helps me go back

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.050
to why I became an economist
in the first place.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.350
I was very interested, as I
explain to freshman whenever

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.280
I teach freshman economics,
in the following question.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.756
Why isn't the whole world rich?

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:06.130
It sounds like a
simple question.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.030
It's actually devilishly hard.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.550
We know there are enormous gaps
over time and place in wealth.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.690
And where do those come from?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.730
And in a lot of my own
work as an economist,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.230
like many economists I've tried
to focus on sources of growth.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.550
What ignites prosperity?

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.500
This book has a
slightly different take.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.160
It's the mirror, the
flip side of that.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.990
It's about what happens
when growth stops.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.220
Basically, we know we have
episodes where economies

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.620
grow for very long periods of
time and become great powers.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.990
And then that growth either
decelerates sharply or stops.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.750
And what do we know about that?

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.240
What do economists have to
say about great power decline?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.620
Now I come at this
from two perspectives.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.550
One is history, and I'll
say a little bit about that.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.640
But what I'll talk a
little bit more about

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.300
is the contemporary
United States,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.780
because this is obviously
a topic that's on the mind,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.060
not just of economists
but policymakers and many

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.210
average folks in our country,
of where we're heading

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.950
and what growth is likely to be.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.420
And to start and frame
the idea with you,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.470
let's suppose that rather
then sitting here today,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.310
we were getting together
about 100 years ago.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.800
So it's 1913, and we're on the
eve of the first World War.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.260
And if you want to look at
what per capita income was

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.250
in industrial countries
in today's dollars,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.799
that would've been typically
about $3,000 in 1913.

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:42.590
That number is obviously
much higher today,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.170
which tells you
about growth we've

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.220
experienced in the past century.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.580
If you were lucky enough to
be an American or a Brit,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.600
that $3,000 number
was about $4,000.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.150
Now let's turn the clock back.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.380
So it's not 1913 anymore.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.890
It's year 1,000
in the Common Era.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.890
If you were to look at
the same numbers-- again,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.020
today's dollars, so we're
comparing apples to apples--

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.990
that number would
have been about $400,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.140
which tells you again
there was growth

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.150
in the intervening period.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.840
But here's where I
want to start with you.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.630
Let's turn the clock way back.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.340
So not to 1913, and not to
the year 1000, but to Rome

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.580
at the time of Caesar Augustus.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.340
In that period in
Rome, the prosperity

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.780
in the core areas of what
was then the Roman Empire

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.680
was actually greater than the
prosperity 1,000 years after.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.130
Now that's kind of
hard to understand,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.550
because typically
we think that there

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.410
can be slowdowns in growth,
slowdowns in productivity,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.210
maybe slowdowns in technology.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.120
But that kind of absolute
regress on a very grand scale

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.800
for a very long period of time
can be hard to understand.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.630
Now this is a familiar topic.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.512
And indeed Paul Kennedy, who
is a very famous historian,

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:03.970
wrote a book-- some
of you may have

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.140
seen it-- about 25 years
ago called "The Rise

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.840
and Decline of Great Powers."

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.939
And Kennedy had in
mind, connecting

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.480
essentially the same
points I'm going

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.790
to try to connect with you.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.700
What happened to Rome?

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.320
And what might happen
to America today?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.670
And in Kennedy's view, if you
looked at great power decline,

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.750
whether that was Ancient Rome,
the British Empire, which

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.620
would have been the
most recent preeminent

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.380
power before America,
and America today.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.370
It was all about
military overstretch.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.450
So Kennedy had this very, very
elaborate overstretch thesis.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.680
And indeed what caught
me about his book,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.510
and the reason I was somewhat
skeptical as an economist,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.180
was the cover.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.310
So if you look at the cover of
Kennedy's book, it's a globe.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.280
And it has stairs that are
going up and down the globe.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.260
And if you look at who
is has tripped and fallen

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.400
almost to the floor,
it's John Bull,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.360
who's the symbol of
the United Kingdom.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.980
Already starting to
stumble a little bit,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.310
but not having fallen
all the way down,

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.700
is Uncle Sam, symbol
of the United States.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.035
Who do you suppose is rising
up the stairs very confidently?

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:16.670
Now keep in mind, I
told you this book

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.750
was written 25 years ago.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.890
A Japanese salary man.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.390
Right?

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.800
So coming up the stairs, this
view that Japan was necessarily

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.940
going to eat the lunch
of other countries.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.410
And many economists at the
time, including myself,

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.410
were a little skeptical
of that, because it's

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.150
one thing to have a growth
catch up to the frontier.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.150
It's quite another to
shift the frontier.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.955
And query-- was the Japanese
model set up for that?

00:07:42.955 --> 00:07:45.950
Now it's not just
Kennedy and historians

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.400
that were looking maybe
through a different lens

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.380
at economic power.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.460
No less an economic lion
than Paul Samuelson, himself,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.400
in his very famous and
bestselling "Principles

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.970
of Economics" boo-- had
for many, many editions

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.700
a date at which the Soviet
Union's economy would

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.240
overtake the United States.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.220
Now what was interesting
was with each edition,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.720
the date kept moving out,
And on or around 1989,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.550
the reference got dropped.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.550
So it's not just
historians, it's someone who

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.410
is as great and as smart
as Paul Samuelson was,

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.270
essentially falls
into the same thing.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.510
But one of the places where
Tim and I start the book

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.910
is with a fundamental
question of what

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.720
does it mean to
have economic power?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.970
What does that mean?

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.470
As an economist,
not as a politician.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.030
And we argue that leaders,
many times in history,

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.080
have been confused about
the sources of wealth

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.760
and economic power.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.450
And in some cases,
interest groups

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.860
are not confused that
all, but simply managed

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.409
to redistribute
resources to themselves.

00:08:49.409 --> 00:08:51.450
To make it simple, because
this is a book written

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.080
for popular consumption,
not for economists,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.180
we go back to the intuition of
what I would call three great S

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.450
economists-- Smith, and
Solo and Schumpater.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.060
So in Smith, I think
about the scale or size

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.290
of an economy,
what we today would

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.370
call GDP or something like that.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.280
Solo's views about investment
and future orientation ,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.130
and of course the Shumpaterian
view of the frontier

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.460
and the process that would
generate innovation that moves

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.560
the frontier.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.380
All of those a sources
are economic power.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.130
In the book we
actually developed--

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.396
it's sort of a trivial point.

00:09:31.396 --> 00:09:33.020
If you're interested,
it's there-- kind

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.810
of index of economic power
looking across place and time,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.840
using the Penn World data.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.860
The United States is definitely
by almost any such measure

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.052
the preeminent economic power.

00:09:44.052 --> 00:09:45.510
I don't think that's
controversial.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.370
What I'm about to say is a
little more controversial.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.320
We think it's likely to remain
in the preeminent economic

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.820
power for a considerable
period of time.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.210
One of the countries that's
often talked about today,

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.700
much as the Japanese salary
men in Paul Kennedy's example,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.450
is, of course, China.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.550
China is growing very
rapidly, as often

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.180
happens in pronounced
catch-up phases.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.320
It's very difficult
though to pivot

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.150
from that to
frontier-producing growth,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.580
particularly in an economy
whose financial system, whose

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.500
rule of law, is not
oriented toward that.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.470
So we can come back
to this if you like,

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.928
but Tim and I would
count ourselves

00:10:23.928 --> 00:10:25.930
among the skeptics
of China immediately

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.920
overtaking United States
in economic power.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.560
So let's have a look at Rome.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.550
Kennedy's thesis,
again, was that Rome

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.630
spent too much on its military.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.600
It was too adventuresome.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.590
Now, like all stories, there
is an element of truth to that.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.180
We argue that what really
killed Rome was understretch.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.410
We point to a series of
examples in the book,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.360
starting from the famous
Hadrian's Wall with the idea

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.540
of walling in Rome
to stop immigration--

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.110
does this sound familiar in
current policy debates?--

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.060
debasing its currency,
pursuing policies that favored

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.060
the present over the future,
including fiscal policy

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.680
and what would be the
equivalent of monetary policy.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.330
Rome's understretch over a
period of time led to its rot

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.830
far more than its
military adventure.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.720
And this is a pattern
you actually see

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.510
with many great
power declines, just

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.302
to give you a quick
tour of [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:28.260
I really want to focus
mainly on America today,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.050
but we have a look
at Ming, China,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.560
for example, which was in
its day, the commercial envy

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.880
of the world.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.460
Virtually every
school kid learns

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.920
of the voyages of
Cheng Ho, at least

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.440
in the transliteration
of my schoolboy days.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.440
And those voyages were to
establish the great merchant

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.130
class of China with shipping.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.910
The only problem,
of course, much

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.670
like a predatory guard in
Rome, usurped power for itself,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.250
people surrounding the emperor
were not too fond of the fact

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.710
that merchants and
shipping folks were gaining

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.260
political and economic
power in the country,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.680
and eventually persuade
the emperor not only

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.020
to decrease that
commercial activity.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.860
But literally burn the ships.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.250
Growth stops.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.420
Regress happens.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.980
Not because the Chinese
forgot how to build ships

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.870
or forgot how to do commerce.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.080
But because of a
political institution

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.910
couldn't keep up with the
economic changes facing China.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.490
Another case study we
look at is imperial Spain.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.340
Oftentimes, when
we hear the phrase

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.427
"the sun will never
set," people commonly

00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:40.760
think of that as being a story
about the British Empire.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.040
The quote is
actually about Spain.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.180
Spain in its day was
the preeminent empire.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.480
But Spanish leaders
were very confused

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.110
about what economic power
is and where it came from.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.420
They thought it was
gold and silver.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.080
The mercantile policies
pursued by Spain

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.880
were toward the advancement
of gold and silver,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.800
and not toward the
kinds of commerce

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.350
an innovation that would
lead to true growth.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.620
Spain also pursued a very
present-oriented policy,

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.540
defaulting many
times on its debt.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.770
And an empire that
at its height seem

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.010
to span the world
simply rotted away.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.190
We look at the case
of the Ottoman Empire,

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.140
which every school
kid is taught--

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.150
that was the sick man of Europe.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.360
Not really true.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.950
If you look at the origins
of the Ottoman Empire,

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.020
it was an administrative marble.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.670
Much like the Praetorian
guards of Rome,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.120
or the court units rounding
the emperor in China,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.670
there were a group
called janissaries

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.000
that were slaves who
rose to be leaders.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.480
The Grand Vizier, himself,
was always from this core.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.350
And they were an
administrative marvel,

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.470
until they decided that the
technological developments

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.790
happening threaten their power
base vis-a-vis the sultan.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.710
And, again, much has
happened in imperial China

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.420
or imperial Rome killed it off.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.600
Just to mention a few other
case studies we look at,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.770
we look at the
British Empire, which

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.610
seems to be the archetype
for Kennedy's case.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.110
After all, World War
I and World War II

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:14.230
were exhausting for Britain,
particularly because it

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.900
was having to defend an
empire all over the world.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.540
But we argue that part of
the seeds of British problems

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.070
went back to an incident
on or around 1776,

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.350
involving the United
States, where Britain

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.600
was insufficiently British,
with folks outside of Britain.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.930
That lack of outwardness,
even though inside Britain

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.040
was a classic
liberal open policy,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.065
the British did not follow
that policy in their colonies.

00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:45.255
The most celebrated
example of that failures

00:14:45.255 --> 00:14:46.560
is the United States.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.240
But it happened many times
in the British colonial

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.700
experience.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.130
We look at Japan after
the war through the lens

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.470
of the game of Go, which is
a very hard game to play.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.470
The beginning of Go--
it's a board game.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.760
Almost anything is possible.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.140
At the end, the conclusion
is certainly known.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.470
In the middle is where
life is interesting.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.930
And we argue in the
book that that's really

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.230
what Japan pursued is
the arc during the war

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.440
like I'm after the war, the
growth and catch up phase

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.570
was very, very impressive
But his stalled out,

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.050
relative to the
American frontier,

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.860
in the past two decades.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.840
A part of that is from
bad macroeconomic policy.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.490
But part of that are from real
structural barriers and failure

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.760
to understand economic power.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.280
We also look at the Eurozone.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.610
And one other example,
I will mention,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.534
is the state of California.

00:15:41.534 --> 00:15:42.950
As a New Yorker,
I sometimes think

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.060
of California as a foreign
country, and I group it

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.590
in with the other examples.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.470
But California is
interesting because it

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:55.660
is the only part of the world,
outside of the Mediterranean,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.556
that has the climate--
the wonderful climate--

00:15:58.556 --> 00:15:59.430
of the Mediterranean.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.040
It's the only large
land mass that has that.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.230
It, however, shares
something else

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.230
with the Mediterranean, which
is a political system that

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.420
can look fairly dysfunctional.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.280
And the Praetorian guards
that I talked about from Rome

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.890
are reconstituted in California
i a variety of interest groups,

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.420
including public workers unions.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.210
So in each of these cases,
a fantastically successful

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.155
rich society is held back
from where it might be.

00:16:27.155 --> 00:16:31.000
Now I want to talk about the
contemporary United States.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.320
And I have this sort of
historical build-up with you

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.390
to now pivot a little
bit to economics,

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.310
because I think there's a view
many people have, particularly

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.920
many people in my profession,
in economics, that what's

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.960
facing the nation are a
series of technical problems.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.680
So, for example, I'm going
to talk with you about debt.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.140
How do we devise
technical solutions?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.420
In none of the
historical cases--

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.150
and certainly, I
will argue with you

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.410
not in what faces American
today-- is the problem

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.760
a lack of economic knowledge.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.260
It is not a lack of
technical issues.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.380
There are plenty of smart
economists, business people,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.819
policymakers on both
sides of the aisle.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.700
Rather the point, as in each
of the historical case studies,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.790
is that the political
rules of the game

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.654
don't facilitate that
technical solution.

00:17:23.654 --> 00:17:26.849
Now let me do a build
up and be more specific.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.660
So in the US, one
of the key examples

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.420
we've seen in the recent
weeks is the battle

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.430
over the future of
debt in the country.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.160
So we all know we've
had politicians

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.290
playing with matches in the
capital and the White House.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.310
And part of this
is-- well, maybe

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.640
it's political theater
or short-term gain,

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.730
Democrats versus Republicans.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.150
It's actually a more
fundamental structural problem.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.910
What has happened in
the country, and much

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.680
of the industrial world
also, particularly

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.620
in Europe and Japan, is
the very large run-up

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.900
in central government
debt relative to GDP.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.510
This is a real problem.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.450
There was a debate around the
publication of Carmen Reinhart

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.620
and Ken Rogoff's
book "This Time is

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.600
Different" about whether
there exists a tipping point

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.070
that if a debt to GDP ratio
gets at a particular level,

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.650
bad things happen.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.860
I don't think any economist
can honestly tell you

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.730
there's a number.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.970
I can't tell you that at 80%
or 90% or you pick your number,

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.340
bad things happen.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.740
But I can tell you
a bit of arithmetic,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.500
that by definition this
rising debt to GDP ratio

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.870
will cause higher tax
burdens in the future

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.390
and will cause spending
adjustments on much of what

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.460
the public thinks government
does-- defend the country,

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.660
educate children,
conduct basic research.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.300
We've seen this experiment run
in many industrial economies

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.560
that simply can't project
themselves in the way

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.310
that fast growth
economies used to be.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.460
Now, to understand why this
isn't a technical problem,

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.630
a little bit of
history is in order.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.280
So let's do an
experiment together.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.100
Suppose I asked you
go back to the time

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.170
of the American Revolution.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.520
And then go to 1970, and
tell me about the shape

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.150
of the federal
debt to GDP ratio.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:26.870
Not the numbers, just the
shape-- up, down, flat?

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:27.470
Anybody?

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.370
Any conjectures
what it looks like?

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.120
Revolution to 1970.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.990
AUDIENCE: It goes up during war.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.300
GLENN HUBBARD: Exactly.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.070
It's entirely a story
of war and peace.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.350
If you look at every
major debt buildup

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.350
episode in the country--
and by the way,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.930
I could have said
Britain or France to you.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.120
It's true of most
industrial countries.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.290
We build up debt in war.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.610
We're borrowing to finance
the war, which is actually

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.530
good fiscal policy to do.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.750
And after a war, we stop
spending so much and we grow.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.020
So both the numerator and the
denominator are kicking in.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.920
To give you just a
quick example of that,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.330
at the close of World War II,
America's debt to GDP ratio

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.930
was in excess of 100%.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.410
That number was 40% by 1960.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.680
Just stopping the
military spending

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.230
and rapid postwar growth
brought it back into line.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.970
Now take that same experiment.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.440
So we talked about
the Revolution

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.970
to the time of say 1970.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.830
Now let's for any industrial
country look at 1970

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.930
to the present.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.730
Any difference in what
the picture looks like?

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:33.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.370
GLENN HUBBARD: Yeah,
basically, first

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.010
of all, mechanically
what's happening

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.760
is there are a few
hills and valleys

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.990
but they're small, relative
to the war and peace years.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.140
And it sort of goes straight up.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.180
Now it's really
not Kennedy's view.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.190
For example, I'm not a
foreign policy expert

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.230
so I can't tell you
whether America's

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.660
military interventions
in the past decade or so

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.770
have been wise or unwise.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.730
But I can tell you, as a bean
counter or as an economist,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.170
they're not the problem.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.150
So military spending
has fallen sharply

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.740
as a share of the economy
decade after decade,

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.230
following the Second World War.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.850
The current debate
in the country

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:18.510
is really whether military
spending ought to be 3% of GDP

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.330
or maybe 4% of GDP.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.270
But that's the gating.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.490
The entitlement programs,
the social welfare programs,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.770
particularly Social Security and
Medicare are much, much larger.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.080
And what we've seen since
the late '60s, early '70s,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.140
is an explosion in
growth in these programs.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.940
So if you look at shares
of GDP and components

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.004
of federal spending,
most of what--

00:21:42.004 --> 00:21:44.170
if you went and polled
people on the street and say,

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.270
what does government do?

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.470
Defense, education,
what goes in Washington

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.930
as "discretionary
spending"-- that's

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.940
all sharply down
relative to GDP.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.810
What has gone up
many, many fold is

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.630
Medicare and Social Security.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.142
So Medicare is about
1% of GDP in 1970.

00:22:02.142 --> 00:22:04.970
It's about 6% and rising.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.930
With Social Security
and Medicare

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.400
together, the
Congressional Budget Office

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.800
tells us just 20 years from now,
if we don't make any changes,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.090
we'll spend about 10 percentage
points of American GDP

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.520
more on just those two
programs than we do today.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.160
And if the whole tax share in
GDP, even in the best of times

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.680
is a number like
18%, 19%, I think

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.650
you can see the
scale of the problem.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.600
Now here's the rub.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.930
What I've said so
far is just facts.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.930
And I don't think serious
people dispute those facts.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.430
But I think the
general consensus

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.250
is we just haven't found the
right technical solution.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.290
Nobody's come up
with the right way

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.130
either to change those
programs or raise taxes or cut

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:47.830
something else.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.240
You can do the arithmetic in
your head on what's needed.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.060
I don't think that's accurate.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.550
There are plenty
of ways to restore

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.780
long-term fiscal balance.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.940
The levers are familiar.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.380
They involve program changes,
other spending changes,

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.970
tax increases, or the
promotion of growth.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.890
And 100 policies fall into
those combined buckets.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.385
So that's not really the issue.

00:23:11.385 --> 00:23:14.330
Rather I think we've got
to learn from three things.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.390
One is this classic
economist joke.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.860
The second is the
game of basketball.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.540
And the third is the
book "The Odyssey."

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.410
Now the classic economist
joke always troubles me,

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.756
because I am the
classic economist.

00:23:29.756 --> 00:23:32.130
And you've probably all heard
the classic economist joke,

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.550
but I'll repeat it
to make my point.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.660
So you have a chemist
and a physicist

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.440
and a economist who are
marooned on a desert island.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.500
And a can of soup or
stew washes ashore.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:49.370
And the physicist says, let's
beat it open and we'll eat it.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.520
The chemist says, no,
that's a little bit messy.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.110
Why don't we heat it?

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.470
It will open, and we'll eat
it and it'll be warm to boot.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.741
And the economist says--

00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:58.990
AUDIENCE: Assume a can opener.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.100
GLENN HUBBARD:
Assume a can opener.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.360
That's the painful
joke for economists.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.480
Now the problem with
what we're looking

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.610
at in the current
situation is we're

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.040
assuming a good government.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.280
We're assuming the
political process

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.710
can deliver the right outcome.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.180
We simply haven't put in
the right technical inputs.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.600
That was not true in any of
the historical case studies.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.150
Nor I would argue is it true for
the contemporary United States.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.600
And here's where
basketball comes in.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.230
So in the 1930s, the game
of basketball, obviously

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.500
a very popular
sport, nearly died

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.390
as a sport of great
spectator interest.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.590
And the reason, if you go
back to books at that time,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.640
was what was called
the Tall Man Problem.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.140
Now this was a
period in which there

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.149
was no shot clock in basketball.

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:47.440
There was no three-point shots.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.707
So the game looked a little
different than today.

00:24:49.707 --> 00:24:52.290
And what would happen is if you
were the team with the tallest

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.970
guys, they could simply
hang around the hoop

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.490
and dominate play.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.190
Now that's great if you're
the team with the "tall men."

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.380
It's not so much fun to watch,
and the sport was in trouble.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.760
Now enter a man
named Howard Hobson.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.970
Howard Hobson was
the basketball coach

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.070
of the University of Oregon.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.000
He comes to my attention
because he's actually

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.300
writing a Ph.D.
Thesis at Columbia.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.830
Now we know this was an era
where basketball coaches got

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.260
Ph.Ds at Columbia and
other institutions.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.810
And his Ph.D. thesis is a book
called "Scientific Basketball"

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.830
which I recommend to any of
you, where he makes consciously

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.650
the argument for a
three-point shot.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.620
Eventually, there's
an experimental game

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.090
between Colombia and
Fordham in the mid-1940s.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.570
Columbia wins.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:42.300
Over time, Hobson's idea works
its way into college ball,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.772
eventually to pro ball.

00:25:43.772 --> 00:25:45.480
And of course, a much
more familiar name,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.510
Michael Jordan can trace his
success back to this man.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.170
I raise this point with you
for a simple illustration.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.160
Sometimes, whether
you're talking

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.690
about a very successful society
or a very successful game,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.080
when there's an adaptation,
you have to change the rules.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.636
So if we can't assume
a good government,

00:26:06.636 --> 00:26:08.010
and a byproduct
of that is we may

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.830
think we need to
change the rules,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.245
what would that rule change be?

00:26:13.245 --> 00:26:16.366
Well, here's the story from
"The Odyssey" that I love.

00:26:16.366 --> 00:26:18.800
It's the story of the Sirens.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.040
So in the story of the Sirens,
it's a story of temptation.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.790
It's a story of
leadership and of joy.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.460
In the story of
course, our leader

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.520
has the men put wax
in their ears and row.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.510
Remember the Sirens have
this beautiful music, very

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.620
physically appealing.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.620
The only problem is if
you follow their way,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.810
let's just say bad
things happen to you.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.660
And so what our
leader wants to do

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.020
is have the men row past
with wax in their ears.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.300
But he wants the benefit
of the Siren song.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.619
How does he get it?

00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:51.160
AUDIENCE: Lashes
himself to the mast.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.450
GLENN HUBBARD: He lashes
himself to the mast.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.820
He's able to get the benefit
because he has absolutely

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.560
had to change the rules to
constrain his own behavior.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.690
Now if you go back
to the debt dynamic

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.580
in industrial countries for
the moment that I started with,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.240
we know we don't have a
self-correcting mechanism.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.120
Before, we had war and
peace, which were essentially

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.490
self-correcting
budget mechanisms.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.100
And much of the rules we
have around the budget

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.580
from the founders on were
written with that in mind.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.052
So, for example,
what we fight over

00:27:24.052 --> 00:27:26.010
in the past couple of
weeks, the so-called debt

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.760
limit negotiations.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.630
The debt limit comes
out of World War I.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.090
It's an idea that
before World War I,

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.220
the Congress had to vote
literally on every bond issue.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.655
And the idea was that since
things were self-correcting,

00:27:38.655 --> 00:27:42.715
why not have these periodic
allowances for borrowing--

00:27:42.715 --> 00:27:44.090
i.e., when you're
fighting a war,

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.300
because that's what borrowing
meant in those days.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.145
And it would allow the Congress
not to constantly do this.

00:27:49.145 --> 00:27:52.350
Now, of course, that works if
you have a natural adjustment

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.839
where debt comes down
at some subsequent date.

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.380
But as I told you,
that is not what's

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.050
happening, not
only in the US, but

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.570
in other industrial countries.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.990
And we may need to think
about changing the rules.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.860
Tim and I offer a couple
of potential rule changes.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.360
One which I would call a light
rope, in "The Odyssey" example,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.260
would be to take
the programs that

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.020
are at issue, which are these
big social insurance programs,

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.450
and treat the accounting
much more like you

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.980
would in a business.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.480
And so in a business, if
I decide to promise people

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.720
more in the future on
something or there's

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.044
a change in accrued
liabilities, that's

00:28:29.044 --> 00:28:30.460
not something
that's in the ether.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.930
It shows up in my
financial statements today.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.360
And it has to be accounted
for and paid for.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.956
So one could say to
the Congress, look,

00:28:37.956 --> 00:28:40.260
it's not that
everything is on budget,

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.780
but the change in the accrued
liabilities of these programs

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.220
is an expense.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.910
You'll put it on the budget.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.160
And you have to go to the
American people and say,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.750
we'd like to raise
taxes to pay for this,

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.320
or we'd like to cut some
other spending-- you pick

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.280
how to pay for it-- or maybe
we'll reform those programs.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.880
But force the choice to be made.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.510
Tim and I argue at
the present time,

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.640
we have a kind of political
prisoner's dilemma game,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.730
where if one party
simply wants lower taxes

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.507
and another party
wants high spending,

00:29:10.507 --> 00:29:12.090
with the current
budget rules, there's

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.510
an unfortunate equilibrium.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.550
It's just called
debt accumulation.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.440
Both parties can
get what they want,

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.300
but ultimately, of
course, that's not stable.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.330
There is a tighter
binding of rope.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.290
And it's a spending limitation.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.000
Now in the book, we argue, as
I think most economists do,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.850
that literal balanced budget
amendments of the types that

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.610
have been considered are
fundamentally flawed.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.860
They are hard to
implement particularly

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.030
around business cycles.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.110
You don't want the government
exacerbating a business cycle.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.180
But it doesn't mean that
you can't design something.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.820
We put out a simple example.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.480
There are many, many others.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.740
You can imagine a
spending limitation

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.990
that says government
spending as a share of GDP

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:57.380
is limited to the moving
average of some number of years.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.540
The example we
use is seven years

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.380
of inflation-adjusted revenue.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.140
Getting rid of the
inflation effect.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.790
I pick seven, because it's
the number in Pharaoh's dream.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.280
But if you like
six, eight, ten, it

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.700
doesn't matter-- some
long period of time.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.360
That's the way typically
most endowments, for example,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.740
work in a university or
any large philanthropic

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.980
organization.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.900
And we would allow the
Congress to deviate

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.470
from that whenever
it wants, but only

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.806
with escalating super majorities
every time it deviates.

00:30:27.806 --> 00:30:29.805
And note the difference
in this kind of approach

00:30:29.805 --> 00:30:30.971
from what's often discussed.

00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:32.780
First of all, it's a
long period of time.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.450
You don't have the
cyclical problem.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.260
We also don't have a
bias as to economists

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.640
as to whether the solution
is raising taxes or cutting

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.140
spending.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.764
I think that's a
political choice,

00:30:41.764 --> 00:30:43.430
and the American
people have every right

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.760
to make that choice,
as long as they

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.690
know that one of those or some
combination is the choice.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:54.760
So we think this kind of a rule
change may help a great deal.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.740
But just to kind of
close where I began,

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.610
I see that we're
in this discussion

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.720
at a kind of fork in the road.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.030
And you can see the fork
in the road going back

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.660
to the historical case
studies, where they're

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.970
about Kennedy and military,
or about what we're

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.890
talking about in the
intersection of politics

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.230
and economics.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.900
And I would like you
to imagine behind me

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.390
as if there were two
pictures to illustrate this.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:22.010
One is Agatha Christie, and
the other's Ben Franklin.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.520
Now Agatha Christie is one
of my favorite writers.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.990
I like murder mysteries.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.430
I like stories that
happen in exotic places,

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.750
involving posh guests.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.270
That's a typical Agatha
Christie murder mystery.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.850
An example that I would use to
illustrate this is the story

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.790
"And Then There Were None."

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.430
s Then There Were None," like
a typical Christie story,

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.630
starts with a dinner
party in a mansion

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:50.270
with a group of posh forks,
and then a murder happens.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.030
And it actually puts
kind of a damper

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.170
on the evening
when that happens.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.820
But pretty soon, people come
back to the dinner party

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.226
and enjoying themselves,
except there's another murder.

00:32:02.226 --> 00:32:04.100
And you can see, given
the title of the book,

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.970
where this is headed.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.740
And then there were none.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.200
Now what's interesting to me
about this-- the economics

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.810
of great power failure and the
economics of growth stoppages,

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.840
they tend to look like
"And Then There Were None."

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.740
It's not some single act
of military overreach.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.170
Rather, it's a series
of political mistakes,

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.610
of missing something in
the economic environment,

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:30.270
and failing to act
until there are none.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:33.010
An alternative view, in
this fork in the road,

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.500
a more optimistic view,
is actually Franklin's.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.490
One of my favorite
quotes from Ben Franklin

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:42.480
is his looking, at the
Constitutional Convention,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.180
at the chair in which George
Washington sat the whole time

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.260
as the leader of the convention.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.760
And carved in the back of that
chair that Washington sat in

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.650
was a sun.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.290
And Franklin said he spent the
whole time-- presumably not

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.630
the whole time, but much
of the time-- wondering

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.620
whether the sun was rising or
setting and concluding it's

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.515
rising.

00:33:02.515 --> 00:33:05.370
If you go through all these
historical case studies,

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.450
they're cautionary tales, I
would argue, but only that.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:13.020
There is nothing written
into the detail of history

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.070
that suggests a great
power has to fail.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.020
There is, however, a road map
of how that failure occurs.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.650
And that's the cautionary tale.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.420
That's the theme of "Balance."

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.710
You'll see on the cover pictures
of ancient Rome and America

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.479
that try to tie it together.

00:33:29.479 --> 00:33:30.270
So I'll stop there.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.410
But I'd be delighted
to take any questions.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.150
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:38.110
So Gordon Crovitz in this
week's "Wall Street Journal"

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:42.550
talked about running
experiments on policies.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.210
And he said Silicon
Valley runs experiments.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.240
And it's true, right?

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.550
Most of your web use
actually runs experiments.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.330
And you propose
some rule changes,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:58.470
and we could run experiments to
go try to deploy those changes.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:03.380
But I don't understand how
you would deploy these changes

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.050
or run an experiment
to see which rules

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.949
are the right one, because the
time frame where I go figure

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:12.429
out whether that's
a good rule is long.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.280
And secondly, it's hard to
go measure the impact, right?

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.530
How do I measure these things?

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.840
Do I go by a bunch of
academics and policy wonks,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.989
and they all
disagree at the end.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:25.949
So can we run experiments
to go and try out

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.400
these rules in various places?

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.909
And if so, how would we do that?

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:30.450
GLENN HUBBARD: It's
a great question.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.889
I would argue that there's
two kinds of experiments,

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.530
to use your term,
that we can look at.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:40.090
One are the roles of state
rule changes over many decades,

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.110
because states do have
much more limits on budgets

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.480
and have experimented over
many years with a variety

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.549
of spending limitations, capital
and current budgets and so on.

00:34:49.549 --> 00:34:51.090
And there's a large
literature that's

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.469
learned a great deal
about budget balance.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.667
There are also two
national case studies

00:34:55.667 --> 00:34:57.125
within the past
couple of decades--

00:34:57.125 --> 00:34:59.820
one is Canada and the
other's Sweden-- where

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.780
these sorts of budget issues led
to fundamental process reforms

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.860
to right the fiscal ship.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.090
So our book isn't so much
a book about solutions.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.820
There are lots of
different ways to do it.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.870
But the idea is
that you really have

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.390
to experiment with rule changes.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:18.280
The notion that we could wait
for a leader on a white horse

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.420
of either party, or just hope
that some smart economist

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:21.920
shows up.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.790
We just think that's naive.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.080
But your question's spot on.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.940
It's very hard.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.180
AUDIENCE: So I think,
continuing on that vein,

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.310
you've essentially proposed
a technical solution

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.450
to the current issues
that we're facing.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:36.180
But as you mentioned in your
talk, a lot of these issues

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.800
are borne from political
problems, rather than

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.460
a lack of technical solutions.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.790
So how would you go
about, for example,

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.680
changing the rules
of the game, when

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.510
the political parties or the
political actors involved

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.710
are clearly-- it's clearly
in their best interest

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.089
to keep the system as it is.

00:35:52.089 --> 00:35:53.630
GLENN HUBBARD: It's
a great question.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.540
And I would argue we haven't
proposed a technical solution,

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.570
because I said we're
agnostic as to what

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.590
form these limitations take.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.590
The right would have one
view, the left another.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.230
We're outlining a
family of rules.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.380
But I would say a
couple of things.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.390
One is that we need to have
much more political process

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:13.650
competition.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.060
One thing I didn't mention,
but we talk about in the book,

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.290
is some unwitting implications
of campaign finance reform

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.970
in the US over the
past several decades

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.550
have led to monopoly powers
of two political parties

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.660
in the process sort of
ossifying competition,

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.310
making it very difficult
to have new budget ideas.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.810
We can break that.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.842
The other is the prospect for
spending limitations are not

00:36:38.842 --> 00:36:40.050
as grim as they might appear.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.850
34 states have
considered and passed

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.270
spending limitations
for the federal level

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.800
in the past two decades.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.860
And twice in that period, one
house of Congress passed it.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.660
So remember, there are two
roots to amendments-- Congress

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.660
or states.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.330
Both of those have
been fairly active,

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.660
so I think this is a
topic of conversation.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.090
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that the entitlement

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.040
is the main driver
for the debt going up.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.020
But I assume the entitlement
is to offset inequality.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.930
But in the meantime,
inequality still is widening.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.190
So my question is to
solve this problem,

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.990
do you think it's a
technical solution

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.280
or we need a sort of
political process for that.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.946
GLENN HUBBARD: Well,
I think that you've

00:37:21.946 --> 00:37:23.620
mixed a couple of
interesting questions.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.120
in there.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.980
I don't know that it's
the case, empirically,

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.620
that the entitlement
programs are

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.580
helping on the inequality front.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.450
For example,
wealthier people tend

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:37.659
to live longer and have higher
medical expenditures in old age

00:37:37.659 --> 00:37:38.700
for a variety of reasons.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.882
These programs may even
slightly at the margin,

00:37:40.882 --> 00:37:43.340
even though they were designed
with the best of intentions,

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.230
not be helping so much.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.640
Policies to go at
inequality, I don't think

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.040
are so much policies
about entitlements

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.100
as they are policies about
education and training.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.080
So I think there are
ways to get at that

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.290
without the entitlements.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.940
One thing that the US could
do that would radically

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.640
lower its entitlement
burdens-- and this

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.890
is a technical
solution-- would be

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.610
to turn them into
safety net programs.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.050
So they would be
focused on inequality.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.880
They would be very strong safety
nets for low income Americans,

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.710
but essentially not part of the
life of middle and upper income

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.020
Americans.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:23.071
That would be a very different
world than the one we live in.

00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:24.820
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
accounting systems

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.510
for government spending
and liabilities.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.350
What examples around
the world do you

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.560
know that use general
accounting practices

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.980
or something comparable to that.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.427
And do they do better?

00:38:38.427 --> 00:38:40.760
GLENN HUBBARD: We certainly
don't have too many examples

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.580
of governments having the
same kind of transparency

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.250
as the private sector.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.850
But the two reforms I
mentioned in Canada and Sweden

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.720
are probably the closest
at really being transparent

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.515
about social welfare obligations
and the present value

00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:56.350
of those obligations.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.230
And they were borne in a crisis.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:01.360
One reason I think one has
to be worried about the US

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.877
is while Canada and Sweden
did make these changes,

00:39:03.877 --> 00:39:06.460
they were made in an environment
where they absolutely had to.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.860
They couldn't borrow money.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.860
One of the issues
in Washington today

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.450
is whenever economists like
me show up and ring the alarm

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.220
bell, they say, but look
at low interest rates are.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.560
We can borrow the money.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.820
So it becomes hard to do.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.160
We have the examples,
but unfortunately there

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.870
are not many examples of
change made voluntarily

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.557
as opposed to hitting the wall.

00:39:24.557 --> 00:39:27.140
AUDIENCE: So we don't have any
examples at the state or county

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.390
levels that have implemented
this that you're aware of--

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.130
or city?

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:32.588
GLENN HUBBARD: Oh,
we certainly do.

00:39:32.588 --> 00:39:36.520
Yes, there is a state
literature on variance

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.980
in pension accounting.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.140
States have very
different rules in that.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.640
One of the things we argue in
the book that I didn't mention

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.910
is while the federal
government can't legally

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.080
tell states what to
do in their budget,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.990
the municipal bond tax exemption
is not in the Constitution.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.120
It's a creature of law.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.820
And so one could
say, if you want

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.040
to borrow in the
tax-exempt market,

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.140
you will conform to
these accounting--

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.190
so actually, there's
quite a bit of leverage

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.110
the federal government
has over states that's

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.899
so far not been exported.

00:40:05.899 --> 00:40:06.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.680
Thanks for the talk.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.820
To what extent do you
think the structure

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.610
of our monetary system impacts
your thesis about our abilities

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:19.660
to either drive up and borrow
beyond what we otherwise would?

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.570
You mentioned, for example,
that every time an economist

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.750
comes up and raises
the alarm, people

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.402
point to how low
interest rates are.

00:40:26.402 --> 00:40:27.860
GLENN HUBBARD:
Well, it's certainly

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.230
the case that current
US monetary policy has

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.720
kept interest rates very low.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.470
I think in the advent
of the financial crisis

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.840
or right after the financial
crisis, that was wise,

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.710
particularly keeping spreads
between mortgage-backed

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.710
securities and treasuries low.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.160
For what it's
worth, I don't think

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.860
there's much evidence to suggest
that lower long-term interest

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.160
rates, as a result of
quantitative easing,

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.880
have had a large material
effect on the real economy.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.590
They certainly have had
an effect on asset prices,

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.220
but not a very big effect
on the real economy.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.740
I know some argue the fed
is enabling Washington.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.900
I don't think that's
the fed's intent.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.765
But it's certainly
a consequence.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:09.860
Yeah?

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.660
AUDIENCE: I'm not
clear on what you

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:16.170
think was the cause of the
shift from war and peace cycles

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.032
in the debt to
ever-increasing debt.

00:41:19.032 --> 00:41:20.500
Where did that come from.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.749
GLENN HUBBARD: It's the
structure of the entitlements.

00:41:22.749 --> 00:41:26.150
So basically in the
mid-'60s is the introduction

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.090
of the Medicare and
Medicaid programs.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:33.740
And it's in 1972 that when
Wilbur Mills, who was then

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.570
Chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee,

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.760
before he cavorted
with a stripper and got

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.740
thrown out of Washington,
he had a policy

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.160
of double-indexing
Social Security benefits,

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.210
so the real value of those
obligations rose sharply.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:51.320
So in a period from between,
say, mid 1960s to mid 1970s,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.860
we had enormous
structural change

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.642
in those programs, none of which
were recorded on the budget.

00:41:57.642 --> 00:41:58.850
I mean, the liabilities part.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.110
The current year spending
is, but the accruing

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.970
of those liabilities
wasn't recorded at all.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.965
So it is almost a-- it's not
a literal natural experiment

00:42:07.965 --> 00:42:11.220
but a sea change in policy.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.720
AUDIENCE: I was curious-- I
think my intent was really

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.230
in regards to both
the dollar statuses,

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:21.370
the global kind of
financial reserve currency,

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:27.379
and the use of federal
debt as the primary asset

00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:28.670
under a standard banking rules.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.860
So, for example, treasury
bills are your unit

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.280
of account for reserve
requirements for everything.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.550
And they're just kind of
a basic building block

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.810
that you assume everything
has to operate on.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:42.190
GLENN HUBBARD: Basically, the
US gets an enormous benefit

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.790
from what Charles
de Gaulle called

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:46.350
years ago "an
exorbitant privilege"

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.420
that we have the
reserve currency

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.410
countries from all
over the world.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.540
People are willing to
hold pieces of paper

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.390
with Ben Franklin's picture.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:58.320
Or they're willing to hold
dollar-denominated assets.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.990
So it's a little bit odd when
politicians in Washington

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.300
trifle with the full
faith and credit of the US

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.980
because it is an
enormous positive impact.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.320
So from a macro perspective,
that's very valuable.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.310
It's also the case
that we do sometimes

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.170
get distortions in
the financial system

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:13.610
from financial repression.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.340
I'm not sure if that's where
your question was headed.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.230
By telling financial
institutions

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.560
they need to hold a certain
category of instruments

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.230
as riskless, may distort
portfolio holdings.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.490
And we certainly are doing
that in contemporary bank

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:28.010
regulations.

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.010
A lot of financial
repression that

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:34.310
has happened since the close
of the financial crisis

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:36.490
there would have been a
time, say, a couple of years

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.500
ago, if you were a large bank
holding Greek bonds-- would

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.390
have been riskless.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:45.110
Lending to a main
corporate credit in the US

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:47.180
would have required a
great deal of capital.
