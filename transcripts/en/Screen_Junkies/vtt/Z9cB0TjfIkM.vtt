00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.600
In a world where most movies are just OK,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.900
one film will be so bizarre,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.440
so upsetting,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.600
and so aggressively bad,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.900
the sheer amount of suck will collapse in on itself like a dying star

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.520
and explode in a supernova of unintentional genius.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.500
"AAAAAAAAH!"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.920
Tommy Wiseau stars in,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.820
writes,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.700
produces,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.240
and directs a film

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.620
that puts the passion in passion project,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.360
financed by a rumored $6,000,000 of his own mysterious fortune,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.840
and featuring 3 long minutes of his own mysterious buttcheeks.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.360
He's a man with a singular vision,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.380
a unique personal style,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.620
and a powerful message to share with the world.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.100
Maybe it's OK to give up on your dreams.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.480
"How can they say this about me?

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.120
I don't believe it.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.520
I'll show them."

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.900
Journey to B-roll of San Francisco

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.260
and meet Johnny,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.740
your everyday all-American Dracula.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.840
"You know, people don't have to say it.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.040
They can feel it."

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.420
Sometimes, his emotions run hot.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.640
"You are TEARING ME APART, LISA!

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.660
Sometimes, he's so cold, it's like he forgets he's on camera.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.500
But he always finds time to laugh at the little things.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.440
"Anything for my princess!"

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.140
Or laugh for no particular reason.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.440
Or laugh at things you really shouldn't be laughing at.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.240
One of them found out about it, beat her up so bad she ended up in a hospital

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.300
on Guerrero Street.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.400
Dude, what part of that is funny?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.520
Experience a story that

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
at its core, is a really simple love triangle.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.820
Where Johnny's engaged to Lisa, his wife of the future.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.960
"You're my future wife."

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.140
"Lisa's your future wife."

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.040
"After all, she's my future wife."

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.640
But she doesn't love him.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.040
"I don't love Johnny anymore."

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.080
"I don't love him anymore."

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080
"I don't love him anymore."

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.340
"But I don't love him!"

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.180
So she sleeps with Mark, his best friend.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.120
"Johnny's my best friend." x3

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.360
"I know."

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640
"He's your best friend."

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.140
But set that aside,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.860
because The Room has enough dangling plot threads to weave a blanket.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.900
Like...

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.920
This endless, unexplained game of tuxedo football,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.880
Johnny's promotion at... whatever his job is,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.100
these two friends who randomly appear and disappear throughout the movie,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.160
this drug deal that's never mentioned again.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.400
"Where's my f--king money, Denny?!!"

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.760
..and, the most casual 'I have cancer' of all time.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.880
"I got the results of the test back."

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.520
"I definitely have breast cancer."

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.060
You- uh- you gonna react to that?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.740
No? Okay, cool. Cool.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.880
Most movies cut straight to the interesting parts,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.300
but The Room is NOT most movies.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.420
Where if a man makes a tape,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.280
you get to see him set up the equipment.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.260
If two friends have lunch, you see what everyone in front of them ordered.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.140
"And, uh, I'll take some cheesecake and a coffee."

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.200
"Okay, why don't you guys go have a seat, we'll have that right out for you."

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.320
"Hi, how you doing?"

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.540
"What would you like?"

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.340
"Can I get... a bagel and Americana?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.620
"Great, sure."

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.640
"I'm gonna get a slice of cheesecake and a bottle of water."

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.380
"Yeah, that sounds good. Why don't you guys have a seat, we'll have that right out for you."

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.360
"Hi, Susan."

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.420
"Hi, Johnny."

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.360
And if a man gives his fiancee flowers,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.380
you'll see exactly how that financial transaction went down.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.680
Spoiler alert, it was weird!

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.660
"How much is it?" - "It'll be $18." - Here you go, keep the change!

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.560
"Hi, doggy."

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.480
"You're my favorite customer."

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.700
"Thanks a lot! Bye!"

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.880
Do you like sex?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.080
Well, not for long,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.220
because you're about to watch an alien's approximation of human love-making,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.580
where a little man playing a little boy tries to join a threesome.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.580
"Three's a crowd."

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.220
these 2 randoms act like toddlers while they do it,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.360
"Arms up."

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.240
and Johnny does his best to penetrate the area around Lisa's bellybutton.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.700
Just close your eyes when the R&amp;B comes on.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.460
Trust us.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.040
So enjoy this real-life version of Springtime for Hitler

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.660
that's the pinnacle of so-bad-it's-good filmmaking,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.480
spawning midnight movie screenings,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.420
Oscar caliber films about its creation,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.860
and the enduring mystery of who Tommy Wiseau is,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.120
where he's from,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.052
where his money comes from,

00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:33.340
and how old he is.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.540
But some mysteries are probably better left unsolved.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.200
We've seen the guy's taint.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.880
I don't need to know anymore.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.660
"Oh, hey, guys."

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.740
"I have to go now."

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.660
"Oh, hey, Peter."

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.640
"I've got to go."

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.500
"Ohai, Mike."

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.000
"I gotta go."

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.860
"Ohai, Mark."

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.540
"I have to go."

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.440
"Ohai, Denny."

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.400
"I have to go now."

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.440
"Oh, hey, Lisa."

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.360
"I better be going."

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.120
"Oh, hey, Peter."

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.620
"I gotta go."

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.700
"Ohai, Denny."

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.620
"I gotta go."

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.380
"Ohai, Claudette."

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.980
"Oh, God, I have to run."

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.900
"Don't worry." x5

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.780
"Don't worry about it." x3

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.100
"Don't worry about it, Johnny. He's just being a big baby."

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.940
"Women change their minds all the time."

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.480
"You think girls like to cheat like guys do?"

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.860
"They never say what they mean, and they always play games."

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.520
"Sometimes they're just too smart.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.140
"Sometimes they're flat-out stupid.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.900
Other times, they're just evil."

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.960
"I don't want to talk about it." x5

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.880
"Just a little chicken.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.320
"Cheep! Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep, cheep! Cheeeep!"

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.640
"Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!"

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.000
"Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!"

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.440
I like to think Lisa's mom isn't playing a character.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.400
She's just a lady who wandered in and started commenting on what she saw.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.400
"What are these characters doing here?"

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.360
"How many people come in and out of this apartment every day?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.360
"This is worse than Grand Central Station."
