00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:08.080
MALE SPEAKER 1: So game
developers in the audience,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.990
round of applause,
how many of you

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.740
actually have code
in your game that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.650
tries to track if user A
is doing things differently

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.365
than user B?

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:19.560
Little bit?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.570
OK.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.028
MALE SPEAKER 2:
The rest of you, do

00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:24.190
you kind of wish you
had code that did that?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.700
Raise your hands.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.200
There we go.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.910
Alright.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.680
That's what I like to see.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.250
MALE SPEAKER 1: The
people who didn't

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.542
raise their hands are just,
like, waiting for the show.

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:32.499
MALE SPEAKER 2: They're
just in it for the art.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.270
MALE SPEAKER 1: So listen.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.250
This is clear in our modern
game development ecosystem,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.370
that everything we do right
now is about segmentation

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.680
and identification of our
users, so that we can best

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.722
classify them and serve them
the experience they want.

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:50.180
Already today we've talked
about identifying whether or not

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.900
users respond more to in-game
ads or to in-app purchases.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.230
And properly changing your
code paths to do that.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.410
Or whether or not you
need to target your ad

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.020
systems to find different
users and display

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.920
different ads to them
at the right time.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.440
This next talk is probably
one of my favorite ones today.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.190
Because for those of
you put your hands up

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.160
that you don't have
the code in your game

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.060
right now to track your users,
and identify them and figure

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.350
out what they want in your
game, this is for you.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.910
Big round of applause for
Mike, Snehal, and Rahul.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.792
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:24.750
RAHUL OAK: Hi everyone.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.926
Good afternoon.

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:26.800
My name is Rahul Oak.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.200
I'm a product manager on
Google Analytics for apps.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
And I have with me
here Snehal and Mike

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.980
who are hanging out
in the back right

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.910
now so you probably
can't see them.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.600
They're two rock star engineers
on the Google Analytics team.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.000
They actually made sure
I mentioned rock star

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.780
in front of their names.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.980
So today I'm here to talk
about turning players

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.340
into customers with
Google Analytics.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.150
So what does this
really mean, that you

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.600
have a bunch of users
who are using your game?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.760
They love it, they
are highly engaged.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.950
But you kind of want to figure
out which of those are users

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.692
and which of those
are customers.

00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:04.150
So what we're going
to try and talk

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.820
about today is a specific
problem that I think, and I

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.300
hope actually, that
resonates with a lot of you.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.440
And then using Google Analytics,
through a series of techniques

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.310
and tools, how you
can actually make

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.460
this classification between
users and customers,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.250
and hopefully convert more
of your users into customers.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.580
So let's talk about the
big picture a little bit.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.640
And I'm a product manager, I'm
going to use buzzwords a lot.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.890
And one of the buzzwords
that I'm sure you heard a lot

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.210
is LTV.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.970
And it's something that the
industry is striving towards.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.280
And this has been a common
theme across the GDC.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.360
As the industry has shifted,
maybe eight years ago in apps,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.310
it was all about how to get
the cheapest users into my app.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.410
But I think the industry
is matured at this point,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.240
and right now you're
not really looking just

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.060
to get the cheapest
person that you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.330
can acquire to come
and play a game.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.660
You want someone who is highly
engaged, highly monetized,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.490
and someone who is a
really good customer.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.980
So let's dive into what
this value really means,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.300
how you can measure value.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.440
And I'll talk about this
problem with the help

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.790
of a specific chart
that we've put together.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.430
A famous man once said
that all users are equal,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.380
but some are more
equal than others.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.080
Actually I lied, he
didn't say "users".

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.600
He mentioned it in the context
of farm animals and not games.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.260
But it applies
fairly well out here.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.420
I'll just walk over
this chart a little bit.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.360
So the y-axis is the
monetization line.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.430
So everyone who is to
the right of the y-axis

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.870
is a well-monetized user.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.820
And everyone to the left is not.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.010
Similarly, for the
x-axis, everyone

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.860
to the top of the
x-axis are people

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.500
who are highly
engaged in your game.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.290
And everyone to
the bottom is not.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.180
Now it's pretty
obvious from this

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.760
that the point of your game,
and for any business really,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.910
is to get as many people to the
top right quadrant as possible.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.850
And, especially in the
context of your game,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.640
that means having highly
engaged users who monetize,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.399
who find it worth their
while to actually spend money

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.899
to get some value
out of the game.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.560
The folks in the
left top, they're

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.370
the guys who are-- the guys
and gals-- who are engaged,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.750
and who you could nurture a
little bit to try and move them

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.040
into the right quadrant.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.200
Similarly with the folks
on the right bottom.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.790
There's some potential there.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.514
You want to figure out some
way to get them engaged again.

00:04:36.514 --> 00:04:38.430
You hope that they were
engaged at some point.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.910
They spent money,
they went back down.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.930
So what we're
going to try and do

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.160
is walk over some
things that we think

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.720
you can do with
Google Analytics that

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.660
helps you solve
specifically this problem,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.210
and try and get everyone
into the top right quadrant.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.320
And I know that's not really
possible, and in most cases,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.260
that's going to be
sparsely populated.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.670
But we are here to create tools
that help you to try and get

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.050
as many people in
there as possible.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.165
So the solution.

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:09.540
Snehal and Mike
are going to talk

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.640
about the solution
in a lot more detail.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.320
But before we move forward--
because I realize some of you

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.540
may not have used Google
Analytics for apps--

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.250
we're going to go over
just very, very quickly,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.030
just to set a baseline here.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.940
This is what a Google
Analytics report

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.410
looks like, the
chart on the top,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.440
tables at the bottom,
pretty pictures.

00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:32.790
There's some words
that we're going

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.860
to use throughout this talk
that I'm going to go over first.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.530
Think of everything in terms
of metrics and dimensions,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.480
so everything that
can be measured.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.380
So sessions and new users and
average session duration, these

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.350
are metrics.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.180
Dimensions are things that you
would slice these metrics by.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.510
So in the case of
this report, it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.050
tells you where your
users have come from.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.730
And that's a dimension,
so where they came from,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.380
what kind of device they're
using, what part of the world

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.740
they are located in.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.790
And at the very basic level
Google Analytics for apps

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.700
is SDKs for iOS and Android.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.770
It's totally free and you
get a lot of amazing reports

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.040
to start off with.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.480
It's very, very easy
to get a lot of value

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.600
unlocked very quickly with just
two or three lines of code.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.310
And amongst the dozens
of reports that you get,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.810
I'm just going to go
over maybe two or three.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.950
One of the things that you
get, new users, active users,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.890
locations, devices.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.600
These are things that you
can expect from any Analytics

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.100
solution.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.570
You care about this stuff.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.450
And you can get
it fairly quickly.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.300
Similarly, one of
the frustrations

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.970
that, at least I've experienced
while writing anything,

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.040
is once you implement
something, it's out in the wild.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.960
You want to see that it's
working within seconds ideally,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.900
if not minutes.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.006
And the real-time
reports we've got

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:58.380
are really great for that,
because you ship a new version

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.250
out and you want to see if
you did a few things right.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.110
And this really helps with that.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.070
Now a little bit of code here.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.830
And these are really
just two lines

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.810
in your Android
onStart and onStop.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.870
I didn't put any
iOS code in there.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.540
But it's fairly easy to get
this to work very, very quickly.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.920
And you don't have to
believe me right now.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.570
We have an expo booth and you
can come check it out tomorrow.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.980
We're actually going to do it.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.610
We're going to have
some fun with it.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.440
So the engineers have
come up with a way

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.219
to just tell you how easy it is.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.010
It's so easy a product
manager could do it.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.630
So I'm going to
try and get this up

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.750
and running in like
five minutes tomorrow.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.200
So while we talk about
just metrics, dimensions,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.010
things you can measure, I
like to think about it broadly

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.490
into two things.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.390
One is things which are
very easy for us to gather.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.330
And those are the
things that you saw,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.390
the baseline stuff--
new users, active users,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.264
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:57.264 --> 00:08:00.150
But then there's some things
which only you know about

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.100
and you can tell us, which
is important for your game.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.860
And those are things
that require a little bit

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.740
more instrumentation.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.460
It's not hard but
it just requires

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.850
a little bit of thought.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.380
And to go over this, let
me call Snehal on stage.

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:18.250
SNEHAL THAKKAR: Thanks Rahul.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.090
So as Rahul said, the
tracking is so easy

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.194
that even a product
manager can do it.

00:08:24.194 --> 00:08:25.360
And we're going to prove it.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.320
Rahul is going to go and prove
it live at our booth tomorrow

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.860
and day after, in case
you miss tomorrow.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.159
But there are things that
we could do automatically.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.850
Like every report
that Rahul showed

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.270
you shows up automatically
with the two lines

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.950
that he just showed you
in a previous slide.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.330
But remember his previous slide?

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.750
We want to find users
that are engaged

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.280
and that are monetizing.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.990
Well, only you can tell us what
means engaged in your game.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.380
For your game, it may
be achievements, right?

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.580
OK, let's say I'm playing a game
and I unlocked an achievement.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.420
Maybe that's engagement for you.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.620
For somebody else it may
be that, oh, I went in

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.090
and I fed the character.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.470
We don't know ahead
of time what it is.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.400
But what we would
like to do is give you

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.410
a tool to very easily send
that information-- whatever

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.820
it is that you choose to send--
to us so that you can then

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.910
use that information later on
to analyze whether the users are

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.230
engaged, how they're
monetizing, what

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.890
do they do before
monetizing, what

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.640
do they do after,
all the fun stuff.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.740
So let's divide this up.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.240
Basically I divide this
up into three categories.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.480
There is things
that you care about.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.840
Those are like events,
player clicked a button,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.540
somebody unlocked a new
level, somebody upped a level.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.950
Their second category
is monetization.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.000
They had a transaction,
they bought some item,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.910
they bought a set of items.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.970
And the third category
is custom data.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.400
How many people here actually
have their own databases

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.810
that back their games?

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.510
I mean you collect
your own data, right?

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.370
You have all your stuff.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.440
So if you have that
data, wouldn't it

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.470
be nice to be able to join
that data along with the data

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.100
that Analytics provides?

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.384
Well that's where the
custom data comes in.

00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:11.800
And we're going to actually
show you how to do that today.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.850
It's easy enough.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.490
We're eventually
going to train Rahul

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.490
to do a demo on that stuff too.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.040
Not yet, but we're
getting there.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.190
So how do you track this stuff?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.930
So Analytics actually moves
those things into three groups.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.130
The first set of groups
are what we call Events.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.830
These are basically things
that happened in your game.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.400
The second group is
Revenue, whatever

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.640
you monetized to your users.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.360
And the third group
is the custom data,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.590
and we send that over
as Custom Dimensions.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.030
So here is a little
code snippet.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.200
I'm showing the iOS version
of the code snippet,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.650
just so that we can switch
between iOS and Android.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.850
Both of them look very similar
because, at the end of the day,

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.700
the data that you need to send
is really the important piece.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.590
The rest of it is just a syntax,
[INAUDIBLE] iOS and Android.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.169
So here, everything
that you see in green

00:11:02.169 --> 00:11:03.710
is the things that
you're sending me,

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.500
except for the value,
where we actually

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.460
chose not to send in a value.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.520
But for every event, you
can categorize your events.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.270
So we allow you to categorize
your events in hierarchies,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.910
so you can actually
keep them in groups.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.740
So for each event you
can send us a category,

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.930
you can send us an action,
and you can send us a label.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.690
And if you so choose,
you can associate value.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.120
So for example, if you say, oh,
I have some achievement that

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.950
got unlocked, I would like to
associate some value to it,

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:31.720
you could do that.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.910
And then you can use
that value in analysis.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.830
If you choose not
to, no big deal.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.547
Here, we've chosen not
to associate a value.

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:40.630
If you choose not to use
a hierarchy and just say,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.480
well I'm going to only
send you a category, fine.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.330
All of the parameters except
the category are optional.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.250
We need at least one thing
to identify the event by.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.100
The Android version
is exactly similar,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:58.080
except that it's in the Java
syntax or the iOS syntax.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.160
So once you actually
send us those events,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.970
we can actually show you
flow of how users move around

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:03.870
in your game.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.250
So you could see a report
that actually tells you,

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.142
oh, from your main screen,
these are the things,

00:12:10.142 --> 00:12:11.850
these are the events
that you're tracking

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.170
that the users are doing.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.620
From the main screen, they
may be going to another screen

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.830
and from those screens
they're doing other events.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.790
These flow diagrams are
great to kind of visualize

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.030
how the users are
using your games.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.270
And you can add steps
and scroll around

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:31.170
to actually visualize more or
less as you feel like doing it.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.400
So the next thing,
the next group

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.160
that we were talking
about, is Revenue.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.540
At the Revenue we actually
let you track revenue

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.490
at two levels.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.030
And again this is optional.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.500
You don't necessarily have
to send us your real revenue.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.250
We're not after your data.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.660
This is really
about helping you.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.120
So you select.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.610
If you choose not to send
us revenue, perfectly fine.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.630
If you choose to multiply or
divide your revenue numbers

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.920
by something, perfectly fine.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.890
You decide what data you want to
share with Google to help you.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.840
Nobody is actually
looking at your data.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.200
It's really only you looking at
this data in your own report.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.570
But still if you want to
be paranoid and say, look,

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.210
I don't want to
really send revenue.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.770
Well, send us hits
with zero revenue

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.560
because it will
count as conversions

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.030
and then you could do the
analysis on the conversions.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.930
If you send us
revenue, it will help

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.260
you monetize different
items differently, right?

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.880
Like all of you probably have
different items in your game

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.080
that you sell.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.830
Well, if you actually
send us the revenue,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.920
then you could see how
different items are working out.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.880
So in this example,
I'm actually sending

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.050
in two pieces of information.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.840
I'm sending in a transaction,
which is the top part.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.530
A transaction, think
of this something

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.860
as whatever you would send to
the app store or Play Store.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.030
You would say, hey
this user came in

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.570
and they bought stuff
worth this much.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.324
We do have
multi-currency support,

00:13:50.324 --> 00:13:51.990
so you can actually
send in the currency

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.690
that you're doing
the business in.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.120
Now the second
piece is the revenue

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.940
for individual line items.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.790
Some of you might have actually
packages that you send.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.650
You might say, hey,
I grouped these items

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.910
and here is a thing
that you buy in bulk.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.640
You can actually send
us multiple line items

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.690
with a single transaction
or single line items.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.140
Now once you do that,
you unlock the reports

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.313
that actually show you
revenues by different products

00:14:17.313 --> 00:14:18.146
and by transactions.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.370
So in this particular
example, I'm

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.290
showing that there is
two different items

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.440
that our app sells.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.650
There is the bombs
and the magic potions.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.710
And you can actually see that
the revenue for both of them

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.670
is about the similar, even
though the individual prices

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.960
are double, one is
double the other.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.460
So you could choose
this information

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.570
to say, look, maybe
potions are not as popular,

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.017
I should maybe make it cheaper.

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.600
Or maybe I need to
make the bombs more

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.870
expensive because
everybody's buying them.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.680
This allows you to
do a lot of analysis

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.650
of the relative values of
different items for you.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.670
OK, the last piece.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.350
The last piece is the
Custom Dimensions.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.070
This is the data that
you have that you

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:05.530
might want to use later to join
this data-- join our Analytics

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.790
data with other data.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.570
Think about this
as-- Rahul earlier

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.620
talked about dimensions.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.190
Think about these
as extra dimensions

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.890
that you can send us
at different levels.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.790
Some of you might actually
send them at the user level.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.800
This could be the key that
you use to identify your user.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.440
Now one thing I will
stress which is we

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.720
don't want anything PII.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.470
If it is a key, it
should be a key to you.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.960
We do not want the email
addresses or credit card

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.160
numbers or anything like that.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.290
But it could be your key
that means nothing to Google,

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.970
and that's perfectly
fine because we're

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.300
considered a third party.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.870
That key can mean
everything to you,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.330
it just can't mean
anything to us.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.350
And that's how we
define PII, which

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.120
is users' private information
that you would not

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.820
want to share with third party.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.610
Think about what
your users would

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.070
be comfortable you sharing
with a third party.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.870
Despite the fact that
nobody's looking at that data,

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.300
you shouldn't-- Send your keys
that are random numbers to us

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.930
and that's OK.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.290
Then you could use them
to do the drawings.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.050
Now custom dimensions,
we actually

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.370
have a 2-step process for these.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.630
Step 1, you actually
define the custom dimension

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.380
in our configuration interface.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.550
The reason behind
this is we don't

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.250
want to just call them
Custom Dimension 1 or 2 or 3.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.066
We really want to
use the terminology

00:16:22.066 --> 00:16:22.940
that you're familiar.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.870
If you're sending
in a unique ID,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.710
we want you to be able to
call that unique ID everywhere

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.050
in our reporting interface.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.230
So the two things you do
is you tell us the name

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.670
and then you tell us what level.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.530
You can tie things to sessions.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.642
You can tie things to users.

00:16:37.642 --> 00:16:39.100
Or you could tie
things to product.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.872
The things where this
can be very useful

00:16:41.872 --> 00:16:43.830
is if you're running
specials, you can actually

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.160
send in product level
information and go,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.910
oh, this product was bought
as part of this special,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.810
so later you could do analysis
on how different specials

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.970
applied to different products.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.825
Once you actually
defined it, here

00:16:56.825 --> 00:16:58.360
is how you actually
send a snippet.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.235
And this is simple enough
that I can actually

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:03.140
show you both Android
and iOS in one slide.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.970
It's really just the one line.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.230
It's setting the
Custom Dimension

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.220
and then sending
a value with it.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.650
So in this example, I'm sending
the #CRM ID as Custom Dimension

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:14.579
1.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.720
And once you have done this,
you actually send this data

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.540
to Analytics, and this
will be a label to you

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.000
as your unique ID dimension
everywhere in Analytics.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.859
Now, how do you actually take
advantage of all this data

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.690
that you actually sent to us?

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.060
For that, I'm going to
hand it over to Mike.

00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:39.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.730
MIKE KWONG: Thank you, Snehal.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.180
So great, now that we
have this wonderful data

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.100
about your game in
Google Analytics,

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.040
let's take a look to see how
we can take advantage of it.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.920
Let's start by
thinking about how

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.495
we can do analysis of the
data to get us some insight.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.120
I'm going to focus on a
very important analysis

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.820
technique which is segmentation.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.180
Google Analytics has very
sophisticated support

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.620
for segmentation.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.100
You can define segments for
users, segments for sessions.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.050
You can define segments just
about based on any Google

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.440
Analytics dimensions and
metrics that you can think of.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.950
Revenue, device type,
even custom dimensions.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.720
Once you've defined
these segments

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.690
you can apply them to
any reports at any time.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.540
You can even use
more than one of them

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.700
together to try to
compare between them.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.570
So to define a
segment is actually

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.940
very easy within
Google Analytics.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.030
You can go directly to the UI
and use the segment editor.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.360
Some might say it's
so easy that even

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.180
Rahul would be able to do this.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.480
As you can see, there
actually are a number

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.700
of predefined segment
types that you can actually

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.140
choose from based on
demographics or even things

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.480
like the first date of
visit by the visitor.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.000
But you have more
sophisticated needs,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.560
you can actually
create a lot more

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.140
that conditions out of
all of Google Analytics

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.300
dimensions and metrics
and combine them

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.900
in very sophisticated ways.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.070
In this slide we've actually
shown a user segment,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.190
focusing in on users that
actually spend more than $30

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.300
within the game.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.550
And we've called the segment
Highly Monetized Customers.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.590
Now that we have
the segment defined,

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.390
we can actually apply it to
the Google Analytics reports.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.530
Let's suppose we want
to look at the user

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.150
behavior for this
set of customers.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.780
We can go to the User Overview
Report, apply the segment,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.510
and then figure out, for this
set of users that have actually

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.640
spent a lot of money
within the game,

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.140
how many sessions
do they come back?

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.380
What's the their behavior?

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.850
What's their conversion
characteristics?

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.150
One thing that's very
useful about segment

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:09.370
is to kind of prove or disprove
hypotheses that we might have.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.340
Let's suppose I'm
suspecting, I have a hunch,

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.880
that customers that convert
actually spend a lot of time

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.650
within the game.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.130
How do I know if that's true?

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.330
One way to see that is to go
to something like the Loyalty

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.370
Report.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.420
Apply the segment.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.090
That way we can actually look
at the number of sessions

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.570
a user came back and
other characteristics

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.220
such as the average
amount of time

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.400
the user spends per
session within the game.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.050
That might help me understand
whether my hypothesis

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.520
or hunch is actually
correct or not.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.329
This is a very
powerful technique,

00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:47.120
and for those of you
that haven't tried it,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.286
I would highly recommend it.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.040
So great, we can apply segments
and gain a lot of insight

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.860
about our users using
Google Analytics.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.020
What else can we do?

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.040
What we want to be able to do
is actually take that insight

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.570
and actually act on them.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.700
Rahul actually showed a
slide dividing up the users

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.110
into different buckets,
some users that

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.330
may have spent a lot of
money, some of them that

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.190
may be engaged.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.400
Our goal, of course, is
we would like to actually

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.980
turn more of these
users into customers.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.170
So how can Google
Analytics help with that?

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.730
Google Analytics has a lot of
useful data that you've sent,

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.430
so that's absolutely
something that we

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.280
want to be able to leverage.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.170
But you can actually
do more with it.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:43.120
You may also have other sources
of data, things such as CRM

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.270
systems or whatnot that may
contain a lot of other very

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.650
useful data about
your users that you

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.740
want to kind of
combine together.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.540
There are many ways
of getting data

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.270
into and out of
Google Analytics.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.500
I'm not going to go into
detail to most of these.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.630
If you're interested,
please do come by our booth,

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.160
Booth 218, and find
us and we'll be

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.660
happy to talk to you
a lot more about them.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.890
But I do want to point out at
least one way of accomplishing

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.360
this goal.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.400
And that will leverage
the custom dimensions

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.180
that Snehal talked about,
that he instrumented,

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.680
about the unique
IDs of your users.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.260
And I'm going to show you how
you can do analysis with it

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.950
and also export some
useful information out.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:35.100
So given that I want to
convert users into customers,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.530
one possibility
is for me to focus

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.620
on the users that are currently
not spending a lot of money

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.376
within the game but
are highly engaged.

00:22:44.376 --> 00:22:47.050
So to identify them
I can once again

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.010
define a segment, which is
pretty much the inverse of what

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.570
I showed you before.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.479
But in this case,
I'm going to identify

00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:56.270
users that have spent
a little bit of money

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.540
but not a whole
lot, so basically

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.820
users that have spent between
$0 and $30 within the game.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.090
And I'm going to call this
segment Potential Spenders.

00:23:07.954 --> 00:23:09.370
The next thing
that I actually did

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.640
is I created what we call
a Custom Report, which

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.230
is a feature within
Google Analytics that

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.440
allow you to select any
Google Analytics dimensions

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.370
and metrics that
you're interested in

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.140
and generate a report out of it.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.260
In this case, what I selected
is actually the unique ID--

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.770
the custom dimension that Snehal
actually already instrumented

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.730
the game to do-- along with
some metrics such as sessions

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.010
and also in-app revenue.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.820
If I apply the segment
that I showed you,

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.250
we can then identify the list of
users that actually have spent

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.900
some money but not a
whole lot within the game.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.110
Now I also actually further
subset this set of users

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:55.080
and find out which ones of them
are actually highly engaged.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.250
I can modify or create a
new segment to do that,

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.480
but I'm actually going to show
you a different technique.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.380
What I'm going to
do is actually apply

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.570
an additional filter
in this custom report.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.140
And I'm going to
ask GA to only show

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.630
the set of users that
actually have spent at least

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.480
50 sessions within the game.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.660
And if I apply
this filter, now I

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.620
have the list of
users that actually

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.030
have spent a little bit of
money but not a whole lot,

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.680
but is very engaged in the game.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.080
I can then use the UI
to actually export out

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.570
the list of users
very easily, simply

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.480
by going to the Export
drop down and selecting

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.720
the format that
I'm interested in.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.830
So in this case we
selected CSV file.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.260
The CSV file will
contain all the users

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.172
that actually fall
into the bucket

00:24:47.172 --> 00:24:49.380
that we're interested in
with some of the key metrics

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.840
that we've selected.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.390
With that, you can actually
join that with data outside,

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.140
for instance in your CRM
system, and do further analysis.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.310
You can even take
this list of users

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.180
and try to target
them within your game

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.840
with things like better
weapons, better spells,

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.540
and see if you can entice them
to actually pay and become

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.690
actually a more active
customer for you.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.170
So I've shown you how
you can do this manually.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.840
There are ways to leverage
this data in a programmatic way

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.830
as well.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.150
For those of you interested
in how to do that,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.300
please do come by
our booth, Booth 218,

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.539
and we can talk a
lot more about it.

00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:29.830
So with that, I'm going to
turn the stage back to Rahul

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.910
to wrap up.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.420
RAHUL OAK: Thanks Mike.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.000
So I'll just do a quick
recap of what we went over.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.920
So the problem here
was that initially you

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.480
saw those three people lonely
in the top right quadrant.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.930
See, there is so many more
now, they look happier.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.110
This is the end goal.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.530
This is what we wanted to do.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.130
And Snehal and Mike talked
over specific techniques

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.860
within Google
Analytics, using which

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.840
you can collect good
data, analyze it, and act

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.720
upon it to hopefully
achieve this end goal.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.890
And before I leave the
stage, though, there's

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.540
one thing that I want
to definitely emphasize.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.700
This morning, Russ
and Jonathan spoke

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.630
about this new, exciting
launch that we are coming up

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.900
with where you'll get
all the power of Google

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.750
Analytics inside the AdMob UI.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.790
And I just want to stress
that it's the same.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.040
Everything that we
spoke about, all of this

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.530
is available inside,
directly inside AdMob.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.040
So we'd definitely love
you to try that out.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.210
And that's it.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.040
Thanks again.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.220
Have any more questions,
we'll be hanging out

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.500
here or at the booth over
the next couple of days.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.280
Thank you.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:41.363
