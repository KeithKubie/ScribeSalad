00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.590
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn:
Good afternoon.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.410
My name is Georgette
Dorn, and I'm the Chief

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.740
of the Hispanic Division.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.390
And I'm very pleased to
welcome you to this library

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.840
that has the largest
collection of Brazilian books

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.830
in the United States by far.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.480
One reason is that they have
an office in Rio de Janeiro,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.350
and they send us books directly
from Rio, off Brazil, Uruguay,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.210
and the Three Guianas.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.310
The other reason is that
the U.S. had an interest

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.430
in Brazil ever since the
times of Thomas Jefferson.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.250
In the [inaudible] is a letter
from Jefferson, where he says,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.540
I look forward to the day where
the American Navy will sail

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.440
with the Brazilian Navy
up and down the continent.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.780
And Jefferson always looked
at the Americas as one unit.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.730
So he was looking forward
to having a Republic

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.120
of South America, which,
of course, never happened.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.790
Now, it is my great pleasure
to introduce Mary Karasch,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.400
a leader of the Hispanic
Division, whom they have known

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.300
since about the 1980s
when she was teaching

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.630
at the Catholic university
for about three years, right?

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690
And she's a Professor
Emeritus from the University

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.480
of Oakland in Michigan.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.430
And she now resides
in Tempe, Arizona,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.670
which is a suburb of Phoenix.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.670
Mary's first book has won the
prestigious Albert Beveridge

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.050
Prize for the Americas.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.510
So the American Historical
Association also looks

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.810
at the Americas as one unit,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.930
because the Beveridge Prize
is for American history.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.810
So Brazil, at that moment,
became American history.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.220
And her current book
has, of course,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.880
garnered the honorable mention
for the Warren Dean Prize,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.470
which was an onset of
the American Historical

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.420
about two months ago
here in Washington.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.000
So her current book, of
course, is a fantastic book

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.440
about Before Brasilia, Central
Brazil in the Colonial Period.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.510
And here is Mary.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.000
[ Applause ]

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: Okay,
it is my great pleasure

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.890
to speak here today, because I
feel like I owe an enormous debt

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.970
to the Library of Congress,
because of the excellence

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.920
of their collection, even on
a place as remote as Goias

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.930
and Tocantins, two
states in Central Brazil.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.730
But they have amazing
books here.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.730
And the reference librarians,
and, of course, Georgette,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.320
have been able to point
me in the right directions

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.380
when I could not find them.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.430
They were listed in the catalog.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.030
But some way, somehow, they
had disappeared in the library.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.820
So, again, I especially
thank everyone here

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.610
that has made this
book possible.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.950
I could not have written it out
the assistance of everyone here

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.020
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.490
All right, now, if you've got
a copy of today's handout,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.360
Talia is passing them out, okay,
let's go to the map, because,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.650
first of all, it's
always a problem

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.480
in discussing this region that
no one knows where the State

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.740
of Tocantins is, or
even the State of Goias.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.070
All right, now, find Brasilia.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.440
Everybody got Brasilia?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.010
Okay, so Brasilia was built
between 1957 and 1960.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.970
The first documents I have--

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.270
and again, I'm not talking

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.080
about archaeological
records-- begin in the 1590s.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.970
So people were out there,
you know, in the 1590s.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.750
And there was no Brasilia
at that point in time.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.580
All right, now, the second place
to locate is west of Brasilia.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.100
It is Vila Boa.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.130
And this is now called
Goias Value [phonetic].

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.850
And it's old Goias.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.560
The first capital of the
region, and the reason

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.060
for its existence is that
they found gold there,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.340
and this brought in all
the gold prospectors

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.020
and enslaved Africans.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.000
And, of course, because
there was gold there,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.490
the Portuguese established
a capital to try

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.910
and capture the gold for the
king or crown in Portugal.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.590
All right, now we're going
to turn to the rivers.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.620
On the west, you'll
see the Araguaia River.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.260
And the Araguaia
River flows from,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.800
you can see from the far
south, all the way north

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.650
to join the Tocantins River.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.120
So that is one specific
locale that's very important.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.510
The second, the Tocantins
River, a tributary,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:26.530
also the term is used Maranon
River, begins near Brasilia,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.080
flows north all the way to
Beling [phonetic] de Pera.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.110
It is the second longest
river in all of Brazil,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.040
and it's an amazing river.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.170
The picture that you
see on the handout is

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.050
of the Tocantins River.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.370
And it comes from the
Library of Congress collection

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.730
of the artist Tomas
[phonetic] Ambor [phonetic].

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.830
So I think the University of New
Mexico Press did a lovely job

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.810
of using that as the cover.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.280
One problem I have to notice,
however, about the river,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.890
is the image suggests that
it's a very large river.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.040
It may have been in the 18th
century a very large river.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.500
I have crossed the
Tocantins River.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.000
I've gone swimming in the river.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.490
It is not a large river.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.930
At present, that is probably
due to climate change.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:39.720
Okay, so just a basic
geographical orientation.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.670
And we're going to begin with
a question I often get was,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.300
how long did it take
you to write this book?

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:54.230
I would have to say from
1969 until 2016 in terms

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.990
of the collection
of experiences,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.080
the median of diverse
peoples, and just going

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.060
around the interior,
looking for documents.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.380
Okay, so I'm going to share some
of these experiences with you,

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.770
but also some of my
findings as well,

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.710
some of the surprising findings.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.690
Okay, so my first contact
with the indigenous peoples

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.740
of the region was
with the Karaja.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.100
Again, they're on
the Araguaia River.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.270
And this is a people who
have maintained lands there

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.100
for at least a thousand years.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.580
In Portuguese discourse,
people were, you know,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.410
indigenous peoples were nomadic.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.150
They moved from place to place.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.970
But certainly not the Karaja.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.010
So we went swimming in the
beautiful Araguaia River.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.060
I spoke with some of the Karaja
who were camping on the beach.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.780
And just a lovely experience.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.350
But I never thought I'd be
writing a history of the Karaja.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.450
So it was just a tourist trip.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.530
And then another tourist
trip followed that one

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.170
up by taking a trip on
the Trans-Amazon Highway.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:19.270
And we crossed the Araguaia
River way to the north.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:25.920
It's beyond just the--
what you see on the map.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:33.700
And at that time, in 1975, it
was a gorgeous, beautiful river.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.880
And as I said, you know, people
used to go camping on the river.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.810
They still do.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:45.130
But it is now dealing with
problems of deforestation,

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:50.270
all kinds of strange things
floating in the waters.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:56.090
All right, so when it came
down to apply for a Fulbright,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.140
there was one that appeared
at the University of Brasilia.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.090
So I applied, and
to my surprise,

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.980
I actually got it
on the first try.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.580
So that led to teaching
at Brasilia

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.060
for three semesters,
1977 and 1978.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.220
So I really began my research
when I was in Brasilia.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.900
In between classes, of course.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.890
What I found of interest,
my students were carrying

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.720
out fascinating research.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.240
One of my students would
disappear from class,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.490
and she would go and
meet the Chivante

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.690
and make contact with them.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.890
And I was thinking, this is a
young woman, and she's out there

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:51.700
in an allegedly dangerous
place, contacting the Chivante?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.320
But she always came back
safely, resumed the class,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.030
and taught me a lot
about the Chivante.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.940
And then also the history

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:08.170
of pacification campaigns
to contact them.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.360
So they were very important

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.050
in getting me started
on my project.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.940
The other thing that happened
was there was a fine geographer

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:23.600
there, and he took me out
to the area around Brasilia,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.240
and showed me the canyons

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.470
that had been carved
by the heavy rains.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.610
And we literally, what
had once been very flat,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.550
was now deep canyons.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.470
So already by that
period of time,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.120
a lot of the erosion
was taking place.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.410
And this is the environments
he showed me,

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.080
the environment of the savannah.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.220
The term in Portuguese
is Cerrado.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:00.620
So I was able to see a lot
of the beautiful landscape

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.240
around the City of Brasilia.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.480
Now, at that time,
the bus station used

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.920
to sell beautiful
baskets that came

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.570
in from the indigenous reserves.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.900
And so when I was
teaching at the university,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.840
I had to take a bus to the bus
station, then take another bus

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.980
to get out to the university.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:33.090
But I saw this wonderful store
that sold exquisite basketry,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.140
or things such as this,
such as a necklace,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.050
although I got this directly
from an indigenous woman.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.240
So I started collecting baskets.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:51.350
And then I went up to
the tower in Brasilia

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.450
where there's a fera
[phonetic] in which they sell,

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.820
you know, artesanato, folk art.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.650
And the Chivante, a couple of
them decided they were going

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.100
to skip the bus station
because that was all directed

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.060
through the Indian agency,
and they were very unhappy

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.900
about the fact they were
not getting paid enough

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.810
for their fine baskets.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:19.120
And so I met some Chivante for
the first time, and, of course,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.970
built, bought a basket.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.750
Now, the story of this basket
is particularly interesting

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:31.150
because it was a very
basic design that they used

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.510
to carry soap to
the river, you know,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.310
when they bathed in the river.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.140
When I went to the Vienna
Museum, ethnographic museum,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:48.560
I saw an exact, the same
thing collected in 1819.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.010
And that's in my book.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.550
All right, so baskets
are in the book, again,

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.800
because of this basket
experience.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.320
All right, then because
the University of Brasilia,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.750
also known as UnB,
had a good library.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.190
There was no national library
in Brasilia at that point.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.630
I started doing research.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.700
And I found some
secondary sources

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.110
on this rather extraordinary
woman, Donna Damiana daCunha.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.610
She was a Caiapo woman.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.980
You'll see the Caiapo located
on the map in the south.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:39.010
And she had been entrusted
by the Governor of Goias

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:44.870
to lead five expeditions
to contact

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.280
and allegedly pacify
the Caiapo, her people.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.470
And, of course, you begin
to ask the question, well,

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:59.410
why would an indigenous woman do
what usually the Banderas did,

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.560
which was to go out and
conquer and pacify a people?

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.040
But the other question
that's important, I think,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.500
is why would a Portuguese
governor entrust an indigenous

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.360
woman to make contact?

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.750
And again, I was thinking,
you know, specifically

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.260
with reference to Arizona.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.920
What if an Apache woman
had been given the job

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.140
of leading an expedition
to contact Geronimo?

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.880
I mean, we would laugh
at the idea because it's

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.320
so strange for our frontier.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.830
All right, so Damiana was,
again, one of my entries

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.810
into writing this book.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.680
And, of course, you know,
I begin with the book

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.300
with raising that question.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:56.590
Then in addition, I went around
visiting the old mining towns.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.670
Barbara will appreciate
this because I used to go

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:06.870
down to Cristalina and buy
beautiful, semi-precious stones.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:13.010
And so I began to look
for other mining towns

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.920
because this was the foundation
of the wealth of the region.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.170
It was gold, and
later, diamonds.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.590
Okay, so I did that exploration.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.930
And then I went to Goias Velho.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:32.870
Goias Velho, for any of you who
planned to do a trip to Brazil,

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:38.780
at least last time I saw,
still pretty much not developed

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.560
into a tourist center
like Ouro Preto.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.060
You get much more a
sense of the real Brazil

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:52.500
and the way it used
to be in Goias Velho.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.020
I was very fortunate
on that visit

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.740
to meet an Italian
missionary who had been going

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.730
around the interior, picking
up, receiving donations

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:13.260
of parish registers, and
also lay brotherhood records.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.200
And this was Fray
Simon Dorvi [phonetic].

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.990
He has long since returned
to Italy in his retirement.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:26.520
But he showed me
fabulous documents,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.990
many from the indigenous
missions.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.850
Also, others from the black
brotherhoods of the region.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:41.740
And I also learned
about the sales taxes.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:46.090
Now, when I was writing
and finishing Slave Life

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.390
in Rio de Janeiro, one

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.650
of the great frustrations was
I hadn't located extensive tax

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.190
records on slaves.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.450
Still, my idea that these
are the ones that were burned

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.460
at the time of abolition,
I know that in Goias Velho,

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.790
the governor receives the order
to burn all the tax records.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.240
He had a little bonfire.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.380
He burned the ones for Vila Boa.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.810
But all the other
tax records survived.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.650
And so why these became
so important to my book is

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.720
that these tax records record,
you know, who the individual was

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.960
that we're having
to pay the tax on.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:40.750
By name, then you can get, of
course, gender, age, ethnicity.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.720
And as I found out,
in the north,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.590
most of the Africans were being
imported from coastal ports

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:57.330
like Salvador, Recife, or
from the mouths of the Amazon.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.670
So in other words, individuals
who were being brought

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:05.730
from Africa, and then put on
smaller boats, and they had

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.510
to travel the whole long
distance of the Tocantins River

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.290
to the mining towns,
such as Vila Boa.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.800
I even had found one
baptismal registry

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.730
in which the mother explained

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.470
to the priest why she hadn't
baptized her child earlier.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.950
It was about three years old.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:32.150
And she said, well, the baby
was born on the journey,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.650
down the Tocantins or
up the Tocantins River.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.500
And it was only at that point

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.820
where the baby could
be baptized.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:48.350
Now, the other trade I also
worked on, trying to pin

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.960
down the internal slave
trade from the coast,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.510
how did those Africans get

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.910
from the coast all the
way to the mining towns?

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.640
They walked them.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.840
So, again, Africans who
came, you know, to the coast,

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.660
then had another
long journey by foot

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.300
after surviving the Middle
Passage, after long treks

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.100
to the coast in Africa.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.870
Absolutely amazing
that they survived

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:25.400
to work the gold mines
of Central Brazil.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.880
Now, the Africans in the south

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.360
of the captaincy came
from Congo Angola.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.520
And they were probably
mostly being brought

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:41.870
up by the trade route that ran
from Rio to the mining towns.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:47.620
Now, while I was doing this
kind of preliminary work,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.210
I did not have much of the
sense of the popular culture

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.310
of the region, which
is exceptionally rich.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.490
But then just being able to
establish these characteristics

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:07.380
of ethnicity, then I understood,
when later I was able to see it

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:14.190
in the 80s, why they still
honored the King of Congo.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.890
The Congoda [phonetic] is
still danced in Goias Velho.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.780
And so you have the
procession of the King

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.300
of Congo with his retinue.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.720
All right, so the
cultural traditions

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.150
that survived there are
very, very important as well.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.930
So after this initial
introduction to the region,

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.980
I knew what I was going
to do in the future.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.750
But meanwhile, I had
to finish slave life.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.010
And then I came to
Washington and taught

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.110
for two years in the 80s.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.840
And this, of course, is when
I began to work at the Library

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.900
of Congress and begin to locate
even materials for slave life

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.910
in Rio, and as I began
the next project.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:06.700
When I returned to Oakland,
I began to teach a film

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.270
with my students, The
Tribe That Hides From Man.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:15.530
And this was directly related
to the fact of my student

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.880
who had taught me about
pacification programs,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.010
because here, they were
doing this in the 1970s,

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.310
and recording it then on film.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.630
It's an excellent
film by Adrian Cowell.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:37.030
I would still use it at present
because it really helps someone

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.270
to stand what they
were doing in Brazil,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:44.670
both in the 18th century, the
19th century and the 20th.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.040
Anyway, the film
concerns the attempt

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.640
to contact the people they
called the Kreen-Akrore

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.130
in the movie.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:57.510
The Kreen-Akrore
were hiding out.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.440
They wouldn't make contact,
like many of the peoples

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.560
that my students contacted.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.910
And one of the themes of
the film is the great fear

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.090
of the Kreen-Akrore, why
they wouldn't come forward.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.080
Well, this book can
demonstrate it,

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.950
the history of their treatment,
because these were one

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:27.260
of the Caiapo groups,
Caiapo Panara.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.600
Their ancestors had suffered
immensely at the hands

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.340
of the Portuguese, or the
newly national government.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.080
So the film is available
on YouTube.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.430
So I recently checked it out.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.840
So if you haven't seen it
and want to understand that,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.750
I really recommend it.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.970
Now, the big grant that
enabled my research

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.660
in Central Brazil was
the National Endowment

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.510
for the Humanities Grant.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:01.570
And this enabled me
now to really get

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.400
at the manuscript sources.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.000
So I worked in Rio at
the Biblioteca Nacional,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.120
which has a fine
collection of documents

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.720
from the colonial period,

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.470
mainly because when the royal
family returned to Portugal,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.620
they left a lot of paper behind.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.110
And so that's at the
Biblioteca Nacional.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.600
Especially things that they
didn't think as very important,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.730
like correspondence from
the governors of Goias.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.400
But, of course, for me,
it was really essential.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:36.150
Then, the Arkeba [phonetic]
Nacional had exactly what

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.450
I needed.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:43.600
Censuses. Now, the
Portuguese did a series

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.510
of censuses from 1779 to 1832.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.620
You know, again, why
am I especially focused

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.300
on that period of time?

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.930
It's because of the censuses.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.630
What they clearly
show was the decline

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.240
of legal slavery in the region.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.770
But also the decline of the
white population, and the rise

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.310
of the non-white population.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.690
Now, the people the
Portuguese called the pardos,

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.340
or the browns, another
way to see it.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.100
In other words, in this
area, you get the division

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.960
between blacks, pardos
or mulatos, and whites.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.540
Sometimes they used
the term moreno.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:36.940
So decline of legal enslavement,
clearly demonstrated

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.520
in the censuses, and the
rise of the free population

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.110
of color of African descent.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.830
So once I did the censuses,
and again, the results are

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:54.250
in the book, you know, I
had to try and explain why

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.030
and how did this happen.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:03.650
Why do you have a free
population of color by 1835

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.450
that is larger than an
enslaved African population?

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.900
Because it's contrary
to what it was going--

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.400
what was going on
in Rio or Sao Paulo.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:19.290
All right, now, at the
Institute of Historico

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.670
that I've abbreviated here IHGB,

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:28.250
the most valuable find there
was a narrative of a voyage

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.370
on the Araguaia and
Tocantins Rivers

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.620
by Tomas de Soso
Vila Rial [phonetic],

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.110
a pardo of African descent.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.450
Elsewhere, mulatto.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:48.430
All right, now, this is if, you
know, Jefferson gave the job

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:53.780
of exploring all the way
to the far west, you know,

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.770
to see what was there, to
someone of African descent.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.780
Again, this would be
improbable in our history.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.810
All right, now, what
was also extraordinary

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.370
about his narrative
and his experience,

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.520
besides leading these
expeditions, he wrote an account

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.160
of it, which was published

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:23.350
in the Institutus
Revista, or Journal.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:28.210
He was even received
in Rio as a great hero.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.610
Imagine that happening
in Jefferson's time.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.730
All right, so this has now
been my brief biography

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.480
that I was able to put
together, has now been published

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.000
in the Dictionary of Caribbean

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.720
and Afro-Latin American
Biography.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.160
All right, the next phase

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.450
of the research then
took me to Brasilia.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:55.890
In Brasilia, I found that
there was no national library.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.910
There is now.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:02.420
So to collect materials on
the region, I had to wander

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.270
from ministry to ministry

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.470
and check their small little
library, often no larger

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.290
than this room, to try and
locate essential sources.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.710
I also was able to
correct reports,

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.100
or relatorios [phonetic],
of the governors of Goias,

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:27.170
which were critical to writing
my study of Indian policy.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:31.490
But now those are all online.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.720
You can get them so easily.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.870
But it took a lot of work,
just wandering from ministry

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.610
to ministry, to collect them.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.730
And the Senate.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.320
And then finally, in
Brasilia, on that visit,

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.290
I was able to go
to FUNAI's library.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:54.570
And FUNAI, at that time,
the National Indian Agency.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:58.980
And the most interesting
part was meeting people

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.920
who came from the reserves.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.350
And they brought video
cameras with them.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.980
And they took them to
the National Congress

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:16.470
to record the white man's
promises about their lands.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:20.020
So some also came to
check out the library.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.590
And so I was able to
meet them at that time.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.920
The actual sources there were
not very rich at that time.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.930
But a few were very useful.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.430
Now, finishing in Brasilia
then, I moved on to Goiania

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.440
and I encountered
another surprise.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.950
In the United States, we think

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:46.360
of these well-stocked state
archives or libraries.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.560
Talia may have worked at
the University of Wisconsin,

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.600
both the university library,
but also the state library.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.590
It's huge.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:01.060
When I got to Goiania, the
Capital of the State of Goias,

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.660
I couldn't find the library.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.690
So I went to the
Ministry of Education

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.310
and started asking people.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.660
Nobody knew where it was,
until finally I made contact

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.550
with someone, and he pointed me

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:20.240
to a very unpretentious
building.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.380
Looked like a former school.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.600
And in that room where I was
directed, there were piles

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.400
of documents, allegedly
being sorted and organized.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.950
So that's where I started
that manuscript resource,

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:42.680
going through piles
of documents.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.890
It has now moved to
its own building.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.650
Fortunately, it's much
better than it used to be.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.620
In more recent visits,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:58.940
I was able to collect the
military records, particularly

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.400
on the black militias
of the region.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.670
They are called enriques
[phonetic] in Brazil.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:13.610
And the enriques [phonetic]
were being carefully counted

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.410
by the Portuguese because
they wanted to find

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:24.310
out how many they could use
to fight in the Indian wars,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:29.720
or to find and destroy
quilombos.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.230
The quilombo in Brazil, a
fugitive slave settlement,

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.310
there were many during
the mining period

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.130
in the 18th century.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:45.010
One of the problems of research
was simply to locate them,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.470
find documents on
them so, you know,

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.730
I wanted to use the
military, those who were

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.290
out there destroying them.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.590
And what did I find?

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:58.010
That blacks and pardos were
involved in that process.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.810
So the question is, why?

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.270
Well, as I found out
doing household lists,

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:09.060
blacks and pardos were
also slaveholders.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:13.740
And so they were-- they
assisted the Portuguese

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.390
in recapturing people
who lived in quilombos

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.650
and fighting the
indigenous nations.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.910
Then I went to the church
archives in Goiania,

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:32.460
got permission from the local
priest to find manuscripts

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.840
on the history of the
missions in the region.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.610
And the priest pointed to
a small room and a pile

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:44.090
of documents once again.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.820
You know, when I returned
from initial research

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.580
in Brazil the first time, I
came to the Library of Congress,

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.640
put in a request for a document,
and I got it immediately.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.300
I was amazed.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.490
In this case, once again,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:01.420
I had to go through the
piles of manuscripts.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.150
But in that pile, I found
an illuminated manuscript,

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:12.040
meaning painted in
red, decorated in gold,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.780
as if it were a medieval
manuscript.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.540
And this was the charter of
the black lay brotherhood

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.620
of a tiny gold mining
town in Goias.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:32.170
And the identity they proclaimed
was that they were Ethiopians.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.930
Fascinating.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:38.560
Okay, so I've written about
this by this point in time.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.090
But, I mean, it really
does pay to go

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.150
through piles of manuscripts.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.450
Okay, so then I went

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.760
to the Museu das
Bandeiras in Goias Velho.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.570
More piles of unsorted
documents.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:58.460
At the time I worked there,
it was kind of half-organized.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.880
There was a catalog
to half of it.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.870
So using that, I was able
to find the materials

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.470
on the Indian militias.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:16.860
Because the Portuguese used
one nation, such as the Caiapo,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.340
then to fight against
their enemies.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:26.600
And so the Caiapo were
in these militias.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.290
The paid militia of
the Caiapo, however,

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.750
often never had any
payment for their services.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:38.280
Any blacks that joined, or
racially mixed individuals

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:43.330
or whites got paid, but the
Indians did not get paid.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.090
Then, again, as I've
mentioned before,

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.770
I worked the tax records there

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.720
that clearly showed the
distinctions in ethnicity.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.500
Now, one of my most
valuable finds at the Museu--

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.440
or in Goias Velho, was the death
registries of the mining town

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.970
of Nativadaji [phonetic]

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.250
that Fray Simon [phonetic]
had brought there.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.710
They were very valuable,
because again,

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:16.130
once you're recording gender,
ethnicity of the Africans,

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.590
but also of the indigenous
children, the Chivante

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.680
who were being brought in,
and as so often happened,

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.250
died shortly thereafter.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.560
So we can count the
Chivante children, you know,

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.560
who were brought to the town,
and then died, as well as,

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.420
of course, the enslaved
Africans.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.590
Now, I had a particularly
compassionate priest who,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:47.590
before he buried Africans,
would often comment

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.270
on their treatment
by the slaveholder.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.830
And he had some awful
cases to narrate.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.440
Then I was trying
to figure out, well,

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.170
what made this priest stand out?

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.790
Because most priests didn't
record that kind of information.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.650
And I later learned he was
a pardo of African descent.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.900
And this was another surprise
for me to find so many people

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.850
of African descent of
priests in the region.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:17.890
Because of the shortage
of priests,

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:21.150
the Portuguese permitted
them to be ordained

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.300
and to serve in the region.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:31.120
All right, then probably just
about the final issue I would

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.280
like to deal with
is then manumission,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.750
or the process of
getting freedom.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.660
Because this cuts back
to my earlier question,

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.430
how did so many people
escape slavery?

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:46.350
Well, this is a gold
mining region.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.020
And because it's a gold mining
region, there is something

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.790
with which one can
buy one's freedom.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:36:02.180
Those tax records, to my
surprise, prove to also reveal

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.980
that when a slave male,
usually it's the men

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.660
who are buying their freedom in
these mining towns with a lot

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:15.050
of gold, he had to
pay his tax on himself

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:19.600
so he could get his freedom.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.810
A gratuitous, or a
free manumission,

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:27.420
or letter of liberty, you
didn't have to pay a tax.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.470
But if you gave up all that
gold to buy your freedom,

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.960
you had to pay a tax on it.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:39.130
Okay, so other slaves were
able to get their freedom

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:43.380
because the father, or
partner, he was a miner,

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.750
and he bought the freedom
of his wife and children.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.370
Then there's also
the group of women

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:54.150
who bought the freedom
of their children.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:58.840
Sometimes after decades
as a slave,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.810
because it took them
that long to do so.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.460
Now, the black brotherhoods
played a role

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.730
in helping them secure
their freedom.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:12.350
I have the records from one

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.530
of the black brotherhoods
in the City of Goias.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:20.410
At the beginning of the period
of time that the records begin,

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:24.430
most of those on the
board were slaves.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:30.320
By the 1860s, most of
them were either free,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.130
born free, or freed.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.130
They had been slaves, but
they had been manumitted.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:43.750
In other cities, often the
black brotherhood kept the box

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.330
in which the slaves
held their savings

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.750
in gold for their freedom.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:54.840
And so that's why the gold
could be protected for 10 years,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.220
20 years, 30 years, until
the person could finally buy

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.940
their freedom.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.360
So this is one area
where both men

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.840
and women were able
to get their freedom.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.980
And, of course, they
often freed the babies

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:15.280
at the time of baptism.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.550
Now, I also worked in
Portugal, but, you know,

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.720
I won't really talk
about that today

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.400
because I can see I'm
running out of time,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.370
and I know you will
probably want

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.110
or to have some time
for questions.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:36.610
Now, my final comment then, I
would like to stress that travel

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.870
and encountering the people of
a region that you're talking

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.850
about is absolutely essential

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.290
to understanding what's
in the documentation.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.670
And some historians feel

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:54.540
that they can just
sit in the archives.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.680
But if you don't
go to these places,

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:03.270
you don't understand often, you
know, what you're writing about.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.360
This was particularly
true for me when I went

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:11.030
to the Apinoge [phonetic]
Reserve in 2007.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.560
Now, in the colonial documents,

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:19.540
the Apinoge [phonetic] were a
notable people controlling the

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.260
juncture of where the two
great rivers come together,

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.620
the Araguaia and the Tocantins.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.440
And they were a powerful people.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.310
Were a very, very
war-like people.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.080
And then they became
allies of the Portuguese.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.820
And they fought for the
Portuguese, which again,

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:41.110
was a strategy by which
they could survive

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:45.410
as a people, retain their lands.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:49.640
In their wars, they often
conquered other populations,

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.040
including Africans.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.100
And so in the sources,
you see the references

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.300
to the Africans living
among them.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.030
Because many enslaved
Africans ran away

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.450
and joined indigenous
communities.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.960
And if they were strong men
who had fought in Africa

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.240
as warriors, they fought
with the indigenous people,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.900
both against, invading settlers,

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.790
as well as against other
indigenous populations.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:22.700
All right, so, you
know, I had those images

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.270
of the Apinoge [phonetic] when
I went to visit the reserve.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:31.570
They had recently been
given their lands back,

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.780
and the reserve created.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.260
I saw the remnants of the old
settler houses that had had

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.490
to leave when the Apinoge
[phonetic] got their lands back.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:45.090
And, you know, met the
people, watched, you know,

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:49.590
particularly very nice
religious ritual in the evening,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:53.940
and just a memorable experience.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.910
And so acquired this too for
anyone curious about this.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.620
So this is Apinoge [phonetic].

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.550
Because one of the things I
had to do was get the help

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.800
of an anthropologist to
go there, as well as I had

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.290
to get permission from
FUNAI to enter the reserve.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:18.510
And I had to take tribute, in
this case, T-shirts from Target.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:23.750
I mean, these are the things you
have to do often to do research,

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.700
and do it successfully.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.260
Okay, then I also did a
trip by car and boat, again,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.790
to visit the Carajas in
Gavea on the Araguaia River.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:39.310
But this time, what
really struck me was not

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:46.210
so much the people
themselves, but the environment,

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:51.250
the great Caymans,
12-footers, 15-footers,

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.580
that the people were
living with.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.650
And it was a dry season,
so all kinds of animals

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:00.110
and birds had congregated
on the river.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:05.450
And then I've also has the
experience of traveling by train

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.830
to the Pantanal of Mato Grosso.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.230
For those of you
considering trips to Brazil,

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.730
the Pantanal is the best place

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.080
to see wildlife anywhere
in Brazil.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.770
Better than the Amazon.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:23.210
Because here, this is
a very swampy area,

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:28.410
and you have the giant
snakes, you have the jaguars,

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:34.080
all kinds of creatures, as
well as cattle, who are part

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.990
of the local landscape.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.650
So travel, I would repeat
again, absolutely essential.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:45.990
So what I have tried to do is
write a history of the people

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:54.590
of the region, and to illustrate
how diverse peoples came

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:59.470
together, indigenous,
African, Portuguese,

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:04.300
immigrants from other parts
of Brazil, to the point

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.580
at which the majority of the
population, very racially mixed,

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.700
people of color certainly.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:17.710
And again, just a
reminder, slavery did not--

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:20.130
most people, or so many
people, were still enslaved

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:24.610
until it was abolished in 1888.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:29.230
Now, Goias is one of the
richest states of Brazil.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:33.010
Not because of gold, but
because of agriculture,

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.290
the great agribusinesses.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.320
When I traveled in
Tocantins state,

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:45.710
one of the most remarkable
ecosystems of all of Brazil,

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:49.650
because you see the
gradation from savannah

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:54.750
to rainforest along the reverse.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.830
There are species
in Tocantins state

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:02.280
that do not exist
anyplace else in the world.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:08.340
Now, Tocantins state is
undergoing the agribusiness

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:14.430
revolution, the burning
down of the Cerrado.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:21.260
The cutting down of
trees to the north.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.660
Redoing rivers.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:28.660
Last time I was in Palmas and
Porto Nacional in the Tocantins,

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.190
we couldn't go swimming anymore

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.680
because the river was
full of dead trees.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.220
Well, they had flooded it.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.770
But it was kind of
typical of what's happened

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:41.390
in many other parts of
the Tocantins River.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.250
The Araguaia as well.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.370
There is also now
increased drought,

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.190
longer periods of drought.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:57.810
In the 18th century, this
region was famous for the length

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:01.500
of the rainy season, the
intensity of the rains.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.900
The rains were so intense,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.040
they called it the
time of the waters.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:10.300
But it's no longer as intense.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.360
And the droughts are extending.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.060
Now what you have is often,
at the end of the dry season,

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.450
intense period of smoke
in the area so thick

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.330
that the planes can't
land at the airport.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:27.630
So there's no question the
environment is changing so much.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.610
And we need, obviously,
to be much more conscious

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:38.020
of what's happening there, both
in Goias and Tocantins state.

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.690
Okay, let's get to
some questions.

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:41.510
I see I am way out of time.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:46.090
[ Applause ]

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:51.510
&gt;&gt; We have time for
some questions.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:46:12.420
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.570
&gt;&gt; So my question is,
after you did the research

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:19.440
in the archives, et cetera,
did you find any people

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.920
with oral histories that
either matched, supported,

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.020
or contradicted the
documents that you found?

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.700
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: Yeah, this is
a real problem in the region.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.100
The oral traditions are bigger.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.500
The people have not
been collecting them

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.670
in a very professional way.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:43.010
Now, with the indigenous
populations.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:44.310
&gt;&gt; Mary? I'm sorry.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:48.260
These people might not
be able to hear you.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.560
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: Oh, okay.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.390
With the indigenous
populations, you know,

00:46:53.390 --> 00:47:01.200
there are interesting
fragments that you pick up,

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:08.030
that people were recording
somehow their traditions.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:19.660
Because I have a petition
from a group of people living

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:27.550
in Central Brazil, and they
petitioned the King of Portugal

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:40.050
for protection for their lands
on the basis of their service

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:51.010
to the Dutch, I mean, in fight
the Dutch in the 17th century.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:48:00.020
So I know they had
some oral tradition.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:08.680
The Chivante and the [inaudible]
of oral traditions, one,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.520
that they once had
their [inaudible]

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:17.430
and they migrated inland.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.050
The other, that they
once lived in Rio.

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:26.100
I cannot substantiate,
especially the Rio tradition.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.710
It seems unlikely also.

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.380
I think the local
historians now are starting

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.170
to collect the traditions.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:39.070
When I was telling
a local person

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:47.330
about the Cuca lay brotherhood,
she was telling me, oh,

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:53.900
there's this tradition
in our town

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.730
about this wealthy
African woman,

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:58.430
which I had not seen
in the records.

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:06.880
So I'm hoping my book will
stimulate more oral history.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:12.670
Because this is such
a rich region,

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:16.370
because you have the survival
of religious traditions there

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:19.990
that are no longer
practiced on the coast.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.630
And a lot of them
are African-derived.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:27.820
&gt;&gt; We know how the
demographics were looked upon

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:34.680
in the United States in
1800s, even up to 1960s,

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:40.240
how do they do demographics in
Brazil, since it's so mixed?

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.430
How do they define it?

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:46.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: Okay,
well, number one,

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:51.090
why were the Portuguese
collecting statistics

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.780
on the population?

00:49:54.780 --> 00:50:00.820
Their objective was to find
out where the people were,

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:07.140
meaning non-indigenous, and
who was available to mine gold.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.220
This is why they
were so conscious

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.120
of tracking the black
population.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.530
Because it's clear that the
Africans knew how to find

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.780
and locate gold, because many
of them came from West Africa,

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.080
places like Ghana,
as you would expect,

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.380
where people knew
how to find gold.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.680
So it's because of the
Portuguese nivate [phonetic]

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.980
of the period.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.280
We've got to count
the people out there

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.580
so we can find more gold.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:26.880
&gt;&gt; I meant more, because
see like how do they--

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.180
if they have a definition
for [inaudible] for example,

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.480
do they have that thing checked?

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.780
So you go to this category,
you go to that category.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.080
How do they push
people in certain rows?

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.380
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: Some of
it is based on the fact

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:34.680
that it's the local priest
who's collecting the data.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, so he would say,
you are this, you are that.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: That's right.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.580
And the other group, the police
in larger cities and towns.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.880
But the Tripartite division is
basically white [inaudible] you

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.180
see this in the brotherhood
registries.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.480
You see this in the tax records.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.780
I mean, it appears through
the whole series of documents.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.080
&gt;&gt; What else?

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.380
We had white, then we had.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: We had pardo,
we had murano [phonetic].

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.980
Pardo is most common, especially
as we get into the 1830s

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.280
where the population is
largely free people of color.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.580
So basically what they're saying
is these people are no longer

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.880
black, but now they're
racially mixed,

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.180
but we don't know
the racial mixture.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.480
Okay, now, another
term that does appear

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.780
in some documentation is the
term cathuso [phonetic], which,

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.080
in some parts of
Brazil, define a mixture

00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.380
of an indigenous and African.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.680
Usually, an Indian woman
and an African man.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.980
But it's the local
area that defines

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.280
who fits in the categories.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.580
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.880
The extent often is the mulatto
is more likely to be the child

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.360
of a European man
and an African woman.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.270
In other words, first
generation.

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:13.250
Pardo being more
likely used for second,

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.930
third [inaudible] generations.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.230
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:19.710
Yeah, and pardo and mulatto
are used interchangeably

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:23.030
in the same document,
referring to the same person.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:29.190
&gt;&gt; Mary, it sounds to me from
your description of agribusiness

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:32.880
in Goias that what the people

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.160
of Goiania are looking
forward to is impoverishment.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.340
Am I reading the
signs incorrectly?

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:44.150
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: There's a
very large urban poor people

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.540
in Goiania because of migration
from the big agribusinesses.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:53.760
Again, a memory from
1969 when I was going

00:51:53.760 --> 00:52:00.370
out to see the caraja
[phonetic], where the people

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:07.460
on the estates, in the
fields, it was harvest time,

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:11.970
there were lots and
lots and lots of people.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:16.370
At present, they've been kicked
off the lands, and they've had

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:18.740
to migrate then to the cities.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.300
And many of them join the
urban slums of Goiania,

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:28.230
or other cities in the
[inaudible] and Brasilia.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:32.000
Now, there is-- there's been
a lot of poverty created

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.510
by the dispossession of whites.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:53:10.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.270
&gt;&gt; I have a question, Mary.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:18.490
I'm curious how the experience
of slavery in the interior

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.070
of Goias, if you learn of
any differences between that

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:27.380
and coastal, or urban areas like
Rio de Janeiro, for example.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Karasch: Yeah, one of my
challenges in doing research was

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.400
to try and find out
how people mine,

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.660
because that's the principle use

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.010
of enslaved African
labor in this region.

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:43.070
And it was very, very difficult
to locate the descriptions.

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.660
I actually was able to
see one of these mines,

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.100
and people were still
working it in Tocantins state.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.840
And it was a very small
sterile operation.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:54:00.220
It was not a big gold mine like
you think of in South Africa.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.830
A lot of it was one slaveholder.

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:05.130
Now, this is, again,

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.630
one of those interesting
social questions.

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:12.380
How does one slaveholder
maintain control

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.330
over a game of miners?

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.060
They're out in the
middle of nowhere.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.490
And obviously we know that a lot

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:25.020
of those miners escaped
to quilombos.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:29.160
But the ones who managed
to return with their slaves

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:35.260
and gold, in other words, there
seems to have been connections,

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.390
and I have a way
to document that,

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.830
maybe in oral history
it would turn up,

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:45.920
of the way people could go
into the interior and survive

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:51.950
in the face of potential
indigenous attacks and get back.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:55.940
Okay, so you've got the
hope of riches and freedom.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.240
I think this is one
of the things

00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.250
that slaveholders were doing.

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:06.480
If you find the gold mine, or a
gold piece of significant size,

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.970
the slaveholder promised they
would monument the individual.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:15.340
The manumission was
used to persuade people

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.640
to stay with the group.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:24.340
Now, there was another factor
that emerged towards the end

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:30.170
of the period when a group
of Africans, mostly composed

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:35.720
of the miners, who were
male, and then the women,

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:41.390
and the group made a
pact, this is about 1805,

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.930
that they would stay
together and mine gold.

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:51.190
And what they would do then
was work for the freedom

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:56.540
of every individual, including
the women, and the role

00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.780
of the women was to provide
the food for everyone.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.620
And so another mechanism

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.000
by which people could
get their freedom.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.360
So one of the things that's
different, if you compare this

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:13.680
to a big sugar plantation
on the coast of Brazil

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:21.210
where rigid control existed,
hundreds and hundreds of slaves,

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:26.340
and they had no opportunity to
enter a cache economy, get gold,

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.740
or even wander off into
the interior in the search

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.500
for something like that.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.580
So there are key differences

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:37.120
between this region
and the coast.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.680
Now, having said that, to
my surprise, I also found

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:46.900
that the region had extensive
sugar plantations with hundreds

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.820
of slaves just like
on the coast.

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:54.900
So I suspect that slave control
was more intense and difficult

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.730
for the slaves on the
sugar plantations.

00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:00.030
But I think you have to look

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:04.200
at what productive
activity they're engaged in.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.250
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:09.050
Wonderful.
