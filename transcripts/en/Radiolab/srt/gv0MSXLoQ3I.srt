1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,260
Hello? I'm Jad Abumrad
and I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:07,670
This is radio lab today our
program is lost and found

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,160
approaching zone without
gps. Alright, well you know,

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,640
I think we're getting real close on the,

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,040
you're driving into our next
adventure is our producer Tim Howard.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,360
See if this is it. So I
sort and I took a trip.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,500
I need your picture id yet
to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,610
For what? Fort Monmouth. Is
that a military base? Yup.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,790
We were going to this
museum they have on the base

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,100
to meet this woman Mindy Mindy rose,

11
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:43,520
what's on the museum curator
at a US army communications.

12
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,380
She agreed to show us around to see what

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,920
well um, patients. Chad, do you
wanna hear some stories? Absolutely.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,820
Okay. Here on display
we have the war heroes.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,290
So she pointed to this one glass
case, sorta like a memorial. Well,

16
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,660
he was born in 1918,

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,980
died here at Fort Monmouth in
1937. So he lived about 20 years,

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,710
served with the army expeditionary forces.

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,030
He was wounded and blinded in one eye,
carrying a very important message.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,750
W what's all this on his, on his
face there? Looks like putty.

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,170
Like what's all this stuff on his nose?

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,710
It's called crop and it's
a natural growth. Um,

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,560
I think it's a calcium growth
and some pigeons just get that.

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,460
Did she just say pigeons? You've
got it. I'm a lot of forget it.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,490
There's another one
marker for pigeon here.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,210
Oh Wow. Wait a second,
Tim. What's the story?

27
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,000
Why Pigeons? Why Pigeons? Yeah.

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,660
Well a pigeons are awesome. And B,

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,770
there's a big question here, which is,
well, let me, let me just start you off.

30
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,550
Training wheels with a simple
little story on, this is GI Joe.

31
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:59,960
He's our hero pigeon, but there's one
pigeon named GI Joe GI Joe is pretty cool.

32
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,570
Well he looks like a totally ordinary
vision. I wouldn't know that.

33
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:05,570
I'm standing a foot away from
a war hero. I think he's cute.

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,410
He's got yellow legs. Remember I told
you about the legs? The feet. All right,

35
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:13,160
so what's the story? Okay, so
it's 1943 there was a town,

36
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,110
the British have just taken this
little Italian town, Cola, Chia,

37
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,850
Chia from the Germans. The bad guys.

38
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,960
The problem is it took it really fast
and their American allies are about to

39
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:27,770
bomb the town 20 minutes.
Oh, the radio is there down.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,920
They can't get anybody back to the base
in time to tell them to call it off.

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,950
How near bias the space 20 miles away
and so they only really have one option.

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,030
Let me guess. No Way. Just so you
really get this. Yeah, bring it home.

43
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:45,830
This bird is in a place that he's never
been before. Hallway there for hours.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,310
He's been in a dark box. He should
be completely confused. Should be,

45
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,410
and yet when they take them
out and throw them in the air

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,250
[inaudible] like a cosmic zip court. He's
pulled over mountains, lakes, forest,

47
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,100
none of which has ever
seen before. Right back

48
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,290
[inaudible]

49
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,500
did the army base where he
lives just in the nick of time,

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,300
just as Obama bombers
are about to take off.

51
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,210
He's credited with saving
over a thousand British live

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,350
American hatched GI Joe Kennedy,

53
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,110
the message through an
artillery bombardment in Italy
and the same units of the

54
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,520
56 London division.

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,510
How the hell did he do that? How
did he know exactly where to go?

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,840
Some of them returned with um,

57
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,630
the message capsule hanging from their
leg and their breastbone shot open and

58
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,050
all that kind of stuff. But
they would always fly back home.

59
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,090
How that's your question? Yep.

60
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,210
Hello? Hello there. So I called
this guy. This is Charlie won't get,

61
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,310
he's a heavy hitter in the vision world.

62
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,250
Former director of the Cornell lab
of ornithology. My question is,

63
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,130
if JIEDDO had never been to that town,

64
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,280
how did he know how to
get back home? Well,

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,310
the first thing that GI Joe needs
to know is we're wait, wait,

66
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,230
Tim, I'm sorry.

67
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,340
Feel bad for saying this because it's
your first piece for the show. But I mean,

68
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,820
don't we know the answer to this?
What's the answer, John? Well,

69
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:06,440
birds have a compass in their
head. That's how they migrate. Jed.

70
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
You dummy,

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,910
you're just not getting the degree of
difficult. Think about it this way.

72
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,590
If I take you on a little boat and put
you out in the middle of a large body of

73
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,980
water, all you can see is
water. And every direction.

74
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,020
Which way do you paddle to find New
York City? Are you asking me? Yeah.

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,100
Can I have a compass in this scenario?
Sure. But that's not going to help you.

76
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,560
Sure will. No, no. What do you
mean? No, and just think about it.

77
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,440
W which way are you going to paddle first?

78
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,700
Hmm. I

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,280
don't know enough to say exactly.

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,970
It depends a little bit on whether
I've dumped you in the Atlantic Ocean,

81
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:49,580
the Pacific Ocean, the
Indian Ocean or whatever.

82
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,730
You can't swim home if you don't
know which direction home is.

83
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,730
And you're saying this
is what a pigeon does.

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,960
You can throw it anywhere and
it knows. That's my whole point.

85
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:00,250
I W if you were a pigeon, I wouldn't
need to tell you anything. Huh?

86
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,270
How did GI Joe figure out where
he is with relation to home?

87
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,480
That's the great question. That it, okay,

88
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,770
I'm with you now and I'm
sorry for interrupting you
earlier. That's all right.

89
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,530
So how do they do it? Well, and if
you have a one sentence answer for it,

90
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:19,460
then that's a short interview. It is a
very, very easy answer. We don't know.

91
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,150
Wow.

92
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,880
But they have been doing a lot of crazy
experiments on pigeons over the years,

93
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:27,720
like 60 years now to try and
figure all this out. Like what? Um,

94
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,010
let us count the ways we have tried flying
pigeons with frosted contact lenses.

95
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,110
They've put coils on their heads
with the pigeons head, like a hat.

96
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,840
They've glued little brass
weights to their backs.

97
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,300
They put radio transmitters
on them. Yes, indeed.

98
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,580
They've followed pigeons and airplanes.

99
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,380
The point is that it is a complex issue
and they have definitely not arrived to

100
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:53,910
any consensus for how pigeons do this.
They have theories, plenty of theories.

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,040
For example, you get talions poppy and his

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,890
colleagues believed that when
you take the pigeons out, uh,

103
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,110
to the release point,

104
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,040
they sample the odors on the
way to the release point.

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,620
All the smells of the places
that they pass, right?

106
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,190
Essentially a series of all
factory landmarks, you know,

107
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:18,191
you go past the chocolate factory and
the olive groves of the garlic plantation

108
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:20,570
or whatever sounds like a beautiful place.

109
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,260
And so when a a pigeon is released, uh,

110
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:29,060
what it does is it sniffs the breeze
and says, Aha, continue past garlic,

111
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,770
take a left at chocolate.

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,060
This is the odor that came to me on the
Northwind and therefore I need to fly

113
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,440
south in order to get home. [inaudible]

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,560
but Charlie's actually put this idea to
the test or we anesthetize the pigeons,

115
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,730
put them in a box,

116
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,260
artificial air so they can't smell
anything and are rotating turntable and

117
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:53,190
transported them to a release
side about a hundred miles away.

118
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,760
And when they got over being kind of
carsick they flew home just fine to

119
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,350
something else is going on here. Yeah.

120
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,400
And here's where we get to my
personal favorite theory. All right.

121
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,480
Forget about smell.

122
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,310
There are some researchers here in the
u s who think that the key to pigeon

123
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,140
navigation, is he ready for this? Yeah.

124
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:14,974
What is it? Metal

125
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,100
[inaudible],

126
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,820
which is to say if you go all the way
down into the center of the earth,

127
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,470
there's all this iron down there
churning and as it's churning,

128
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,440
it's throwing off this magnetism. Yes.

129
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,830
Lines of magnetic force up
through the earth, out into space.

130
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,040
So imagine up there in the
atmosphere above the planet,

131
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:41,041
there are all these lines
that are wiggling and as GI
is flying through the air,

132
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,690
he's moving through these lines.

133
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,020
[inaudible]

134
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,000
do you think he sees the lines? Well,

135
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:53,080
I can tell you that he might feel them
because there are these little particles

136
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,920
in his beak magnetite
magnetic iron particles.

137
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,880
They're twitching in some spots
that twitch more in some spots less.

138
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,040
And if you can measure various
aspects of the magnetic field,

139
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:11,630
like its strength and its angle,
you can tell whereabouts you are.

140
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,160
Do you think that's
what's actually happening?

141
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,490
I think it may be partly what's
happening. I mean Charlie had,

142
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,900
Charlotte says there's probably a lot of
things going down and anytime you think

143
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,340
you've figured it out, the pigeon
goes and messes you up. For example,

144
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,100
he told me about this one
place, the place in New York,

145
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,910
about 90 miles west of here
called Jersey Hell fire tower.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,110
If we take Cornell pigeons to
Jersey Hill and let them go,

147
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,790
they go random. Uh, and only about
10% of them ever find their way home.

148
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,430
And so they are essentially lost.

149
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,960
It is a Bermuda Triangle
for Cornell pigeons.

150
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,980
Why would that be? That's sorry I
hadn't, if we, I would tell you,

151
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,860
is it a magnetic thing? No, no,

152
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,310
there's nothing magnetically
disturbed about it. Is it a,

153
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:07,020
a sewage treatment capital? No.
Hyper active radio frequencies? No,

154
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:11,250
it's a, it's a hill. A surrounded
by pine trees. It's just a hill.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Does it make you wonder if there's a
whole other system going on in a pigeon

156
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,710
that we haven't even started
to think about? Yes, of course.

157
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:23,280
And then use you say, well what
could it possibly be? Yeah.

158
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,050
And after a long day of being out there
with the pigeons and releasing them and

159
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,710
waiting for them to make up their mind
and fly home and get the vanishing

160
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:35,160
bearings, you come back and you open
the loft and there they are, you know,

161
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,980
all sitting on their little
purchasers going, cool, cool.

162
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,070
And you just long to grab one by
the scruff of the neck and say,

163
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:45,480
how do you do it? But so far,
obviously they haven't told us.

164
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,060
[inaudible] one more thing I didn't
tell you about how they were monogamous.

165
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,440
The pigeon mind might be unknowable,

166
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,980
but the patient heart
is an open book. Yeah.

167
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,910
Well Mindy said that with a lot of
other birds, stirs and chickens.

168
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,000
He'd get them all together.
They all go wild and party.

169
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,720
One thing leads to another,
they love Jacuzzi. Right?

170
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,620
Well maybe they go into
Jacuzzi after, maybe they,

171
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,120
I don't know what they do in the
Jacuzzi. I'm not judging, but pigeons,

172
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,410
they would mate and they would stay
mated until death do they part.

173
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:21,400
So one thing you can do to make the pigeon
fly home faster is you take the male

174
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,234
out of his cage,

175
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,930
you put another male in there with his
girl and of course he's going to get

176
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,820
pissed off. Feathers are fluffing.

177
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,100
And who is the straight male in my
cage and all this kind of stuff.

178
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,170
Drive him away. He flies back
so fast to clean house. Yeah.

179
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,260
So this is called the widow hood method.
And yes, it is a powerful motivator.

180
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,680
Yeah, they missed the misses. So
wow. So who knows how he did it,

181
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,250
but what may have propelled GI Joe
through those darkened war-torn skies was

182
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,570
jealous. Rage. Could have
been, could have been.

183
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,130
You go judge or you go get that young
buck [inaudible] you go gho and if you

184
00:10:57,131 --> 00:11:00,490
have to save a thousand lives in
the meantime, okay, just do it.

185
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,190
[inaudible]

186
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,400
he good? Pretty good. Those pigeons.

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,060
But I think we can go one more around
for the human being and our natural

188
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:20,520
ability to navigate. I met,
uh, a woman named Lira Borucki.

189
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,440
She's in the psychology
department at Stanford University.

190
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,920
She studies languages and she's found
that some languages have a curiously,

191
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:34,450
I don't know how to put this a curiously
pigeon like [inaudible] no, seriously.

192
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,350
They're languages that don't rely
heavily on words like left and right.

193
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:43,040
And some languages actually don't have
those words at all. Um, in the, uh,

194
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,770
culture, I got to spend some time in,
they rely on north, south, east, west.

195
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,730
Oh, you mean like sort of taking
in left at the biscuit factory.

196
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:55,390
I'm going to hang in east
more so than that. Uh,

197
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,900
you would say things like, there's
an ant on your southwest leg,

198
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,230
or move your cup to the north northwest
a little bit. Where are we taught?

199
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,700
You should back up. This story is
too good. You should start at the,

200
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:08,200
where are we in the world right now?

201
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,160
This is a community called pump
morale on Cape York. In Australia.

202
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,300
When was this? Uh, this
was a few years ago,

203
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,150
I guess 2006 there.

204
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,500
The way you say hello in
pumper out is you say,

205
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,080
which way are you going?
Uh, so in English you say,

206
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:29,320
how are you fine in pumped I you
say, which way are you going?

207
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,580
And the answer must be something like
north, northeast in the middle distance.

208
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,880
How bout you say, imagine as
you're walking around your studio,

209
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,380
each person that says hi to you,

210
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,720
you have to report your
heading direction to them.

211
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,050
So you literally can't get past hello in
this language without knowing which way

212
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:47,854
you're facing.

213
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,270
And you said North northwest in the middle
direction isn't really that precise.

214
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,500
It's actually more precise than that.
There are 80 some different choices.

215
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,680
Yeah, it was socially very awkward.

216
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,420
People thought I was quite dim because
I wasn't oriented and I didn't know

217
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,250
exactly which way was which all the time.

218
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,340
It was especially notable when I was
surrounded by a small children who unlike

219
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:15,490
me, knew which direction
they were facing always. Yup.

220
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,360
You can ask a five-year-old
there, can you point northeast?

221
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:23,080
And they'll point without hesitation if
you ask a Stanford professor or Harvard

222
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:27,130
professor to do the same thing,
they have no idea. And I,

223
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,100
you know what if you were indoors, like
what if you were in a, in a shoulder?

224
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,000
Yup. They keep track of directions
even when they're indoors.

225
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,800
Without windows you'd pay attention.
You just have to pay attention.

226
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,500
And I think what's really
striking about, um,

227
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,310
the discovery of language is like this
and folks like this as they have an

228
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:53,200
ability that we call dead reckoning.
And it's an ability to, you know,

229
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:58,201
after any kind of circuitous path to
turn around and head straight back home.

230
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,900
That ability we thought
was beyond human capacity.

231
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,010
We had observed it in ants and
we had observed it in birds,

232
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,470
but there was always
some other explanation.

233
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:12,510
Like birds have magnets in their beaks
and ants are counting steps and you know,

234
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,670
there's some kind of extra
thing that they were doing.

235
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,400
Now there's 7,000 languages in the world,

236
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:21,700
about a third of the world's
languages have this property,

237
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,530
not a third of the world's speakers,
but a third of the world's languages.

238
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,760
And these are not folks that have
magnets or special aunts superpowers.

239
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,470
They, they're using this the same
cognitive system that we're using.

240
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,940
They're just using a differently,

241
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,870
they're paying attention to something
that we normally don't pay attention to.

242
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,140
But interestingly, earlier
it says there was a moment,

243
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,270
a very particular moment when she sort
of, she slipped into attention. Yeah.

244
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:53,360
So I had this interesting
experience and I was there.

245
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:56,720
So after about a week
of being there, I was,

246
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,840
people were constantly pointing, uh,

247
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,990
two locations and I was constantly
trying to stay oriented.

248
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,110
And after about a week,
I was walking along,

249
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,150
I was kinda trudging through
the sand. It was hot.

250
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:11,240
And I was thinking about whether I
was wasting my time there or not.

251
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:15,170
I wasn't sure if this study was going to
work out and all of a sudden I noticed

252
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:19,250
that in my head there was this extra
little, it seemed almost like a win,

253
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,570
like an extra window,

254
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:25,040
like in a video game there was like a
little console and in that console was a

255
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,360
birds eye view of the landscape that I
was walking on and I was a little red

256
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,260
dot. That was traversing
that landscape. No kidding.

257
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,020
And you just become a pillow ball
allo or whatever they're called them

258
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,890
and I thought, wow, that's really cool.

259
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,890
That makes it so much easier if you have
that little extra module in all of a

260
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:48,710
sudden is the correct word. Is that you?
It happened all of a sudden it, yeah,

261
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,260
I just saw it. It was,

262
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,180
it was just there and then I kind of
shyly shared this with someone. I said,

263
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,400
you know, this weird thing happened.
I was walking along and I got this,

264
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,780
I had this view in my mind and they
looked at me kind of strangely and said,

265
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,550
well, of course. How else would you do it?

266
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,150
That's exactly of course you have a
bird's eye view and you keep track of your

267
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,050
location from a bird's eye
view. Of course you do.

268
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,680
I have that all the time. No,
you don't. You really don't

269
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,670
proceed to break. And by the way,

270
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:23,920
bad voice right there that's been
joining us from time to time. Uh,

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,740
we should explain that. Is Karen Jacobson

272
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,290
also known as the GPS girl.

273
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,220
She was nice enough to agree to read
some things that we could use in our

274
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,290
stories. So that's what you been hearing.

275
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,400
Okay. Well shall we start with the
scripts that I have in front of me? Okay.

276
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,290
Please enter your address.

277
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,670
Well, that's amazing.

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,130
It sounds like you've actually
gone into the machine somehow.

279
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,410
Are you someone that gets lost a lot?

280
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,590
No, I have a great sense of direction.
Years before I did the voice of gps,

281
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,660
I was on vacation with my family in
Denmark. We were in this little town,

282
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,260
it was winter, it was
getting dark, it was raining,

283
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,740
and then the street signs were in
Danish and we didn't speak Danish.

284
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,190
And I am still heralded as the family
member who navigated us out of that

285
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:14,450
situation cause it was like around
and round there in this little town.

286
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:19,250
But who ever would have imagined that
ended up being the person giving people

287
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,830
directions in millions of
