00:00:02.012 --> 00:00:03.970
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to
Google Developers Weekly

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.174
for November 18, 2013.

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:08.090
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.756
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:11.790
and off.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.420
I often say that
Google's the biggest

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.980
startup I've ever worked for.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.860
But if your startup
is smaller than ours,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.068
you might be considering
working with an accelerator,

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:21.470
like 500 Startups or Rocket
Space, trading equity

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.110
for benefits, like office
space and business strategy.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.320
Is it worth it?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710
Don Dodge shares his experience
with us and provides advice.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.510
Also, many startups these days
selling premium services find

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.090
themselves caught between
free open source software

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.620
and large software packages
from bigger competitors offering

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.190
support and consulting.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.570
How can you survive?

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.530
Jay Simons, president
of Atlassian,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.400
joins Don to talk about how
they navigate this challenge.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.329
From New York,
YouTube's Ikai Lan

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.370
shows us how to manually
create Google credential

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.561
instances with refresh tokens
as well as access tokens.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.310
If you've been looking
for tips and tricks

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.450
on how to use OAuth
with the Java API,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.650
this is the show for you.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.370
Native applications
that run in Chrome

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.340
are a big part of the
web as a platform.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.060
Portable Native Client,
or as we call it,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.450
PNaCl, enables secure
and portable execution

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.750
of these native apps.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.610
When you produce a
platform-independent form

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.290
of your native app,
Chrome translates

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.250
it to run on users' portable
devices at greater than 80%

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.040
of native performance--
very cool stuff.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.600
Check out the video with
moderator Colt McAnlis and some

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.960
of Google's product leads on
Native Client to learn more.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.660
Francesc Campoy and
Kurt Schwehr teamed up

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.290
to show us how they leveraged
Google's cloud and Go language

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.380
to visualize big data, building
an app that maps shipping

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.230
using the Google Maps API.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.990
We brought you clouds
to Google Earth,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.280
and now you can see what
maps can do with cloud.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.110
Staying in a Google
Maps state of mind,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.450
GDL hosted Ujaval Gandhi, author
of the new Google Maps Engine

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960
QGIS Connector, about
how this plug-in fits

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.440
into a typical
workflow and where

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.180
you can get the source code.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.450
We also welcome back
Peng Ying and Maru

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.524
as they dive into
Wallet Objects concepts,

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:54.940
showing us how Wallet Objects
are represented and rendered

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.380
in the Google Wallet app.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.120
I tend to know what few objects
are in my physical wallet,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.660
and now, I'll know what objects
are in my Google Wallet, too.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.480
Cloud platform
Maven Paul Rashidi

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.680
then joins us for a quick
walkthrough of the Google

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.600
Compute Engine API on
Android, demoing a sample app

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.630
that connects to the
Google Compute Engine API.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.690
And all week, we've been
happy to host four new courses

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.730
from the Google
Developers Hackademy.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.330
This week focused on the
Android SDK presented

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.310
by Enrique Diaz from
the GDG Androititlan--

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.920
[SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.420
Stepping outside the
studio, we have more updates

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.980
from the world of
Google Developers.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.400
On Thursday, we celebrate
an important milestone

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.250
as Dart turned 1.0.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.790
Dart is a modern language for
building structured web apps,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.690
and now, it's officially ready
for your production apps.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.350
Find out all the cool details
at dartlang.org and get started.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.490
You already know that you
can use a Google Drive

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.410
SDK to build apps that are
highly integrated with Drive.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.640
And now, there's a powerful new
way to integrate with Gmail.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.370
Use the new SDK features to
make drive-enabled apps that

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.320
let users open docs in your
app without ever leaving Gmail.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.130
And to make sure that you never
miss a thing from the world

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.660
of Google Developers, subscribe
to Google Developers on YouTube

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.700
and check out the GDL schedule
at developers.google.com/live.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.145
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you in the studio.
