00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.690
Welcome back

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.690
Thanks for joining me today on the King Of Random

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.850
Recently I saw a product that looked like a stone archway with a hallway

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.540
Extending behind it as far as the eye could see

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.700
It was an illusion set up using a couple of mirrors and some lights to make it look like the hallway

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.880
extended far beyond the actual dimensions of the product

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939
I thought it was a really cool idea and I wanted to build my own so the purpose of today's video is to show you

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.559
How I'm going to build my own infinity mirror using a few easily available products the primary supplies

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.900
We'll need for this project are a mirror and a piece of glass

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.688
Approximately the same size as each other some styrofoam a couple of lights and some window tinting the other supplies

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.719
I have around our equipment for building and decorating my infinity mirror

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.649
This mirror was originally a baseplate designed to put candles on to decorate your home

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.959
I picked it up at a craft store for around five bucks

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
If you have a store near you that sells glass and will cut it for you to a custom size you can often get that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.349
For fairly cheap if that's not available you can often pick up a picture frame with a glass front. We're pretty cheap

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.829
I have the white styrofoam from Lowe's. It's a one-inch sheet of expanded polystyrene

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.149
This actually comes in a 4-foot by 8-foot, sheet, but that didn't fit in my car

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.800
So I had to cut it down into smaller sizes

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.539
Which worked just fine for this project

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.408
These battery-powered tea lights can often be found in any home decor section of a store

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.188
And I like these ones because they flicker mimicking a real flame the window tinting I picked up at an autoparts supply store this particular

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.008
Film blocks 35% of light you can go as high as 50%

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.809
But you don't want to go any darker than that or it'll be too hard to see through the front window of your infinity mirror

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.199
before we do anything else with a styrofoam on both sides it has a

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.920
Plastic coating we want to peel that off

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.070
So we have the raw foam because I cut this foam to fit into my car a lot of the edges aren't straight

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.209
So I'm using my glass as a square to line up a new 90 degree angle

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.079
I've got foam to cut, so I'm gonna be using our styro-slicer' that we've shown you in a few other videos

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.990
If you haven't yet gotten around to building yourself a styro-slicer' don't worry most of what we're building today

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.249
Can be done with just a razor blade the first thing we need to do is set up our mirror and our pane of glass

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.860
Perfectly parallel to each other a few inches apart to start. I'll cut out a large piece of styrofoam to use as our base

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.790
I'll start with a base

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.450
That's a little wider than it needs to be and I'll cut off some extra later, but to start off

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.729
I'm going to take about three inches on either side of the mirror

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.159
Now that we've got our bass, let's measure out two lines that we will carve down to become slots

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.199
Which will hold the mirror and the glass in place?

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.950
You'll have to decide how far apart you want your mirror and your pane of glass to be if they're closer together the repeating light

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.919
Effect will also be closer together farther apart the lighting will look more normal, but the effect will be a little bit diminished

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920
I like to leave about 3 inches of space

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.799
With our lines measured out we now need to cut grooves about halfway down into the foam. I'm going to use this handsaw

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.370
You want to be sure that the saw is perfectly perpendicular to the poem so that your slots are straight up and down with

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.579
The slots the way, we've cut them our pane of glass will fit into the slots

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.570
But our mirror is a little bit thicker so we need to widen that slot so it fits well to

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.160
widen the slot for the mirror

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.790
Let's just take a piece of sandpaper and wrap it around a popsicle stick and run it through the groove

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.379
We need to make sure that our mirror and our glass stay perfectly parallel to each other

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.880
so let's make another piece of foam that will go on top of the two and hold them straight up and down this piece of

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.670
Foam, I want to be about one inch narrower on both sides of the glass

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.750
this piece of foam in the end will be entirely covered up by the decorative parts of the infinity mirror it needs to hold the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.290
Pane of glass in the mirror in place, but it doesn't need to be as extensive as the bases

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.569
The grooves that will hold the mirror and the glass on our base are three inches apart

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.829
So if there are three inches apart on the top as well the two planes should be perfectly parallel

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.979
Now because my pane of glass is a little bit smaller than my mirror my one inch thickness of foam is actually not thick enough

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.870
To build a cap on top of this

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.939
So I'm going to cut another piece identical to this one

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.959
Slice it on the lines that I've marked and then glue it all together to make a piece that will hold our pane of glass

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.959
And our mirror steady

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.819
That should hold our two pieces pretty well

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.529
Gluing styrofoam together can be tricky some kinds of glue will dissolve or melt your styrofoam

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.359
What I'm going to be using today is a very low heat glue gun. It's cool enough that the glue

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.389
Shouldn't melt the styrofoam at all feels like you're working pretty well

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.438
Trying to leave just enough room that the pane of glass will fit nicely of course on this side

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.899
I need to leave enough room for the slightly wider mirror just

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.139
To reinforce the glue on putting a strip on the outside here as well

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.349
Our styrofoam cap lines up pretty well with our two panes of glass

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.908
But it's still having a little bit of a hard time fitting nicely onto the mirror so to make it conform

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:13.309
Even more perfectly to the shape, I'm going to use a piece of sandpaper on top of the mirror and carve it down like that

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.500
We've got our base and our cap piece

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.750
Which are holding our mirror and our pane of glass perfectly?

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.269
Parallel to each other so now it's time to start adding some more pieces to make this a little more decorative the first piece

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.860
I'll add will act as a sort of facade

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.860
I'm going for sort of a castle theme on this

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:35.449
Infinity mirror so what I want is a piece that comes up on the sides and just makes a nice face for the whole thing

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.758
On this calf you can see one of the pieces of styrofoam sticks out a little bit farther than the top piece of styrofoam

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.029
So I'm going to trim it down so the two are flush to make this facade

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.870
I'm actually going to cut three pieces of styrofoam

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.289
One for each side and one that will go across the top I'll start by cutting a two inch wide strip from this styrofoam

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.729
Next I'll measure the height so it comes up to the same place as the top of the cap

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.249
We will want our side pieces to overlap the glass a little bit, so let's use our hand saw and cut some more grooves

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.339
Looking good so far. Let's add a few more details with the cat piece and the two side supports added

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.909
I'm going to make a single facade piece that will raise up higher than the level of our cap

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.630
This area here is where we'll be able to see the glass so this part of the styrofoam will be removed and the rest of

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.630
It will stay

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.609
There we go that looks pretty good now

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.170
I want to add a curved archway

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.759
So I'm going to trace out our facade and figure out a good shape that will fit entirely on it

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.409
I don't want the archway to be quite as wide as the facade and I'm going to have it come in just a little bit

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.020
I'm gonna make that a little bit larger because I do want it to extend beyond the corners here

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.050
All right, I'm gonna give this a rough cut with the razor blade, and then I'll go around all the detail edges with the styro-slicer'

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:55.229
Beautiful leave that it will turn into a fantastic stone archway our decorative pieces are coming along nicely now

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.580
I'm going to add a strip across the back of the cap and another piece that goes on top of the whole thing

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.010
Let's measure how high we need that strip to be

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.369
Now let's measure a piece that goes on top of the beam

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.790
We just added and our facade act as a cap on top of the whole thing

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.149
I do want it to extend about an inch ahead of the facade

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.630
This line represents the front of the facade, so I'm going to extend it about one inch beyond there

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.580
While I measure this cat piece that was going on top

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.539
And then I decided I actually wanted to extend about an inch off to the sides as well

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:45.120
So I'm going to trace this out onto another piece of styrofoam. Just adding a couple inches to the width new piece

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.109
Cut I like that fit a lot better with it extending off of the sides as well as the front

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.640
I want to start gluing things together, so it's more structurally sound as I finish it up, but before I do that

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.249
There's a few more decorative elements. I need to add to these pieces

00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:17.549
The structural and the decorative pieces are both ready to go

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:23.759
But before we start assembling everything permanently we need to clean the mirror and the glass and attach our darkening film to the glass pane

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.789
That's static electricity making our styrofoam stick to everything right now

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.389
Let's take our darkening film and stretch it over our piece of glass

00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:40.829
Then we'll cut out a piece leaving a border about an inch and a half wide around the whole pane

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:46.499
The film has a dark side and a clear side, which is just used to make it

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.809
So it doesn't stick to yourself while you're preparing it for

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.489
This next step, I'm using this window film application solution

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.300
But you can also just use soapy water

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.979
Spray both the glass and the film so that as we lift the film and place it onto the glass

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.980
It's not sticking to everything everywhere

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.500
So at this point our film is on our glass

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.109
But it's still got all sorts of this soapy liquid inside it so we need to use a sort of squeegee to press all that

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.329
Out and make sure that the film and the glass make

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.040
Contact since I've got it laying around

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.589
I'm going to use a piece of styrofoam as my squeegee starting in the middle and pushing all the bubbles out toward the edge

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.920
That sounds horrible, but it is working

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.730
Our film is now pressed down over the whole glass pane

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.399
So I'm going to take the razor blade and trim off all of the extra

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.409
We've got the film attached to the glass and the glass and mirror are both nice and clean, so let's start assembling everything

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.060
When you're putting the glass in make sure that the side with the film on it is facing the mirror

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.279
the film might take a day or so to

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.939
Completely dry and stick to the glass so when you're putting it into the little slot

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.219
Be careful that you're not causing it to peel up

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:09.609
To make sure that the test-fit works with our facade piece here

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:15.429
Liking that too. All right. Let's take our glue gun and start attaching some of the pieces more permanently

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.060
This piece I could attach right now

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.919
But I am gonna be doing some painting on this and to make sure that I'm easily able to paint the inside edges of some

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.779
Of these parts, I'm gonna attach this piece later

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:43.419
I am going to trace where it is so that I know up to what point I can add the paint now

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.500
We've got most of it, built and all we need to do is add a couple of side pieces to seal it off

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.740
I Glued one side on but not the other because we need to have access to be able to put things in between the two reflective

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.069
Surfaces we have our two lights, but we don't want them to just sit in the box

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.559
So let's make a little stand for each light

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.040
There we have it all of our pieces of the infinity mirror in place

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.280
All we have left to do is a little bit of painting and secure everything down

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.640
I've got the whole thing covered in a layer of acrylic paint and now just make it pop a little extra

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.640
I'm gonna use some black ink in my airbrush

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:46.440
There we have it the decorative housing for the infinity mirror is now complete all this left to do is secure these two bases down

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.049
Inside turn on the tea lights and watch it go

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.760
And

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.369
Now instead of gluing this on because we want to be able to reach in and out and turn the tea lights on and off

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.570
So we don't run out of battery

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:14.159
I'm going to be using a couple pieces of bamboo skewer poke through the foam to hold this piece in place

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.750
There we go now we can easily pull out both of these bamboo skewers

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.770
And we need to reach in and out there you have it that is how you can build your very own

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.279
Infinity mirror of course with this one the lights are not super powerful

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.540
So it's more like a really really long mirror having quite reached infinity

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.890
I chose a castle theme because I thought the orange color of the lights mixed really well with that idea

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.299
But you don't have to use this theme if you have a different color lights you can go with a different design theme

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.430
Even if you have the same color lights you can choose what you want yours to look like I just like castle stuff I think

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.969
The effect works the best if your infinity mirror is pushed up against a light-colored

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:56.159
Wall it really helps with the contrast of the darkness of the tunnel with the light of the wall making it look like it's going

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.960
Through what its resting up against one more thing that I want to mention is this actually looks better in real life

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.200
We're pretty limited by the low light abilities of our camera

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.210
But when you're seeing it with your eyes the flames really pop out and they do seem to be disappearing into the wall

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.809
I really had fun showing you how I built this today, and I hope you had fun watching it

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.020
Thanks for joining us for this project and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then oh

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.190
That's fantastic oh

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.539
My ears are gonna ring for days after that now. It looks like the tunnel of lights is going right through me

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.100
Hey guys

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.110
Did you know that we're on Twitter Instagram and Facebook?

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:37.259
as well all at the king of random and every platform has a different purpose so go scroll through the histories check out what we're

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Doing, I'll see you there (have a good day)    ; )
