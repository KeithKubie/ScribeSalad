00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.904
We are getting close.
We are in the last unit.

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:23.415
We are doing kinetics.
And we are going to talk about

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:27.840
reaction mechanisms today.
We had a little bit of an

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.397
introduction to that already
last lecture,

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:35.911
setting up to do this.
Today we are going to run

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:39.811
through and talk about how you
come up with reaction

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:44.400
mechanisms, how you evaluate a
proposed mechanism in terms of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.229
the experimental data.
This is, again,

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.064
in Chapter 13.
All right.

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:51.970
Suppose you have a particular
reaction.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.558
You know that two NO gas plus O
two gas go to two NO two gas.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And someone has come up with
some experimental data for you.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.745
And they figured out that the
rate law for this reaction,

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:13.644
there is observed rate
constant, so k observed.

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.694
And in terms of the NO
concentration,

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:20.169
it is second-order.
And in terms of O two,

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:23.983
it is first-order.
And so now, you can come up

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:30.000
with a reaction mechanism that
fits that experimental data.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.704
And, as I mentioned last time,
you never know for sure that

00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:35.876
your reaction mechanism is
correct.

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:38.751
All you can do is be consistent
with the data.

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.242
You can prove reaction
mechanisms wrong.

00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:44.436
You can come up with a
mechanism and show that that

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:48.268
cannot possibly be the mechanism
given the experimental data.

00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:51.909
You can prove things wrong,
but you can never be sure that

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.656
you have it right.
The best you can do is be

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:59.000
consistent, but you can prove a
lot of things wrong.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.448
And if you have a lot of
mechanisms and you prove a lot

00:02:02.448 --> 00:02:05.897
of them wrong and there is only
one that seems to hold,

00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:09.218
then there is a good chance
that probably is correct,

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:12.412
but you never 100% because
someone might do another

00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:14.839
experiment and discover
something else.

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.585
But, in the problem set,
you will be saying,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.651
yes, this mechanism is
consistent, or you will be

00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:24.036
writing a consistent mechanism,
or you will be saying,

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:26.463
that mechanism cannot possibly
be true.

00:02:26.463 --> 00:02:28.315
All right.
Let's look at that.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:31.828
First let's just consider what
the overall order of this

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:36.074
reaction is.
What is the overall order if

00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.074
this is the rate law?
Three.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.370
I am just running through
these.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.740
We will practice some of these
because these are good couple

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.037
point questions on the final,
and so you don't want to miss

00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:51.111
these easy points.
All right.

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:55.111
If the overall mechanism is
three, the overall order is

00:02:55.111 --> 00:03:00.000
three, three things coming
together at once to react.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.519
Is it likely that is it one
step?

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.905
No, it is not.
What is it called if you have

00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:10.078
three things coming together in
terms of molecularity?

00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:12.598
Termolecular.
And those are rare,

00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:17.165
as we talked about last time.
As I said, if you are getting

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:21.023
together three people,
it is usually not true that

00:03:21.023 --> 00:03:25.748
they all arrive sort of ready to
go at the same exact moment.

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:30.000
Usually one person is late,
if not more.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.270
Getting three things to react
together at the same time is

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.818
challenging, and so those are
rare.

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:39.815
So, this probably has more than
one step.

00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:44.311
Then we have to try to divide
up this reaction into steps and

00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:48.282
come up with a mechanism,
a two-step mechanism we will

00:03:48.282 --> 00:03:50.829
try for this.
Let me leave that up.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.227
All right.
Let's draw a potential

00:03:53.227 --> 00:03:56.000
mechanism on the board.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.400
And then we will try to figure
out, for that mechanism,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.300
what the rate law would be if
that was the correct mechanism

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.699
and see if it is consistent with
the experimental data.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.199
Again, what was the
experimental rate law is k

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.000
observed.
That is the observed rate

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.480
constant.
Second-order in NO and

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.040
first-order in O two.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.680
We can write the reaction in two
steps, and each step is an

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.120
elementary reaction,
so it occurs exactly as

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.199
written.
In the first step,

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.079
we will have two NOs coming
together.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:56.639
And the forward rate constant
will be k one and the

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.000
reverse rate constant will be k
minus one.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.433
And it will be forming an
intermediate,

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:09.861
N two O two.
In the

00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:15.192
second step of the reaction,
we will have oxygen come in and

00:05:15.192 --> 00:05:19.891
interact with the intermediate,
N two O two,

00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:23.777
and form, with a rate constant,

00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:27.391
two NO two's.
And

00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:32.000
that will give us our overall
reaction.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.831
Now we need to write rate laws
for each step.

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:41.772
And since each step is an
elementary reaction,

00:05:41.772 --> 00:05:48.470
we can write the rate law using
the stoichiometry of that step

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.752
as written.
The rate law for the forward

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:57.474
reaction would be what?
What do I put first?

00:05:57.474 --> 00:06:01.054
k one.
And then?

00:06:01.054 --> 00:06:05.625
NO squared.
What

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:10.195
about the rate for the reverse
reaction?

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:14.062
k minus one.
Times what?

00:06:14.062 --> 00:06:19.570
N two O two.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.437
Okay.
Let's look at each of these.

00:06:23.437 --> 00:06:30.000
For the forward direction,
what is the order?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.879
The overall order is two.
And so in terms of

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.720
molecularity,
what is it?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.639
Bimolecular.
For the reverse reaction,

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.160
the order is what?
One.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.079
And what is that called?
Unimolecular.

00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:02.000
Okay.
Let's look at Step 2.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.474
The rate for step two is what?
k two.

00:07:06.474 --> 00:07:10.824
Times?
It would be O two and N two O

00:07:10.824 --> 00:07:17.785
two, the concentration of each.

00:07:17.785 --> 00:07:24.000
Again, we can write them exactly
as written.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.862
Now we consider the rate of N
two O two formation,

00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:43.080
so the overall rate of NO two
formation from these two

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.866
steps.
And we can just use second

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:51.835
step, where NO two is
being formed.

00:07:51.835 --> 00:07:58.343
And so we can write this is
equal to that rate law times

00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:02.321
two.
Let me rewrite the rate law.

00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:07.461
And the two comes from the fact
that two NO two's are

00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.025
being formed.
Because two NO two's are being

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:15.917
formed, this concentration is
increasing at a different rate

00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:19.813
than the concentrations of these
are decreasing.

00:08:19.813 --> 00:08:24.621
The book is inconsistent with
whether it puts a two all the

00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:29.761
time, so I am not going to take
off if people forget to put the

00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:34.345
two in this --
-- because the book should be

00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:38.469
more consistent with that.
But, if you do see a two,

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:42.916
it will mean that you are
forming two of the products in

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.776
the reaction.
All right.

00:08:44.776 --> 00:08:48.819
Now we have written a rate.
We are not equal to our

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:53.266
experimental rate here because
there is an intermediate.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:57.309
This is an intermediate.
And an intermediate cannot

00:08:57.309 --> 00:09:02.000
appear in the overall rate law
for something.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.293
You are going to be spending a
lot of time getting rid of

00:09:09.293 --> 00:09:14.893
intermediates.
Let's now leave this here and

00:09:14.893 --> 00:09:19.320
try to get rid of our
intermediate.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.139
I am having trouble with papers
today.

00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:30.000
Now let's solve for the
intermediate.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.367
And we want to solve for this
intermediate in terms of things

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:40.108
that are not intermediates.
We want to solve for it in

00:09:40.108 --> 00:09:44.402
terms of reactants or products
or rate constants.

00:09:44.402 --> 00:09:48.696
We need to consider,
then, how this intermediate,

00:09:48.696 --> 00:09:53.079
N two O two,
is being formed and how this

00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:58.000
intermediate is being consumed
or decomposed.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.737
We want to figure out the net
formation of the intermediate.

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:11.359
And the net formation of the
intermediate is going to equal

00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:18.439
the rate at which it is formed.
It is being formed over here in

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:24.833
the forward direction of the
first step, so we will write

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:29.058
that down.
We consider how it is being

00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:33.187
formed.
It is being formed with the

00:10:33.187 --> 00:10:37.642
rate k one times the
concentration of NO squared,

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:42.502
so that is just the rate law
for the forward direction of the

00:10:42.502 --> 00:10:45.905
first step.
It is also

00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:50.684
being decomposed in the first
step in the reverse direction.

00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:55.544
It is being decomposed with the
rate of k minus one

00:10:55.544 --> 00:11:00.000
times the concentration of the
intermediate.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.809
That is just our rate law for
this reverse step of the first

00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:09.649
reaction.
And it is also being consumed.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:15.458
It is also being consumed in
the second step with a rate law

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:19.889
of k two times the
concentration of the

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:25.009
intermediate times the
concentration of O two.

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:32.000
That is just the rate law that
we wrote for this second step.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.641
It is being formed,
decomposed and consumed.

00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:40.721
The net formation equals the
rate at which it is formed minus

00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:45.971
the rate at which it decomposes
minus the rate at which it gets

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:49.104
consumed.
And now we can use something

00:11:49.104 --> 00:11:53.000
called the steady-state
approximation.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.750
In the steady-state
approximation,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.000
all it is saying is things are
in a steady state.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.724
That means that the net
formation of this intermediate

00:12:09.724 --> 00:12:14.692
is equal to zero,
or if it is in a steady state

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:20.631
that the rate at which it is
being formed is going to be

00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:25.707
equal to the rate at which it is
being consumed,

00:12:25.707 --> 00:12:31.000
either by the reverse,
Step 1, or Step 2.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.095
This rate is equal to this
rate.

00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:36.678
That means it is steady,
so it is in the steady state.

00:12:36.678 --> 00:12:40.396
The net formation is zero.
The rate at which it is being

00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:44.384
formed equals the two rates at
which it is being consumed or

00:12:44.384 --> 00:12:48.575
decomposed, the rate at which it
is decaying, are equal to each

00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:50.603
other.
That is the steady-state

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.969
approximation,
and it is a very good

00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:56.011
approximation.
And so you can use this for all

00:12:56.011 --> 00:13:00.000
of the mechanisms that you will
be writing.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.882
That allows us to set it equal
to zero, or we can rearrange

00:13:04.882 --> 00:13:08.670
these terms so that these two
are on one side,

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:13.301
and the rate at which it is
formed is on the other side.

00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:16.836
Let's do that.
And I am going to take these

00:13:16.836 --> 00:13:21.803
two and put them together and
also pull out the term for the

00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:26.012
concentration of the
intermediate because I want to

00:13:26.012 --> 00:13:30.053
solve for that term.
I am going to try to pull it

00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:34.983
out and solve for it.
If we rearrange this,

00:13:34.983 --> 00:13:38.856
then, we get that the
concentration of our

00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:42.540
intermediate,
you pull it out from those

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.925
terms, so that leaves k minus
one plus the other

00:13:47.925 --> 00:13:51.325
term k two times O two.

00:13:51.325 --> 00:13:55.671
Now I have just pulled this out
from these two,

00:13:55.671 --> 00:14:02.000
and I have moved these to the
same side of the equation.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.508
And so that is going to be
equal to k one times NO squared.

00:14:07.508 --> 00:14:11.663
This is the rate at which you

00:14:11.663 --> 00:14:17.462
are decaying your intermediate,
and this is the rate at which

00:14:17.462 --> 00:14:20.651
you are forming that
intermediate.

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:25.000
Now I can continue to solve for
this.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.239
The concentration of the
intermediate is going to be

00:14:29.239 --> 00:14:33.977
equal to k one NO squared over
((k minus one) plus (k two)

00:14:33.977 --> 00:14:36.721
times the concentration of O
two).

00:14:36.721 --> 00:14:41.709
Here is what the

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:44.286
intermediate,
then, is equal to.

00:14:44.286 --> 00:14:48.525
And now I can take this term
and go plug it back in.

00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:51.767
All right.
We can take the concentration

00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:56.589
and plug it back into here,
so that whole term that we just

00:14:56.589 --> 00:15:01.687
came up with.
And we will put it back into

00:15:01.687 --> 00:15:05.240
that equation.
Then, if we substitute,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.711
we get the rate of NO two
formation is going to be

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:16.375
equal to (two rate constant k
one, rate constant k two times

00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:21.272
NO squared times the
concentration of O two) over (k

00:15:21.272 --> 00:15:26.456
minus one plus k two times the
concentration of O two).

00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:38.199
But that is not consistent.

00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:45.071
We have NO squared
and two O two terms,

00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:49.928
whereas, in our observed
experimental law,

00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:53.720
there is only one term for O
two.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:16:00.000
That is not consistent,
so something is wrong.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.588
This is not consistent,
so there must be fast and slow

00:16:05.588 --> 00:16:08.962
steps.
If there are fast and slow

00:16:08.962 --> 00:16:15.394
steps, then we can simplify this
equation and make it like the

00:16:15.394 --> 00:16:20.561
experimental equation.
Now we can go over here and

00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:25.622
think about what would happen if
Step 1 was fast.

00:16:25.622 --> 00:16:31.000
It is a fast and it is a
reversible step.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.617
It is already written that it
is a reversible step,

00:16:35.617 --> 00:16:39.773
so it is reversible.
And Step 2 might be slow.

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:44.207
Now we can consider,
if we have a fast first step

00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:48.547
and slow second step,
what that would do to this

00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:53.812
equation and whether we could
then rearrange this equation

00:16:53.812 --> 00:17:00.000
such that it would be equal to
our experimental rate law.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.533
When we say something is slow,
we are going to introduce a new

00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:07.135
term.
And that the slowest step in a

00:17:07.135 --> 00:17:11.148
reaction mechanism is called the
rate determining step.

00:17:11.148 --> 00:17:15.385
And, for a rate determining
step, you can assume that that

00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:19.101
step is governing the overall
rate of the reaction.

00:17:19.101 --> 00:17:23.114
It is slow enough that the
rates of the other reactions

00:17:23.114 --> 00:17:26.756
don't really matter.
That is what rate determining

00:17:26.756 --> 00:17:29.209
means.
And let me just give you an

00:17:29.209 --> 00:17:33.000
example of a rate determining
step.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.136
After today's lecture,
you will be able to do all of

00:17:36.136 --> 00:17:39.826
the problems on Problem Set 10.
This is your last problem set

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:43.394
in 5.111, and so it would be
really great when that problem

00:17:43.394 --> 00:17:47.084
set is finished and turned in.
And so all through the rest of

00:17:47.084 --> 00:17:50.651
this lecture thinking about,
I can go out right after class

00:17:50.651 --> 00:17:54.157
and finish that problem set,
because you are very excited.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:57.785
And by the time it gets close
to the end, you see the end of

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:01.672
the handout coming up.
Your books are sort of packed,

00:18:01.672 --> 00:18:04.182
you are ready to go,
and then the minute it is

00:18:04.182 --> 00:18:07.639
finished, you are out the door.
And you are going to some place

00:18:07.639 --> 00:18:10.315
where you can sit down and
finish Problem Set 10.

00:18:10.315 --> 00:18:13.271
You are moving really fast.
You might even be running.

00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:16.561
You may be even jumping over
people in the infinite corridor

00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:18.791
to get to the library as fast as
you can.

00:18:18.791 --> 00:18:21.412
You get to the library and you
look for a table,

00:18:21.412 --> 00:18:23.921
but everyone else from 5.111 is
already there,

00:18:23.921 --> 00:18:27.211
and all the tables are filled.
You go to the first floor and

00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:31.839
the second floor and the third.
You go to the basement and in

00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:34.376
the stacks.
Every table is filled up with

00:18:34.376 --> 00:18:37.801
people doing Problem Set 10.
Then you have to leave the

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:39.640
library.
You think Building 2,

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.875
lots of small classrooms,
they cannot all be in use.

00:18:42.875 --> 00:18:46.363
You run over to Building 2,
but all those classrooms are

00:18:46.363 --> 00:18:49.344
filled with 5.111 students doing
Problem Set 10.

00:18:49.344 --> 00:18:53.023
And so eventually you get to
Building 4 and you find a free

00:18:53.023 --> 00:18:55.116
classroom.
The minute, the second,

00:18:55.116 --> 00:19:00.000
you find that free classroom
your books are out of your bag.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.111
They are out.
Your calculator.

00:19:02.111 --> 00:19:06.116
Your correct kind of approved
calculator is right there,

00:19:06.116 --> 00:19:10.048
and you are ready to go.
It takes you maybe two seconds

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:13.252
to get out 10-250,
and it takes you maybe two

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:17.038
seconds to pull out all your
books to be ready to go,

00:19:17.038 --> 00:19:21.334
but it takes you a half an hour
to find the table to do that

00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:24.466
problem set.
Overall, half an hour plus four

00:19:24.466 --> 00:19:28.470
seconds is a half an hour.
That was the rate determining

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.268
step.
In finishing Problem Set 10 was

00:19:32.268 --> 00:19:35.707
finding that table.
What you can do for these as

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:40.170
well, if we say there is a slow
step, you can assume that that

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.609
is rate-determining.
And you don't have to worry

00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:46.243
about how fast those other steps
are.

00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:49.463
It just depends on the rate of
the slow step.

00:19:49.463 --> 00:19:53.707
That is governing the overall
rate at which the reaction or

00:19:53.707 --> 00:19:57.365
the process happens.
That is rate-determining step.

00:19:57.365 --> 00:20:00.000
We can use that,
now.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.369
And we can use that and go back
and simplify the expression that

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:08.531
we solved for the intermediate.
Here we were solving for this

00:20:08.531 --> 00:20:12.485
expression, and we weren't
considering anything about fast

00:20:12.485 --> 00:20:16.369
and slow steps at this point.
And so this is the equation

00:20:16.369 --> 00:20:20.184
that you would get if there were
no fast and slow steps.

00:20:20.184 --> 00:20:24.138
And then we plugged it into
this and found that it was not

00:20:24.138 --> 00:20:26.982
consistent.
Now let's take a step back and

00:20:26.982 --> 00:20:31.144
go back here and think about
what this expression would be if

00:20:31.144 --> 00:20:36.000
the first step was fast,
and the second step was slow.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.025
Here, again,
I have just put it up on the

00:20:39.025 --> 00:20:43.789
screen what we had on the board.
We have this first step is fast

00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:47.042
and reversible,
and the second step is slow.

00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:51.352
Really, what we are talking
about here is we are comparing

00:20:51.352 --> 00:20:54.907
rates for the decomposition of
the intermediate,

00:20:54.907 --> 00:20:59.369
that is the reverse direction
of step one, with the rate for

00:20:59.369 --> 00:21:03.000
the consumption of the
intermediate.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.326
Which of these is faster?
Well, decomposition is faster

00:21:07.326 --> 00:21:11.893
because this is a fast step.
And the consumption in Step 2

00:21:11.893 --> 00:21:14.136
is slow.
What does that mean?

00:21:14.136 --> 00:21:18.142
Well, if we write it down,
then, if the rate of the

00:21:18.142 --> 00:21:21.347
decomposition,
this rate, the rate of the

00:21:21.347 --> 00:21:24.952
reverse reaction,
is faster, then this k minus

00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:30.000
one is a bigger number
than k two.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.783
The rate of consumption here is
slow.

00:21:32.783 --> 00:21:37.268
We are going to consider the
relative size of these numbers

00:21:37.268 --> 00:21:41.907
and how they fit in this term,
and you can drop things out by

00:21:41.907 --> 00:21:46.546
assuming that one thing is a lot
bigger than the other thing.

00:21:46.546 --> 00:21:49.561
If we do this then we are
saying, again,

00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:53.350
this is the same thing that was
on the last slide,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.371
that the rate of the
decomposition is faster than the

00:21:57.371 --> 00:22:01.382
rate of consumption.
i.e., Step 2 is slow,

00:22:01.382 --> 00:22:04.277
Step 1 is fast.
What you are saying is that k

00:22:04.277 --> 00:22:06.778
minus one is a bigger
number.

00:22:06.778 --> 00:22:10.530
That rate constant is a bigger
value than the k two

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.504
term.
And, in the bottom of the

00:22:12.504 --> 00:22:15.400
equation here,
in the bottom of this equation

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.493
for the intermediate,
we have a term k minus one

00:22:18.493 --> 00:22:22.705
and we have the term k
two times the concentration of O

00:22:22.705 --> 00:22:25.798
two.
And now, if you are saying this

00:22:25.798 --> 00:22:28.563
about the different rates of
this reaction,

00:22:28.563 --> 00:22:31.656
if you are saying this is fast
and that is slow,

00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:36.000
this is a big number,
that is a small number.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.632
If you have on the bottom here
a really big number plus a much

00:22:40.632 --> 00:22:44.810
smaller number in comparison,
this smaller number is not

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.240
adding much to the bigger
number.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.974
And we can just cancel that
term out.

00:22:49.974 --> 00:22:53.924
We can just say it is so much
smaller than the other,

00:22:53.924 --> 00:22:58.632
we are not going to worry about
it, and we are going to get rid

00:22:58.632 --> 00:23:02.500
of it.
Now our expression would look

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.431
like this.
The concentration of the

00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:10.517
intermediate is k one times NO
squared over k minus one.

00:23:10.517 --> 00:23:14.655
We can rearrange this and think

00:23:14.655 --> 00:23:19.827
about, does this look familiar
to any of you in terms of what

00:23:19.827 --> 00:23:23.879
we have seen before.
We can rearrange it to look

00:23:23.879 --> 00:23:26.637
like this.
And what is this term?

00:23:26.637 --> 00:23:32.032
What is this all equal to?
K, the equilibrium constant.

00:23:32.032 --> 00:23:36.024
It is equal to K one.
This is just an equilibrium

00:23:36.024 --> 00:23:38.854
expression.
And, if you go back and look

00:23:38.854 --> 00:23:42.991
over here, you will see that if
you are going to write the

00:23:42.991 --> 00:23:47.201
equilibrium expression for Step
1, products over reactants,

00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:51.120
that is what you would get.
And also, we saw last time,

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.750
that you can express
equilibrium constants in terms

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.327
of rate constants.
And the equilibrium constant

00:23:59.327 --> 00:24:04.232
for a reaction is going to be
equal to the rate constant for

00:24:04.232 --> 00:24:09.054
the forward reaction over the
rate constant for the reverse

00:24:09.054 --> 00:24:12.296
reaction.
And at equilibrium those rates

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:16.786
are equal to each other.
So this is just an equilibrium

00:24:16.786 --> 00:24:20.277
expression.
When we assumed Step 2 was slow

00:24:20.277 --> 00:24:23.935
and Step 1 was fast,
we can now solve for the

00:24:23.935 --> 00:24:28.092
intermediate in terms of an
equilibrium expression.

00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:32.000
Let's consider why this is
true.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.913
Okay.
When you have a fast first step

00:24:34.913 --> 00:24:39.365
followed by the slow step,
the first step is pretty much

00:24:39.365 --> 00:24:43.088
in equilibrium.
The first reversible step is in

00:24:43.088 --> 00:24:46.569
equilibrium.
And you can kind of think about

00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:51.182
it in terms of this diagram.
Here you have reactants going

00:24:51.182 --> 00:24:54.177
to intermediates,
and this is fast and

00:24:54.177 --> 00:24:56.767
reversible.
Then the second step,

00:24:56.767 --> 00:24:59.600
the consumption of the
intermediate,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.123
is slow going to products.
If this is really pretty slow

00:25:05.123 --> 00:25:09.224
and not much of the intermediate
is being siphoned off to

00:25:09.224 --> 00:25:13.324
product, more of it in fast
equilibrium is going back and

00:25:13.324 --> 00:25:17.132
forth with the reactant,
then that creates sort of an

00:25:17.132 --> 00:25:20.135
equilibrium expression.
It is not perfect.

00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:24.308
Some of it is being siphoned
off, but more or less you can

00:25:24.308 --> 00:25:28.263
consider this in equilibrium.
Again, if you have a fast

00:25:28.263 --> 00:25:32.217
reversible step followed by a
slow step, you can assume

00:25:32.217 --> 00:25:37.828
equilibrium conditions.
That is going to make your life

00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:43.577
easier in terms of solving these
expressions, because you can go

00:25:43.577 --> 00:25:47.958
right to writing an equilibrium
expression, then,

00:25:47.958 --> 00:25:52.064
for your intermediate.
Now, we can go back and

00:25:52.064 --> 00:25:54.711
substitute.
We have this term,

00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:59.000
now, for solving for our
intermediate.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.722
Or, you could write rate
constant k one over k minus one.

00:26:03.722 --> 00:26:07.243
Or, you could write big K,

00:26:07.243 --> 00:26:10.421
the equilibrium constant 
K one.

00:26:10.421 --> 00:26:14.027
These are equal to the
concentration of the

00:26:14.027 --> 00:26:17.548
intermediate.
We can put this term back in

00:26:17.548 --> 00:26:19.695
here now.
This was, again,

00:26:19.695 --> 00:26:24.418
what we wrote in the very
beginning for the formation of

00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:28.368
NO two.
And we can substitute that back

00:26:28.368 --> 00:26:32.079
in.
And we can have it in terms of

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:36.237
the rate constants or using an
equilibrium constant in there.

00:26:36.237 --> 00:26:39.495
Those would be equivalent.
And all of these k's,

00:26:39.495 --> 00:26:42.960
in terms of the experiment,
are going to be grouped

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.386
together as a k observed.

00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:49.475
You usually are not going to
measure all the individual rate

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:52.316
constants.
You are just going to have some

00:26:52.316 --> 00:26:56.336
overall rate constant that you
do measure, an observed rate

00:26:56.336 --> 00:27:00.390
constant.
And so if you write then either

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:05.248
of these in that form where all
your k's just get grouped into k

00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:08.718
observed,
then you see that that is

00:27:08.718 --> 00:27:11.571
consistent with the experimental
data.

00:27:11.571 --> 00:27:15.503
That mechanism works.
A mechanism works that has two

00:27:15.503 --> 00:27:20.207
steps, the first step being fast
and reversible and the second

00:27:20.207 --> 00:27:23.522
step being slow.
We don't know for sure that

00:27:23.522 --> 00:27:27.455
that is the mechanism,
but it is consistent with the

00:27:27.455 --> 00:27:32.242
experimental data.
Let's look at another example

00:27:32.242 --> 00:27:34.794
now.
We are going to look at three

00:27:34.794 --> 00:27:38.197
different examples.
Here, there is a proposed

00:27:38.197 --> 00:27:42.837
mechanism that is very similar
to the one that we just looked

00:27:42.837 --> 00:27:45.389
at.
Now, we are going to try to do

00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:49.874
this problem in a more efficient
way than we did last time,

00:27:49.874 --> 00:27:54.592
which is kind of work through
it the way you will when you are

00:27:54.592 --> 00:27:57.066
doing Problem Set 10 really
fast.

00:27:57.066 --> 00:28:01.201
All right.
We have a two-step mechanism,

00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:05.377
one that is fast and reversible
and a step that is slow.

00:28:05.377 --> 00:28:10.008
The first thing you want to do
is write the rate laws for each

00:28:10.008 --> 00:28:12.817
of the individual steps.
For this one,

00:28:12.817 --> 00:28:16.234
what is the rate law for the
forward reaction?

00:28:16.234 --> 00:28:18.739
k one times O three.

00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:22.839
That is
for the forward reaction.

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:27.091
For the reverse reaction,
we have k minus one times O two

00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:30.583
times the concentration of this
intermediate O.

00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:36.715
Let's look at the second one.

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:42.333
Here, we have the rate k two
times the intermediate O times O

00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:47.857
three.
Now, the rate is going to be

00:28:47.857 --> 00:28:53.288
determined by this slow step.
And we can write the equation

00:28:53.288 --> 00:28:59.000
for the formation of O two
from this last step.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.458
And we could do that whether it
was the slow step or not.

00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:05.978
We did that before as well.
If we write the formation of O

00:29:05.978 --> 00:29:09.621
two, it is being formed
in the last step from O and O

00:29:09.621 --> 00:29:12.091
three.
We are using this rate law.

00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:14.685
And, again, we have a two in
there because,

00:29:14.685 --> 00:29:17.772
like the last example,
two things are being formed.

00:29:17.772 --> 00:29:20.860
We have two molecules of O two
being formed.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.689
The rate of formation of O two
is two times k two

00:29:24.689 --> 00:29:27.406
times this intermediate times O
three.

00:29:27.406 --> 00:29:31.966
If there is no intermediate in

00:29:31.966 --> 00:29:34.063
the expression,
we would be done,

00:29:34.063 --> 00:29:38.061
but there pretty much always is
going to be an intermediate in

00:29:38.061 --> 00:29:40.682
the expression.
We need to solve for that

00:29:40.682 --> 00:29:42.911
intermediate.
O is an intermediate,

00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:46.122
so you need to solve for it in
terms of reactants,

00:29:46.122 --> 00:29:49.858
products and rate constants.
Again, here we have this step

00:29:49.858 --> 00:29:52.807
that we saw before.
The first step is fast and

00:29:52.807 --> 00:29:56.608
reversible, the second step is
slow, and so you can assume,

00:29:56.608 --> 00:30:01.000
approximate that the first step
is in equilibrium.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.705
And so you can solve for the
intermediate in terms of an

00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:09.640
equilibrium expression.
What is the equilibrium

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.917
expression for the first step?
K would be equal to?

00:30:13.917 --> 00:30:18.964
I will just put it down here.
You can write it in terms of k

00:30:18.964 --> 00:30:22.643
one over k minus,
products,

00:30:22.643 --> 00:30:25.123
O two times O,
over reactants,

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:28.289
O three.

00:30:28.289 --> 00:30:31.958
That is just our equilibrium

00:30:31.958 --> 00:30:34.897
expression.
We have it in terms of the rate

00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:38.954
constants and in terms of this
expression for products over

00:30:38.954 --> 00:30:41.613
reactants.
And now we can take this and

00:30:41.613 --> 00:30:44.551
rearrange it to solve for our
intermediate.

00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:48.049
We would have this,
we would bring the O two 

00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:51.477
down to the other side,
we would bring the O three

00:30:51.477 --> 00:30:54.345
up here,
which leaves us with k one

00:30:54.345 --> 00:30:58.473
times the concentration of ozone
over (k minus one times the

00:30:58.473 --> 00:31:02.111
concentration of oxygen gas).

00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:05.642
That was a lot simpler than

00:31:05.642 --> 00:31:08.501
what we did over here.
And so you can feel free,

00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:11.664
if you are told there is a slow
step and a fast step,

00:31:11.664 --> 00:31:14.766
just jump right to that and
solve it in terms of the

00:31:14.766 --> 00:31:17.807
equilibrium expression.
It will save you some time.

00:31:17.807 --> 00:31:21.396
You should come up with the
same answer if you do it the way

00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:23.343
that we did it in the first
step.

00:31:23.343 --> 00:31:26.871
And sometimes you will have to
because you won't know about

00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:31.179
fast and slow steps.
Now we can take this term and

00:31:31.179 --> 00:31:35.840
substitute it back into the rate
law for the formation of O two

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.847
gas.
And so we had two k two times

00:31:38.847 --> 00:31:43.507
this intermediate times O three.

00:31:43.507 --> 00:31:46.514
We put this term in for our
intermediate,

00:31:46.514 --> 00:31:50.724
and we get two times k two
times k one ozone squared over

00:31:50.724 --> 00:31:55.009
(k minus one times O two).

00:31:55.009 --> 00:31:58.316
And so this would be the rate

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:02.000
law for this particular
mechanism.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.930
If that is the rate law for
that mechanism,

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.418
you could think about,
what are the orders in this,

00:32:08.418 --> 00:32:12.116
and could you experimentally go
back and look and say,

00:32:12.116 --> 00:32:15.116
okay, is that consistent with
the mechanism?

00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:18.744
Let's take a look at what we
would predict from this.

00:32:18.744 --> 00:32:23.139
First, we could also write this
in terms of k observed and group

00:32:23.139 --> 00:32:27.395
all the k constants together for
k observed, and that is times

00:32:27.395 --> 00:32:32.000
ozone to the two and O two.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.960
If we look at this,
if we were going to design

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:41.152
experiments for someone to do,
what would we predict to sort

00:32:41.152 --> 00:32:45.640
of prove that that is,
in fact, a correct mechanism?

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.248
What is the order,
based on this rate law,

00:32:49.248 --> 00:32:53.559
in terms of the concentration
of O three?

00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:56.375
Two.
If someone went into the lab

00:32:56.375 --> 00:33:01.392
and doubled the concentration of
O three, what should they

00:33:01.392 --> 00:33:07.470
observe happen to the rate?
They should observe four times

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.764
the rate.
What is the order in terms of O

00:33:10.764 --> 00:33:12.741
two?
What is it?

00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:15.623
Minus one, right.
If you doubled the

00:33:15.623 --> 00:33:20.811
concentration of O two,
what should happen to the rate,

00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:23.447
keeping everything else the
same?

00:33:23.447 --> 00:33:27.400
It should be half.
This is the kind of thing that

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:33.000
can be experimentally tested,
whether it is consistent.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.446
And what is the overall order,
then, of this reaction?

00:33:38.446 --> 00:33:42.762
It would be one.
And so if you doubled both

00:33:42.762 --> 00:33:47.901
things, what should you observe
happen to the rate?

00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:53.245
Yeah, it should double.
You could go back and sort of

00:33:53.245 --> 00:33:54.786
test this.
Okay.

00:33:54.786 --> 00:34:01.376
Let's look at one more example.
This time, we are not going to

00:34:01.376 --> 00:34:05.732
make a proposal ahead of time
about fast and slow steps,

00:34:05.732 --> 00:34:10.247
but we are going to work out
what the overall rate law for

00:34:10.247 --> 00:34:14.603
this is without fast and slow
steps and then go back and

00:34:14.603 --> 00:34:17.534
consider which step,
or any, are slow.

00:34:17.534 --> 00:34:22.445
Now we are going to go through
the long way and do this problem

00:34:22.445 --> 00:34:27.514
and then think about what we can
learn from it in terms of we are

00:34:27.514 --> 00:34:33.175
given an experimental rate law.
And once we see how this works

00:34:33.175 --> 00:34:37.017
out, we can think about whether
a step is slow or not.

00:34:37.017 --> 00:34:41.150
First we start the same way,
and we are going to write the

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:44.195
rate laws for each of the
individual steps.

00:34:44.195 --> 00:34:46.804
Again, they are elementary
reactions.

00:34:46.804 --> 00:34:50.067
Steps in a mechanism are
elementary reactions.

00:34:50.067 --> 00:34:53.764
We can write the rate law
exactly as the equation is

00:34:53.764 --> 00:34:56.375
written.
What is the rate law for the

00:34:56.375 --> 00:35:00.000
forward direction,
here, of Step 1?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.406
First we have k one times NO
concentration times Br two

00:35:06.406 --> 00:35:11.271
concentration.

00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:15.898
That is the forward.
And in the reverse,

00:35:15.898 --> 00:35:22.898
we have rate constant k minus
one times NOBr two.

00:35:22.898 --> 00:35:26.338
For step two,

00:35:26.338 --> 00:35:31.440
we have rate constant k two
times NO.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.031
There you go.

00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:39.362
So, you know how to do these.
We have that.

00:35:39.362 --> 00:35:43.963
Now we are going to be looking
for the overall formation of

00:35:43.963 --> 00:35:48.325
NOBr, and so we can write this
just using the last step.

00:35:48.325 --> 00:35:52.291
We can use that rate expression
for that last step.

00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:56.178
The formation of this.
And we are putting a two in

00:35:56.178 --> 00:35:59.985
because, once again,
there are two of these being

00:35:59.985 --> 00:36:04.795
formed in that last step.
Again, we could just use the

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:06.912
rate expression for the last
step.

00:36:06.912 --> 00:36:10.567
And there is a two in there,
because two are being formed.

00:36:10.567 --> 00:36:12.940
That is the rate of formation
of NOBr.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.532
Now, we have an intermediate.
This is being formed and is

00:36:16.532 --> 00:36:19.225
being consumed,
so we need to solve for the

00:36:19.225 --> 00:36:21.277
intermediate.
There cannot be any

00:36:21.277 --> 00:36:24.933
intermediates in our overall
expression, so we need to get

00:36:24.933 --> 00:36:27.562
rid of that.
So, it is intermediate and we

00:36:27.562 --> 00:36:31.871
need to solve for it.
Now, we cannot go and just use

00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:35.614
the equilibrium expression for
the top, because we don't know

00:36:35.614 --> 00:36:37.734
anything about fast and slow
steps.

00:36:37.734 --> 00:36:41.228
We don't know that that is
going to be a good assumption.

00:36:41.228 --> 00:36:44.846
Let's just write it out the
long way and then come back and

00:36:44.846 --> 00:36:48.214
consider whether that is
consistent with the experiment

00:36:48.214 --> 00:36:50.397
or we have to do some
modifications.

00:36:50.397 --> 00:36:53.828
We are going to solve for this
in terms of reactants and

00:36:53.828 --> 00:36:56.822
products and k's.
Now we want to consider the net

00:36:56.822 --> 00:37:00.003
formation or the change in the
concentration of this

00:37:00.003 --> 00:37:04.108
intermediate.
The intermediate is being

00:37:04.108 --> 00:37:08.662
formed in the first step,
so we can write down the rate

00:37:08.662 --> 00:37:12.963
expression for how it is formed,
which is just this,

00:37:12.963 --> 00:37:17.349
k one times NO times Br two.

00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:22.409
This is how it is being formed.
It is decaying in this second

00:37:22.409 --> 00:37:26.626
step, in the backwards step,
so we can put that in.

00:37:26.626 --> 00:37:30.000
We have a minus sign here,
--

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.057
-- because it is going away by
the rate expression of k minus

00:37:34.057 --> 00:37:37.236
one times the concentration of
the intermediate,

00:37:37.236 --> 00:37:40.483
and it is also being consumed
in the second step.

00:37:40.483 --> 00:37:44.473
It is being used up in that
second step, so we will put that

00:37:44.473 --> 00:37:47.314
term in here.
That is minus k two times the

00:37:47.314 --> 00:37:50.695
concentration of the
intermediate times NO.

00:37:50.695 --> 00:37:53.806
It is being formed in one step,

00:37:53.806 --> 00:37:58.000
and it is being consumed in two
different steps.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.358
Now we can use the steady state
approximation,

00:38:01.358 --> 00:38:04.791
which says that the overall net
change is zero.

00:38:04.791 --> 00:38:07.328
We can set this term equal to
zero.

00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:09.865
It is a steady state
approximation.

00:38:09.865 --> 00:38:13.671
That is the same as saying that
the rate at which an

00:38:13.671 --> 00:38:17.776
intermediate is formed is equal
to the rate at which the

00:38:17.776 --> 00:38:21.656
intermediate goes away.
We can rearrange these terms,

00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:26.059
bring these on one side of the
equation and have this one on

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:28.914
the other.
Rearranging,

00:38:28.914 --> 00:38:33.336
then, we moved these onto one
side and the formation to the

00:38:33.336 --> 00:38:36.385
other side.
Now, we can pull out the term

00:38:36.385 --> 00:38:39.282
for our intermediate.
Take it out here,

00:38:39.282 --> 00:38:41.798
that leaves k minus one.

00:38:41.798 --> 00:38:45.228
Take it out here,
that leaves k two and

00:38:45.228 --> 00:38:47.439
NO.
Again, this is the rate at

00:38:47.439 --> 00:38:51.479
which it is being formed.
And now we can solve for the

00:38:51.479 --> 00:38:54.071
intermediate.
When we solve for the

00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:57.426
intermediate,
we take this term and divide it

00:38:57.426 --> 00:39:02.000
by that term,
and we get this expression.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.880
That is solving for the
intermediate.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.519
The next step is to take that
intermediate and plug it back

00:39:09.519 --> 00:39:14.320
into the initial equation that
we had, the formation of NOBr,

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.320
and that was two times k two
times the intermediate

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.840
concentration times NO.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.480
Now we take this whole term and
put it back into this term,

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.000
and we get this expression
here.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.369
All right.
This expression now is not

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:35.133
consistent with this
experimental rate law,

00:39:35.133 --> 00:39:37.503
so there must be fast and slow
steps.

00:39:37.503 --> 00:39:41.123
Now, let's consider what is
going to happen if the first

00:39:41.123 --> 00:39:43.755
step is slow and the second step
is fast.

00:39:43.755 --> 00:39:47.704
Again, you are considering what
is happening on the bottom of

00:39:47.704 --> 00:39:49.745
this expression.
You are asking,

00:39:49.745 --> 00:39:53.628
how does k minus one 
compare to this k two NO 

00:39:53.628 --> 00:39:56.129
term.
And so if you say that the

00:39:56.129 --> 00:39:59.288
first step is slow,
then k minus one is

00:39:59.288 --> 00:40:02.977
small.
If the second step is fast,

00:40:02.977 --> 00:40:06.492
that means k two NO
is a bigger term.

00:40:06.492 --> 00:40:10.373
If this second step is fast,
the rate constant for the

00:40:10.373 --> 00:40:14.767
second step is a bigger number
than the rate constant for the

00:40:14.767 --> 00:40:17.257
first step.
And so what you can do,

00:40:17.257 --> 00:40:21.065
then, is you can say,
okay, that is small compared to

00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:25.166
this, so we drop out that term.
If we drop out that term,

00:40:25.166 --> 00:40:30.000
can we cancel anything else?
What else can we cancel?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.014
We can cancel k two.
What else?

00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:35.622
We can cancel out one of the
NOs.

00:40:35.622 --> 00:40:39.207
And that leaves us with this
expression here.

00:40:39.207 --> 00:40:44.177
There is the expression again,
two times k one NOBr two.

00:40:44.177 --> 00:40:47.274
And that can be written as k

00:40:47.274 --> 00:40:50.370
observed.
And, look at that,

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.874
it is consistent with the
experimental rate.

00:40:53.874 --> 00:40:58.762
Now let's just check the other
way to make sure one should be

00:40:58.762 --> 00:41:03.000
right and one shouldn't be right
---

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.867
That we can get the answer if
we go the other way around.

00:41:06.867 --> 00:41:09.491
This is consistent with the
experiment.

00:41:09.491 --> 00:41:12.046
And the overall number of this
is two.

00:41:12.046 --> 00:41:14.739
All right.
Now, let's look the other way

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:17.225
around.
If the first step is fast and

00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:20.884
the second step was slow,
that would mean that k minus

00:41:20.884 --> 00:41:24.751
one would be a lot
bigger than the k two 

00:41:24.751 --> 00:41:26.616
term.
k minus one,

00:41:26.616 --> 00:41:30.000
rate constant for the first
step.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.511
k two,
rate constant for the second

00:41:33.511 --> 00:41:34.367
step.
Fast.

00:41:34.367 --> 00:41:38.220
Bigger than this.
And so then we can take this

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.389
term out.
Can we cancel anything else?

00:41:41.389 --> 00:41:44.386
No, you cannot cancel anything
else.

00:41:44.386 --> 00:41:48.582
This is the expression.
We can put that down here.

00:41:48.582 --> 00:41:51.837
We can group the k terms to k
observed.

00:41:51.837 --> 00:41:57.060
And so this is not consistent
with the experiment that you had

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.000
before.
That way doesn't work.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.494
You can write out the whole
thing and then think about

00:42:05.494 --> 00:42:08.547
whether they are fast and slow
steps.

00:42:08.547 --> 00:42:13.550
Again, you will be asking the
question, which of these terms

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.960
is bigger than the other term?
What is the fast step?

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.539
How does k minus one
compare to k two?

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:25.168
You can make the
simplification.

00:42:25.168 --> 00:42:27.966
And only one should be
consistent.

00:42:27.966 --> 00:42:30.849
One mechanism should be
consistent.

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:33.902
The other one should be
inconsistent.

00:42:33.902 --> 00:42:36.235
Okay.
Now you can do Problem Set 10.
