00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.130
So this is your final project for the class.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.180
And judging by the looks of it, your resume should be just about done.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.350
Great job.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.970
But, before we can let you off the hook,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.450
remember that we've learned quite a bit about objects and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.280
the way that they can encapsulate information and related functions.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.790
This is a two-part final project.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.930
In the first part, take the display functions that you wrote and

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.780
encapsulate them within their respective display, work and education objects.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.970
&gt;&gt; The second part of this project is to make the page your own.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.950
You can add whatever you want to show how truly awesome you are.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.900
In the Instructor's Notes, we've added links to a couple of

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.120
cool JavaScript libraries to do interactive graphics and charts.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.040
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.140
There are thousands of awesome JavaScript libraries out there, and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.700
most of them are really simple to include in your project.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.633
Go the extra mile, and

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.690
make your project really stand out by taking advantage of any one of them.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.327
Good luck.
