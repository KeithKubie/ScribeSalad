[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:04.371
SHOW".

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:05.405
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.541
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE'RE BACK.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:08.942
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.100
OUR GUEST TONIGHT OH, SHE PUTS
THE HUFF IN HUFFPO.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.260
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON WILL BE OUR
GUEST TONIGHT.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.295
BUT FIRST, FOR WEEKS THE BIG
STORY HAS BEEN THE MISSING

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.269
MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT. TODAY
SATELLITE DATA SEEMS TO

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.200
HAVE CONFIRMED THE WORST. I
THINK WE ALL FEARED THIS STORY

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.900
WOULD END IN TRAGEDY, AND SO
EARLY ON WE TURNED TO THE NEWS

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.840
MEDIA FOR A SENSE OF SOBER
CLARITY.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.742
&gt;&gt; AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE LOST CONTACT

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.630
WITH A JUMBO JET CARRYING 239
PEOPLE.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.543
WE'RE OF COURSE DOING ALL
WE CAN TO GET AS MANY DETAILS AS

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:42.703
POSSIBLE FROM OUR SOURCES
AROUND THE REGIONS AND THE
WORLD.

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:47.380
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS ACCURATE AND
HUMBLE ASSESSMENT FROM CNN UNTIL

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:52.986
THEY REALIZED OH, (bleep) WE
HAVE 23 HOURS AND 59 MINUTES

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.021
LEFT TO FILL.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:01:00.928
[ LAUGHTER ]
(bleep) IT LET'S GO NUTS.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:01.895
AND THEY DID.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.733
WITH EVERYTHING IN
THEIR BAG OF TRICKS.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.235
GIANT FLOOR MAPS.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.070
BIG FAKE AIRPLANES.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.740
LITTLE FAKE AIRPLANES.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:14.508
HOLOGRAPHIC AIRPLANES.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.110
NO AIRPLANE DETAIL LEFT
UNSPOKEN.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:23.083
&gt;&gt; A PLANE LIKE THIS IS AROUND
61, 62 METERS END TO END.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.351
61-62 SIDE TO SIDE.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.187
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ARE TELLING THEM
WHAT A PLANE LOOKS LIKE?

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:32.993
[LAUGHTER]
DID YOU FORGET WHO WATCHES CNN?

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:38.098
YOU COULD TELL 90% OF YOUR
VIEWERS LOOK OUT THE AIRPORT

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.933
WINDOW AT THE PLANE THEY ARE
ABOUT TO GET ON.

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.703
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT, OF COURSE --

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:53.647
[ APPLAUSE ]
THERE'S A SAYING CNN IS POPULAR

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.115
AT AIRPORTS.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.718
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE MAN DOES NOT LIVE BY
HOLOGRAM

00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:58.418
ALONE. GIVE ME A SIX BOX,
FLANK IT, NOW STUPID ME.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:04.324
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE ASKING ABOUT BLACK

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:08.161
HOLES AND ON AND ON AND ON AND
ALL OF THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:11.331
NOHA SAYS WHAT ELSE CAN YOU
THINK? BLACK HOLE? BERMUDA

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.267
TRIANGLE? AND THEN DEJI SAYS
IT'S JUST LIKE THE MOVIE LOST.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.272
I KNOW IT'S PREPOSTEROUS BUT IS
IT PREPOSTEROUS, DO YOU THINK,

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:19.072
MARY?

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:27.381
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; Jon: DON'T ANSWER, MARY

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.382
IT'S A TRAP.

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:33.654
[ LAUGHTER ] SOME SORT OF
WEIRD BERMUDA TRIANGLE

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:36.757
OF LOGIC WHERE QUESTIONS ARE
ANSWERED BEFORE THEY ARE ASKED.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.593
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; A SMALL BLACK HOLE WOULD SUCK

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.128
IN OUR ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.130
SO WE KNOW IT'S NOT THAT.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:47.301
THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE IS OFTEN
WEATHER AND LOST IS A TV SHOW.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:51.505
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL --

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:57.244
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- I KNOW IT'S A TV SHOW BUT IS

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:57.911
IT, MARY?

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:01.048
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK AT ME, MARY.

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:02.549
MARY, LOOK AT ME!

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:05.152
[LAUGHTER]
IS IT?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.856
[LAUGHTER]
YOU HAVE TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.160
DOWN TO THE STUDIO, MARY, LEVEL
WITH ME, MARY.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:18.465
[ LAUGHTER ]
WOW, DID THAT LOWER THE BAR,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.132
CNN.

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.502
BUT I THINK YOU CAN GO LOWER.

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:25.138
&gt;&gt; INVESTIGATORS SOMETIMES USE
PSYCHICS.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:29.877
WHY HASN'T ANYONE CONSIDERED THE
SERVICES OF A CREDIBLE PSYCHIC

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.513
SPECIALIZING IN MISSING PERSONS?

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.848
IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE BUT THEY
HAVE BEEN USED BEFORE.

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:40.254
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, WHILE WE'RE AT
IT WHY NOT USE THAT OCTOPUS THAT

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.623
ALWAYS PREDICTS THE WORLD CUP
VICTOR?

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:48.095
WHY DON'T WE STRAP SOME WINGS TO
WOLF BLITZER AND LET HIM LOOSE

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:51.832
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO CATCH A
PLANE YOU MUST BECOME A PLANE.

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:54.301
[LAUGHTER]
CNN'S MISSING AIRLINE OBSESSION

00:03:54.334 --> 00:04:01.742
NOT ONLY DOUBLED THEIR PRIMETIME
RATINGS IT ITSELF BECAME NEWS

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:08.348
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING LESS
LIKELY THAN AN AIRPLANE

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:12.486
DISAPPEARING OUT OF THE SKY
IS CNN'S RATINGS DOUBLING.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.487
&gt;&gt; SPECULATION HAS BEEN
REPLACING HARD FACTS IN NEWS

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.821
COVERAGE EARLIER THIS
WEEK CNN ANCHOR DON LEMON

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.157
BROUGHT UP THE THEORY SOMETHING
QUOTE SUPERNATURAL

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.292
COULD BE AT PLAY.

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.761
&gt;&gt; THE NETWORK IS IN DIRE
RATINGS TROUBLE.

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:23.330
THEY GET A PULSE.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:24.565
OKAY.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.334
SO THE EXECUTIVES ORDER YOU GUYS
HAVE TO DO THIS WALL TO WALL.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:37.244
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL
O'REILLY OR FOX'S COVERAGE OF

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.613
CNN'S OVER COVERAGE WILL BE
COVERED -- BY CNN. NEWS LOOP!

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.282
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF BILL
O'REILLY SPEAKING WAY HE

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:43.417
DID?
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE IS NERVOUS BECAUSE

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.587
HE LOST IN THE DEMO THE
YOUNGER VIEWERSHIP THREE NIGHTS

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.754
IN A ROW LAST WEEK
AND HE STARTED GETTING NERVOUS.

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.191
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE ALL KNOW MOST OF
O'REILLY'S YOUNGER VIEWERS ARE

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:53.694
COMING INTO THE ROOM TO MAKE
SURE THEIR GRANDPARENTS ARE

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:54.895
STILL BREATHING.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:59.700
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T --

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:00.834
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:04.137
I THINK IT DOESN'T COUNT, ONCE
THEY PUT THEIR HAND ON THE

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:04.238
CHEST, DOES THAT COUNT?
