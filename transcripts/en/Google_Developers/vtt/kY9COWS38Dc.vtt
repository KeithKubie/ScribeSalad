I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.630
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.380
If you haven't heard,
Google I/O this year

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.740
is mid-May, right here, in
Mountain View, California.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.140

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150
Last week, we hosted the first
annual TensorFlow Developer

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.550
Summit where we
announced TensorFlow 1.0.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.509
It's faster, more flexible, and
more production ready than ever

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.410
before.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.910
For all the details
for this release

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.270
as well as videos of all the
sessions from the Dev Summit,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.689
please follow the link
in the description below.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.730
And while we're on the
topic of machine learning,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.914
you may want to check
out TensorFlow debugger.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.080
It's a tool that makes
debugging of machine learning

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.360
models in TensorFlow easier.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.640
Get started by following
the link to the post.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.490
We're rolling out
more custom styling

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.350
and data object
association features

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.600
in the Google Maps Android
API to further help

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.324
you customize your maps.

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:03.740
Head on over to the post to
learn about styling and custom

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.680
data for polylines and polygons.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.170
Also, you may have noticed
our Maps API tutorials

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.050
have a new look with complete
step-by-step instructions

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.960
for the most common use
cases and code up front.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.380
Please let us know what
you think on the post.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.180
When building
cloud applications,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.370
database administrators
and developers

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.680
have been forced to choose
between traditional database

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.600
that guarantee transactional
consistency or NoSQL databases

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.950
that offer simple horizontal
scaling and data distribution.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.340
Cloud Spanner offers both of
these critical capabilities

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.590
in a single
fully-managed service.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.870
Get started on the post.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.330
Oh, and one more thing
on Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.200
NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs
are now in public beta.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.850
You can now spin up
NVIDIA GPU-based VMs

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760
in three GCP regions.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.590
