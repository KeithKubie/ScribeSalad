00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:04.068
(exciting instrumental music)

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.530
- We can never leave something on exhibit,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.746
one particular item on
exhibit, for too long

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:21.144
because especially in clothing

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:24.800
there are certain dyes that
are very sensitive to light.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.210
So even if it's on display

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.710
for a very brief time it could fade.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.790
Sunlight is the most harmful, obviously.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.751
I mean we know that the
sun dries things out,

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:39.751
makes them, fades them brittle;
think of autumn leaves.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.170
But even artificial
lighting, again, over time

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.940
will have that cumulative
effect of fading,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.773
and in some cases drying
out particular materials

00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:53.373
like fiber and fabric.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.313
In our galleries lighting
levels are as low as possible,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.200
but high enough we hope so that visitors

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.300
can clearly see the detail.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.410
You wonder, well why
can't that be on exhibit

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.553
for all the time because it
would be wonderful for visitors

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:14.900
to be able to see, and we agree with that,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.410
because that's why people are coming here

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.340
to see the real thing.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.100
But if you think of it
in the bigger picture

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.740
that even though the Kennedy presidency

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.393
was only 50 years ago,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.310
and it's important to tell that story,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850
it's gonna be important to
tell it 100 years from now,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.773
200 years from now, 300 years from now.
