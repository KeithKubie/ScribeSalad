00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.340
Machiavelli was a 16th century Florentine political thinker

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.700
with powerful advice for nice people who don't get very far.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.780
His thought pivots around a central , uncomfortable observation:

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.100
that the "wicked" tend to win;

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.620
and they do so because they have a huge advantage over the "good":

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.980
they are willing to act with the darkest ingenuity and cunning to further their cause.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.860
They are not held back by those rigid opponents of change: principles.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.660
They will be prepared to outright lie, twist facts, threaten, get violent.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.860
They will also, when the situation demands it, know how to seductively deceive, use charm and honeyed words, bedazzle and distract.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.460
And in this way they conquer the world.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.540
It's routinely assumed that a large part of what it means to be a good person is that one acts well.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.580
One doesn't only have good ends;

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.860
one is committed to good means.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.460
So, if one wants a more serious world, one needs to win people over through serious argument, not click bait.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.860
If one wants a fairer world, one has to

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.380
judiciously and gently try to persuade the agents of injustice to surrender willingly, not through intimidation.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.740
And if one wants people to be kind, one must show kindness to one's enemies, not ruthlessness.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740
It sounds splendid.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.940
But Machiavelli couldn't overlook an incontrovertible problem: it doesn't work.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.300
As he looked back over the history of Florence and the Italian states more generally,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.340
he observed that nice princes, statesmen, and merchants always come unstuck.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.580
That's why he wrote the book for which we know him today: "The Prince",

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.460
a short, dazzling manual of advice for well disposed princes on how not to finish last.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.060
And the answer, in short, is to be as nice as one wished, but never to be overly devoted to acting nicely,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.820
and indeed to know how to borrow, when need be, every single trick employed by the most cynical,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.660
dastardly, unscrupulous, and nastiest people who have ever lived.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.100
Machiavelli knew where our counterproductive obsession with acting nicely originated.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.940
The West was brought up on the Christian story of Jesus of Nazareth,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.540
the very nice man from Galilee who always treated people well and wounded up as the king of kings and the ruler of eternity.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.940
But Machiavelli pointed out one inconvenient detail to this sentimental tale of the triumph of goodness through meekness:

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.580
from the practical perspective Jesus' life was an outright disaster.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.460
This gentle soul was trampled upon and humiliated, disregarded, and mocked,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.900
judged in his lifetime and outside of any divine assistance, he was one of history's greatest losers.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.380
The clue to being effective lies in overcoming all vestiges of this story.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.300
"The Prince" was not, as is often thought, a guide to being a tyrant;

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.260
it's a guide about what nice people should learn from tyrants.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.380
It's a book about how to be effective-not just good.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.860
It's a book haunted by examples of the impotence of the pure.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.300
The admirable prince- and today we might add CEO, political activist, or thinker-

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.300
should learn every lesson from the slickest and most devious operators around.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.860
They should know how to scare and intimidate, cajole, and bully, entrap, and beguile.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.540
The good politician needs to learn from the bad one, the earnest entrepreneur-from the slick one.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.540
We are all, ultimately, the sum of what we achieve, not, what we intend.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.060
If we care about wisdom, kindness, seriousness, and virtue,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.300
but only ever act wisely, kindly, seriously, and virtuously, we will, Machiavelli warns us, get nowhere.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.460
We need to learn lessons from an unexpected source: those we temperamentally most despise.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.700
They have the most to teach us about how to bring about the reality we yearn for, but, that they are fighting against.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.580
We need weapons of similar grade steel to theirs.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.940
Ultimately, we should care more about being effective than about being nobly intentioned.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.340
It's now enough to dream well. The true measure is what we achieve.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.220
The purpose is to change the world for the better, not reside in the quiet comforts of good intentions and a warm heart.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.260
All this Machiavelli knew. He disturbs us for good reason because he probes us where we are at our most self serving.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.900
We tell ourselves we didn't get there because we're a little too pure, good, and kind.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:56.140
Machiavelli bracingly informs us we are stuck because we have been too short sighted to learn from those who really know: our enemies.
