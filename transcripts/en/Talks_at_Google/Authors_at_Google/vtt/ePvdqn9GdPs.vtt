00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.790
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Jeff Potter is one of us.
He's a geek. He studied Computer Science at

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.959
Brown, done his time in a cube at a start-up.
He's organized BarCamp, a Boston-based technology

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.590
unconference, for and by attendees. And today,
we've asked him to come talk about his other

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.789
geek hobby, food.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.509
Jeff's book, "Cooking For Geeks," which some
of you might have found on your chairs, sprung

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.400
from his passion for food. With no formal
culinary training, Jeff wrote a book about

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.850
food. It's not really a cookbook. It's got
a whole chapter on food-borne illness--

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.850
[laughter]

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.940
that he's conveniently broken into two sections,
parasites and bacteria. But you can't really

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.079
classify it like that.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.250
Similarly, it's not really one of these detailed
recipe porn books where they show you the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.620
recipe and then they have beautiful pictures
'cause he dug a bit and devoted a number of

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.269
pages on Twitter recipes and publishing in
a couple of hundred characters a recipes.

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.859
So, it's really a book about food that appeals
to people who like to overanalyze, kinda like

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.030
us. All right. I'm happy someone's written
a book about food for people like me. I'm

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.619
hoping today he'll answer my question about
why we call them "cookies" and not "bakies,"

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.900
when clearly they should be called bakies.
And--

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.900
[laughter]

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: AT&amp;T burn.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.700
[laughter]

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And with great pleasure,
I'd like to introduce Jeff Potter.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.700
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Thank you.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.930
[applause]

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:50.860
Thanks for the great kind words. I hope I
live up to the hype. And of course, there's

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:05.659
nothing better for a geek than a Venn diagram.
So, I get asked a lot, "What's a geek?"

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.690
And I'm like, "This is the answer to what
a geek is." Note the [inaudible] bit is not

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.440
included in the set of the things that make
a geek up. And for me, that's like really

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.019
important to people who invariably think pocket
protectors and all this other stuff. But it's

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.730
not what it's about.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:35.060
For me it's really about curiosity. And as
Jeremy was saying, for me, whether it's in

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:46.560
front of a computer or in the kitchen, it's
really the curiosity about how things work

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.400
that gets me excited. And so, when it comes
to cooking, it's exactly the same thing. How

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.900
does this thing that we do in the kitchen,
how does it actually work?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.440
Why do we do the things we do the way we do
them? And once you know those things, what

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.670
can you do that's fun, new, interesting, or
just plain delicious? Continuing the theme

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:25.239
of Venn diagrams, figuring that it's Google,
I figured the Google Venn diagram generator

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.250
was appropriate.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.830
You know, pointing at things like Windows
and Apple. You can see there's some interesting

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.909
traits like, I guess everyone knows why Apple
is so popular because people don't seem to

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:49.599
search for it. "Why is Windows so popular?"
comes up a lot. Hey. Here's another one which

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.130
is a little more interesting.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.629
It has chefs versus geeks versus bakers. Geeks
clearly don't wear white. I don't quite get

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:05.510
the "like bacon" bit. I would think it would
be under "cooks" as well, but you know. Then

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.950
the last one: Science, cooking, and food.
And the interesting thing for me is all three

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.700
of these things are important.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.110
And I thought it was actually nice to see
that come up. So, a bit about science. And

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:27.000
it's always fun to talk about science in the
context of dead white dudes. So, I present

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.990
to you three dead white dudes: Aristotle,
Newton, and Einstein. And the thing that these

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.100
three guys all have in common is they all
came up with models of gravity.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.990
And in science, models are really, really
important. Aristotle's model was really, really

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.440
simple. He basically sent things to fall at
a rational place. So, the drop that falls,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:04.280
I don't know why it didn't fall in my mouth,
but it's a really simple model and it's not

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.440
very good.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:19.470
In the 1800s, we start getting better models.
Galileo came up with something that describes

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:43.300
basic high school physics for gravity. It's
still taught in high school today. It's pretty

00:05:43.300 --> 00:06:11.350
good as a model goes. But it's not actually
perfect. It doesn't actually describe Mercury's

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:22.570
orbit around the sun, rather famously.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:59.240
And you actually can't describe that with
that law. You have to get an even better model,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:20.330
something that Einstein came up with, the
Theory of Relativity. And that actually accounts

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:40.080
for Mercury's orbit around the sun. The point
here is that with better models, you get better

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080
predictions.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:48.330
And it's true in all sciences and it's true
in the kitchen. So, let's actually talk about

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:58.380
a model of cooks, types of cooks. Right now,
your model of types of cooks is probably pretty

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:08.580
simple. But how many types of cooks are there?
So that's two types. People who like to cook

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.370
things and people who like to bake things.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:21.160
But it's actually a very simple model. It's
Ancient Greece territory in terms of like,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:31.680
"Yeah, this sounds good." But it doesn't actually
really describe what's going on in the kitchen

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:39.880
that well. So, the researcher down at Cornell
got some data, looked at thousands of cooks,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.560
home cooks, and asked them lots of questions
and did a factor analysis.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:57.530
And he came up with this five-factor model
that describes five different types of cooks

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:04.060
that describe most types of cooks. And luckily,
he came up with a quiz for it. So, here's

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:10.710
a quiz. This is a really simple quiz. The
way we do this is just to keep track of what

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.900
letter you answer most often.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:21.710
And whatever that letter is in the end, that's
your type. It only accounts for about 85 to

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:28.320
90% of the population. And given the people
in this room, I have my guesses about how

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.390
this is gonna go.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.390
[laughter]

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:41.160
I will say that under normal populations,
there's a roughly 20% split between all five

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:54.010
types. So, keep that in mind when you go through
this. First question: When I cook a meal,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.270
I typically dot dot dot.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:03.470
If anyone needs me to read these off, holler.
But if you can see them great.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.440
[pause]
Everybody good? Should I go to the next one?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.700
OK. Some of my favorite ingredients are. That
thing from the kitchen around the corner.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.500
They did the right cookies. Anyone have Dayquil
for me?

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:26.270
Unusual tea. It's not unusual to you because
of cultural things, then it’s not an unusual

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:42.590
ingredient. Shall I go to the next one? Howdy.
In my free time I like to. OK, I know you

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.830
guys are like, "What free time?"

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.830
[laughter]

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:57.400
Next one? My favorite things to cook are.
Jeremy, are you A on this?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.520
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Mmm.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.340
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Looked good.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.460
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.670
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Your recipe. Delicious.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:16.610
[pause]
Are we good? OK. And the last one. Other people

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:29.560
describe me as. And F is a joke. I put that
in there in a previous talk. Don't actually

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:39.950
answer F. If won't do us any good.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.810
[laughter]

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:49.470
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: What about none
of the above?

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.470
[laughter]

00:11:50.470 --> 00:12:12.420
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: This only fits 90% of the population
plus or minus delta. So, I'm curious to see

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:31.890
a show of hands. Who here said "A"? So it’s
like, let's see, five or six? "B"? Only five

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:43.080
or six. "C"? Probably about seven. OK, "D"?
Yeah, about 40&amp;, like half the room. "E"?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.730
Two. OK. That's cool. So here's what these
things mean.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:53.040
The researcher who did this was Dr.Brian Munson
down at Cornell and he basically looked at

00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:07.120
types of cooks. There's giving types of cooks,
so people can basically, they basically wanted

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:17.450
to express their affection through baking.
So they should all show up at work with a

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.060
box full of gingerbread cookies.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:27.530
And what they're really saying is "hey, I
love you guys." Then you go, "Thanks. That's

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.670
really cool. I like them." Thanks, Jeremy.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.670
[laughter]

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.800
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I love you guys.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800
[laughter]

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.750
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: It's like next time someone
shows up with a plate of brownies, that's

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:50.910
where it's coming from. Healthy. This is somebody
who'll do it for steamed veggies, brown rice,

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.510
fish, chicken.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:58.000
To them food is really about nutritional value,
taking care of the body. Methodical. This

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:11.589
is something you can give them a recipe and
they will nail it perfectly. It'll come out

00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:27.210
exactly like a recipe says, but if they're
missing like one ingredient, like, they don't

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.120
know what to do.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:58.550
And Innovative. This is the type of person
who basically like maybe reads a couple recipes,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:08.530
looks at some TV shows, like walks into the
kitchen and throws stuff into a pan and it

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:18.150
comes out. He doesn't have a good time doing
it. And for them this is kind of like, "Hey.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:25.850
I'm just goofing off, playing and seeing what
might happen."

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:35.630
And that's really how I like to cook. And
then finally, this Competitor type. This is

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:43.390
somebody who like, for them cooking is almost
an act of expressing who they are as a personality.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:51.420
Grilling, things that are a little bit chest-thumping
type things. That make sense? It's totally

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.420
cool.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:16:00.300
But for them it's as much about that act of
cooking and doing that in a competitive realm.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:07.290
So, that all said, we started with a really
simple model. It's like there's two types

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:16.700
of cooks. But here's a better model. And once
you have a better model, you can start making

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.180
better predictions.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:24.680
So, you can imagine a couple, or maybe somebody
who is really health-driven married to somebody

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.520
who is all about expressing affection. So
you know, the girlfriend makes for the boyfriend

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:36.620
a plate of brownies, saying, "Hey, I love
you." And the guys like, "Oh my God, this

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:41.040
isn't fish and veggies. Like Oh, my God, no!"

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:48.550
And you can just see this conflict that comes
up around food. And food is such a thing.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:53.850
You're laughing about this, but only because
this is a true person?

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.850
[laughter]

00:16:54.850 --> 00:17:02.790
You have this very pained look. Now with this
better model, you'll understand what's going

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.790
on.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.790
[laughter]

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.920
She looked at me like, it's really powerful
to have that better model because besides

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:19.720
breaking ground on the front row of an audience,
now we can talk about it. It's not an offense.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:27.910
So, that whole bit of a model is really, really
powerful. Science, in general, really does

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:35.600
rely on these two thing, theory and data.
And they say this a lot. And a lot of people

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:43.460
go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. I understand
this in science." But they don't think about

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.250
it in the context of the kitchen.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:54.220
Without your data, your theories are really
no good. You don't know if they're true or

00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:01.080
not. Without your theories, well, you just
compile data and you can't predict new data

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:07.660
points that you don't have in your set of
observations. Same thing is true in food.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:16.559
Here is a model of an equation for knowing
when meat is done being cooked.

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:17.559
[laughter]

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:26.790
I can't read this. I confess I am not a theory
guy. My background is much more on the data

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:36.150
side of things. So, when it comes to the kitchen,
all I think of are data. So, I'll do things

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:44.360
like this. I'll go into a kitchen, take a
lump of chocolate-chip cookie dough, throw

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:52.679
a probe into it, throw it in the oven and
see what happens.

00:18:52.679 --> 00:19:02.040
And start recording data. So, what's your
model right now tell you about what happens

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:10.350
to a lump of cookie dough when you throw in
the oven? It cooks. I had someone go " it

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.610
turns into a cookie."

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.610
[laughter]

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.429
[You open the box and put in the dough and
the cookies come out. So if you put an apple

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:20.270
in there, a cookie is just not coming out.]

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.270
[laughter]

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:32.050
So, let's look at cookie dough. It's kind
of interesting. So, after I put this probe

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:37.600
in, this little light out here you barely
see. It's actually little probe thermometers,

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.000
kitchen, 30 dollar thermometers we've got
at home.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.650
So, around 92 degrees they begin to spread
out and do that thing that you were saying.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:53.630
That's the temperature which butter begins
to melt. So like, right. OK. This makes some

00:19:53.630 --> 00:20:01.980
sense. There's some structure holding this
mass of dough together and that structure

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:09.121
starts to go when butter starts to go.

00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:18.580
Isn't that cool? Around 212 degrees, the edge
of the cookie begins to set up. It starts,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:28.370
again at 212 degrees, an obvious number, the
boiling point of water. And the edge of that

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:37.550
cookie begins to steam up. It's also around
the temperature in which a lot of starches

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:44.610
and things like flour begin to actually like
melt and do their thing as well.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:51.130
Then at around 310 degrees, the outside of
this cookie begins to turn light brown. Any

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.310
guesses what's happening around 310?

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.490
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Condensation.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.350
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: A good guess, but not the right
guess.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.470
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Maillard.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:07.250
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yes. Who said Maillard? An
extra gingerbread cookie to the man in green.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.250
[laughter]

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:13.860
A Maillard reaction is a breakdown between
proteins and simple sugars. Basically, these

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:21.010
two things break down, form hundreds of new
compounds, some of which are brown, some of

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.470
which smell really, really good and we happen
to like.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:34.140
And if that doesn't do it for you, think about
taking a slice of bread and toasting it. That

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:44.570
toasted smell that you get? That's the Maillard
reaction. And it's really important in cooking

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:56.000
because it brings a whole set of flavors.
So, think about things like brussel sprouts.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:06.770
Brussel sprouts are universally boiled and
universally hated because the flavors kinda

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:27.049
bland. If you quarter them, throw some olive
oil, some salt on there and put them under

00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:34.250
a broiler, you get some nice toasted, rich,
brown outside that help us bring the flavors,

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.700
the Maillard reaction.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:53.810
And that's responsible for a lot of flavor
in foods. And once you start realizing it's

00:22:53.810 --> 00:23:01.190
a temperature-dependent reaction, you now
realize right, cooking methods that don't

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:13.520
get that hot won't trigger that reaction.
So, you have to get things that hot to get

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.080
that reaction.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:29.320
When we think about steaming or boiling something,
well, it's gonna bring a loss of flavors.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:36.460
Then at around 356, 360, somewhere in that
territory, our cookie gets turned even darker

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:44.680
brown. And this is from caramelization, as
you guys were guessing earlier.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:24:02.419
And this is pure breakdown of sucrose and
other sugar molecules. This temperature I'm

00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:11.200
giving you is for sucrose, specifically. Basically,
it's just the sugar molecule itself is decomposing

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.470
and then forming hundreds of compounds again,
some of which are brown, so they smell good.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:21.820
And it's surprising in hindsight for me, looking
at the book and working on it, how long it

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.310
took to understand some really like, basic
"duh" type things. Caramelization has nothing

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:32.710
to do with melting. This happens if sugar
melts right at the same temperature point

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.890
that breaks down, decomposes.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:39.840
Fun fact. Sugar melts at around 367, actually
377, so those after 367. So you can actually

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.280
calibrate your oven using sugar, just like
you use on ice cubes. You know how your freezer

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:54.390
is above 32 or below 32. Same thing with your
oven. If you put sugar in your oven at 350,

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.890
it shouldn't melt.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:04.410
If you leave your oven at 375, it should melt.
You can start looking at recipes and say,

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:11.380
"Hey, some recipes call for things being cooked
at 325 or 350. Other recipes at 375." There's

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:17.970
this nice, like break point between these
two sets of temperatures and that is the chemical

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.880
reactions that sugar goes through for both
melting and caramelization.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:41.400
So, here's a nice little visual proof of this.
I just took some sugar dough. It's kind of

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:48.280
hard to see them on the projector. But basically,
I just took some sugar cookie dough and baked

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.210
it at different temperatures. And you can
see there's this really nice difference between

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.309
that 350 to 375, where it starts to get brown.

00:25:53.309 --> 00:25:59.100
And note, on these temperatures, they are
not exact points. These are Maillard reactions.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:11.860
So like, caramelization picks up the hotter
you go, but it's not really visibly occurring

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:23.080
until around a little bit north of 350. So,
there's a model and then your simple model

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.669
of cookie dough to cookie, right?

00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:37.470
Next time you're going to make cookies, you
can think about things like, "Hey, do I want

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:55.350
these a deep brown?" In the case of a chocolate
chip cookie. Or, not so brown in cases like

00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:05.429
a sugar cookie or an oatmeal cookie. Same
thing is true with meat. Another model for

00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:10.250
you. When you cook meat, what happens? Bueller?
Bueller?

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.770
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Brown, scalded.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.530
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Browned.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:24.350
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: It like burns and
the inside stays cold.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.960
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Do what?

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:38.860
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: The outside burns
and the inside stays cold.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.860
[laughter]

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:53.330
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: It turns brown
and when it breaks down you get texture.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:28:06.340
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yes. You get textural breakdowns
when a number of the proteins denature. And

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:21.070
specifically, at least in the papers I've
been able to find, it seems like there are

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:33.280
different proteins that are responsible for
this, some of which we happen to like being

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:42.820
denatured when cooked, and some of which we
happen to like being in a native, uncooked

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.820
state.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:49.710
Specifically, the two are myosin and actin.
Different types of meats have different variants

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:54.270
of these proteins when temperatures vary a
little bit. But essentially for a thing like

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:59.290
steak, it looks like right at 122 degrees
one of these proteins, myosin, begins to denature.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:07.020
And in the process of denaturation, changes
its texture, changes the way it tastes and

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:17.320
the way we perceive it. And we happen to like
that change. And if you look at another protein,

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:23.830
what we call actin, it begins to go somewhere
around 150. And unlike myosin when it denatures,

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:28.799
it changes its texture and gets tough and
dry and not so delicious.

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:37.600
If you look at things like medium-rare steak,
it's at this temperature point, 135, 140,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:45.730
where you basically mean one of those proteins
is cooked and another one uncooked. So suddenly,

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:52.820
it's like, "Oh, right." This thing is about
the particular reactions that are occurring

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.290
at particular temperatures.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:05.280
It's not so much about the time you cook your
meat at whatever temperature you're cooking

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.960
it, it's really the actual temperature of
the meat in itself AND what it comes up to.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:20.180
So, when we take the piece of meat. Let's
say you take a steak tip and drop it into

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.110
a pan, you get something that looks kinda
like this.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:30.540
Again, it's kinda hard to see in the projector.
Basically, there's this grainy adundant square

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:36.840
. I've done this. Where it's kind of, well
this particular example is basically rare

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:43.950
in the middle. Looks like medium-rare and
you have well-done out here and notice the

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:48.330
outsides brown from the Maillard reaction
we were talking about earlier.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:55.570
So, one question to I get asked a lot at this
point here, well, why are we told always to

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:02.030
cook things at 165 degrees? I mean, if the
proteins in here are really ideal at 135,

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.080
140, like why is it we're constantly hammered
with this "Why 165" number? And the reason

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.320
for this is this.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.070
Salmonella, another food-borne illness, definitely
not a fun thing to come down with. And one

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:19.230
of the main reasons we cook food is that it's
safe for us to eat. The standard rule is actually

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:25.360
given in food safety, this thing called the
danger zone. It basically says don't hold

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.210
food between 40 and 140 for more than two
to four hours.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:36.549
It depends upon what state you’re in. The
laws of food safety are actually state by

00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:41.290
state. But essentially in that time window,
in that temperature range, then you start

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.409
running into problems. Now, you'll notice
this nice, little square I have here is a

00:31:44.409 --> 00:31:46.530
simple model of what's going on.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:53.490
And there's a little dotted line, which is
actually a better model of what's really going

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:59.620
on, which is essentially that bacteria like
to multiply at different temperatures and

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:08.669
different rates. So it happens that salmonella
reproduce best at body temperature. And what

00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:13.200
food safety people are concerned about is
the quantity of these pathogens that are present.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:21.030
It's not really like your food is either safe
or unsafe, it's really a probability how unsafe

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:29.620
is it. And that's kind of, you know, a little
icky when you think about it at first, but

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:35.780
once you understand it's really about probability
and odds, you can start understanding how

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:39.919
to mitigate those risks and actually correctly
taking the [inaudible] and start doing some

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:40.919
fun things.

00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:50.760
So, you don't have to just take my word for
it. In terms of things like cooking foods

00:32:50.760 --> 00:33:01.350
below 140, you can actually do this. Even
according to the people that set these guidelines.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:08.580
So the Food Safety and Inspection Services
has a table that says here's how long you're

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.620
supposed to cook food at various temperatures.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:17.840
If you wanna cook your chicken at 136 degrees,
you can do that. You just have to hold it

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.900
at the temperature for over an hour to make
sure it's properly pasteurized. So, it's really

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.860
about reducing the quantity of pathogens that
are present to a sufficiently safe level,

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.870
such that it's not likely to hurt you.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:35.530
Now, why would you wanna do this? Well, we
were talking about myosin and actin a few

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:45.110
minutes ago and it comes to this texture of
the proteins. If you can get something to

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:51.679
a point where it's safe to eat, but you haven't
denatured the actin, well, you're not gonna

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:54.000
say it's delicious, just safe.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.630
And that's always the end goal. So, simple
model. Cook your meat to 165. And by meat,

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:14.139
it's really usually poultry. The better model
is really 140 degrees is OK as long as you

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:41.079
hold it correctly to pasteurize it. So, once
you do this, you can do fun things like this.

00:34:41.079 --> 00:35:04.481
You'll see the piece of meat on the right
is basically medium-rare. The whole thing,

00:35:04.481 --> 00:35:14.510
center to edge. You also notice the outside
has no brown crust on the outside 'cause it's

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:21.589
got no Maillard reaction. Any guesses as to
how I did this?

00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:23.960
&gt;&gt;Audience Members: Sous vide.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:30.469
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yeah. I asked this like, two
years ago and people would be like, "What?"

00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:36.109
Yeah. This is called sous vide cooking. It's
a really simple concept. It basically says

00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:46.380
hold your food in an environment that's at
the target temperature that you want to cook

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.739
something to.

00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:59.099
So if you take a piece of meat and you're
wanting that steak to be at say, 140 degrees.

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:08.530
Instead of putting it into a 300 degree oven,
you can put in into an environment that's

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:16.549
140 degrees. And eventually, it'll go up to
a temperature of 140 degrees. It works great

00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:23.010
for eggs. Hey. No worries. Are there any gingerbread
cookies left?

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:27.700
&gt;&gt;Female Helper: No, we don't have any here.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.700
[laughter]

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:41.859
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: So, it really comes down to
the sous vide stuff that it's really about

00:36:41.859 --> 00:36:57.499
the temperature that you're trying to get
your material to. It can be your target temperature.

00:36:57.499 --> 00:37:07.200
And the benefit of this is that you can't
overcook things because you're not talking

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.930
about an environment that's hotter.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:22.809
So if you've got that actin protein in meat,
for example, it doesn't really begin to go

00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:46.229
until 150. Well, if you put it in an environment
that's 140 it never gets to be 150. That reaction

00:37:46.229 --> 00:38:07.089
never triggers. So, you can't overcook things.
Eggs are a great example. This is my set-up

00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:09.599
at home.

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:24.369
This is called immersion recirculator. It's
basically a piece of fancy lab gear that keeps

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:38.859
water at a particular temperature and it's
got a little propeller that agitates it, more

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:43.789
on that in a little while. But the eggs themselves
work out really, really well this way. Think

00:38:43.789 --> 00:38:47.489
about the temperatures that are involved in
egg.

00:38:47.489 --> 00:38:54.549
You drop that egg in a regular cooking situation
into a pan of boiling water and it does this

00:38:54.549 --> 00:39:03.530
and gets hotter and hotter, right? In like
five or seven minutes, then you basically

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:16.380
pull it out, somewhere right around here.
Right in the really, really narrow band that's

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:23.529
the ideal temperature range for eggs.

00:39:23.529 --> 00:39:34.529
And hopefully, you timed it right. About 144
and 158 refer to the two temperature points

00:39:34.529 --> 00:39:44.789
at which proteins in eggs begin to denature
and the upper limit where most of them actually

00:39:44.789 --> 00:39:50.420
set. So a really good soft poached egg is
somewhere in-between that range.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:55.529
And depending on how well you like your eggs
set, it's going to be somewhere between there.

00:39:55.529 --> 00:40:01.710
There's 15, 16 different types of proteins
in these eggs and they all denature in that

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:09.200
range. This is the sort of thing where you
can have fun playing with it one degree at

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:23.269
a time just to see what your perfect egg is.

00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:41.989
The thing about doing it with sous vide style
is that you set your temperature of your bath,

00:40:41.989 --> 00:40:56.140
put your egg in, and the egg just ramps up
in temperature and finally just reaches that

00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:06.989
ideal temperature point, but it never over
cooks. So you get this egg that is essentially

00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:19.569
perfectly soft poached and just sits there
for a couple hours.

00:41:19.569 --> 00:41:33.880
So, if you're trying to cook brunch for 30,
40 people, you just put the bucket out, put

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:48.329
your eggs in, set the temperature and walk
away and forget about it. And they won't ever

00:41:48.329 --> 00:42:00.209
overcook. The key to making sure that--. The
one thing that I want you to really understand

00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:08.130
to hammer home is that it's the temperature
that's important here.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:15.431
Time is just a proxy for temperature. When
you put those cookies in your oven and you

00:42:15.431 --> 00:42:25.339
time them for 12 minutes, well it's really
about how long does it take for that mass

00:42:25.339 --> 00:42:31.201
of dough to come up to a certain temperature
at the temperature of your oven. But it's

00:42:31.201 --> 00:42:38.900
really the temperature of the actual mass
that matters.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:54.045
So here's a photograph of an egg that had
been cooked this way. It's kind of hard to

00:42:54.045 --> 00:43:01.210
see, so here's a video of it. The other cool
thing I was doing things this way was this

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:14.259
one layer of egg on the outside that doesn't
actually set up until a higher temperature.

00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:20.989
So the egg just falls out of the shell when
you do this. It was like, totally awesome.

00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:21.989
[laughter]

00:43:21.989 --> 00:43:47.109
And you'll see coming on the screen here in
a minute, you can see the texture. The yolk

00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:58.170
and the white have almost the same texture.
They're both mayonnaise-like consistency when

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:05.460
cooked at a certain point.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:19.529
There you go. Yeah, and they're delicious.
I mean like, if there's one thing you can

00:44:19.529 --> 00:44:29.910
go home and try is sous vide eggs. Definitely
hands down. So this is a piece of gear that

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:31.509
I have. It's called an immersion recirculator
and it's expensive. Three, four years ago,

00:44:31.509 --> 00:44:39.160
this was the only way of doing it, but there
are now better ways of doing this.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:48.619
There a consumer device out called the Sous
Vide Supreme. They're like three or four hundred

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:56.630
dollars. If you've got counter space and the
cash, it's certainly very easy and they look

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.329
nice next to your other stainless steel appliances.

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.329
[laughter]

00:45:00.329 --> 00:45:06.009
But if you're like me, a pair of wire cutters--.

00:45:06.009 --> 00:45:07.170
[laughter]

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.559
This works. It works very well. Just say your
crock pot or any slow cooker, interpose on

00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:14.549
the power supply. Rig up your own thermal
coupler and drop it in the thermostat controller

00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:15.549
and you're good to go.

00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:17.390
And it's actually easy. And I get questions
a lot of times about, "Well, there's no circulator.

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:26.680
There's nothing to agitate the water bowl."
For whatever reason it seems that, at least

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:39.709
for the stuff I've done in the slow cooker,
the heat source in the bottom over a large

00:45:39.709 --> 00:45:40.709
enough area.

00:45:40.709 --> 00:45:48.950
There's really no gradient inside the container.
You don't have to worry about it so much.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:54.019
One other thing I neglected to mention earlier.
When you pulled that piece of meat out it

00:45:54.019 --> 00:45:59.479
didn't have that brown outside. There was
no Maillard reaction on that. And that's one

00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:02.209
of the really good key characteristics of
a really good steak.

00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:06.209
So, what we do is after you take it out of
the sous vide environment, you then drop it

00:46:06.209 --> 00:46:08.130
into a pan. You sear the outside. So you're
basically still getting that reaction outside,

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.130
but you've taken the two reactions, the external
temperature and the interior temperature,

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:12.509
and you basically are controlling for them
independently of each other.

00:46:12.509 --> 00:46:19.459
If you don't have any kind of race the outside
temperature and the inside temperature. So

00:46:19.459 --> 00:46:21.590
you were saying earlier you're always like,
overcooking the outside and the middle is

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:22.590
rare.

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.590
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Yeah.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:24.779
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: It sounds like you're barbecue
is too hot. So, try cooking it at a lower

00:46:24.779 --> 00:46:34.220
temperature. That would be my guess. So, kind
of in summary. I mean, if there's a high-level

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:39.770
couple of bullet points you'll hopefully remember
tomorrow or next week, this is simple models,

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.869
simple predictions that will help you recover
when disaster strikes.

00:46:42.869 --> 00:46:43.869
Better models, better predictions. And really,
for me a lot of it comes down to just being

00:46:43.869 --> 00:46:47.990
curious in the kitchen. If you walk into the
kitchen and you're like, "Hey, how does this

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:54.809
actually work? What's going on here?" And
you're not sure. Well, do an experiment. I

00:46:54.809 --> 00:47:01.369
mean it's really easy to gather data in your
kitchen.

00:47:01.369 --> 00:47:08.490
And when you're talking about cookies and
you're not sure about the difference between

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:13.000
melted butter versus room temp or even fridge
temp butter when you're making your cookie

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.109
batch, just take two batches and do them side
by side and see what the difference is.

00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:23.920
'Cause you're gonna learn a lot more about
what's going on in that process by actually

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.480
trying it. And you can sit there and have
lots of guesses, but until you actually try

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.499
something and see what comes out, well, you're
not gonna really be sure.

00:47:33.499 --> 00:47:38.930
There's this great quote that I saw years
ago that really brings home for me a lot of

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.589
these things. "In theory, there's no difference
between theory and practice. In practice,

00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:46.150
there is." The reason for this is there's
always a delta between what your theory predicts

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:47.150
and what really happens in your life.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.009
The thing is with a better model, that delta
gets smaller and smaller. And so, there always

00:47:49.009 --> 00:47:57.549
will be a difference, but hopefully by understanding
some of the science that difference will be

00:47:57.549 --> 00:48:11.760
easier to understand even smaller. So with
that, I figured that it'd be much more fun

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.260
to open this up as a conversation and talk
about questions you guys might have.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.539
Hopefully I've given you lots of ideas and
being aware of things to talk about. But I'm

00:48:16.539 --> 00:48:20.270
totally happy to hang out for the next half
hour and answer questions and strategize a

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:25.130
little bit about questions you might have
and how to figure out answers about it. So

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:26.130
with that, thanks.

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.130
[applause]

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:28.130
Jeremy.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:40.460
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You mentioned that people
preferred tastes as the proteins changed at

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.229
different temperatures. Is that evolutionary?
I mean, is that like, have there been studies

00:48:43.229 --> 00:48:44.229
done to show that we like it tasting better
because it has less bacteria, therefore we

00:48:44.229 --> 00:48:45.229
live longer, blah blah blah blah blah?

00:48:45.229 --> 00:48:46.229
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: I don't think that that's been
done. And I don't know how you'd do that.

00:48:46.229 --> 00:48:47.229
But textural preference of meat stuff is definitely
a personal preference based on what you grew

00:48:47.229 --> 00:48:48.229
up with.

00:48:48.229 --> 00:48:49.229
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK.

00:48:49.229 --> 00:48:50.229
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: So it's the reason why--. If
you look at older people, they tend to actually

00:48:50.229 --> 00:48:51.229
prefer their meats cooked well done or well.
They don't like that medium rare texture.

00:48:51.229 --> 00:48:52.229
A lot of it comes down to as we learn more
about food safety, we've relaxed the rules.

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.229
So actually just recently in the last few
months, it's now considered safe to cook your

00:48:53.229 --> 00:48:54.229
pork to 145 as opposed to 165. That's because
trichinosis, which was a concern in pork originally,

00:48:54.229 --> 00:48:55.229
it's basically not in our meat supply, at
least here in the US. It's just the same thing

00:48:55.229 --> 00:48:56.229
with meat texture stuff where it's like, well,
two generations ago, people really cooked

00:48:56.229 --> 00:48:57.229
it to make sure they weren't gonna get anything.

00:48:57.229 --> 00:48:58.229
Now it's actually OK to go even colder. I
don't know about being able to show it biologically,

00:48:58.229 --> 00:48:59.229
evolutionary. I think it's more cultural than
anything. Good question though. Thank you.

00:48:59.229 --> 00:49:00.229
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Your salmonella
food safety graph, I noticed the dotted line

00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:01.229
was still on zero below freezing.

00:49:01.229 --> 00:49:02.229
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yes.

00:49:02.229 --> 00:49:03.229
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: How far below freezing
does it have to go before it's actually zero?

00:49:03.229 --> 00:49:04.229
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Pretty gosh darn cold. For
things that deal with food safety, that dotted

00:49:04.229 --> 00:49:05.229
line really isn't so much of a concern, but
spoiled bacteria, it is. This is why if you

00:49:05.229 --> 00:49:06.229
put things in your fridge, they eventually
go bad.

00:49:06.229 --> 00:49:07.229
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Right.

00:49:07.229 --> 00:49:08.229
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: 'Cause they're, really it's
something multiplying at that temperature

00:49:08.229 --> 00:49:09.229
range. I don't know below freezing at what
point it actually ceases to get, I think there

00:49:09.229 --> 00:49:10.229
are some, but even at freezer temp it could
be an issue, which is why the guidelines say

00:49:10.229 --> 00:49:11.229
not to hold food in your freezer for more
than six months.

00:49:11.229 --> 00:49:12.229
I think there actually is some stuff that
can come up, but it's such a slow rate that

00:49:12.229 --> 00:49:13.229
most people don't get into product limits.
That's a good question to look into more detail.

00:49:13.229 --> 00:49:14.229
And the thing about that dotted line on the
high side is that really, the highest temperature

00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:15.229
hits 130 a little more serious, the next highest
is at 122.

00:49:15.229 --> 00:49:16.229
So, this is a cartoon line. Obviously, it's
not specific bacteria. But the thing is none

00:49:16.229 --> 00:49:17.229
of these things really multiply above 131-ish.
So holding food at 140 is actually safer than

00:49:17.229 --> 00:49:18.229
40. Think about it. So, 40, they can't actually
multiply. They can't get around. This rate

00:49:18.229 --> 00:49:19.229
is so slow that it's not really an issue with
how to consume it.

00:49:19.229 --> 00:49:20.229
But given the choice between eating beef stew
that's been held at 140 degrees for six weeks

00:49:20.229 --> 00:49:21.229
versus held at 40 degrees for six weeks? I'd
take the 140 degree. 'Cause it basically,

00:49:21.229 --> 00:49:22.229
at that point, it's clean, it's sterilized
it, how long it's there.

00:49:22.229 --> 00:49:23.229
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: In sous vide, though,
you're bringing it up to the temperature much

00:49:23.229 --> 00:49:24.229
more slowly--

00:49:24.229 --> 00:49:25.229
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Right.

00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:26.229
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: which means it
spends more time in that bulge of this curve.

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:27.229
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yes. That's a really good question
which is this sous vide stuff where you drop

00:49:27.229 --> 00:49:28.229
it in. And basically, you're dropping it in
from fridge temperature and it has to traverse

00:49:28.229 --> 00:49:29.229
this entire span.

00:49:29.229 --> 00:49:30.229
And it takes whatever length of time. This
journey is normally not a problem in sous

00:49:30.229 --> 00:49:31.229
vide, because we normally portion the foods
to individual portion size, and so the actual

00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:32.229
food comes up to temperature pretty quickly.
If you take like, let's make a number up,

00:49:32.229 --> 00:49:33.270
like a six-ounce steak.

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:39.559
You drop it. And it's at 40 degrees. It's
gonna get up to temp pretty fast. If you took

00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:45.099
five pounds of chuck roast that's been frozen,
like that's, like don't do that.

00:49:45.099 --> 00:49:46.099
[laughter]

00:49:46.099 --> 00:49:47.099
And the reason for that is that the center
of that is gonna be between that 40 and the

00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:48.099
140 for such a length of time, that depending
on what your environment is, there's some

00:49:48.099 --> 00:49:52.529
big huge variables in there that it's just
gonna sit too long in a bad temperature.

00:49:52.529 --> 00:49:53.529
I should probably add a little asterisks here
and say things like steak or other meats that

00:49:53.529 --> 00:49:54.529
are called WMULT, Whole Muscle Intact, the
center of these pieces of meat are actually

00:49:54.529 --> 00:49:55.529
sterile. In those cases, you really only care
about the surface, 'cause we were at surface

00:49:55.529 --> 00:49:56.529
contamination during butchering, slaughtering,
transport work into the kitchen.

00:49:56.529 --> 00:49:57.529
So, this is why it's OK to do things like
take your steak, sear it outside and then

00:49:57.529 --> 00:49:58.529
serve it rare. 'Cause even in the middle is
essentially, in a rare case, even let's say

00:49:58.529 --> 00:49:59.529
120 degrees, obviously well below that safety
point. It's sterilized. 'Cause it hasn't actually

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:00.529
been contaminated.

00:50:00.529 --> 00:50:01.529
So things like ground hamburger, though, where
ground hamburger is all outside, that there's

00:50:01.529 --> 00:50:02.529
no inside. I've secretly wanted to go to a
food safety convention and like, serve hamburgers

00:50:02.529 --> 00:50:03.529
and ask the people, "How do you want this
cooked, medium rare?"

00:50:03.529 --> 00:50:04.529
'Cause like nobody should want their hamburger
cooked medium-rare because it's at a temperature

00:50:04.529 --> 00:50:05.529
at which you haven't actually properly pasteurized
and many pathogens there might be present.

00:50:05.529 --> 00:50:06.529
I will note that you can properly pasteurize
hamburgers to medium-rare using sous vide

00:50:06.529 --> 00:50:07.529
cooking.

00:50:07.529 --> 00:50:08.529
So, that's where having a better system of
models comes into play 'cause you can start

00:50:08.529 --> 00:50:09.529
doing some fun stuff like not worry about
organisms that might be present. Go for it.

00:50:09.529 --> 00:50:10.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: You can presumably
get away with it if you knew the meat was

00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:11.529
ground immediately before you cooked it, too.

00:50:11.529 --> 00:50:12.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yes. If you have control over
the--. I mean, it also depends on what the

00:50:12.529 --> 00:50:13.529
problem or the source of the contamination
is at that point. I mean, yeah. If you're

00:50:13.529 --> 00:50:14.529
grinding it yourself, you've got lots of control
over everything.

00:50:14.529 --> 00:50:15.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: If you sear the
outside.

00:50:15.529 --> 00:50:16.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yeah. If you sear the outside,
then you have a completely sterilized grinder,

00:50:16.529 --> 00:50:17.529
it's called beef tartar. And they serve that
at restaurants.

00:50:17.529 --> 00:50:18.529
[laughter]

00:50:18.529 --> 00:50:19.529
I mean, as long as it's clean, you're fine
going in. But a lot of the food safety stuff,

00:50:19.529 --> 00:50:20.529
it basically assumes the worst-case scenario.
Let's just assume this piece of poultry is

00:50:20.529 --> 00:50:21.529
infected with salmonella to the worst possible
degree.

00:50:21.529 --> 00:50:22.529
And then we need to reduce the log D, the
term is log D reduction. We need to do a seven-fold

00:50:22.529 --> 00:50:23.529
reduction. Only one in a million are going
to survive after cooking that. Like, that's

00:50:23.529 --> 00:50:24.529
the statement. That's the numbers they give
you. So I mean, their concern is safety, not

00:50:24.529 --> 00:50:25.529
taste and texture.

00:50:25.529 --> 00:50:26.529
That's where the balance always comes into
play. [pointing to audience member] In the

00:50:26.529 --> 00:50:27.529
green shirt.

00:50:27.529 --> 00:50:28.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: Sir, on the topic
of sous vide taking a long time to come up

00:50:28.529 --> 00:50:29.529
to temperature, has anyone in the sous vide
community looked at a trick that, I think,

00:50:29.529 --> 00:50:30.529
hunters used a lot in time where you say,
"Oh, if I want some stuff that I dump in a

00:50:30.529 --> 00:50:31.529
bath of hot water to be at a particular temperature,
I approximate the stuff by room temperature

00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:32.529
water and make the water extra hot so that
when I dump it in, the temperature is, after

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.529
everything is said and done, is gonna be what
we want."

00:50:33.529 --> 00:50:34.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: This is a good idea and I'm
sure it would help in theory.

00:50:34.529 --> 00:50:35.529
[laughter]

00:50:35.529 --> 00:50:36.529
In practice, when your container of water
is this big and the food you're putting in

00:50:36.529 --> 00:50:37.529
is already at 40 and we wanna make it 140
and it's not actually a problem being a food

00:50:37.529 --> 00:50:38.529
to temperature criteria.

00:50:38.529 --> 00:50:39.529
The bigger problem that does come up with
sous vide stuff is once you get to temperature

00:50:39.529 --> 00:50:40.529
the question is then what do you do with it?
So, if you're a restaurant and you're doing

00:50:40.529 --> 00:50:41.529
something that you're gonna bring up to temperature
and you're gonna put it in the fridge.

00:50:41.529 --> 00:50:42.529
And the next day, you're gonna take it and
heat it back up. You're now traversing that

00:50:42.529 --> 00:50:43.529
span, like three times. And it's the cumulative
time that's the matter, unless you actually

00:50:43.529 --> 00:50:44.529
properly sterilize it by the time you get
it up to temp, which isn't gonna happen in

00:50:44.529 --> 00:50:45.529
this case.

00:50:45.529 --> 00:50:46.529
So in that case, there's a whole set of guidelines
called HCAP. I can never remember. It's like

00:50:46.529 --> 00:50:47.529
H-C-A-P, Hazardous Control and something Program.
Basically it says if you sous vide stuff,

00:50:47.529 --> 00:50:48.529
there's two methods. There's one that's cook/serve
and the other one's called cook/chill.

00:50:48.529 --> 00:50:49.529
With cook/chill, you basically need to cook
it and chill it as fast as possible. Like,

00:50:49.529 --> 00:50:50.529
dump it into an ice bucket, or ice and a little
bit of water to get it down really quickly.

00:50:50.529 --> 00:50:51.529
So, in those cases, you stop worrying about
the temperature stuff and playing with how

00:50:51.529 --> 00:50:52.529
quickly you can move the temperature back
and forth.

00:50:52.529 --> 00:50:53.529
But if you basically do what's called cook/serve,
where you cook it and you put it on a plate

00:50:53.529 --> 00:50:54.529
and you ship it out. I mean, like sous vide
in restaurants is great. Because if somebody

00:50:54.529 --> 00:50:55.529
orders a steak, you've got it in a plastic
bag and it's in your sous vide tub. It's gonna

00:50:55.529 --> 00:50:56.529
need some marinade in the bag so it's gonna
taste good, too.

00:50:56.529 --> 00:50:57.529
You pull it out. Slit the bag open. You sear
for 30 seconds on a side, drop it on a plate,

00:50:57.529 --> 00:50:58.529
and ship it out. Like, you don't have to wait
for cooking because it's already cooked. So

00:50:58.529 --> 00:50:59.529
cook/serve stuff is really easy to do at home.

00:50:59.529 --> 00:51:00.529
Cook/chill stuff is, just make sure you get
a cold enough bowl. There's a really good

00:51:00.529 --> 00:51:01.529
guide online. Douglas Baldwin has this sous
vide, a guide. You can just Google sous vide

00:51:01.529 --> 00:51:02.529
Douglas Baldwin. You'll find it. Great page
that details like everything down to like,

00:51:02.529 --> 00:51:03.529
I mean, he's done a fantastic job of coming
up with literature, of coming up with great

00:51:03.529 --> 00:51:04.529
tables. So, that's where I point people to.
Gotcha.

00:51:04.529 --> 00:51:05.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: How does contamination
and danger zone and such vary with vegetables,

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:06.529
with non-meats?

00:51:06.529 --> 00:51:07.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yeah. You're more likely to
get food-borne illness from your veggies that

00:51:07.529 --> 00:51:08.529
you are from your meats at this point. It's
the number one metric. We don't cook lettuce.

00:51:08.529 --> 00:51:09.529
If you think about all the salmonella outbreaks
that have happened, like spinach, than things

00:51:09.529 --> 00:51:10.529
where you're not actually adding heat to it.
Wash your veggies. I mean, really. Wash your

00:51:10.529 --> 00:51:11.529
veggies. I don't know if I answered your question.

00:51:11.529 --> 00:51:12.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: Even cooked vegetables,
like cooked vegetables you'd keep a whole

00:51:12.529 --> 00:51:13.529
lot longer than cooked meats 'cause you don't
have, they're less likely to contaminate.

00:51:13.529 --> 00:51:14.529
It that true, or no?

00:51:14.529 --> 00:51:15.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Umm.

00:51:15.529 --> 00:51:16.529
Well, it's not just contamination. Things
like bacteria, and you need a bunch of different

00:51:16.529 --> 00:51:17.529
variables to be able to survive. For bacteria,
[inaudible] they need something to munch on,

00:51:17.529 --> 00:51:18.529
and veggies certainly have plenty of nutrients.

00:51:18.529 --> 00:51:19.529
There's other things like acdity, pH, temperature,
time. I don't mean specifically a container

00:51:19.529 --> 00:51:20.529
of veggies and a container meat in your fridge,
which is the way to go faster. I know that

00:51:20.529 --> 00:51:21.529
my food is not a problem because I eat it
faster than the bacteria will. Yeah.

00:51:21.529 --> 00:51:22.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: But really probable,
it's just we're more aware of meat and temperature.

00:51:22.529 --> 00:51:23.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: People are very afraid about
getting sick from meat that is not properly

00:51:23.529 --> 00:51:24.529
cooked. They should be more worried about
getting sick from veggies that have not been

00:51:24.529 --> 00:51:25.529
properly washed. I think that's a pretty safe
tip.

00:51:25.529 --> 00:51:26.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: Well, I now have
a follow-up to that question, which is do

00:51:26.529 --> 00:51:27.529
you have any, is there any special procedure
for properly washing your vegetables?

00:51:27.529 --> 00:51:28.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Google it.

00:51:28.529 --> 00:51:29.529
[laughter]

00:51:29.529 --> 00:51:30.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: It ought to be
possible. So, turkey brining, which is a tradition

00:51:30.529 --> 00:51:31.529
every Thanksgiving, it seems like it should
be possible to sous vide your turkey in the

00:51:31.529 --> 00:51:32.529
brine.

00:51:32.529 --> 00:51:33.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yep.

00:51:33.529 --> 00:51:34.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: Have you seen
people do that?

00:51:34.529 --> 00:51:35.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: I've slow-cooked--. You actually
use a slow-cooker. So like, a turkey leg.

00:51:35.529 --> 00:51:36.529
Oh, let's see. Long, rambling tangent. OK.
Actin, myosin, another important thing called

00:51:36.529 --> 00:51:37.529
collagen. Meats that are really high in collagen
are things like duck legs, short ribs.

00:51:37.529 --> 00:51:38.529
These kinds of meats, the collagen has to
be broken down, hydrolyzed, denatured and

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:39.529
that takes up a long time, which is why a
dish like duck confi , you have to cook it

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:40.529
for like, six to eight hours. And that temperature
of the collagen goes to 165, 180. It's a Maillard

00:51:40.529 --> 00:51:41.529
reaction.

00:51:41.529 --> 00:51:42.529
It's higher than those minor reactions, also.
If you take a turkey leg and put it in water,

00:51:42.529 --> 00:51:43.529
throw a turn or two of salt in that, put it
in your slow cooker and turn it on for a day.

00:51:43.529 --> 00:51:44.529
You'll come back a day later to an amazing
turkey leg that's perfectly brined and everything.

00:51:44.529 --> 00:51:45.529
You don't need to throw that much salt in
there, enough salt that would actually inhibit

00:51:45.529 --> 00:51:46.529
bacterial growth as far as I know. So, obviously
salt in water is, I mean, this is how you

00:51:46.529 --> 00:51:47.529
can get things like lox or jerks or fish.
It's like basically taking the salinity to

00:51:47.529 --> 00:51:48.529
a high enough level to where the bacteria
cell then literally ruptures and destroys

00:51:48.529 --> 00:51:49.529
the cells.

00:51:49.529 --> 00:51:50.529
I don't know if you could actually like, cook
a turkey in just salt. They have to be food

00:51:50.529 --> 00:51:51.529
safe, like turkey jerky.

00:51:51.529 --> 00:51:52.529
[laughter]

00:51:52.529 --> 00:51:53.529
I'm sure it's doable. It just doesn’t sound
like something I would go and buy, but it

00:51:53.529 --> 00:51:54.529
could work. Try it and let me know.

00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:55.529
[laughter]

00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:56.529
I'll get food poisoning.

00:51:56.529 --> 00:51:57.529
[laughter]

00:51:57.529 --> 00:51:58.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: Not to [inaudible]
on food safety, but--

00:51:58.529 --> 00:51:59.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: No.

00:51:59.529 --> 00:52:00.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: I'm curious
what we know about the science of what flavors

00:52:00.529 --> 00:52:01.529
go together. So, I had a friend come over
at my house and looked at my not particularly

00:52:01.529 --> 00:52:02.529
extensive spice rack and said "Do you actually
know how to use all of those?" and I said,

00:52:02.529 --> 00:52:03.529
"Well, yes."

00:52:03.529 --> 00:52:04.529
But when he asked like what, how do you know
what goes with what, I had no answer for him

00:52:04.529 --> 00:52:05.529
whatsoever other than experience.

00:52:05.529 --> 00:52:06.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: So it seems that chemical similarity
of compounds is predictive of how well the

00:52:06.529 --> 00:52:07.529
flavors will go together. And there's a great
website called Food Pairings, where this guy

00:52:07.529 --> 00:52:08.529
has done a whole bunch of chemical analysis.
And you give it an ingredient and it tells

00:52:08.529 --> 00:52:09.529
you what's similar to it.

00:52:09.529 --> 00:52:10.529
Somewhere in the book is a couple of screen
shots from it, in Chapter Three, on page number--.

00:52:10.529 --> 00:52:11.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: Well, I got
one, so.

00:52:11.529 --> 00:52:12.529
[laughter]

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:13.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: I'm trying to--. It's Food
Pairings. If you Google food pairings, you'll

00:52:13.529 --> 00:52:14.529
find it. Here we go, it should be that. Page
143. So, you'll see the top of that are two

00:52:14.529 --> 00:52:15.529
little diagrams. They look like that. So yeah.

00:52:15.529 --> 00:52:16.529
Flavors that can go together seem to be based
on chemical similarity. The way that our noses

00:52:16.529 --> 00:52:17.529
smell things--. Well, sense of taste and smell
are totally truly fascinating, 'cause like

00:52:17.529 --> 00:52:18.529
there's so much that goes on. Taste is relatively
straight-forward. There's chemical receptors

00:52:18.529 --> 00:52:19.529
on your tongue that are able to fire off for
like, five or six different types of categories

00:52:19.529 --> 00:52:20.529
of compounds.

00:52:20.529 --> 00:52:21.529
So, some things taste sweet, some things bitter,
sour, you know all these things. Maybe metallic

00:52:21.529 --> 00:52:22.529
ions. There's still a question mark for human
tongues. They found receptors for that in

00:52:22.529 --> 00:52:23.529
dog tongues. It’s probably quite reasonably
that some of us have those as well.

00:52:23.529 --> 00:52:24.529
Smell is a lot more complicated. Your nose
has somewhere in the order of ten thousand

00:52:24.529 --> 00:52:25.529
different receptors that key off different
aspects of a molecule. At least this is the

00:52:25.529 --> 00:52:26.529
current theory. And any given molecule can
trigger a different number of receptors. So,

00:52:26.529 --> 00:52:27.529
it's like the chord on a piano, where you
hear certain notes.

00:52:27.529 --> 00:52:28.529
And so, the theory as far as I understand
it is that compounds that strike similar notes,

00:52:28.529 --> 00:52:29.529
just like they would chord-wise in a symphony,
go well together, will likewise go well together

00:52:29.529 --> 00:52:30.529
in food. So this is why things like, if you
look well, basil and tomato.

00:52:30.529 --> 00:52:31.529
They go well together because they literally
have similar chemicals in similar chemical

00:52:31.529 --> 00:52:32.529
families that strike the same receptors in
your nose. And likewise, this is why it's

00:52:32.529 --> 00:52:33.529
hard to get things like chocolate and lobster
go well together. It's like they don't. Yeah.

00:52:33.529 --> 00:52:34.529
It's like a C-Sharp chord along like a D-flat.

00:52:34.529 --> 00:52:35.529
It's a dissonant. So, if you actually look
at some of the more interesting combinations

00:52:35.529 --> 00:52:36.529
of ingredients that are done in some of the
high-end restaurants occasionally, a lot of

00:52:36.529 --> 00:52:37.529
it comes out of actual just experience. And
a lot of top-end chefs will go and look at

00:52:37.529 --> 00:52:38.529
food pairings and go, "Oh, we can do strawberry
with a few particular other ingredients and

00:52:38.529 --> 00:52:39.529
it works." So yeah. I mean, go and try and
play with it.

00:52:39.529 --> 00:52:40.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: All right. Does
this mean I should go back and tell my friend

00:52:40.529 --> 00:52:41.529
who had a challenge for generating free pair-wise
delicious combinations that do not go well

00:52:41.529 --> 00:52:42.529
together to give up?

00:52:42.529 --> 00:52:43.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: No. There are plenty of combinations.
But using this, you would probably come up

00:52:43.529 --> 00:52:44.529
with a really good list of three pair-wise
combinations that don't work together. I remember--.

00:52:44.529 --> 00:52:45.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: Chicken and
basil and chicken and cinnamon are both [inaudible].

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:46.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: [inaudible]
[laughter]

00:52:46.529 --> 00:52:47.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #12: So, A and B
are good. B and C are good. C and A are good.

00:52:47.529 --> 00:52:48.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: So, the guy that did these,
Bernard Lahousse, I remember him saying to

00:52:48.529 --> 00:52:49.529
me at one point that I think you can bridge
like--. You can't like jump four or five jump

00:52:49.529 --> 00:52:50.529
points. Like, they didn't work anymore.

00:52:50.529 --> 00:52:51.529
I mean, he's a great guy. Like, I emailed
him to say, "I would love to figure out how

00:52:51.529 --> 00:52:52.529
to come up with a combination of three-wise
pairs that don't work out chemically as a

00:52:52.529 --> 00:52:53.529
joke on my friend." And then send me the list,
too.

00:52:53.529 --> 00:52:54.529
[laughter]

00:52:54.529 --> 00:52:55.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #13: I was wondering,
you talked about safe heating. I was wondering

00:52:55.529 --> 00:52:56.529
if you could talk a little bit about safe
defrosting, or does that not even matter if

00:52:56.529 --> 00:52:57.529
you're going to be cooking it afterwards anyway?

00:52:57.529 --> 00:52:58.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Safe defrosting basically amounts
to defrosting in this temperature range. There's

00:52:58.529 --> 00:52:59.529
a line if you've got frozen ground turkey.
They say put it in your fridge overnight,

00:52:59.529 --> 00:53:00.529
because below 40, above 32, it's going to
defrost.

00:53:00.529 --> 00:53:01.529
But your multiplication of bacteria is slow
enough that you won't have any real concern

00:53:01.529 --> 00:53:02.529
there.

00:53:02.529 --> 00:53:03.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #13: If you're trying
to defrost fish over like, an hour time period

00:53:03.529 --> 00:53:04.529
for example, you don't have like a whole night
to put it in the fridge.

00:53:04.529 --> 00:53:05.529
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member: Put it in cold water.

00:53:05.529 --> 00:53:06.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Water conducts heat a lot faster
than air. So if you took that lump of frozen

00:53:06.529 --> 00:53:07.529
fish and you put it on your counter at 60
degrees, you put it in a bath of water at

00:53:07.529 --> 00:53:08.529
40 degrees in your fridge and you put a third
piece in your fridge, just in air.

00:53:08.529 --> 00:53:09.529
The fish in water at 40 degrees is gonna defrost
fastest. This is actually why when we do sous

00:53:09.529 --> 00:53:10.529
vide stuff, we do it in a water bath or a
liquid bath. You could technically do sous

00:53:10.529 --> 00:53:11.529
vide in your oven if your oven went to those
temperatures. It's just gonna take 23 times

00:53:11.529 --> 00:53:12.529
longer.

00:53:12.529 --> 00:53:13.529
And because of that you run into too much
time in the danger zone. So like fish, I mean,

00:53:13.529 --> 00:53:14.529
keep in mind about the danger window it's
like four hours. If you put it on your counter

00:53:14.529 --> 00:53:15.529
to defrost in like two hours and you cook
it and you eat it an hour later, you're probably

00:53:15.529 --> 00:53:16.529
fine. I mean, assuming you're starting with
a fish that isn't slathered with salmonella

00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:17.529
or something.

00:53:17.529 --> 00:53:18.529
[laughter]

00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:19.529
But actually with fish, it's really parasites
that's the concern and freezing kills parasites,

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:20.529
so actually really, really good like high-end
tuna. Well, actually tuna [inaudible], but

00:53:20.529 --> 00:53:21.529
like say salmon.

00:53:21.529 --> 00:53:22.529
They're actually even frozen to kill parasites.
'Cause then you're not concerned about being

00:53:22.529 --> 00:53:23.529
ill. Bacteria obviously don't die when you
freeze them. I mean, you store bacteria in

00:53:23.529 --> 00:53:24.529
labs like, putting the samples in the freezer.
That's how you preserve them. Not so with

00:53:24.529 --> 00:53:25.529
parasites.

00:53:25.529 --> 00:53:26.529
So, the issue is shellfish and various parasites.
I mean, not that you usually leave fish on

00:53:26.529 --> 00:53:27.529
the counter all day long, it would be kinda
gross, but yeah.

00:53:27.529 --> 00:53:28.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #14: What's the biggest
kitchen disaster you've ever had?

00:53:28.529 --> 00:53:29.529
[laughter]

00:53:29.529 --> 00:53:30.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #15: What was the question?

00:53:30.529 --> 00:53:31.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: What was the biggest kitchen
disaster you've ever had? I think I've got

00:53:31.529 --> 00:53:32.529
a slide of this somewhere.

00:53:32.529 --> 00:53:33.529
[laughter]

00:53:33.529 --> 00:53:34.529
There's one I don't want to talk about publically
yet, so let's just say it involves some TV

00:53:34.529 --> 00:53:35.529
cameras.

00:53:35.529 --> 00:53:36.529
[laughter]

00:53:36.529 --> 00:53:37.529
I'm not gonna be able to find this very fast.
Let me see. Actually, it might be here.

00:53:37.529 --> 00:53:38.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #15: Are you looking
for your oven?

00:53:38.529 --> 00:53:39.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yeah.

00:53:39.529 --> 00:53:40.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #15: I found it. A
search for Jeff Potter high temperature pizza.

00:53:40.529 --> 00:53:41.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Man, you Google employees are
scary. It's like you have a plug right here.

00:53:41.529 --> 00:53:42.529
[laughter]

00:53:42.529 --> 00:53:43.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #15: I actually pre-searched
that last night.

00:53:43.529 --> 00:53:44.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Pre-cached it?

00:53:44.529 --> 00:53:45.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #15: Yeah, it's really
scary.

00:53:45.529 --> 00:53:46.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Where is it on my hard drive?
Here we go. Yes. Yeah, well. Sort of. Maybe.

00:53:46.529 --> 00:53:47.529
I don't know if this is very useful. I will
show you a photograph and then talk about

00:53:47.529 --> 00:53:48.529
it. So, here's the photograph. I'll wait for
the words "cleaning cycle" to pop in everyone's

00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:49.529
devices.

00:53:49.529 --> 00:53:50.529
[laughter]

00:53:50.529 --> 00:53:51.529
Pizza. It turns out you can make really, really
good pizza if you're oven goes to about 900

00:53:51.529 --> 00:53:52.529
degrees. And your oven goes to about 900 degrees,
actually hotter than that in the cleaning

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:53.529
cycle.

00:53:53.529 --> 00:53:54.529
There's this guy down in Atlanta. This guy
named Jeff Varasano who first did this, maybe

00:53:54.529 --> 00:53:55.529
a decade ago. He clipped the lock on his oven
doors so he could open it when it's on the

00:53:55.529 --> 00:53:56.529
cleaning cycle. In the interest of readers
and research, I tried to replicate this at

00:53:56.529 --> 00:53:57.529
home. Not that you should, but if you really
want me to.

00:53:57.529 --> 00:53:58.529
It does make a pizza, though. So, that's an
infrared thermometer. Basically, it tells

00:53:58.529 --> 00:53:59.529
you the temperature of things and it says
845 degrees. And there's a marked difference

00:53:59.529 --> 00:54:00.529
between like 800 degrees and 600 degrees.
I put my hand in the oven at 600 degrees.

00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:01.529
It's warm.

00:54:01.529 --> 00:54:02.529
Like, 800 degrees is kind of like--. You almost
have an involuntary reaction to pull your

00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:03.529
hand back. But the thing about doing pizza
in an oven this hot, is that it cooks like

00:54:03.529 --> 00:54:04.529
in 45 seconds.

00:54:04.529 --> 00:54:05.529
[laughter]

00:54:05.529 --> 00:54:06.529
You drop it in. It goes [whomp], sets,and
you pull it out.

00:54:06.529 --> 00:54:07.529
[laughter]

00:54:07.529 --> 00:54:08.529
You also have about a two-second window between
undercooked and overcooked. But if you've

00:54:08.529 --> 00:54:09.529
ever wondered how you get a really, really
thin crust pizza, it's cooking it in a really

00:54:09.529 --> 00:54:10.529
hot environment.

00:54:10.529 --> 00:54:11.529
So, if you go over to like, Harvard Square
where there's Cambridge One, they're cooking

00:54:11.529 --> 00:54:12.529
on top of a charcoal wood grill. And I took
my infrared thermometer when they weren't

00:54:12.529 --> 00:54:13.529
looking and put it in it. And it reads about
a thousand degrees. So, the difference between

00:54:13.529 --> 00:54:14.529
the commercial pizza makers that are making
really delicious thin crust pizzas and you

00:54:14.529 --> 00:54:15.529
at home is their oven is really hot.

00:54:15.529 --> 00:54:16.529
That's why you can't really do it at home.
So here's the slide in question. One of these

00:54:16.529 --> 00:54:17.529
is a surviving pane of glass from my oven
door. The other is a piece of Pyroceram 3,

00:54:17.529 --> 00:54:18.529
which is quartz crystal. So the military used
it on missile nose cones in the 1950s. Thank

00:54:18.529 --> 00:54:19.529
you Google. It's amazing what you can find
on the internet.

00:54:19.529 --> 00:54:20.529
[laughter]

00:54:20.529 --> 00:54:21.529
What's even more amazing to me was that it
was cheaper than the replacement piece of

00:54:21.529 --> 00:54:22.529
plastic from the oven manufacturer.

00:54:22.529 --> 00:54:23.529
[laughter]

00:54:23.529 --> 00:54:24.529
And my oven now safely goes to a thousand
degrees. Since I'm renting my place out, I

00:54:24.529 --> 00:54:25.529
have removed my lock to heat mechanism. Heck,
while I'm at it, I might as well show this

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:26.529
slide, too.

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:27.529
It has to do with negative 320 degrees. I
apologize that I did not bring my liquid nitrogen

00:54:27.529 --> 00:54:28.529
here with me today. Because you can make really,
really delicious ice cream in about 30 seconds,

00:54:28.529 --> 00:54:29.529
just like heating pizza in 30 seconds. Basically,
when you think about temperature--.

00:54:29.529 --> 00:54:30.529
We were talking earlier about foods that temperature
matters. When you start dealing with extreme

00:54:30.529 --> 00:54:31.529
temperatures, either really hot or really,
really cold, you can take that mass of food

00:54:31.529 --> 00:54:32.529
to your target temperature and beyond really,
really fast.

00:54:32.529 --> 00:54:33.529
[laughter]

00:54:33.529 --> 00:54:34.529
The thing that's kind of cool about doing
it with liquid nitrogen is that there are

00:54:34.529 --> 00:54:35.529
certain things like ethanol that don't freeze
under normal ice cream making conditions,

00:54:35.529 --> 00:54:36.529
that do freeze at this temperature range.
So you can make ice cream that is literally

00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:37.529
strong enough from one scoop to give you a
hangover.

00:54:37.529 --> 00:54:38.529
[laughter]

00:54:38.529 --> 00:54:39.529
And it's delicious. I highly recommend. This
is the part where you have to delete me saying

00:54:39.529 --> 00:54:40.529
this.
[pause]

00:54:40.529 --> 00:54:41.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #16: To what extent
does the humidity of your oven matter?

00:54:41.529 --> 00:54:42.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: It matters.

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:43.529
[laughter]

00:54:43.529 --> 00:54:44.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #16: There's no control
part. You have to figure something out.

00:54:44.529 --> 00:54:45.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Well, yeah. I mean, that's
why bakers will oftentimes spritz or spray

00:54:45.529 --> 00:54:46.529
water in their oven, or sometimes you'll see
a recipe that'll say "put a tray of water."

00:54:46.529 --> 00:54:47.529
I mean, humidity is one of the big uncontrolled
variables in baking, especially.

00:54:47.529 --> 00:54:48.529
It's something we just don't really deal with
'cause it's kinda hard to control for, at

00:54:48.529 --> 00:54:49.529
least with tools we have today. Maybe in 20
or 30 years, our ovens will have a humidity

00:54:49.529 --> 00:54:50.529
knob next to the temperature knob, which would
be really cool.

00:54:50.529 --> 00:54:51.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #17: [inaudible]

00:54:51.529 --> 00:54:52.529
[laughter]

00:54:52.529 --> 00:54:53.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yeah, [inaudible] I mean it's
really an issue for dry cooking methods, any

00:54:53.529 --> 00:54:54.529
time you're baking or roasting. 'Cause obviously
water can impart heat a lot faster. You got

00:54:54.529 --> 00:54:55.529
more moisture in the environment. It's gonna
heat the outside of your food faster. So it

00:54:55.529 --> 00:54:56.529
transfers heat better. So yeah, it matters.
I mean--.

00:54:56.529 --> 00:54:57.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #18: Because I was
thinking if you're cooking something for longer

00:54:57.529 --> 00:54:58.529
there's the chance that it'll dry out.

00:54:58.529 --> 00:54:59.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Aluminum foil.

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:00.529
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: I'm pragmatic.

00:55:00.529 --> 00:55:01.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #18: OK.

00:55:01.529 --> 00:55:02.529
[laughter]

00:55:02.529 --> 00:55:03.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #19: I know that
you can control certain points of humidity,

00:55:03.529 --> 00:55:04.529
especially if you're baking, like melted butter
versus cold butter. If you use cold butter,

00:55:04.529 --> 00:55:05.529
you're gonna leave stuff in the oven longer
because it takes a longer time for the fat

00:55:05.529 --> 00:55:06.529
to melt in the batter.

00:55:06.529 --> 00:55:07.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Right.

00:55:07.529 --> 00:55:08.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #19: So then it melts
out and that's why you can leave it in even

00:55:08.529 --> 00:55:09.529
longer. But it also takes longer for the cookies--.
If you're making cookies, it takes longer

00:55:09.529 --> 00:55:10.529
for the cookies to spread as well. So, if
you use liquid fats they spread really fast.

00:55:10.529 --> 00:55:11.529
That's why chocolate chip cookies tend to
flatten out really easily. But don't do it

00:55:11.529 --> 00:55:12.529
from the refrigerator because then it takes
forever and then your cookies aren't as delicious.

00:55:12.529 --> 00:55:13.529
They're too doughy in the middle.

00:55:13.529 --> 00:55:14.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Depends on what kind of cookies
you like. So much variability. You think you

00:55:14.529 --> 00:55:15.529
have it perfect and someone's like, "No, I
like it crunchy." And someone's like, "No,

00:55:15.529 --> 00:55:16.529
I like it chewy." Like, go look at the cookie
aisle at the grocery store and there's five

00:55:16.529 --> 00:55:17.529
thousand different varieties of cookies because
people like the variation.

00:55:17.529 --> 00:55:18.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #19: Yeah, like there's
Toll House cookies that you can just break

00:55:18.529 --> 00:55:19.529
apart. Sometimes they're not the best because
they just take too long to flatten out 'cause

00:55:19.529 --> 00:55:20.529
they're cold.

00:55:20.529 --> 00:55:21.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yeah.

00:55:21.529 --> 00:55:22.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #19: You might have
to leave them at room temperature, but then

00:55:22.529 --> 00:55:23.529
you have the bacteria problems with that.

00:55:23.529 --> 00:55:24.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Anything's that got sugar and
chocolate in it, sign me up.

00:55:24.529 --> 00:55:25.529
[laughter]

00:55:25.529 --> 00:55:26.529
You got a question?

00:55:26.529 --> 00:55:27.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #20: Uh, yeah, so perhaps
this is a foolish question, but let's see

00:55:27.529 --> 00:55:28.529
if you have a good response to it.

00:55:28.529 --> 00:55:29.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Oh, no. Not that question.

00:55:29.529 --> 00:55:30.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #20: You've done a
lot of experimentation in the kitchen. Any

00:55:30.529 --> 00:55:31.529
particular devices that you find really good
for trying new things?

00:55:31.529 --> 00:55:32.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Particular devices. I'm gonna
give you two different answers. One is kinda

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:33.529
generic. What do I think you should have if
you're gonna go and do experimentation in

00:55:33.529 --> 00:55:34.529
your kitchen?

00:55:34.529 --> 00:55:35.529
And the second's gonna be, what do I miss
in my kitchen now that I'm out in LA on a

00:55:35.529 --> 00:55:36.529
temporary basis? If you're gonna go do experimentation
in your kitchen, just like any science, anything

00:55:36.529 --> 00:55:37.529
that gathers good data. So, good scales, good
thermometers, timers. It's hard to find bad

00:55:37.529 --> 00:55:38.529
timers. I mean, get one that tells you the
time.

00:55:38.529 --> 00:55:39.529
[laughter]

00:55:39.529 --> 00:55:40.529
So really, understanding the temperature of
the food, temperature of the environment,

00:55:40.529 --> 00:55:41.529
how much weight-wise of particular stuff and
trying to control for it. That really comes

00:55:41.529 --> 00:55:42.529
down to the really key aspects.

00:55:42.529 --> 00:55:43.529
So I did this talk last December on the science
of chocolate chip cookies and as part of it,

00:55:43.529 --> 00:55:44.529
we did an experiment where I had 500 people
bake batches of cookies, each of them being

00:55:44.529 --> 00:55:45.529
an A B split at start up. Where it's like,
OK, one person's gonna make two batches--one

00:55:45.529 --> 00:55:46.529
with whole wheat flour and one with regular
flour.

00:55:46.529 --> 00:55:47.529
Or someone's gonna make it with melted butter
versus standard butter. And the reason I did

00:55:47.529 --> 00:55:48.529
each person doing two batches was to actually
try to hold everything else constant on the

00:55:48.529 --> 00:55:49.529
basis that if one person is making both of
these controls, there's gonna be variation

00:55:49.529 --> 00:55:50.529
between kitchen to kitchen, variation between
chef to chef, variation between each batch

00:55:50.529 --> 00:55:51.529
that one chef does.

00:55:51.529 --> 00:55:52.529
So I wrote a very detailed protocol, writing
everything out to the gram. Like, this is

00:55:52.529 --> 00:55:53.529
actually for a bunch of chemists down in New
York. It's like a bunch of chemists given

00:55:53.529 --> 00:55:54.529
a protocol. This should be easy. The day of
the event comes up and a couple of people

00:55:54.529 --> 00:55:55.529
had sheepishly come up to me and said, "I
followed your protocol, but when I looked

00:55:55.529 --> 00:55:56.529
at the cookies they were all over the board."

00:55:56.529 --> 00:55:57.529
I mean, I was trying to control for temperature,
for weight, for everything. We're talking

00:55:57.529 --> 00:55:58.529
about a three-page, bullet point, single spaced
list that like, followed to the letter by

00:55:58.529 --> 00:55:59.529
PhD chemists. And I couldn't get them to actually
within--.

00:55:59.529 --> 00:56:00.529
So, even trying to control for time and temperature
and weight, everything else, there's still

00:56:00.529 --> 00:56:01.529
so much variation that when you're trying
to do an experiment, really understanding

00:56:01.529 --> 00:56:02.529
what variables you're capturing and recording
and you're actually not missing the bigger

00:56:02.529 --> 00:56:03.529
variables, that's really the challenge.

00:56:03.529 --> 00:56:04.529
As for the second bit, the second question
I said I'd answer, so I'm out in LA on a semi

00:56:04.529 --> 00:56:05.529
temporary basis, enjoying the weather very
much. I will say I left here December 18th

00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:06.529
and it started to snow December 19th.

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:07.529
[laughter]

00:56:07.529 --> 00:56:08.529
I miss my immersion stick blender. And it's
kind of funny 'cause I have a confession to

00:56:08.529 --> 00:56:09.529
make. I don't really have a kitchen in LA.
I have an electric hot plate, a toaster oven,

00:56:09.529 --> 00:56:10.529
and a microwave.

00:56:10.529 --> 00:56:11.529
And I'm like, "Hey. If I can't make this work,
yeah, OK. I gotta make this work." And it's

00:56:11.529 --> 00:56:12.529
been fine. It's actually worked just--. I
didn't miss not having an oven or burners,

00:56:12.529 --> 00:56:13.529
but I have missed my immersion blender, 'cause
it's the one thing that lets you pulverize

00:56:13.529 --> 00:56:14.529
and change texture and make smoothies and
whatever, make soup.

00:56:14.529 --> 00:56:15.529
There's so many things you can do with that
one tool. I haven't been able to make soup,

00:56:15.529 --> 00:56:16.529
puree it, for six months. So yeah, I would
say that that's been a surprise for me, that

00:56:16.529 --> 00:56:17.529
that particular tool actually. It's hard to
fake it with something else. You can't take

00:56:17.529 --> 00:56:18.529
a knife and dice stuff up small enough. But
yeah. Any other question? I'm gonna go with--.

00:56:18.529 --> 00:56:19.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #21: OK.

00:56:19.529 --> 00:56:20.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Actually, I haven't gone that--.

00:56:20.529 --> 00:56:21.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #22: So, I guess my
question is there's this other device that's

00:56:21.529 --> 00:56:22.529
a totally different way of cooking things.
It's like putting something in a temperature

00:56:22.529 --> 00:56:23.529
bath, a microwave. So, what's cool about microwaves?
So anything?

00:56:23.529 --> 00:56:24.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Microwaves are kind of underappreciated.
I mean, they fundamentally work by vibrating

00:56:24.529 --> 00:56:25.529
molecules [inaudible], so things like water
would get hot and inhibit microwaves, which

00:56:25.529 --> 00:56:26.529
means that essentially they're only good for
wet cooking methods.

00:56:26.529 --> 00:56:27.529
So you wanna steam some veggies, works great.
Take a container. Put some veggies in there,

00:56:27.529 --> 00:56:28.529
maybe some asparagus, close the container
loosely, put a tablespoon or two of water

00:56:28.529 --> 00:56:29.529
in the bottom and hit it with microwaves.
And it'll steam up and get hot enough and

00:56:29.529 --> 00:56:30.529
your asparagus or whatever your veggies are
will cook.

00:56:30.529 --> 00:56:31.529
Same thing like cakes. You can actually make
chocolate cake in the microwave under 30 seconds.

00:56:31.529 --> 00:56:32.529
There's this whole theme here with 30 seconds.
What's going on? Pizza, ice cream and now

00:56:32.529 --> 00:56:33.529
cakes.

00:56:33.529 --> 00:56:34.529
[laughter]

00:56:34.529 --> 00:56:35.529
You can make a cake in like 30 or 40 seconds.
Again, because a microwave's retain water

00:56:35.529 --> 00:56:36.529
better when present with eggs and the batter
inside, causing it to vibrate, heat up inside.

00:56:36.529 --> 00:56:37.529
That said, microwaves are not so useful for
things that involve Maillard or caramelization

00:56:37.529 --> 00:56:38.529
reactions under normal circumstances. There
are probably some clever hacks involved with

00:56:38.529 --> 00:56:39.529
bizarrely foiled, creased foil, like in popcorn
bags, which the industry managed to pull off.

00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:40.529
So, that's why microwaves don't get the love
that maybe they deserved, because you can't

00:56:40.529 --> 00:56:41.529
get those other reactions, the dry cooking
method reactions. But anything that involves

00:56:41.529 --> 00:56:42.529
liquid, any kind of wet cooking method, seems
like a reasonable guess that you should be

00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:43.529
able to do some form of cooking in the microwave.

00:56:43.529 --> 00:56:44.529
Does that give you any inspiration? I don't
think I'd make pizza in one, but definitely

00:56:44.529 --> 00:56:45.529
steam things, boil things. Potatoes work great
in microwaves, 'cause again it's about taking

00:56:45.529 --> 00:56:46.529
moisture that's present from the potato and
get the starches to dissolve and set a. Do

00:56:46.529 --> 00:56:47.529
you have a question?

00:56:47.529 --> 00:56:48.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #22: I was just gonna
ask if you had any tips for how the inventive,

00:56:48.529 --> 00:56:49.529
intuitive, throw-everything-in-a-pan cooks
can describe how to cook to the precise I-need-a-recipe

00:56:49.529 --> 00:56:50.529
cook?

00:56:50.529 --> 00:56:51.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yes. Innovative and traditional,
write it down and take really good notes about

00:56:51.529 --> 00:56:52.529
what you're doing.

00:56:52.529 --> 00:56:53.529
[laughter]

00:56:53.529 --> 00:56:54.529
OK, OK. Take two. Record you doing it, edit
it down, give it to them.

00:56:54.529 --> 00:56:55.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #22: YouTube!

00:56:55.529 --> 00:56:56.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: Yeah. Absolutely. Have you
guys seen My Drunken Kitchen?

00:56:56.529 --> 00:56:57.529
&gt;&gt;Male AUDIENCE MEMBER #23: Oh, love it.

00:56:57.529 --> 00:56:58.529
&gt;&gt;Jeff Potter: It's great. Anyway, I'll hang
out and sign some books for a while and we're

00:56:58.529 --> 00:56:59.529
probably out of time, so with that, thanks
for having me out.

00:56:59.529 --> 00:56:59.530
