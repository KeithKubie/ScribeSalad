00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:03.030
- Hey, it's Mark Wiens here
today in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.597
I'm going to be making a Thai
street food recipe today,

00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:08.626
pad kra pao gai khai daw.

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:11.950
And that is holy basil with chicken

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.646
and a fried egg on the side
all over a bed of hot rice.

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:18.373
It's a delicious, awesome Thai dish.

00:00:18.373 --> 00:00:19.206
Stay tuned,

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.063
I'm going to share the
recipe with you right now.

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:24.980
(melodious instrumental music)

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:35.916
We're going to fry the eggs first

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:38.166
so they're all ready to go.

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:41.815
Put my pan over.

00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:44.252
Thai eggs are actually
not just fried eggs,

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.343
but they're deep fried eggs.

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:48.883
So you do use quite a bit of oil.

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:51.227
You want to make sure the oil is very hot

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:53.394
before you put in the egg.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.575
Actually you don't want to flip the egg.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:01.637
So what you want to do is
just grab some of the oil,

00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:04.804
and keep like putting it over the egg.

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:10.262
Oh yeah, that is a nice Thai style

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:11.908
deep fried egg right there.

00:01:11.908 --> 00:01:15.212
You want to set the egg aside.

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:17.685
We're going to be using one
chicken breast for this recipe.

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:18.813
Alright, the first thing you want to do

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.059
is take your chicken and slice it

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:22.616
into nice bite size pieces.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:23.720
Chicken aside, we're now going to cut up

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.026
the chilis and garlic.

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:29.465
And I'm going to put, I think
about, how about four chilis,

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.187
but of course, you can use as many chilis,

00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:32.560
or as little as you like.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.692
The normal Thai chilis.

00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:37.918
Garlic, again you can use as
many or as little as you like,

00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:40.248
but I am again a garlic fanatic.

00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:42.105
I think we're going to
go with four cloves.

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:44.114
Now I think the easiest way to cut garlic

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:46.785
is to first slice off both
of the ends of the clove,

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:50.380
and then give it a quick smash
with the side of your knife.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.053
And that way you can see the garlic just,

00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:56.553
the skin just peels right off.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.098
You don't need to get it too fine.

00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:04.931
You just want to kind of bring out

00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:07.270
those oils of the garlic and chilis.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.103
So that should just about
be good right there.

00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:15.809
Final preparation, gonna
take the holy basil leaves

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.456
off the stock.

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:19.078
And you just kind of pluck the leaf,

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:20.576
get a good bunch of holy basil,

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:24.743
because that is the awesome
flavor of this entire dish.

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:28.765
Alright.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:31.007
This time make sure
it's a really high heat,

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.144
and pour in about one
tablespoon or so of oil.

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:36.718
Swirl that oil around
for just a few seconds.

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:40.033
Once it's really hot, you can
toss in the garlic and chilis.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:41.865
Stir fry that for just a few seconds,

00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:44.138
and then you can toss in your chicken.

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:45.814
And you want to stir fry
that chicken continuously

00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:47.451
for about a minute or so,

00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:49.439
and then you can add the light soy sauce,

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.086
spoon of oyster sauce, tiny bit of sugar,

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:54.356
and lastly a squirt of dark soy sauce.

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:55.436
And if it gets a little bit dry

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:59.019
you can add a little
bit of water in there.

00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:02.938
Final step.

00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:05.256
(coughs)

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:07.695
I like a big handful of holy basil.

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:09.051
As soon as you add that basil

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:10.715
you want to turn off the heat,

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:12.226
but keep stirring.

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.416
This is extremely important,

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:15.447
because you don't want
to overcook that basil,

00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:17.029
which would make it lose its flavor.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.093
Put that right over the rice,

00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:23.584
and then that egg that we fried before.

00:03:23.584 --> 00:03:24.834
Lay that right.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.977
The only reason I cook
is of course to eat,

00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:30.810
so it's hot and fresh.

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.162
Oh.

00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:39.515
That's delicious.

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:42.079
It's spicy and garlicky,

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.934
and you've got that
awesome peppery sensation

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.596
from the holy basil.

00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:49.318
I overcooked it a little
bit unfortunately,

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:50.996
but that's alright.

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:52.631
I like it a little bit runnier.

00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.048
And another bite.

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:07.445
That extra creaminess from the egg yolk.

00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:08.544
Yeah.

00:04:08.544 --> 00:04:10.071
That's where it's at right there.

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:10.904
That is...

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.856
Alright, thank you so much for watching.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.296
I hope you enjoyed this quick recipe.

00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:20.635
And be sure to leave comment below,

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.532
and also give it a quick thumbs up.

00:04:22.532 --> 00:04:24.654
And happy cooking.

00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:28.571
