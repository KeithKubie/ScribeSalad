00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.510
Now there's just one last thing we need
to take care of in our data model,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.170
deletion rules.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.410
What are deletion rules?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.710
Well, let me ask you this,

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.910
what happens to all the notes in a
notebook when this notebook is deleted?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.090
And what happens to the notebook
when a note inside it is deleted?

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.430
These questions can be resolved
setting deletion rules.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.120
Let's start with the Notes property.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.790
The deletion rules are over here,
and we have several options.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.382
No Action, which is usually not
something that you want to use,

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:36.688
Nullify, Cascade, and Deny.

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:40.065
Deny is also something that
you usually don't use.

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:44.350
So, our common options are Nullify and
Cascade.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.210
When we delete a notebook,
what should we do to the notes?

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.440
They should be deleted also.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.260
That's what cascade means.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.370
When notebook is deleted,
all the linked notes will go away.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.720
So this should be Cascade.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.495
And we need to do the same thing for
the inverse relationship.

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:08.335
What happens to the notebook
when one note is deleted?

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.383
Should we delete the notebook?

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:11.855
Obviously not.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:16.833
What we should do is remove
the reference that that notebook had to

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:17.748
this note.

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:20.188
That is what Nullify does.

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:23.100
One last warning before we move on.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.250
Getting your deletion rules wrong is one
of the most common beginner mistakes.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.970
If you set Cascade on both
relationships your app will crash.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.570
We'll talk about that later.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.080
So pause this video now, and
set up your deletion rules now as well.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.940
And that's it,
we're done setting up the model.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.590
And from now on it's going to
be pretty smooth sailing.
