00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.620
&gt;&gt;Mary Jane Deeb: OK,
well welcome to the Africa

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.210
and the Middle East Reading
Room, to the Division.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.510
I'm Mary Jane Deeb.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.300
I'm Chief of the Division
and I am really delighted

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.000
to see you all here today
for what I know is going

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.700
to be a very exciting
program with Edmund Ghareeb.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.930
In a little while he
will be fully introduced

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.520
by our colleague Nawal
Kawar, but I just want

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.980
to add my little bit that
Edmund is an old friend.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.530
And as you all know --
we all have grey hair --

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.060
and it goes back many
decades, our friendship.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.970
At least I met you in Beirut

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:07.020
and we continued being
friends for decades at least.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.730
And we even started the new
millennium together in 2000.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.690
But Edmund is a very
special person

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.160
who has written extensively,
traveled all over the world,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.710
and written on topics that are
always current: the Middle East,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.060
Iraq, the Kurds, and much more.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.150
Edmund is -- also his
books are here as part

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
of our collection
at the library.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.950
And I always say something
about us, about our division,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.080
about the library when I
introduce our programs.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.690
Our division, as
many of you know,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.830
is made up of three sections.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.690
The Near East section is the
largest, both in terms of staff

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.200
and in terms of the collections
that we have custody of.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.620
The second section -- and the
Near East extends from Morocco

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.110
to Afghanistan through
central Asia and the Caucuses.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.600
It's the Arab world.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.280
It is Turkey.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.580
It is Iran.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.690
It is the past and the present.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.680
So it's a very extensive
collection that we hold.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.400
We also have Hebraica which
includes collections from all

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.840
over the world in
Hebrew and Yiddish.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.490
And we are responsible for
Africa, for the whole continent

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.390
of Africa, and its collections
are all over the library.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.360
And we are custodians
only of a small part

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.330
of the African collections.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.170
We have specialists who
speak the many languages

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.100
of the regions, who read
it, and who can advise,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.300
and who are themselves scholars.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.040
So I'm always very proud of
our staff here in the division

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.800
because of the breadth and depth

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.040
of their knowledge
of our materials.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.380
We serve these collections.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.990
So whenever you want
to do research,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.720
please don't hesitate to come.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.740
We've had major exhibits.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.500
We have programs.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.120
We have displays.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.020
And we have, of course,
wonderful scholars who come.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.860
And they come to inform
us, to enlighten us,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.970
to teach us about the research
and the use they have made

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.120
of the collections
in the library.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.940
And they are the interpreters
in a way of our collections.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.790
They make everyone understand
better that which we hold sacred

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.570
in a way, which we
preserve and hold here

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.030
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.370
And so we're always delighted
to have brilliant scholars come

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.480
and inform us like today.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.120
So now I will pass the
baton on to Nawal Kawar,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.200
our specialist here
in the division.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.570
And Nawal has organized
this program

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.570
and sent you all invitations and
so she will introduce Edmund.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.870
Thank you.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.930
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Thank
you all for coming.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.100
It was a pleasure to have
our wonderful scholar,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.900
Dr. Edmund Ghareeb.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.300

[ Applause ]

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.280
&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb:
Thank you very much.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.970
Thank you, Mary Jane, for
that kind introduction,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.470
and also Nawal, many thanks.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.770
That's very kind.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.350
I don't know if you
were talking about me

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.020
or somebody else [laughing]
with that kind introduction.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.670
But Marius and Mary Jane and I
have been many close friends,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.620
as Mary Jane mentioned,
for a long time.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.140
And I've been always an
admirer of both of their works

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.290
and I'm grateful for their
friendship, as I am also

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:32.490
for the friendship of many
of you who are here today.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.720
You know, one of the things
that I wanted to focus on,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.290
I'll try to focus on -- it's
a big topic, by the way,

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.490
and I'll try to be as brief
about some of the points

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.040
as I can but I'll be
happy if we have the time

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.780
to answer some questions later
on during the discussion.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.350
But I want to talk
about this press

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.680
because in the Arab
American press,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.600
the Arabic language specifically
press in the United States

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.320
because it has been a -- you
know, some of these papers,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.990
one of the papers, Al-Hoda,
which was published in 1898,

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:17.370
actually survived
until the 1991-92.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:24.200
And it was the second longest
surviving Arabic language

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.640
newspaper after Al-Ahram.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.320
So that's something
quite, quite unusual.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.620
And actually they also --
and I will talk a little bit

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.260
about that later -- they
made some very significant

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.730
technological contributions
which were used

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:43.180
by the Arab press later on.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.510
One of the things
is that the life

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.630
of the Arab press has
not received a great deal

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.220
of attention by scholars.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.430
There have been some
reports, some studies, a few,

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.800
a couple of books, a
few books here and there

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.800
about the Arabic language
press in the United States.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.760
Although the press was
mentioned as early as 1922,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.350
as one of the main ethnic
presses in the United States

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.410
by Professor Robert
Park who did the first

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.110
and the most significant
study on the ethnic presses

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.570
in the United States
until that time.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.610
Nevertheless, not
much has been done.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:35.690
What's unfortunate is that
while there's this rich history

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.150
and this treasure of the
Arabic language newspapers,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.160
unfortunately many
of them are missing.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.960
Some we don't know what
has happened to them.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.010
Maybe some of them are still
somewhere in the attics of some

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.230
of the Arab Americans,
Lebanese-American immigrants,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:00.300
or the children or grandchildren
because many of the children

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.050
or grandchildren didn't know
Arabic, didn't appreciate,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.780
didn't know what they had.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.740
And I know several people --

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.640
and I know this from
personal experience --

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.170
threw away some of these papers
and books that were published

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.490
in Arabic in the United States.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.990
But we should be grateful,
actually, for the work done

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.060
by people at the
Library of Congress.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.100
It was started by the
former head of this section,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.300
Dr. George Atrilla,
the late George Atrilla

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.040
who actually did amazing work
actually trying to get some

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.830
of these newspapers, magazines,
and books into the library.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.130
And Mary Jane has
continued with this effort

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.010
because this is really
a significant,

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.710
as I've said, treasure.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:53.160
There are some amazing
things in these papers.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.050
But and there is a need,
actually, to try to preserve

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.190
and protect what's
left out there.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.430
I also used -- more than once
-- used the library here.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.040
And actually one of
the former librarians,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.180
or one of your former
colleagues, Dr. George Saleem,

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.320
who is very knowledgeable about
the Arab American literature --

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.820
he did his thesis on
Elia Abu Madi who's one

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.630
of the great Lebanese
poets in the [inaudible]

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.870
and who was the editor also of
Samir Magazine which survived

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.470
for decades, actually,
in the United States.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.720
Although at times
it was a newspaper

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.550
and then it changed
into a magazine.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.530
But he helped me find --
I found an article in one

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.720
of my father's books which
basically was talking, warning,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.020
about the possibility

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.620
of establishing a Jewish
state in Palestine.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.480
And I have the name of the
author and the date which was --

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.060
but I didn't know
where it appeared.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.000
And the date wasn't
really clear.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.780
But there was 19.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.750
But that's a long history.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:11.480
So George Saleem helped direct
me to the work by Henry Milkee

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:17.150
who has done an amazing work
on actually the relationship

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.020
between the press
and the Mahjar,

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.930
some of the Mahjar writers.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.200
And that is something
that's very unusual.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.360
And I appreciated that.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.620
A friend of mine and I, Dr.
Jenapta Tunji, wrote an article

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.920
about this discovery,
this article.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.660
And it was published
about a year ago.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.670
And the article was,
interestingly enough,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.980
written by the least
political of the Majar writers

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.820
and that was Mahain
Naime [phonetic].

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.710
That was quite significant
that Naime would write

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.020
about a political topic.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:15:00.140
Well, the Arabic press, there
have been also a number of,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.480
by the way, some other
studies that have been done.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.860
For example, there is
in addition to Milkee,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.900
there has been Alexa Inaff
[phonetic] did some work --

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.480
she's an historian -- about
the Arab American experience.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.670
And so also in addition to to
her, Mamadou Mudaleli [phonetic]

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.980
and George Saleem did both
the articles on Afifa Karam

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.720
who is very interesting.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.210
I'll try to, if we have time,
to talk a little bit about her

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.530
and maybe use a couple
few quotes from her.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:38.250
She was one of the
first woman journalists

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.700
in the Arab American
press, people the first.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:48.480
She later on established
her own magazine,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.360
[foreign language spoken], The
Woman's New World Magazine,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.350
which survived for about two
years between 1912 and to 1914.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:04.500
But it was amazing the articles,
the topics that she focused on.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.950
But beyond that, even
Parr quoted, actually,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.670
pioneering work in this area.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.620
He said there is a woman
who has written here

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.680
but he didn't even
mention her name.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.370
She is also a novelist in
addition to being a journalist

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.700
and she has eight
books to her name and

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.720
yet she has not received the
attention that she deserves.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.940
Well, in many ways, you know,
something very interesting

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.490
about these newspapers,
this press.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:46.030
You know, between 1892 when the
first newspaper was published

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.470
and around 1929-1930
there was something

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.820
like 57 Arabic language
newspapers published

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.960
in the United States.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.350
And there were something
like 22 magazines published

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.900
in the United States
at that time.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.900
There were many others
that came after.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.260
Some of these survived for
a short period but some

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.690
of them were there for
decades or years, many years.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:16.570
And that's something very
unusual when you think

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.540
of how small the community was.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.390
The Lebanese American,
Syrian American --

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.140
at that time they were all
called Syrians although there

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.420
was a push early on by
the editor of Al-Hoda,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.350
Naoum Mokarzel who was one of
the, again, the founders of one

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.980
of the major newspapers --

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.820
to move away from using
the term Syrian to focusing

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.050
on the term Lebanese, at least
for the Lebanese communities

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.590
but others continued to use
the term interchangeably.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:51.940
And so this is what we
saw during this time,

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:57.040
is that you began
to see this movement

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.160
that basically created a new
environment, the environment

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:07.040
that made it possible for
the major writers, poets,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.050
historians, novelists to
write in these newspapers.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.130
And that's where we
saw the emergence

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.120
of the Mahjar literature.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.260
People like Gibran --
that's where he first wrote.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:24.960
He first wrote his first
articles in al-Mohajer

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.060
which was published
by Ameen Guraieb.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.540
And he published hundreds of
articles in that newspapers

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.740
and that's how he first began
to be known in the community.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.210
And the editor of the
paper really helped him

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:45.090
and helped him especially
with his Arabic as well

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.180
as with other, you know,
projects that he had.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.780
And in a way this was the
same kind of relationship

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.740
that Naoum Mokarzel, the founder

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.140
of Al-Hoda newspaper,
had with Afifa Karam.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.310
And I'll talk a little bit if
we have time earlier about it.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:08.450
Now most of the immigrants who
were here probably by the 1890s,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.910
nobody knows the exact numbers.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.230
There may have been
somewhere around 15,000 people

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:23.480
by the 1890s, maybe
2-300,000 by the early '20s.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.590
So still this community
was small.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.740
But how could this small
community produce so many papers

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:36.520
and so many contributions in
this short period of time?

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.230
Part of it, first of
all, especially that many

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.290
of these people were
not very well educated.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.570
Many of them came
from small villages

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.020
who did not receive
a good education.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.720
Some of them barely -- they
had rudimentary knowledge even

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.020
of Arabic.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.320
They didn't know English.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.100
But there was also amongst
these there were people

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:03.180
who were quite well educated and
who knew English, knew French,

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.000
knew other languages as well.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.690
And these people
basically benefited

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.150
from the renaissance
movement that emerged

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.450
in the 19th century
in the Arab world.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:20.820
And a basic part of it had to
do with the printing presses

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.180
that were established
first in Aleppo in the end

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:30.000
of the 17th century, early
18th, and in Lebanon at some

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.640
of the monasteries in Lebanon

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.320
which at first they
were interested

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.100
in publishing religious
texts and then

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:45.510
after that they turned back to
publish early Arabic treasures

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.440
in poetry, in literate, in
history, religion, etc.,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:58.370
etc. Also, the second one had
to do with missionary schools

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.820
that were established by
American missionaries,

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:06.700
French missionaries, some
other Europeans, Russians.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.550
There was -- the Russians,
for example, opened schools

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.930
for the orthodox Christians.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:19.490
It was known as the
Palestine Oriental Society.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:24.340
That's where somebody like
[inaudible] have studied.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.260
And Naoum ended up
studying in Russia.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.530
But American missionaries
also played a major role

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.040
because they opened
schools and colleges as well

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:41.560
in the whole region from Egypt
to Turkey to Iraq and Iran

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.560
as well, and of course
Lebanon, Syria,

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.650
Palestine benefited a great
deal from these schools.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:55.360
And of course especially the
Syrian Protestant College

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.730
which later on became known

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.900
as American University was
a very important center

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.370
for learning in these areas.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.510
This is where they learned
European languages in a way.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:14.190
They opened their, you know,
their minds to works by writers

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.540
from other countries,
particularly

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.620
from Europe and beyond.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.450
So the tiny elites among
the immigrants were the

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:28.430
beneficiaries of this cultural
renaissance which resulted

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.120
from the enlightenment policies
which were pursued at least

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.600
in Lebanon from the Maanad
and the Shihabi princes

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.840
who opened the country
up to foreign ideas

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.960
and to western missionaries.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.100
The missionaries, of course,
went there to convert Muslims.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.910
They didn't succeed.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.310
They didn't do a very good job.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.410
And I don't think they would
have been convincing in any way.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.330
There were only a handful of
Muslim converts but they ended

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.840
up converting some
Middle Eastern Christians

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.950
to their own faith or sects.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.420
One of the -- also and that's
why we had the first Arabic

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.810
newspapers, actually.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.340
The first Arabic newspaper, by
the way, was started by Napoleon

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.550
when he invaded Egypt.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:19.740
But a couple of years
later that newspaper died.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.330
But the first private Arabic
newspaper was established

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.280
by Rizqallah Hassun
who was from Aleppo.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.430
And he published a very
important newspaper and later

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:35.280
on he also published the
paper and moved it to Egypt

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:42.180
because the atmosphere in Egypt
was much freer at that time.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.730
Then it was mostly the Lebanese

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.920
and to a lesser extent
the Syrians

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.470
who were publishing
newspapers in the Middle East.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.380
In fact, most of the
newspapers that were published

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.350
at that time were
started by the Lebanese.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.520
And if we take a look,
for example, in Egypt,

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.290
you had Al-Ahram
newspaper, for example.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.940
[Inaudible] were
started by Lebanese.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.730
Also, al-Muqtataf Magazine

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:15.140
and Al-Hilal Magazine were also
started by Lebanese journalists.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.440
And that's primarily because
of the much freer environment

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:26.330
that existed at that
time in the area.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:31.330
One of the things that I think
is very important to remember is

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:36.900
that we -- when, you know, these
immigrants first started coming

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.320
to the United States,
actually it was newspapers

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.230
that they first started.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.930
These were the first
institutions they built.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.610
They built these
institutions before they began

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.090
to build churches or mosques.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.710
And that's something very --

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.760
when you think of
it very unusual

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.110
because if you take a look
at some of the newspapers

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.780
that would emerge later
on you'd find that some

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.120
of the papers were
very sectarian.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.870
They were newspapers
that supported,

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.450
defended the orthodox Christians

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.590
against the Maronites
and others.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:14.130
There was a Maronite newspaper,
two Maronite newspapers,

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.400
basically defending
the Maronite community.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.780
Basically you had a newspaper
that defended and sort

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:24.530
of supported the Druze community
and the Muslim community.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.460
But then you also had
newspapers that spoke

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.030
for the community as a whole.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.770
And who defended
actually the community

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.670
as a community regardless?

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.930
And there were many
of the writers who,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.250
especially the Mahjarwriters,
prominent writers,

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.480
people like Amina
Rohani, like Gibran,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.400
like Mikhail Anaymi [phonetic]
who denounced sectarianism

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.310
and denounced that tendency.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.690
Rohani wrote, actually,

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.470
a very important article
denouncing the presses,

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.300
the newspapers, and
he blamed them

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:01.980
for actually devaluing the role
of the press and urged them

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:06.470
to rise above their
sectarian conflict.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.460
So basically you had
others, as I said, however,

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:17.370
that had either more of
a pan-Arab kind of view

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.360
or even the ones that
were either pro-Lebanese

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.770
or pro-Syrian.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:26.860
But primarily many of them
were secular and non-sectarian

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.030
and they defended the
community as a whole.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.920
One of the interesting things
that happened, actually,

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.050
and where we saw the
unity of the community

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.800
and the important role that
newspapers, the presses played,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.310
and it was when around 1907
the US government banned,

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.020
stopped immigration
from the Middle East.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.530
And primarily they considered
the people from the Middle East

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.140
as non-Caucasian Asians.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:01.180
And so the other thing
is they made it difficult

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.140
for them to get citizenship.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.330
That's when the community
led, interestingly enough,

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.970
by two people who were fighting

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.640
at that time [laughing] almost
tooth and nail with each other.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.650
And these were basically
Najeeb Diab who was the editor

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.410
of Meraat ul Gharb --
the Mirror of the West --

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:24.530
and Naoum Markezel who
was the head of Al-Hoda.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.680
They were -- almost every week
they were attacking each other.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.690
But when this issue came
up they joined together.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.840
They joined something like
what you might call a lobby

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.590
and they came to Washington.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.530
Actually that was the title
of one of the articles

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.230
by one of the writers.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.590
He said onto Washington.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:51.470
And so they united and they
were able to change the position

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.570
of the government at that time.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.830
The press, actually -- and
there were a number of them.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.070
Maybe if we can look at them,
some of them, I'll show you

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.930
at least some of the photos
of some of these papers.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.750
But they played a
very important role.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.340
Thank you.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.570
They played a very important
role in this area in the sense

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.600
that they were -- first of
all, they were [inaudible].

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.120
For example, during
the First World War --

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.490
and I know this from
personal, by example,

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.290
because I know my relatives who
had immigrated to this country

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.110
at that time would tell me
that the news of the war,

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.790
the First World War, the news
that people were dying of hunger

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.860
or starvation, of the
executions that took place

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.250
under [inaudible] of
politicians, of activists,

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.650
nationalists, were
actually making many people

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.420
in the community
very much concerned

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.860
about what was going on.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.040
And the way to find out what
was happening was primarily

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.690
through the newspapers that
were here at that time.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.740
You know, the second thing is

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:06.950
that they also expressed these
thoughts, the immigrants,

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.290
a great deal about
the United States.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.610
There were a number of
them who published books

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:16.560
about the American Constitution
in Arabic, about American laws.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.020
They published also about the
history of the United States.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.630
Several books, actually,
came out, were published

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:29.630
about the history of the
US and also how to deal

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.210
with their day-to-day life.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.170
That was something that
was basically very,

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:39.410
very important during
this period.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.790
In addition, some of these
papers, especially Al-Hoda,

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.680
actually were financially
successful.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.180
By the early '30s,
around 1931-32,

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:55.230
they had 30,000 subscribers
from all over the world.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.200
Most of them, of course, were
from the United States but some

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.190
of them were from Latin
America, all different countries

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.140
in Latin America,
where by the way,

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.500
there was also a vibrant
Arabic language press.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.860
In fact, the Arabic
language press

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.790
in South America started before
the Arabic language press

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.360
in the United States.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:22.170
The first press newspaper was
established in Brazil in 1890.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:29.430
And so what we saw during
this period is that we began

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:34.120
to see these newspapers
also had sections --

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.810
for example, a section
talking about your doctor.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.600
So basically if you're
having a problem,

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.110
you wrote to the newspaper.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.470
You wrote a letter to the doctor
who would answer the questions

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.580
which was in many
ways very modern,

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.380
something like what
we have been hearing

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.570
about basically our
people on radio

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.600
and television these
days doing it.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.670
But that was very
quite interesting.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:00.610
They had also, they said,
your immigrant advisor.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.000
Basically if you had
problems, legal problems,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.470
if you had any questions
to do, how to, for example,

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.970
establish a company
or anything like that.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.440
They also had somebody who
would write a weekly column

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.790
about this.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.710
Maybe we can just take a look
at some of these newspapers.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.810
Al Bahrayn, which is a
very, very important paper.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.770
And this was established
by Samiam Abdul

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.460
and Abbas Abu Abushepra
[phonetic] at that time.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.080
And it was an excellent
paper, actually.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.080
In the beginning its
attitudes, its perspective was

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.540
in the beginning
somewhat an Islamic

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:45.500
but then it became pan-Arab
and what was critical

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.060
and as time went by they
became much more secular.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.940
The [inaudible] who
some of you may know,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:58.000
a very eloquent speaker and
a scholar and a good scholar

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.090
who used to read Al
Bahrayn regularly,

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.770
they said of Al Bahrayn
that this was a newspaper

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.430
that did not -- sorry?

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.730
Where was it?

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.030
&gt;&gt; In New York.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.330
&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb:
In New York, yeah.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.600
And later on, however, it
moved after it was taken

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.530
over by Rajid Bahar,
another prominent journalist,

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.540
and he moved it to Detroit.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.850
But basically it
was in New York.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.250
So he said, Faid Sael said,

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:33.060
he said this newspaper is not
going to fabricate stories.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.730
We'll not fabricate any story.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:41.800
And they will not censor any
story because something's bad

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.030
and we don't want
to hear about it.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.890
So and he used the
term, actually,

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.460
it's almost an exact translation
for what we're hearing a lot

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.740
about these days, the fake news.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.610
He said, we'll never
publish fake news.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:58.660
So it's a fascinating paper.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.990
Another paper was [foreign
language], actually.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:06.740
It was started by
Shebelle Damouz [phonetic]

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.200
around 1906, I think.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:15.850
And at that time he
was primarily focusing

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:20.000
on literary issues, cultural
issues, historical issues.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.660
He didn't basically do some
of the things that Al-Hoda

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.960
or Meraat ul Gharb did like
your doctor and your advisor,

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.300
etc. And later on it was picked
up by Fawzi Lebraydi [phonetic]

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:39.700
who is from the same hometown
as Damouz and it was published

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.870
and then moved at
one time to Detroit.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:50.360
I had the privilege of
meeting recently the daughter

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.720
of Fawzi Lebraydi and I was
asking her about how did she --

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.590
she lives in New York.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:00.660
How did her father
finance his newspaper?

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.960
And she said -- she laughed.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.450
She said, well sometimes he got
it from basically advertising

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.720
and that's something
very also interesting

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.890
and this is something
clearly American in the sense

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:15.610
that these newspapers rely to a
large extent on advertisements.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.490
And they made, like
Al-Hoda made a lot of money

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:21.780
from these advertisements.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.110
But she said he did that but
he also relied on friends.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.810
And sometimes -- it was
the paper started weekly.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:30.200
By twice a week.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.170
And then when money
wasn't coming in,

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.470
he changed it to weekly.

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:37.070
And then he had to go
travel from state to state

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.990
to get some friends to
contribute some money for him

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:43.260
to keep the newspaper going.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.940
But he also had -- [inaudible]
was quite interesting

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.650
in the sense that it focused
a great deal of attention

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.280
on developments in
the Arab world also

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.580
and in Lebanon and Syria.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.080
They supported the independence

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.130
of the Arab countries,
self-determination.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.230
They supported -- they
wrote, for example,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.070
about Abd al-Karim El-Khattabi
in Morocco who was one

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:09.090
of the rebel opposing
colonial control.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.470
They focused on what was
happening in Tunisia.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.780
So it's quite interesting.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:18.450
Another thing that another
newspaper we have is like --

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.080
let me give you a
look at Al-Hoda.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.710
Al-Hoda is quite, it's probably
actually, as I mentioned

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.870
in the beginning, it's the
most influential newspaper.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:34.810
It had excellent -- the
editor had excellent command

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.400
of the Arabic language.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.950
He emphasized the significance

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:47.950
that he has a publication
that's written in very eloquent

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:52.540
and correct grammatically
Arabic,

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.220
unlike his brother Salloum
who later would establish one

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.190
of the first English language
magazines in the United States

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:07.250
between 1926 and 1932 which
was probably the best magazine

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.790
that had appeared
talking about the region.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.370
And this was known
as The Syrian World.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:18.020
It had people like
Gibran, like Phillip Hitti,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:22.650
like [indecipherable name],
Rihani, and many others as well

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.540
as American writers
contributing to it.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.920
They had political articles.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.220
They had historical articles.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.570
They had a great deal of
literary works, translations

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.640
from Arabic literature
to English.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:40.200
They had sections focusing on
developments in the Arab world

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.100
at that time in different
Arab countries.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.220
Of course, the main focus
was mostly Lebanon, Syria,

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.170
to a lesser extent
Iraq, Palestine,

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:55.190
but that was something
that was very significant.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:57.730
In addition to to this, if
we can take a note, also,

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:01.880
to another newspaper,
maybe, Meraat ul Gharb.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:11.680
This is the paper which really
was the competitor of Al-Hoda.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.530
And this was published
by Najeeb Diab.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:18.740
Najeeb Diab basically supported
more or less an orthodox view,

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:24.090
the orthodox Christian
perspective, at that time.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.940
Najeeb Diab actually
was very critical.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.710
While Naoum Markezel
was somewhat soft

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.020
on the Ottoman government --

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:36.170
he was careful because he had
also some correspondence there

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.500
and some subscribers.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.850
But he later on would
become also a severe critic

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.310
of the Ottoman government.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.430
Meraat ul Gharb from the
beginning was a severe critic

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:49.130
of the Ottoman government and
called for independence of that

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.140
of the Arab-speaking lands.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.210
They even opened the
door sometimes for a call

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:58.660
if there should be a caliphate
should the caliphates would

00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.980
return to the Arabs.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.130
It would not be in the Ottoman.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:08.390
And but Najeeb Diab was
sentenced to death when he was

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.380
in the Middle East because
of his political activities

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.680
and he fled.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.510
And his property was
expropriated by the government.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.960
And he fled the year later.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.200
By the way, Naoum
Markezel and a number

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.320
of other editors were
sentenced to death

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.880
by the Ottoman government
and some, by the way,

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.150
who were in the Middle East
were executed, were caught

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.880
and some were imprisoned.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.700
If we can just take a
look at the Neisser,

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.800
one of the other papers.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.900
That's the paper.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.500
I was interested
in it personally

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.320
because my father used to write
some articles in this paper.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.970
It used to be known as The
Syrian Eagle and it was

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:58.230
by another very activist
nationalist editor Najeeb

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:04.030
Badran, who also emphasized
a great deal not only

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.120
on the literary side but
on the political side.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.460
But the mirror art was very
similar to Al-Hoda in the sense

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:16.860
that they had a great deal of
emphasis on the literary work

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.830
because primarily when we think
of it, Gibran actually wrote,

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.330
learned, and much of what
although later he would write

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.780
in other papers he started,
as I said, in Al-Mouhajir,

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.080
the newspaper of [inaudible].

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.110
Rohani, although
he later on broke

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:35.120
with his relative Naoum
Markezel, the editor of Al-Hoda,

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.100
that's where he started
his writing was in Al-Hoda.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.840
Later on, however,

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.800
while Markezel adopted a
Lebanese nationalist respect --

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.350
he established the Lebanese
National Organization,

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.340
he called for the
independence of Lebanon --

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.180
Rohani adopted what you might
call a pan-Arabist perspective

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:02.300
and so he broke away from Naoum
Markezel and began to write

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.970
in some of the other
publications.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.550
For example, Asser [phonetic]

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.630
which is another
important publication.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.930
I don't know if we have a --

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.750
I don't think we
have a picture of it.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.070
Asser was established by
Abdul Messi Habdid [phonetic]

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.280
who is a Syrian from Homs.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.440
It was a Syrian nationalist
newspaper.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.860
It said basically they
believed there was no difference

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.300
between Lebanese
Syrians, Palestinians,

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.160
Jordanians, or Iraqis.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:36.390
They should all be --
[inaudible] one Syria.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:48.250
But he also opened the doors
to people like Nedra Haddad,

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.760
for example, was one of
the prominent writers,

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.750
William Hetsfleez [phonetic],
Gibran, [inaudible],

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:59.100
and a number of others,
Phillip Hechty, [inaudible],

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:03.700
they began to write
in this paper.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.210
And it survived,
actually, up until the '50s.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:14.880
Let me quickly just mention
a couple of things I wanted

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.960
to mention about 'Af?fa Karam
who was a very unusual --

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.150
I mean, I didn't know much
about her in the beginning

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:27.130
but when I was looking at some
of the material about her.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:33.380
She left Lebanon -- she was
born in 1883, married in 1897.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.570
She was 14 years old when
she got married to a doctor

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.770
who was a distant
relative of her family.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.950
It was an arranged marriage
and she came to this country.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.760
She had studied in some of the
catholic schools in Lebanon

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.630
and in some of her local schools
but she came from a family

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.700
that had connections
with a prominent school

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.810
of [foreign language]
and from the village

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.830
of Croshema [phonetic].

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.130
It's [inaudible] which had --

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.820
that's where people like the
Bostanais and others had,

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.470
you know, had the renaissance
of the Arabic language

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:09.770
and the Arabic literature.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.920
And so she was interested
in, even from that time.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.980
When she got to the
United States about a year

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.950
or two later she read an article
that was written by a priest.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:26.620
And she didn't like what he was
saying about the role of woman.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:30.840
So she wrote an article and
basically criticizing him.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.730
Then she wanted to
pull the article back.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.620
She thought she went too far.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:39.120
But Naoum Merkezel encouraged
her, edited it for her.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.990
And later on she began
to ask him for books.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.650
She was living in Louisiana
with her husband and he told her

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:50.010
that if she wants to
write he would help her

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.640
and improve her Arabic so
that she could write well

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:59.530
and also write articles.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:04.490
And he said she can write
about any topic she wants.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.890
And she was actually one

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.210
of 600 American woman
journalists at that time.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.540
There were only 600
American women

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.060
who were journalists
during this period.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.620
But she focused -- much
of her work focused

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.220
on liberty and freedom.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:23.980
She was both criticizing
and praising these concepts

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.910
in the American context.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.780
And while she praised the
American idea of freedom,

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.960
Karam also asserted
that America is one

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.200
of the most dangerous
countries for young people given

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.160
to high cost of living and
expectations of lavishness

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.290
which could put youth at risk
entering the workforce in order

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:47.140
to make money by
any means necessary.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:51.300
Karam's womanhood played
a very important role

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.830
in her writing.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:57.000
She stated that she did not
become a writer for fame

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.860
or money but rather to advance
the issues of her fellow women.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.740
And she was known
to be the voice

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.950
of the Arab women's
liberation movement.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:10.270
And she published one of
the four magazines devoted

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.970
to women's issues in the
whole Arabic speaking world

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:15.270
at that time.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.570
So one of them was here.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.870
Later on there was
another paper,

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.600
although it was not
just focusing on women.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.010
That was called [foreign
language].

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.500
I think -- do we
have a picture of it?

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.800
I think we --

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.610
&gt;&gt; Is that a newspaper?

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.080
&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb:
It's a magazine.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.640
And so basically -- no.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.980
So that was published by
Apubref Ayel [phonetic]

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:41.260
and it also was quite
an impressive paper.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.500
Let me use one quote
from what she said.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.730
She said just women have
the right to newspapers.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.420
She criticized newspapers
including Al-Hoda

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.810
because they were not devoting
enough time for women's issues.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.490
She said women are subscribers

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:59.770
and pay their subscriptions
like men.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.090
Women are still behind

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.120
in reforming themselves
on their own.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.790
Thus they need the
support of men.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:09.570
This is why she wrote we
need to have more articles,

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.050
more publications,
devote themselves

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.610
to the issues of women.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.830
She was not only a defendant
of women's issues but one

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:20.140
of the interesting things about
her, she also was very critical

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.680
of the way African Americans,

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.790
black Americans were
being treated also

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.830
in the United States
at that time.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.070
And she wrote a number
of articles about this.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.970
And she was very much
opposed to violence.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:36.740
But primarily all of
these publications,

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.960
they helped link the
people of the Diaspora

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.100
and the Arab-American community

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:50.470
with their home and
their old homes.

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:54.170
They linked them with the other
immigrants in North America,

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.140
South America, Canada.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.640
They also did something else.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.070
They began to help modernize
the way newspapers function.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.470
They began to learn from
the American experience how

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.900
to write this happened with
the [inaudible] of America,

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.790
the star of America which
was the first newspaper.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.930
And they began to
put the quick summary

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:17.370
in the beginning of the article.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.290
And they tried to separate --

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.220
although it wasn't
always the same

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.060
but we have the same
problem today --

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.640
separate opinion from news.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:30.520
And so in many ways this was a
very significant contribution

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.820
that they made.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.030
They also introduced -- that's
what I wanted to mention earlier

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.560
about the linotype machine by
the brother of Naoum Merkezel,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.570
Salloum Merkezel, the
editor of The Syrian World.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.900
He basically used a
typesetting machine

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:48.420
and he modernized it
basically to use Arabic letters

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.510
in a much easier
way and a faster way

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:54.490
to publish Arabic
newspapers or books.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:58.050
And this machine, the linotype
machine, was imported later

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:01.010
on first by Allah
Haram in Egypt and then

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:05.300
by other Arabic language
newspapers.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.940
So they really, they
also had correspondence.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.960
They had correspondence
and assembled in Damascus

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.570
and Cairo and Cuba and Havana.

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.660
So this was quite,
quite significant.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.450
So basically this was they
began to decline basically

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:22.710
from the '30s, although
they continued.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:26.860
But I think overall we can say
that they made a difference

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.430
and they added color to
the American rainbow.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.540
Let me just show you some
pictures maybe of some

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.170
of the books that have been

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.000
and the magazines
that were published.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.170
One of the magazines I
didn't mention was Al-Funun.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:44.470
Al-Funun was probably one
of the -- it was published,

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:49.220
started to be published
in 1912 by Nasib Arida.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:55.210
And he attracted -- Naimy became
one of its editors at one time.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.940
He focused on literary issues.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:02.190
He focused on cultural
issues, on poetry, on novels,

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.550
and was very, very impressive.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.240
And it looked beautiful.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.570
It was -- from every
angle you looked

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:13.410
at it it was quite impressive,
whether it was the printing,

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.550
the subject matter,
the topics, etc.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:23.590

whereby focus was not on --

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:33.350
it was one of the few magazines
that focused on women's issues.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:35.140
And I don't know if
you can read the titles

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.060
of some of the articles.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.500
That will give you
an interesting idea

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:44.130
of what they wanted
to talk about.

Let us -- also quickly let me
show you some of the other books

that were published

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:52.470
by the Arabic Language

This [foreign language
spoken], this was done

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:58.540
by Abdul Messi Hadded
[phonetic] and it was

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.300
with the help of Nasib Arida.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.980
They had basically -- first of
all they wrote the introduction

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.540
of the history of
the immigration

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.130
to the United States,
the history of Syria,

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:10.430
then they had the names

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.510
of businesses and/or
organizations --

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:17.450
different kinds of organization,
social, civic, religious,

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.460
etc. -- in the United States.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.130
One of them that
was very interesting

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.470
to me it was called
the Syrian Israelite

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:27.960
Charitable Association.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.260
So it was very interesting.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:34.770
This was in 1930, around '29-30.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:36.270
So there was an organization

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:39.870
because this was apparently
Jews, you know, from Lebanon

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.650
and Syria who considered
themselves

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:45.950
to be Syrians at that time.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.580

Syrian World.

It's just the cover of it.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.960
This is the one Salloum
Merkezel, Naoum's brother --

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.000
and he, by the way, after
his brother Naoum died

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.170
in 1932 he had to
close The Syrian World

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:08.510
because he wasn't making
enough money at that time.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:14.370
He was having problems but
he left it to someone else

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.220
to edit it and then he went to
take over his brother's paper,

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:23.690
Al-Hoda, and he somewhat changed
the direction of the paper.

[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:35.660
This is -- by the way this
is the Gibran's Processions

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.130
which was published
in Arabic in 1949.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:43.700
And this is a real
book, by the way.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:47.290
This was a copy that
my father had.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:53.620
And it has this -- he had given
it to a present to someone else.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.660
And maybe if we can
take a look at that.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:03.300
By the way, some of the poems
are sang by Farooz today.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.000
But it received some criticism

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.010
by like Mahmoud al-Bezla Akahd
[phonetic] because they said

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:09.650
that some of the words

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:14.160
that Gibran was using
were not literary

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.960
or were not really
grammatically correct.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.820
And then he was criticized
by Naimy who said,

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:26.050
you know, he's writing poetry.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:28.180
It's readable poetry.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.800
It's beautiful poetry.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.600
It doesn't matter even if he --

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.000
because somebody said something
1,000 years ago that we have

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.300
to follow on the same path.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:42.030
So this is, we can -- let's see.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.330

I was going to show
you at least.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.350
Gibran had given this
to a friend of his,

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.050
Maria Garland, in New York.

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.360
And there are only
500 copies of this.

which was known as
the Sahr [inaudible].

Actually almost all

of the Mahjar writers
would contribute to this.

to the Saneb.

There's no doubt that the papers
also saw themselves in some way,

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.940
or at least some of the
editors did and you can say

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.330

Although others, conservatives,
criticized them and they said

that they were almost heretics
and nevertheless these editors,

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.180
some of them, they felt that
they have a duty also to have --

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.950
well to learn, to pass
on what they learned

of principles and ideals

They wanted them to be, to
assimilate in the United States

but also so that they
could become good citizens

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:53.330

not only to their new lands

through these scientific
advancements --

like Asheb in Tunisia

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.200
&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb:
There's no doubt that --

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.520
by the way, most of these
publications have passed away,

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.820
have died.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.150
Some of them, as I said,
survived like Al-Hoda

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:30.480
for almost 100 years,
almost 100 years.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.310
Some of them survived
for a couple of years

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:36.270
like [foreign language
spoken], The Woman's New World,

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.570
[foreign language spoken].

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.280
Although she continued
to write in Al-Hoda

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:45.390
and other publications
and other,

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:46.690
[foreign language
spoken], this other paper

00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:49.690
which focused on women's issues.

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:53.120
But there was a period

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.270
where there was a very
negative reaction to the people

00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:00.390
that were still called Syrians.

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:04.190
Sometimes there were also a few

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:10.570
who called them Turks
at that time.

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.920
I read this and somebody
else has quoted this.

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.890
I don't remember the
name of the congressman.

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:22.500
There was a congressman who
basically was running for office

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:25.530
in South Carolina at
the time of immigration

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:29.030
and he said the Syrians
are the worst of the people

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:36.410
who came either from Asia
Minor or Sicily or Greece.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.400
And he said that if I was to win

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400
with their votes, I
don't want to win.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.470
I'd prefer to have the vote
of the Negroes [laughing]

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:44.130
than have the vote
of the Syrians.

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:45.660
This is this kind
of [laughing] --

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:48.160
I mean, you had this
kind of language

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.450
at least among some
of the people.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:58.920
But overall, I think this
community I think proved they

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.870
succeeded at least in
terms of they succeeded

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.880
in many ways in the sense first.

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.760
Many of them, as I said,
didn't have any education.

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.060
They came here.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.160
Some of them carried bags
on their backs and they went

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:13.960
to sell goods in different
parts of the United States.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.040
Some of them became farmers.

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.860
But -- and by the way, that
was something very interesting

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:25.030
that has nothing to do with your
question but it's significant

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.350
in the sense that one of the
reasons they started coming

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.180
to the United States
or to travel.

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:31.880
Of course there was
the religious,

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.350
the political oppression.

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:34.790
Both of these were factors.

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:39.820
But also the desire to
have a better way of life.

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:43.980
They heard the news after
the Homestead Act was passed

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:55.480
in the United States by, I
think it was President Lincoln

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.040
if I'm not wrong.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.130
That the American king, the king
of America, was giving free land

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.400
to peasants, to farmers.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.870
And so that's why
some of them --

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.620
actually if you take a look
at where people came from,

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.360
most of the people who came
in the beginning, the first,

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.390
second wave of immigration came

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:16.740
from very small villages
and towns.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.780
And many of them were farmers
or a few were artisans.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.170
So you know, so this
was quite something

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:22.470
that was quite significant.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:27.130
But I think they tried whenever
there was pressure on them --

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:29.800
like with the point when
they had difficulty getting

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.980
citizenship and later on
when there was an attempt

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:36.300
to ban immigration from there
because they considered them

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:40.370
to be non-Caucasians,
the community, all of it.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.430
And they had a lot of support
from Americans at that time.

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.730
And they fought back.

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:46.060
And that was the way.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.360
The other way they believed

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.890
that if they succeed
in American society.

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:51.920
They educated their
children, for example.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.480
That's why it ended up many
of them became professionals.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.030
You had a lot of lawyers,
doctors, merchants,

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:06.920
business people in addition to
people who own the, you know,

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.290
small stores or who
still work in --

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.590
there are all kinds

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:14.510
but generally overall
the community succeed.

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:23.100
[ Inaudible Comments ]

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.260
The pictures of the
newspapers, yes.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.770
They are from the
library's selections.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:31.060
But the books are my books.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.500
They are copies that I have.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.890
And that's why I think it's very
important -- if any of you know,

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:41.190
I think, to try to preserve them
there were something like close

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:44.360
to 500 books that I know
of that were published

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.770
in the United States in Arabic.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.100
These included books on
the history of America,

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.330
two books on the history
of the French Revolution,

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:56.800
two books on the
history of Russia and one

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.620
on the Bolshevik revolution.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:03.920
They had several books, at
least, on American government,

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.530
American laws, the
US Constitution.

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:11.080
There are books,
novels, several novels.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.720
Something that's very unusual

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.910
and unfortunately I didn't
find some of these at the time

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:19.420
and I asked some of the
librarians to fine them --

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:24.930
these are books what you'd
call Arabic folk poetry

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:26.230
or zaja [phonetic].

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:29.310
And there were several
books that were published

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.180
in this country of zaja poetry.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:37.530
I have a couple of them,
two or three of them,

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:41.050
but I know that there are
several others out there

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.350
and they're not there.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:46.530
So basically it would be good,
any of us, if you know anybody

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:50.560
who has some of these books
or if you know of anybody

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.390
who maybe they would want to
donate them or make copies

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.540
of them because once they
are gone they are gone.

so much for [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask you
about the newspapers.

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:14.110
You said you got the pictures
from the Library of Congress.

01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:18.540
I know the Library of Congress
is doing a [inaudible] --

is what we've written.

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:24.650
Are these newspapers included
in commonplace America?

&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb: This
is -- I should ask you.

I have no idea.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:28.550
Not now. We haven't started
but that's a good idea.

01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:29.850
We can start that.

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:31.150
&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb: Ah,
that's a very good point,

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:32.450
very good question.

[ Inaudible Comments ]

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.730
&gt;&gt; I've been working
on an article

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:45.470
on [inaudible] American
publishing.

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:58.040
And one of the things that I
discovered about the Library

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:13.600
of Congress is that -- well not
just the Library of Congress

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.390
but a lot of things
do get [inaudible].

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:22.210
So I think because the
fees were too high.

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:26.800
[Inaudible] And they
also were coming

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.040
from an oppressive government.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:42.300
They had this fear of
governments in general.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.600
[Inaudible]

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.900
&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb: To tell
you the truth I don't know.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.520
But I know for example,
one thing, that the point

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.600
that you mentioned about fear of
repressive government in a way.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.980
For example, that editor
of [inaudible] of America,

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.460
the first publication.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.750
By the way he was
a medical doctor.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:03.420
His two sons -- he comes from
the town of Arbil in Syria

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.660
where there's a lot of
attacks now taking place.

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.530
Although they are changing
the name to Arbin, not Arbil.

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:13.440
Two of his sons -- they came
as a family, the first family

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.370
that came to the United
States in the 1870s.

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:21.960
And he found it very difficult
to try to get Arabic letters

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.940
so that you could publish,
print the newspaper.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.970
So he had to appeal to the --

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:31.730
he had to get the approval of
the sultans from all the way.

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.320
And he was very careful.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.380
He was very pro-Ottoman, almost,
in several of his editorials.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.070
You know, so that, I think,

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:45.230
I'm sure that was a factor
to take into account.

01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:47.030
Yeah?

No, it wasn't, actually.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.480
That's a very good question.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.240
You know, that's why I
was saying that's what's

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.760
so interesting about
these papers.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.140
For example, the idea of having
correspondence at that time,

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.740
that's amazing when
you think of it.

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:15.010
Having a correspondent in
[inaudible] or in Cairo

01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:17.550
or in Damascus or
in Havana, Cuba.

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:20.390
Or you have people
writing from Brazil.

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:23.460
I mean, brought in
a way there a sense

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:27.770
of some globalization taking
place to a certain extent.

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:32.400
But the number of
readers, I think, was --

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.580
you know, for example,
probably the highest circulation

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:40.990
newspaper was Al-Hoda and
they had 30,000 subscribers.

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:45.120
But that doesn't mean that these
were the only ones who read it

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.470
because sometimes the newspaper
would go from hand to hand.

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:50.270
I mean, I remember
when I first came

01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:54.290
to the United States I
would go and sit with some

01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:56.140
of the early immigrants
that came.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:58.080
I liked the stories
that they had.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.380
I always enjoyed it.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.470
And some of them had subscribed
to some of these papers

01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:04.020
and they would ask
me to read the paper

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.350
for them [laughing] you know?

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:09.220
So that's partly how I
became interested in it.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.270
So that -- and they
would pass the newspaper.

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:14.460
So one person subscribes
but maybe at 15

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.990
or 20 people read the paper.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.290

there's no doubt there was

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.880
strong connection.

publication maybe Thomas would

a secularist among

debate, several debates

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:47.510
with Muhammad Abduh and over in
Al-Menaar and he would respond

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:49.830
with all-Jami'ah over religion.

01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:53.810
He published a book about
[inaudible] and some people said

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:55.890
that this was anti-Muslim.

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:57.880
But Egypt still had, you know,

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.490
a much more freer
environment than, say,

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:01.790
under the Ottoman government.

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.600
And this was published the year

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.590
so that was a very
important factor.

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:08.080
Later because he was beginning

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.250
to feel uncomfortable
he brought it here.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:16.040
And this, actually, magazine
focused on philosophical issues,

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.880
on scientific issues,

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.270
and actually didn't find
much of an audience.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.210
So after three years
he went back to Egypt.

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:25.850
You know, but that's the
-- there was this kind of.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:29.350
There were writings in
the Egyptian newspaper

01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:32.020
about what was being written

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.310
in the Mahjar newspapers
and vice versa.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:37.800
There was a very close
connection with Syria,

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.660
with Lebanon, with some of
the other Arab countries.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.510
We have take one more, I
think, or do you have --

01:08:43.510 --> 01:09:09.670
[ Inaudible Comments ]

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:13.730
Yes, I would say in the
1930s and the 1940s.

01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:15.600
That's when the beginning
of the decline

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.910
but there were different waves.

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:20.920
There was the wave, for
example, that came after '67.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.670
The '67 war had a
very important impact

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:28.080
on changing the way Arab
Americans as a whole began

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.760
to look at the situation,
then began to organize,

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.660
and began to publish
news publications.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:37.490
There were also some important
English language publications

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.790
during this period.

01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:42.910
For example, such as George
[inaudible]'s The Arab World.

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:46.230
That was a very important
publication.

01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:51.040
It focused on issues related
to the US, its foreign policy,

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.680
and also to what was going
on in the Middle East.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.810
And he covered almost
the whole Arab world.

01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:59.530
There was also a publication
by George Dibbs called Caravan

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:02.700
which was actually an
excellent publication.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.020
And then we began to
see the revival of some

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.880
of these publications by
the different communities.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.380
There were Iraqi newspapers.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.830
There were Egyptian newspapers.

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.880
Basically I'm not saying in
the sense that they only appeal

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.510
to these communities but they
focus on these communities.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:33.430

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:34.730
Me?

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.030
[ Inaudible Comments ]

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:38.810
Some. Actually that's
a very good question.

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:43.650
I know probably the best places
to find these newspapers: here,

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:48.290
the Library of Congress;
New York Public Library;

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:50.670
the Arab American Museum;

01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:58.320
and yes I think there is also
the University of Minnesota

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.770
if I am not wrong also has it.

01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:06.930
But unfortunately I don't think
we have a complete set of some

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:09.220
of these publications.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.590
There may still be.

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:14.540
I hope they preserve
it -- Estefan.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:19.290
Faris Estefan who basically took
over Al-Hoda in its last years.

01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:22.940
He bought it but the editors
were very prominent Arab poets

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:27.930
like Hari Ghrezb [phonetic]
and Yusuf Hufal [phonetic]

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:29.820
who also had been publisher

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.460
of Shar magazine,
a poetry magazine.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:37.240
He also was publishing
and editor Al-Hoda.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.180
But I hear that he
has a complete copy

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.300
and that is a priceless treasure

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:49.580
that somebody should
try to get and keep.

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb:
OK, [inaudible].

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.670

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:54.990
&gt;&gt; Edmund Ghareeb: Thank you.

01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:57.510

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:12.900

of the Library of Congress.
