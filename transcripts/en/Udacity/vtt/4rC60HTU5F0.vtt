00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
Now a mistake that a lot of people make

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:06.166
is to confound slope and correlation.

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.533
In other words, if they find that

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.467
the slope of the line fits the data is 1,

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:13.400
that the data are correlated,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.867
and that's not true.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.800
The slope is just the slope.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.000
Correlation is a measure of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.100
how tightly do these individual
points fit that line?

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.200
So you could have a shallow slope but

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.266
the data tightly fitting that line,
and thus a higher correlation.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.734
Or you could have a steeper line and

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:40.900
the data fitting that line
at a higher correlation.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.467
Correlation is just a measure of how
tightly do those dots fit the line.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:52.433
And you can have
a correlation from 0 to 1.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.400
0 meaning it's not correlated at all,

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.333
And 1 meaning itâ€™s very highly correlated

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.367
Now add a scatter plot for
another stock, ABC,

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:08.200
and again each one of these dots represents
the daily return of SPY versus ABC, 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.066
and we fit a line to it, and
it turns out it's got a slope of two, so

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.467
now we're going to ask you
a couple of questions about it.
