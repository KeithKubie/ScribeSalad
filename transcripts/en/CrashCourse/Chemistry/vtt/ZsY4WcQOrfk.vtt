00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
Life is chaos.
The whole universe is chaos.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.719
Whether it's the terrible state of my office
or the slow degradation of my body into dust,

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.650
the universe tends toward disorder.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.220
But why, why is the universe structured in
this terrible and callous way?

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.740
Well, it turns out that it's not really the
universe's fault.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.840
If you think about it there's only one way, or at best, maybe a few ways for things to be arranged in an organized way.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.220
But there are nearly infinite other ways for
those same things to be arranged.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.110
The simple rules of probability dictate that
it's much more likely for stuff,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.470
whether it's the stuff on my desk or the particles
and energy that make up my concept of self,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.230
to be in one of the many disorganized states
than in one of the few organized states.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410
It's simple math and it's unavoidable.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.310
So unavoidable that it is in fact our Second
Law of Thermodynamics, which says that:

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.100
"Any spontaneous process increases the disorder
or randomness of the universe."

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.720
Processes that don't increase the disorder of the universe require work to be done in opposition to the disorder,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.360
and are in fact often impossible to achieve.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.670
The very act of putting one system in order
requires that other systems become disordered.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.340
Think of it this way: Your lunch was composed
of an extremely ordered set of molecules.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.479
And it gave you the energy to clean up your
house, maybe.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.439
And it had to be broken down into less ordered
nutrient molecule for you to do that.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.499
Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, and those
molecules were broken down even further as

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.409
they were converted to energy in your cells,

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.189
and your body used some of that energy to
power your muscles as you cleaned your house.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.569
But a bunch of that energy was used to do things like keep your heart beating, and breathe, and make sweat,

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.440
and some of that was lost to the surroundings in the form of random movement, and most importantly, heat.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.020
By the time you've finished your house may be orderly but the remains of your lunch molecules are all over the place.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.429
And that's only one of the many systems that
became less orderly while you worked.

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.560
So yes, cleaning your house in fact increased
the overall disorder of the universe.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.100
Next time someone gives you a hard time about the state of your house you can tell them that.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.180
Obviously disorder is a pretty big deal in the universe, and that makes it a pretty big deal in chemistry.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.200
So scientists have a special name for it:
entropy.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.550
Entropy is a measure of molecular randomness,
or disorder.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.060
And even though people complain about
the disorder in their lives, it's not all bad news.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.500
Entropy helps make chemical reactions possible,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.040
and it helps us predict how much useful work
can be extracted from a reaction.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.110
We all have to live with disorder so you might
as well understand it.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.310
For the next ten minutes I want you to embrace
the chaos.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:39.330
[Theme Muusic]

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.840
So what does the Second Law of Thermodynamics
mean when it says:

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.670
"Any spontaneous process increases the disorder
of the universe."

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.140
"Spontaneous" simply means a process that
doesn't need outside energy to keep it going.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.400
And it goes the other way too, anything that increases the disorder of the universe happens spontaneously.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.200
That doesn't mean disorderly things will always
happen though, other factors may interfere.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.730
The reaction to change a diamond into graphite,
for example, would be thermodynamically spontaneous.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.300
It wouldn't have to be forced along by outside
energy,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.100
but the bonds in the diamond are so stable
that essentially it never gets started.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.520
Lots of other chemical reactions are like
this too.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.700
So even though we think of "spontaneous" meaning sudden and impulsive, like the majority of mall lip piercings,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.940
in chemistry "spontaneous" doesn't tell you
how quickly something happens,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.800
it only means a reaction is thermodynamically capable of happening without outside energy to move it along.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.420
Though come to think of it, I imagine that spontaneous lip piercings cause a fair amount of disorder as well,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190
especially upon arriving home.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.680
Entropy is another state function.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.640
It doesn't depend on the pathway the system
took to reach its current state.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.560
So even though we can't measure the entropy of reactants or products directly, we can calculate them.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.640
We can also calculate the change in entropy during a reaction exactly like we can for the change in enthalpy,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.260
by subtracting the sum of the reactant values
from the sum of the product values.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.340
In other words, the formulas look exactly
the same, just substituting "S"

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.220
(which for some reason is used to denote entropy)
for "Delta H F".

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.180
Notice we dropped the "Delta"s on the right
side of the formula

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.040
because we know absolute values for entropy
of individual reactants and products.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.370
We keep the "Delta" on the left

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.490
because we're calculating the change in entropy that occurs when the reactants rearrange into products.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.840
What the heck is this good for?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.359
Well, we can explain a mysterious thing, which
is how reactions occur spontaneously in nature

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.990
even though there's no energy given off, or
even they suck energy out of the environment,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.990
and seem to go up the energy ladder instead
of down.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.060
Let's try it out with a real reaction here
on my desk -- this is one of my favorites.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.949
This is barium hydroxide octahydrate and this
is ammonium chloride.

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.149
Usually we do chemical reactions in aqueous solution because most solids don't interact easily,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.740
but this pair is exception to that rule; they
react readily in solid form.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.979
This reaction absorbs a lot of heat from the surroundings, making everything around it feel cold.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.740
Now to show you how cold it gets, I'm going
to do something here.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.189
And you're just going to have to assume you
understand what I'm doing.

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.180
"What am I doing? What is happening? Why am
I doing this? That's weird Hank.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.219
Why are you doing that?" And then I put that
on there.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.800
So now I've dumped barium hydroxide in this beaker, I'm gonna dump the ammonium chloride in.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.700
And now one of the by-products of this reaction is ammonia so I'm gonna have to smell that, but you don't.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.189
Oooh ye-eah, look at that slush.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:28.960
I think we've reacted pretty much completely here and so we should, if all things have gone properly --

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:37.380
yep, that's pretty cool --- sucked enough heat out of the block of wood to actually freeze it to the beaker.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.180
Normally in chemistry a reaction that proceeds spontaneously and yet absorbs heat is really weird.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.400
Basically I have a hard time believing what
I just did.

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.210
So what does entropy have to do with this
little freak show?

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.080
You might think it has something to do with taking the heat from the surroundings to make the system colder,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.689
but while that's counter-intuitive and cool,
that's not all of it.

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:03.429
You might also think that it has to do with two solids combining to form a whole bunch more liquids and gases,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.580
and that IS a big part, but still not all.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.800
To understand what we just saw a little better,
we need to put it all together.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.979
Let's start by finding out exactly how much heat it did absorb and what happened to the entropy as well.

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.490
First, we'll find the enthalpy change using
Hess's Law and standard enthalpies of formation.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.300
We can use the coefficients from the balanced chemical equation to fill in the number of moles for each substance.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.220
Then we have to look up a whole bunch of numbers

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.939
(remember, you can find tables like this online and probably in the back of your chemistry textbook too).

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.069
When we plug the standard enthalpies of formation
into the formula and do the math,

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.819
we find that the change in standard enthalpy
is plus 166 kilojoules.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.620
It's positive, which makes sense because the
reaction absorbed the thermal energy,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.360
enough to create about a half a kilogram of ice if it had been surrounded by water instead of air and fingers.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.490
Next, we'll find the entropy change: remember,
the basic equation is the same.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.719
We put in the number of moles from the balanced
chemical equation

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.819
and the standard entropies from the table

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.680
and a quick calculation tells us that the change in standard entropy is 590 joules per Kelvin.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.889
A positive result means the entropy of the
reaction increased,

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.329
meaning the products were more disordered
than the reactants.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:14.580
Note that the standard enthalpy is in kilojoules while the standard entropy is in joules per Kelvin.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.780
The energy units should match, so let's call
the standard entropy 0.594 kilojoules per Kelvin.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.180
It doesn't look like much right now, but wait,
there's more.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.080
Those numbers don't explain why the reaction
proceeds spontaneously,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.280
even though it scavenges all that heat from
the environment.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.520
But Josiah Willard Gibbs, he found a way to
explain it, and he didn't even mean to.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.800
Gibbs was interested in the amount of energy in a system that was available or free to do useful work.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.060
Today, we call this Gibbs free energy or sometimes the standard free energy or simply free energy of the system.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.800
Like enthalpy or entropy, Gibbs free energy is a state function, so it can be calculated the same way.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.900
We simply substitute "Delta G," which stands
for Gibbs free energy, for "Delta H" or "S."

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.289
The standard free energy of formation, written
like this,

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:05.540
is the change of free energy that occurs when a substance is formed from its elements at a standard state.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.660
It's analogous to the standard enthalpy of formation that we use to calculate change in enthalpy.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.960
Like enthalpy and entropy, we can't directly
the free energy change of the whole reaction.

00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:18.289
So scientists created a baseline by setting
the standard free energy change of formation

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:23.300
for an element in its most stable form at
standard state to zero.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.449
The standard free energy change of formation
for a compound, then,

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:29.819
is just the difference between its standard
free energy and that baseline.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.420
But what if you don't know the standard free energies of formation for the products and reactants?

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.200
Well, they're often listed in tables, but
sometimes the ones you need aren't available.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.700
Never fear, Willard Gibbs has an app for that.
It's actually a formula, but he figured it out.

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:48.480
In 1873, Gibbs calculated that at constant
pressure and temperature,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.800
the change in standard Gibbs free energy for
a reaction equal the change in standard enthalpy

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.009
minus the product of the temperature and the
change in standard entropy.

00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:01.669
In other words, the amount of free energy a reaction makes available to do work depends on two

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.449
and only two things: the enthalpy change,
the amount of heat the reaction transfers,

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:11.279
and the entropy change, the amount of disorder
it creates at a given temperature.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:15.360
So which is more important, the heat transfer
or the disorder? Well, it depends.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.389
A large change in enthalpy can determine the
direction of a free energy change,

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:22.529
even if the entropy changes in the opposite
direction, and vice versa.

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:28.060
If the absolute value of the change in enthalpy is greater than the absolute value of the product of the temperature

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.820
and the change in entropy (or "T Delta S"),
then we say that the reaction is enthalpy-driven.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.360
this means that the flow of thermal energy
provides most of the free energy in the reaction.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.760
On the other hand, if the absolute value of "T Delta S" is greater than the absolute value of the enthalpy change,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.580
we call the reaction entropy-driven, meaning increasing disorder provides most of the reaction's free energy.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.000
Which type was the barium hydroxide reaction?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.220
Well, I'm gonna say that the temperature in here is about 25 degrees Celsius, or 298.15 Kelvin,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.600
because I'm awesome like that -- I can just
tell.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.110
When we multiply that by the change in entropy
that we calculated,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.500
0.594 kilojoules per kelvin,
we get a value of 177 kilojoules.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.690
If we compare that to the change in enthalpy
we calculated, 166 kilojoules,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:19.240
it is clear that the "T Delta S" is higher than the "Delta H", so the reaction is entropy-driven -- no surprise there.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.720
Even though the reaction absorbed a lot of thermal energy, this phenomenon was dwarfed by the increase in entropy.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.540
And this makes sense, because the balanced
equation goes from three total moles of solids,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:38.060
with their molecules locked in place, to one mole of solid, ten moles of liquid, and two moles of gas.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.620
This is a massive increase in disorder,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.200
because in addition to the fact that there are now 13 moles of particles to move around instead of just 3,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.720
the liquid and gas are particularly good at
moving around,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.009
so most of those particles are in random motion,
no longer stuck in one spot,

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:55.889
causing a large increase in disorder, or entropy.

00:10:55.889 --> 00:11:00.120
But here's the coolest part, Gibbs formula also tells us whether the reaction is spontaneous or not.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.520
We know all systems tend toward the lowest possible energy state, whether its a ball rolling down a hill,

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.019
elastic springing back into shape, or positive
and negative ions forming a bond.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:16.020
"Delta G" is a type of energy, obviously, so it spontaneously approaches the minimum possible level.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:22.200
So if the value for "Delta G" is negative, that is if the free energy decreases, the reaction is spontaneous.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.279
Reactions that are able to release free energy
don't need external energy to make them proceed,

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:30.660
and that's the very definition of a spontaneous
reaction.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.920
So if "Delta G" is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous, but the reverse reaction is spontaneous.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.500
If "Delta G" is zero, the reaction is in an equilibrium state and no discernible occurs in either direction.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.320
So what about the reaction I just did?

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.240
Is it spontaneous at room temperature? Can
it occur without energy driving it along?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.380
Well, yes because we just watched it happen,
but let's do the math!

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.560
Using Gibbs Formula and plugging in the numbers
we've calculated so far,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.009
we see that the Gibbs free energy for this
reaction is negative 11 kilojoules.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:03.509
It is indeed spontaneous, because it releases energy instead of requiring it in order to get started.

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:06.879
The energy that was produced was used to rearrange
the bonds in the reactants,

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:10.540
to make smaller product molecules, to break
attractions between molecules,

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.800
and to push some of the particles apart from
solid form into liquid and gas form,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.920
which increased the entropy of the system.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.300
So even though the reaction absorbed a lot of thermal energy, it didn't NEED that energy to make it proceed,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.759
because the large change in entropy alone
was enough to keep things moving along.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.280
So Gibbs formula confirms our earlier results with just one little subtraction -- pretty smart guy.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.500
And now, some of his smartness has been transferred
into you,

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.080
now that you've watched this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:41.529
If you paid any attention, you learned:

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:46.470
that it's hard to stay organized because there
are so many ways to be disorganized,

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.649
that the second law of thermodynamics says
disorder, or entropy, happens everywhere,

00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:55.949
and that the change in entropy ultimately depends on how much room molecules have to move around in,

00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:59.369
how much heat heat energy they have to give off in reactions, and the temperature around them.

00:12:59.369 --> 00:13:04.319
You learned about Josiah Willard Gibbs and his formula to calculate the Gibbs free energy for a reaction,

00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:07.829
that both entropy and Gibbs free energy are
state functions,

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:12.470
and that the sign of the Gibbs free energy
tell us whether or not a reaction is spontaneous.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.920
