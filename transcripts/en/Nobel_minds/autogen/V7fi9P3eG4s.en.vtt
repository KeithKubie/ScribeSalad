of human intelligence and I guess that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
of human intelligence and I guess that
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190
of human intelligence and I guess that
sort of also would be a subtitle for our

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
sort of also would be a subtitle for our
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840
sort of also would be a subtitle for our
panel because what we're going to ask is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
panel because what we're going to ask is
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.459
panel because what we're going to ask is
how much our knowledge of human

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
how much our knowledge of human
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.350
how much our knowledge of human
perception and by extension human

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
perception and by extension human
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.350

intelligence will extend to the way we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
intelligence will extend to the way we
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.090
intelligence will extend to the way we
develop intelligent computers and I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
develop intelligent computers and I
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100
develop intelligent computers and I
think we ought to begin by thinking

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
think we ought to begin by thinking
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.969
think we ought to begin by thinking
about how much we know about human

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
about how much we know about human
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.210
about how much we know about human
intelligence human perception so who

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
intelligence human perception so who
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.310
intelligence human perception so who
would like to describe our current state

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
would like to describe our current state
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.820
would like to describe our current state

that as we discussed this morning
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.480
that as we discussed this morning
intelligence it's a very very broad

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
intelligence it's a very very broad
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.910
intelligence it's a very very broad
concept but each of the sub functions of

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920
concept but each of the sub functions of
 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.140
concept but each of the sub functions of
intelligence which we often call

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
intelligence which we often call

cognition

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
cognition
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.580
cognition
I mean planning or thinking or memory or

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
I mean planning or thinking or memory or
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.600
I mean planning or thinking or memory or
learning or imagination I mean we are

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
learning or imagination I mean we are
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480
learning or imagination I mean we are
beginning to understand how these things

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
beginning to understand how these things
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.620
beginning to understand how these things
work in the brain and so it's very

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
work in the brain and so it's very
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.319
work in the brain and so it's very
different from when we started in in

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
different from when we started in in
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.740

almost thirty years ago and it's just a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
almost thirty years ago and it's just a
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900
almost thirty years ago and it's just a
black box now it's not a black box

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
black box now it's not a black box
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.150
black box now it's not a black box
anymore and I think we are starting to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
anymore and I think we are starting to
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.530
anymore and I think we are starting to
see how neurons

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
see how neurons
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.179
see how neurons
groups on you and thousands of neurons

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189
groups on you and thousands of neurons
 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.789
groups on you and thousands of neurons
can actually collaborate to generate

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799
can actually collaborate to generate
 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.830
can actually collaborate to generate
these phenomena but at the same time I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
these phenomena but at the same time I
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.539
these phenomena but at the same time I
think it's important to say that we are

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549
think it's important to say that we are
 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.330
think it's important to say that we are
just at the beginning and it's very very

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
just at the beginning and it's very very
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.979
just at the beginning and it's very very
complicated but you want to hear about

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989
complicated but you want to hear about
 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.849
complicated but you want to hear about
perception well since we've started with

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859
perception well since we've started with
 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:29.809
perception well since we've started with
intelligence we can come back to

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819
intelligence we can come back to
 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.610
intelligence we can come back to

psychologist that was almost a bad word

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099
psychologist that was almost a bad word
 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.330
psychologist that was almost a bad word
because it's so cultural independent the

way we were taught to think about

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180
way we were taught to think about
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.610
way we were taught to think about
intelligence because it was measured by

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620
intelligence because it was measured by
 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.969
intelligence because it was measured by
tests that we're not they're really

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979
tests that we're not they're really
 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.140
tests that we're not they're really
biased but of course intelligence is

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
biased but of course intelligence is
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.479
biased but of course intelligence is
about survival and it's also about

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
about survival and it's also about
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.149
about survival and it's also about
emotional intelligence and I think

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159
emotional intelligence and I think
 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.729
emotional intelligence and I think
emotional intelligence is what makes us

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739
emotional intelligence is what makes us
 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.129
emotional intelligence is what makes us
human and and I'm not on the on the

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139
human and and I'm not on the on the
 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.899
human and and I'm not on the on the
question of understanding what that is

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909
question of understanding what that is
 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.809
question of understanding what that is
we're really nowhere I assume I mean we

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819
we're really nowhere I assume I mean we
 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.449
we're really nowhere I assume I mean we
understand sir from your from work from

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459
understand sir from your from work from
 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.099
understand sir from your from work from
you and from others we understand

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109
you and from others we understand
 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.599
you and from others we understand
something about how we perceive space

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609
something about how we perceive space
 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.610
something about how we perceive space
I mean space is just an example of the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
I mean space is just an example of the
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.009
I mean space is just an example of the
fact if they're beginning to understand

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019
fact if they're beginning to understand
 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.599
fact if they're beginning to understand
some of the what we believe are the

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609
some of the what we believe are the
 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.210
some of the what we believe are the
basic algorithms of the brain or of the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220
basic algorithms of the brain or of the
 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.080
basic algorithms of the brain or of the
cortex and I think one of the reasons

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090
cortex and I think one of the reasons
 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.300
cortex and I think one of the reasons
why we are studying space is that you're

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310
why we are studying space is that you're
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.670
why we are studying space is that you're
not only interested in space as such but

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680
not only interested in space as such but
 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.539
not only interested in space as such but
because it's a window into areas of the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549
because it's a window into areas of the
 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.940
because it's a window into areas of the
cortex that we know much much less but

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950
cortex that we know much much less but
 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.950
cortex that we know much much less but
it still tells us something about this

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960
it still tells us something about this
 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.850
it still tells us something about this
algorithm

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860
algorithm
 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.529
algorithm
and those are the algorithms that

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539
and those are the algorithms that
 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.770
and those are the algorithms that
probably are or interest artificial

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780
probably are or interest artificial

what what are the rules that the brain
uses but when you hear that people are

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000
intelligent systems based on our
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.909
intelligent systems based on our
knowledge of how the brain works do you

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919
knowledge of how the brain works do you
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.350
knowledge of how the brain works do you
think our knowledge of how the brain

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360
think our knowledge of how the brain
 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.430
think our knowledge of how the brain
works is sufficient for them to be

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440
works is sufficient for them to be
 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.159
works is sufficient for them to be
working on that already how do you think

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169
working on that already how do you think
 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.659
working on that already how do you think
that the connection is there yet

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669
that the connection is there yet
 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.850
that the connection is there yet
I noticed this morning when the cookies

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860
I noticed this morning when the cookies
 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.529
I noticed this morning when the cookies
questions came up there was a sort of

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539
questions came up there was a sort of
 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.999
questions came up there was a sort of
silence about the connection between

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009
silence about the connection between
 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:07.249
silence about the connection between
biology and how did our brain develop it

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259
biology and how did our brain develop it
 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.670
biology and how did our brain develop it
was not only to reduce intelligence but

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680
was not only to reduce intelligence but
 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.589
was not only to reduce intelligence but
the computer if you develop a computer

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599
the computer if you develop a computer
 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.950
the computer if you develop a computer
you want to have an intelligent robot or

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960
you want to have an intelligent robot or
 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.920
you want to have an intelligent robot or
whatever you want intelligent machine so

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930
whatever you want intelligent machine so
 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.320
whatever you want intelligent machine so
our brain contains so much more than

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330
our brain contains so much more than
 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.960
our brain contains so much more than
intelligence so to learn from the brain

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970
intelligence so to learn from the brain
 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.189
intelligence so to learn from the brain
and just cope it maybe it's not useful

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199
and just cope it maybe it's not useful
 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.230
and just cope it maybe it's not useful
artificial intelligence can machines can

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240
artificial intelligence can machines can
 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.810
artificial intelligence can machines can
be so intelligent without using what we

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820
be so intelligent without using what we
 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.570
be so intelligent without using what we
know from the brain it's probably very

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580
know from the brain it's probably very
 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.020
know from the brain it's probably very
useful you have to confirm that but it's

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030
useful you have to confirm that but it's
 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.659
useful you have to confirm that but it's
very useful to know about algorithms or

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669
very useful to know about algorithms or
 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.610
very useful to know about algorithms or
the ways that the brain does it and may

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620
the ways that the brain does it and may
 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.370
the ways that the brain does it and may
serve as a really useful guideline and I

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380
serve as a really useful guideline and I
 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.260
serve as a really useful guideline and I
guess that's what's happening partly now

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270
guess that's what's happening partly now
 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.800
guess that's what's happening partly now
in AI that actually the mechanism that

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810
in AI that actually the mechanism that
 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.890
in AI that actually the mechanism that
the brain uses or is believed to use is

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900
the brain uses or is believed to use is
 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.230
the brain uses or is believed to use is
actually used by computers but of course

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240
actually used by computers but of course
 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.870
actually used by computers but of course
computers are very different so I mean

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880
computers are very different so I mean
 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.749
computers are very different so I mean
it has to be done but the principle

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759
it has to be done but the principle
 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.899
it has to be done but the principle
still can be transferred country there

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909
still can be transferred country there
 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.420
still can be transferred country there
are very many different different

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430
are very many different different
 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.370
are very many different different
reasons why and why studies in humans or

reasons why and why studies in humans or
 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.140
reasons why and why studies in humans or
in general in biological systems are

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150
in general in biological systems are
 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.839
in general in biological systems are
relevant for artificial systems the

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849
relevant for artificial systems the
 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.790
relevant for artificial systems the
first one is to of course understand the

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800
first one is to of course understand the
 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.950
first one is to of course understand the
principles or the processes of how

things were information is processed in

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810
things were information is processed in
 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.040
things were information is processed in
the brain right and we can draw a

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050
the brain right and we can draw a
 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.480

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490
parallel with birds and airplanes
 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.899
parallel with birds and airplanes
airplanes do not fly as birds but are

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909
airplanes do not fly as birds but are
 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:39.710
airplanes do not fly as birds but are
basically

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720
basically
 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720
basically
build on the technology of understanding

build on the technology of understanding
 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.680
build on the technology of understanding
how birds fly okay but it's not as

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690
how birds fly okay but it's not as
 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.780
how birds fly okay but it's not as

artificial systems that fly as birds so

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630
artificial systems that fly as birds so
 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.540
artificial systems that fly as birds so
if you draw that perilous understanding

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550
if you draw that perilous understanding
 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.280
if you draw that perilous understanding
the brain and the processes in brain can

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290
the brain and the processes in brain can
 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.260
the brain and the processes in brain can
tell us something about how information

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270
tell us something about how information
 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.570
tell us something about how information
is processed in order to build or be

so that's one thing the other aspect is

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710
so that's one thing the other aspect is
 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.640
so that's one thing the other aspect is
the structure the structural aspect

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650
the structure the structural aspect
 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.940
the structure the structural aspect
right so what is the hardware and how

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950
right so what is the hardware and how
 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.040
right so what is the hardware and how
does the hardware work and that can also

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050
does the hardware work and that can also
 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.660
does the hardware work and that can also
serve as inspiration for building

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:17.670
serve as inspiration for building
 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.290
serve as inspiration for building
sensory systems today we do have

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300
sensory systems today we do have
 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.780
sensory systems today we do have
examples of like visual systems or

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790
examples of like visual systems or
 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.670
examples of like visual systems or
cameras that work for example with the

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680
cameras that work for example with the
 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.580
cameras that work for example with the
visual system in the fly or works and so

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590
visual system in the fly or works and so
 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.620
visual system in the fly or works and so
on and it gives the possibility to

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630
on and it gives the possibility to
 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.250
on and it gives the possibility to
systems to be devoted to specific

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260
systems to be devoted to specific
 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.870
systems to be devoted to specific
applications so understanding why fly or

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880
applications so understanding why fly or
 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.550
applications so understanding why fly or
other biological system has developed

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560
other biological system has developed
 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.820
other biological system has developed
the sensing or perceptual system can

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830
the sensing or perceptual system can
 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.880
the sensing or perceptual system can
make similar and we can draw parallels

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890
make similar and we can draw parallels
 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.820
make similar and we can draw parallels
to that but also the artificial systems

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830
to that but also the artificial systems
 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.540
to that but also the artificial systems
for the future are there to help human

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.550
for the future are there to help human
 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.700
for the future are there to help human
in some way to interact with humans and

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.710
in some way to interact with humans and
 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.460
in some way to interact with humans and
so on and in order to be able to do that

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.470
so on and in order to be able to do that
 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.770
so on and in order to be able to do that
the machines also need to understand the

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780
the machines also need to understand the
 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.170
the machines also need to understand the
human way of interaction with the

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180
human way of interaction with the
 

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.330
human way of interaction with the
environment okay so this is really

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340
environment okay so this is really
 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.400
environment okay so this is really
really important because if you want to

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.410
really important because if you want to
 

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.440
really important because if you want to
have a robot that is a little bit more

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:06.450
have a robot that is a little bit more
 

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.810
have a robot that is a little bit more
than a vacuum cleaner robot you talk to

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:08.820
than a vacuum cleaner robot you talk to
 

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.659
than a vacuum cleaner robot you talk to
a robot you can send to places a robot

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:11.669
a robot you can send to places a robot
 

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:13.190
a robot you can send to places a robot
that does not use only metric

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:13.200
that does not use only metric
 

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.020
that does not use only metric
information because humans do not really

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.030
information because humans do not really
 

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.180
information because humans do not really
use what's of metric information right

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:17.190
use what's of metric information right
 

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.500
use what's of metric information right
we have different types of topological

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:18.510
we have different types of topological
 

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.700
we have different types of topological
maps and so on we talk about relations

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:21.710
maps and so on we talk about relations
 

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.740
maps and so on we talk about relations
well you will find the PR room in the

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:24.750
well you will find the PR room in the
 

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.750
well you will find the PR room in the
hallway to the right I mean we use went

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:26.760
hallway to the right I mean we use went
 

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.810
hallway to the right I mean we use went
Mart's and so on an understanding of

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:29.820
Mart's and so on an understanding of
 

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.640
Mart's and so on an understanding of
those processes and how we use natural

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:31.650
those processes and how we use natural
 

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.880
those processes and how we use natural
language to actually convey that the

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:34.890
language to actually convey that the
 

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.860
language to actually convey that the
wave is stored information and so it's

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:36.870
wave is stored information and so it's
 

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.860
wave is stored information and so it's
also an inspiration of making machines

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:38.870
also an inspiration of making machines
 

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.920
also an inspiration of making machines
that can be more human-friendly

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:42.930
that can be more human-friendly
 

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.570
that can be more human-friendly
in terms of interaction that can make

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580
in terms of interaction that can make
 

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.930

copied some aspects of birds that
 

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.160
copied some aspects of birds that
weren't actually right to copy and then

along the road to understanding are we
 

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.880
along the road to understanding are we

but I will also emphasize that the

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:36.960
but I will also emphasize that the
 

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.440
but I will also emphasize that the
process of understanding the brain is

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:39.450
process of understanding the brain is
 

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.470
process of understanding the brain is
much much slower than the development of

much much slower than the development of
 

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.770
much much slower than the development of
computer technology so I think that is a

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:45.780
computer technology so I think that is a
 

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:53.090

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:11.589
to a mythical figure a painting that's
 

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:13.530
to a mythical figure a painting that's
important because of the mythological

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:13.540
important because of the mythological
 

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.100
important because of the mythological
story that

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.110
story that
 

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.610
story that
telling now all of this it seems to me

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:17.620
telling now all of this it seems to me
 

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.790
telling now all of this it seems to me
it is part of vision you could say well

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800
it is part of vision you could say well
 

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.100
it is part of vision you could say well
it's not vision it's thinking which is

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.110
it's not vision it's thinking which is
 

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.780
it's not vision it's thinking which is
triggered by vision you could put it

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:24.790
triggered by vision you could put it
 

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.790
triggered by vision you could put it
that way but anyway it seems to me it's

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800
that way but anyway it seems to me it's
 

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.130
that way but anyway it seems to me it's
very very closely linked and until we

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.140
very very closely linked and until we
 

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.530
very very closely linked and until we
get machines the visual machines you

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:31.540
get machines the visual machines you
 

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.960
get machines the visual machines you
know that can do that we can't claim

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:33.970
know that can do that we can't claim
 

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.910
know that can do that we can't claim
that they've approached human vision and

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920
that they've approached human vision and
 

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.590
that they've approached human vision and
again as well as I know there's no work

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600
again as well as I know there's no work
 

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.019
again as well as I know there's no work
on that I can I can out the affordances

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:43.029
on that I can I can out the affordances
 

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:45.780
on that I can I can out the affordances
you're talking about or as people have

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:45.790
you're talking about or as people have
 

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.550
you're talking about or as people have
called it and tried it's functional

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560
called it and tried it's functional
 

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.069
called it and tried it's functional
categories it's actually a very very

00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079
categories it's actually a very very
 

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.620
categories it's actually a very very
difficult task and very often I ask

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:52.630
difficult task and very often I ask
 

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.949
difficult task and very often I ask
people ok and our job is about writing

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959
people ok and our job is about writing
 

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:58.290
people ok and our job is about writing
computer programs that take video

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:58.300
computer programs that take video
 

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.360
computer programs that take video
sequences and try to understand them so

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:00.370
sequences and try to understand them so
 

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.850
sequences and try to understand them so
building really complicated models based

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:02.860
building really complicated models based
 

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.880
building really complicated models based
on many examples but a very simple

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:05.890
on many examples but a very simple
 

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.960

question what is a chair ok yeah and

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:09.970
question what is a chair ok yeah and
 

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.970
question what is a chair ok yeah and
then you know people look at me ok it's

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:11.980
then you know people look at me ok it's
 

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.710
then you know people look at me ok it's
not a tricky question ok what's a chair

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720
not a tricky question ok what's a chair
 

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.960
not a tricky question ok what's a chair
and then 99 percent of people will

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:15.970
and then 99 percent of people will
 

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.509
and then 99 percent of people will
answer something I can sit on and then I

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519
answer something I can sit on and then I
 

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:20.519
answer something I can sit on and then I
say ok I can sit on the floor I can sit

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:20.529
say ok I can sit on the floor I can sit
 

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:22.710
say ok I can sit on the floor I can sit
on the table what's not a chair so for

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720
on the table what's not a chair so for
 

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.090
on the table what's not a chair so for
the computer program they are not so

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:24.100
the computer program they are not so
 

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.720
the computer program they are not so
very good in understanding what's not a

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:27.730
very good in understanding what's not a
 

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.300
very good in understanding what's not a
specific category right and how to find

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:30.310
specific category right and how to find
 

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.340
specific category right and how to find
the differences between something that

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.350
the differences between something that
 

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.620
the differences between something that
has a function and the does not have a

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:34.630
has a function and the does not have a
 

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.949
has a function and the does not have a
function I have a one and a half year

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959
function I have a one and a half year
 

00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:40.949
function I have a one and a half year
old at home that and her brain obviously

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959
old at home that and her brain obviously
 

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:43.139
old at home that and her brain obviously
understood the shape but not the

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:43.149
understood the shape but not the
 

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:45.240
understood the shape but not the
function yet and it's really interesting

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.250
function yet and it's really interesting
 

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.880
function yet and it's really interesting
to see because I would have never never

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:47.890
to see because I would have never never
 

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.600
to see because I would have never never
I think noticed that so so she has a

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:51.610
I think noticed that so so she has a
 

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.389
I think noticed that so so she has a
chair for her doll ok that she's trying

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399
chair for her doll ok that she's trying
 

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.790
chair for her doll ok that she's trying
to sit on and the chair is approximately

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800
to sit on and the chair is approximately
 

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.120
to sit on and the chair is approximately
this side fantastic video that I use in

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.130
this side fantastic video that I use in
 

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.329
this side fantastic video that I use in
my lectures now because she has the

00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:03.339
my lectures now because she has the
 

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:06.030
my lectures now because she has the
shape information in her brain but not

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040
shape information in her brain but not
 

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.699
shape information in her brain but not
yet the function so I asked Elizabeth

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:08.709
yet the function so I asked Elizabeth
 

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:11.250
yet the function so I asked Elizabeth
what are you trying to do sit sit sit

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:11.260
what are you trying to do sit sit sit
 

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.230
what are you trying to do sit sit sit
and you know she's just throwing and

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240
and you know she's just throwing and
 

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.569
and you know she's just throwing and
falling down all the time and it's

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:15.579
falling down all the time and it's
 

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:17.810
falling down all the time and it's
really interesting this is exactly how

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820
really interesting this is exactly how
 

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.829
really interesting this is exactly how
for the future that's going to be a

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839
for the future that's going to be a
 

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:21.990
for the future that's going to be a
problem for for computer systems in

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000
problem for for computer systems in

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:25.290
example
 

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.370
example
but yeah I think what you are talking

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380
but yeah I think what you are talking
 

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.410
but yeah I think what you are talking
about is often what we in your science

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420
about is often what we in your science
 

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:30.829
about is often what we in your science
call

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839

00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:33.110
call
top-down processes because even the

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120
top-down processes because even the
 

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.170
top-down processes because even the
simplest thing like just seeing or

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180
simplest thing like just seeing or
 

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.030
simplest thing like just seeing or
recognizing visual image is actually

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040
recognizing visual image is actually
 

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.850
recognizing visual image is actually
influenced by everything else that the

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860
influenced by everything else that the
 

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.439
influenced by everything else that the
brain knows and everything else that

00:15:42.439 --> 00:15:42.449
brain knows and everything else that
 

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:44.749
brain knows and everything else that
happens simultaneously in the brain has

00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759
happens simultaneously in the brain has
 

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:47.960
happens simultaneously in the brain has
to go back and that's why we humans or

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:47.970
to go back and that's why we humans or
 

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.850
to go back and that's why we humans or
other animals are so good at

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860
other animals are so good at
 

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.160
other animals are so good at
distinguishing a chair from a non chair

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.170
distinguishing a chair from a non chair
 

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.150
distinguishing a chair from a non chair
which is so difficult for a computer and

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160
which is so difficult for a computer and
 

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.920
which is so difficult for a computer and
then I think that's one thing more we

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:57.930
then I think that's one thing more we
 

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.170
then I think that's one thing more we
can do which animals and humans do is

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180
can do which animals and humans do is
 

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.360
can do which animals and humans do is
that not only can you distinguish but

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:02.370
that not only can you distinguish but
 

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.639
that not only can you distinguish but
you actually know you know a lot about

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:04.649
you actually know you know a lot about
 

00:16:04.649 --> 00:16:06.949
you actually know you know a lot about
probabilities which you can then use to

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959
probabilities which you can then use to
 

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:09.860
probabilities which you can then use to
guide behavior so for example when you

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:09.870
guide behavior so for example when you
 

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.030
guide behavior so for example when you
run through a big lots of people on the

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040
run through a big lots of people on the
 

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.980
run through a big lots of people on the
street you manage to navigate your way

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:15.990
street you manage to navigate your way
 

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.410
street you manage to navigate your way
because you know how likely it is that

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420
because you know how likely it is that
 

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.329
because you know how likely it is that

he or she walks left or right and bumps
 

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:22.910
he or she walks left or right and bumps
into you so you can use all of this

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920
into you so you can use all of this
 

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.189
into you so you can use all of this
information together with all the input

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199

that comes in at the same time just to
interpret this little image that's you

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:33.500
 

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.040
can do that know that that's exactly

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.050
can do that know that that's exactly
 

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.009
can do that know that that's exactly
said I think that very many times I we

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019
said I think that very many times I we
 

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:41.329

do fail a lot but the thing is that they

00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079
do fail a lot but the thing is that they
 

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:51.220
do fail a lot but the thing is that they
had developed so that we can actually

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:51.230
had developed so that we can actually
 

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.949
had developed so that we can actually
manage in the world around us but lots

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959
manage in the world around us but lots
 

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:56.900
manage in the world around us but lots
of intelligence is also in the body so

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:56.910
of intelligence is also in the body so
 

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.490
of intelligence is also in the body so
it's not about only how we see and

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.110
reminds me of a very very interesting
case I'm trying to remember the name of

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120
case I'm trying to remember the name of
 

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.510
case I'm trying to remember the name of
the book or the author in which I read

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520
the book or the author in which I read
 

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.940
the book or the author in which I read
it years ago and I can't but I remember

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:43.950
it years ago and I can't but I remember
 

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.390
it years ago and I can't but I remember
the example very very well well this

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400
the example very very well well this
 

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.920
the example very very well well this
person was a psychologist he was

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:48.930
person was a psychologist he was
 

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.110
person was a psychologist he was
teaching a course in psychology to

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120
teaching a course in psychology to
 

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.990
teaching a course in psychology to
medical students who were already in

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000
medical students who were already in
 

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.820
medical students who were already in
their clinical training so they were

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:55.830
their clinical training so they were
 

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.400
their clinical training so they were
working in the hospital and various

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:58.410
working in the hospital and various
 

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.680
working in the hospital and various
parts of the hospital already and she

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:00.690
parts of the hospital already and she
 

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.870
parts of the hospital already and she
showed them a photograph

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880
showed them a photograph
 

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.990
showed them a photograph
of a baby I know just a few months old

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000
of a baby I know just a few months old
 

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.430
of a baby I know just a few months old
sitting up against a brick wall with a

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440
sitting up against a brick wall with a
 

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:19.910
sitting up against a brick wall with a
white sort of dress thing on and she

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:19.920
white sort of dress thing on and she
 

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.220
white sort of dress thing on and she
said you know what's wrong with this

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:22.230
said you know what's wrong with this
 

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.650
said you know what's wrong with this
baby oh yeah how would you diagnose this

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:24.660
baby oh yeah how would you diagnose this
 

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.890
baby oh yeah how would you diagnose this
baby and it went on and on and on and on

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900
baby and it went on and on and on and on
 

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.390
baby and it went on and on and on and on
and they discussed and they discussed

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400
and they discussed and they discussed
 

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.560
and they discussed and they discussed
and discussed and while they were

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:30.570
and discussed and while they were
 

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.750
and discussed and while they were
discussing one person said was very

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760
discussing one person said was very
 

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.850
discussing one person said was very
well-cared-for baby because look at that

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860
well-cared-for baby because look at that
 

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.240
well-cared-for baby because look at that
spotless white nitrus that she's in and

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.250
spotless white nitrus that she's in and
 

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.700
spotless white nitrus that she's in and
another one said well yes but I mean

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:40.710
another one said well yes but I mean
 

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.250
another one said well yes but I mean
it's not very kind to put a baby up

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260
it's not very kind to put a baby up
 

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.940
it's not very kind to put a baby up
against the brick wall so they they were

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:46.950
against the brick wall so they they were
 

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.680
against the brick wall so they they were
worrying about this anyway to cut a long

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:48.690
worrying about this anyway to cut a long
 

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.220
worrying about this anyway to cut a long
story short it turned out that the baby

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:51.230
story short it turned out that the baby
 

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.860
story short it turned out that the baby
was a dead baby who was in the hospital

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:54.870
was a dead baby who was in the hospital
 

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.610
was a dead baby who was in the hospital
morgue which the students being already

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620
morgue which the students being already
 

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.780
morgue which the students being already
clinical students had visited had seen

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:01.790
clinical students had visited had seen
 

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.180
clinical students had visited had seen
and they had picked up the fact of that

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:05.190
and they had picked up the fact of that
 

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.450
and they had picked up the fact of that
brick ball they'd picked up the what

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460
brick ball they'd picked up the what
 

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.950
brick ball they'd picked up the what
they called the night dress which of

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960
they called the night dress which of
 

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.600
they called the night dress which of
course was the hospital shroud but

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:14.610
course was the hospital shroud but
 

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.960
course was the hospital shroud but
because they just expected to be looking

because they just expected to be looking
 

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.030
because they just expected to be looking
at living children in order to try and

help them in some way by diagnosing what
was wrong with them in the first place

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:23.370
was wrong with them in the first place
 

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.300
was wrong with them in the first place
it just never occurred to them that it

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.310
it just never occurred to them that it

out yes and they but they were giving

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700
out yes and they but they were giving

of purely visual test you may look at

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.040
of purely visual test you may look at
 

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.970
of purely visual test you may look at
this baby and see no look for symptoms

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980
this baby and see no look for symptoms
 

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.430
this baby and see no look for symptoms
of illness and which do you find they

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440
of illness and which do you find they
 

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.980
of illness and which do you find they
didn't find any if you want to talk

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:45.990
didn't find any if you want to talk
 

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.710
didn't find any if you want to talk
mathematically about things then then we

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720
mathematically about things then then we
 

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.720
mathematically about things then then we
talked about priors or prior information

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:50.730
talked about priors or prior information
 

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:56.750
talked about priors or prior information
that somehow it affected the model or

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760
that somehow it affected the model or
 

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.570
that somehow it affected the model or
decision model or the expert system and

00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580
decision model or the expert system and
 

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.590
decision model or the expert system and
I think that having this prior

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600
I think that having this prior
 

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.820
I think that having this prior
information so have I been in this

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:04.830
information so have I been in this
 

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.430
information so have I been in this
situation before or how other people

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440
situation before or how other people
 

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.590
situation before or how other people
have done or performed in a situation

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600
have done or performed in a situation
 

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.230
have done or performed in a situation
like this before effects lot of other

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240
like this before effects lot of other
 

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.240

and today when we build computer systems

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:17.540
and today when we build computer systems
 

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.050
and today when we build computer systems
we put lots of prior information in it

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:20.060
we put lots of prior information in it
 

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.280
we put lots of prior information in it
so if you talk about so-called

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:21.290
so if you talk about so-called
 

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.260
so if you talk about so-called
supervised learning we put labels on

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:23.270
supervised learning we put labels on
 

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.710
supervised learning we put labels on
images and so on but the problem is that

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720
images and so on but the problem is that
 

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.480
images and so on but the problem is that
lots of this prior information makes

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:28.490
lots of this prior information makes
 

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.450
lots of this prior information makes
sense because we have the body we have

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:31.460

the human has and the priors that make
 

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.130
the human has and the priors that make
sense to us may not have any effect or

their robots learning capabilities and
that's an important issue also to

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:49.490
that's an important issue also to
 

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:53.110
that's an important issue also to
discuss we've set up this panel to

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120
discuss we've set up this panel to
 

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.000
discuss we've set up this panel to
investigate what computers can learn

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.010
investigate what computers can learn
 

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.680
investigate what computers can learn
from humans and we've established very

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:56.690
from humans and we've established very
 

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.270
from humans and we've established very
much that there's all sorts of human

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:58.280
much that there's all sorts of human
 

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.490
much that there's all sorts of human
animal behaviors that will be extremely

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:00.500
animal behaviors that will be extremely

difficult to replicate in computers
 

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.240
difficult to replicate in computers
because there is so much association but

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:07.250
because there is so much association but

development of computers to a major
 

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.410
development of computers to a major
extent so maybe maybe computers are

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:20.420
extent so maybe maybe computers are
 

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.300

going to in fact not learn all that much

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.310
going to in fact not learn all that much
 

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.100
going to in fact not learn all that much

should not forget about that and even
 

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.810
should not forget about that and even

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.770
the way we think about things or the way
we do things you know if we see it from

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:50.780
we do things you know if we see it from
 

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.660
we do things you know if we see it from
the beginning we learn to do something

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:52.670
the beginning we learn to do something
 

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.510
the beginning we learn to do something
and then we see somebody doing something

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520
and then we see somebody doing something
 

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.090
and then we see somebody doing something
in a more effective or optimal way we

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:58.100
in a more effective or optimal way we
 

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.190
in a more effective or optimal way we
have a tendency of adopting that that

have a tendency of adopting that that
 

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.560
have a tendency of adopting that that
way of doing things and so on so I think

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:02.570
way of doing things and so on so I think
 

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.920
way of doing things and so on so I think
that that it is really really important

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:05.930
that that it is really really important
 

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.770
that that it is really really important
to understand biological systems and I

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:08.780
to understand biological systems and I
 

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.800
to understand biological systems and I
think in terms of perception we have a

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:11.810
think in terms of perception we have a
 

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.480
think in terms of perception we have a
good understanding for example of how

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:13.490
good understanding for example of how
 

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:18.010

the AI work very precisely we do have an
 

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.480
the AI work very precisely we do have an
understanding of where the information

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:19.490
understanding of where the information
 

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.340

is processed in the brain when it comes

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:21.350
is processed in the brain when it comes
 

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.020
is processed in the brain when it comes
to visual information when it comes to

to visual information when it comes to
 

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.290
to visual information when it comes to
motor information we also know a lot

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:26.300
motor information we also know a lot
 

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.480

about that there is lots of interaction

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:28.490
about that there is lots of interaction
 

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.899

but there's something that is so
 

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:53.200
but there's something that is so
exciting because we know that the brain

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:53.210
exciting because we know that the brain
 

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.839
exciting because we know that the brain
is so important for perception like you

00:26:55.839 --> 00:26:55.849
is so important for perception like you

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.000
the rules that are used to guide the
learning process are also come you know

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.010
learning process are also come you know
 

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.800
learning process are also come you know
conveying or the ethics and moral and

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:31.810
conveying or the ethics and moral and
 

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.060
conveying or the ethics and moral and
also having some form of external

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.070
also having some form of external
 

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.130
also having some form of external
teacher that can say this is a good and

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.140
teacher that can say this is a good and
 

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.730
teacher that can say this is a good and
this is a bad outcome of a learning

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:39.740
this is a bad outcome of a learning
 

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.810
this is a bad outcome of a learning
session and I think that there is a lots

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:43.820
session and I think that there is a lots
 

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.299
session and I think that there is a lots
of

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:45.309
of
 

00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:47.470
of
discussion about that in several

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480
discussion about that in several
 

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.000
discussion about that in several
communities computer vision machine

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.010
communities computer vision machine
 

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.430
communities computer vision machine
learning and so on we talk about

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440
learning and so on we talk about
 

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.020
learning and so on we talk about
supervised learning we talk about

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.030
supervised learning we talk about
 

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.030
supervised learning we talk about
semi-supervised learning but there is

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.040
semi-supervised learning but there is
 

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.669
semi-supervised learning but there is
also lots of discussion about completely

00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679
also lots of discussion about completely
 

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:59.890
also lots of discussion about completely
unsupervised learning so just having

00:30:59.890 --> 00:30:59.900
unsupervised learning so just having
 

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.360
unsupervised learning so just having
lots of data and then learning something

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:01.370
lots of data and then learning something
 

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.790
lots of data and then learning something
and that's very difficult I think that

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:03.800
and that's very difficult I think that
 

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.890
and that's very difficult I think that
the machines that learn without the

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:05.900
the machines that learn without the
 

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.790
the machines that learn without the
teacher can are very limited I don't

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:09.800
teacher can are very limited I don't
 

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.410
teacher can are very limited I don't
think the day these machines can learn

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:11.420
think the day these machines can learn
 

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.220
think the day these machines can learn
anything on a pretty kind of like high

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:15.230
anything on a pretty kind of like high
 

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.580
anything on a pretty kind of like high
level making the generalizations and

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:17.590
level making the generalizations and
 

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.320
level making the generalizations and
understanding affordances I don't think

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:20.330
understanding affordances I don't think
 

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.790
understanding affordances I don't think
that that will come to the machines

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:21.800
that that will come to the machines
 

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.280
that that will come to the machines
especially not to machines that are not

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:24.290
especially not to machines that are not
 

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.100
especially not to machines that are not
embodied okay because I think that lots

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.110
embodied okay because I think that lots
 

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.340
embodied okay because I think that lots
of intelligence we have is in the way we

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:30.350
of intelligence we have is in the way we
 

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.930
of intelligence we have is in the way we
interact with environment that's

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:31.940
interact with environment that's
 

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.970
interact with environment that's
something that you said experiences that

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:33.980
something that you said experiences that
 

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.220
something that you said experiences that
together throughout the life is also

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:36.230
together throughout the life is also
 

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.580
together throughout the life is also
what we physically do with the body

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:39.590
what we physically do with the body
 

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.730
what we physically do with the body
so I think that that having

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:42.740
so I think that that having
 

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.370
so I think that that having
semi-supervised systems and using the

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:45.380
semi-supervised systems and using the
 

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.980
semi-supervised systems and using the
teacher in the loop can achieve that and

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:47.990
teacher in the loop can achieve that and
 

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.330
teacher in the loop can achieve that and
then of course having the rules that

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:49.340
then of course having the rules that
 

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:56.070
then of course having the rules that
they're based on that take some more

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080
 

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.930
curiosity was mentioned earlier today as

00:31:58.930 --> 00:31:58.940
curiosity was mentioned earlier today as
 

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.930
curiosity was mentioned earlier today as
being a key part of intelligence of

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:01.940
being a key part of intelligence of
 

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.660
being a key part of intelligence of
human intelligence and and many learning

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:04.670
human intelligence and and many learning
 

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.850
human intelligence and and many learning
systems learn what we ask them to learn

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:06.860
systems learn what we ask them to learn
 

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.130
systems learn what we ask them to learn
and this connects of course they would

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:09.140
and this connects of course they would
 

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.510
and this connects of course they would
to what done it suggests said that how

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:12.520
to what done it suggests said that how
 

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.410
to what done it suggests said that how
curiosity could be considered some kind

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:14.420
curiosity could be considered some kind
 

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.590
curiosity could be considered some kind
of meta urge to sort of learn things

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600
of meta urge to sort of learn things
 

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.450
of meta urge to sort of learn things
that we don't know and you know to

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:19.460
that we don't know and you know to
 

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.669
that we don't know and you know to
conquer new esthetic domains or

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679
conquer new esthetic domains or
 

00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:23.049
conquer new esthetic domains or
understand something that we don't even

00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:23.059
understand something that we don't even
 

00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:25.840
understand something that we don't even
know what to do with how do we I would

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:25.850
know what to do with how do we I would
 

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.340
know what to do with how do we I would
like to hear your reflections on how how

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:27.350
like to hear your reflections on how how
 

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.380
like to hear your reflections on how how
do we actually implement this in

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:29.390
do we actually implement this in
 

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.510
do we actually implement this in
machines it's connects to creativity of

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:31.520
machines it's connects to creativity of
 

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.980
machines it's connects to creativity of
course it connects to aesthetic

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:32.990
course it connects to aesthetic
 

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.320
course it connects to aesthetic
experiences etc and those are key

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:35.330
experiences etc and those are key
 

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.660
experiences etc and those are key
elements of human intelligence how do we

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:37.670
elements of human intelligence how do we
 

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:48.100
elements of human intelligence how do we
deal with that I think curiosity as you

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.110
deal with that I think curiosity as you
 

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:52.590
deal with that I think curiosity as you
implied in your question comes out of a

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600
implied in your question comes out of a
 

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:58.060
implied in your question comes out of a
knowledge that you don't know something

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:58.070
 

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.550
an understanding maybe you'd only to a

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:00.560
an understanding maybe you'd only to a
 

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.500
an understanding maybe you'd only to a
very very limited degree because you

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:02.510
very very limited degree because you
 

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.630
very very limited degree because you
find that you can't do something which

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640
find that you can't do something which
 

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.360
find that you can't do something which
you wanted to do and so obviously you

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:07.370
you wanted to do and so obviously you
 

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.590
you wanted to do and so obviously you
don't know how to do it so you need to

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600
don't know how to do it so you need to
 

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.640
don't know how to do it so you need to
find out sometimes you know much more

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:11.650
find out sometimes you know much more
 

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.650
find out sometimes you know much more
wide and interesting than that where

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:14.660
wide and interesting than that where
 

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.560
wide and interesting than that where
you're thinking about a some interesting

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:17.570
you're thinking about a some interesting
 

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.480
you're thinking about a some interesting
complex area of human knowledge for

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:19.490
complex area of human knowledge for
 

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:26.610
complex area of human knowledge for
example and for a an AI system to

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:26.620
example and for a an AI system to
 

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.090
example and for a an AI system to
realize if you like but it doesn't know

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.100
realize if you like but it doesn't know
 

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.210
realize if you like but it doesn't know
something when it isn't just a question

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:34.220
something when it isn't just a question
 

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.920
something when it isn't just a question
of you know there is a particular

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:35.930
of you know there is a particular
 

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.740
of you know there is a particular
measurement for example that it needs to

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:38.750
measurement for example that it needs to
 

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.460
measurement for example that it needs to
know if it wants to lift this cup you

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:42.470
know if it wants to lift this cup you
 

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.170
know if it wants to lift this cup you
know and it hasn't it looks for the

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:44.180
know and it hasn't it looks for the
 

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.520
know and it hasn't it looks for the
measurement it hasn't got it

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:45.530
measurement it hasn't got it
 

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.140

so the program could say well you know

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:47.150
so the program could say well you know
 

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.240
so the program could say well you know
go and find it so yeah okay no problem

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:49.250
go and find it so yeah okay no problem
 

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.310
go and find it so yeah okay no problem
but if we're talking about the more

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320
but if we're talking about the more
 

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.190
but if we're talking about the more
interesting sorts of case where we would

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200
interesting sorts of case where we would
 

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.490
interesting sorts of case where we would
talk about curiosity where as I think

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:57.500
talk about curiosity where as I think
 

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.020
talk about curiosity where as I think
you you suggested you aren't even

00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.030
you you suggested you aren't even
 

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.570
you you suggested you aren't even
necessarily looking to solve a

necessarily looking to solve a
 

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.460
necessarily looking to solve a
particular sort of problem you're just

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:03.470
particular sort of problem you're just
 

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.060
particular sort of problem you're just
interested you don't know and maybe you

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:07.070
interested you don't know and maybe you
 

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.810
interested you don't know and maybe you
think maybe nobody else knows either and

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:09.820
think maybe nobody else knows either and
 

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.250
think maybe nobody else knows either and
that's especially interesting so how can

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:12.260
that's especially interesting so how can
 

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.250
that's especially interesting so how can
you find out now the sort of meta

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:15.260
you find out now the sort of meta
 

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.140
you find out now the sort of meta
knowledge if you like the sort of self

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:17.150

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.110
it's in principle impossible I don't
think the human brain works by magic and

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:41.120
think the human brain works by magic and
 

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.970
think the human brain works by magic and
I don't think therefore that the human

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:42.980
I don't think therefore that the human
 

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.220
I don't think therefore that the human
mind works by magic and so I don't think

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.230
mind works by magic and so I don't think
 

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.230
mind works by magic and so I don't think
it's in principle impossible that's not

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240
it's in principle impossible that's not

itself does not really make any sense so
 

00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:48.890
itself does not really make any sense so
we need to be really really careful in

this is my area of research we can talk
 

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:56.450
this is my area of research we can talk
for 45 minutes after but the the the

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460
for 45 minutes after but the the the
 

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.050

types of sensing modalities as I usually

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:03.570
types of sensing modalities as I usually
 

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.470
types of sensing modalities as I usually
say when working with robots and

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480
say when working with robots and
 

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.470
say when working with robots and
artificial sensing we also have to work

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480
artificial sensing we also have to work
 

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.110
artificial sensing we also have to work
with sensing that humans don't have such

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.120
with sensing that humans don't have such
 

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.390
with sensing that humans don't have such
as for example the ability to measure

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400
as for example the ability to measure
 

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.610
as for example the ability to measure
distance humans cannot do that not in

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:16.620
distance humans cannot do that not in
 

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.560
distance humans cannot do that not in
metric coordinates right but we can put

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:18.570
metric coordinates right but we can put
 

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.020
metric coordinates right but we can put
a laser or sonar on a robot and get the

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:21.030
a laser or sonar on a robot and get the
 

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.570
a laser or sonar on a robot and get the
metric information out directly so no

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:23.580
metric information out directly so no
 

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.000
metric information out directly so no
it's not so much in terms of integrating

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.010
it's not so much in terms of integrating
 

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.440
it's not so much in terms of integrating
the sensory information is about

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:27.450
the sensory information is about
 

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.780
the sensory information is about
representing it so how do we use the

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:29.790
representing it so how do we use the
 

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.910
representing it so how do we use the
sensory knowledge and how do we make

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920
sensory knowledge and how do we make
 

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.100
sensory knowledge and how do we make
sure how do we assess that the right

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:34.110
sure how do we assess that the right
 

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:38.030
sure how do we assess that the right
sensor or sensors are used for the right

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040
sensor or sensors are used for the right
 

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.820
sensor or sensors are used for the right
task so for example lifting a cap from

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:40.830

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.880
my map you too can say more about that
but I basically can use or will rely

and it could be the same in robot too

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:20.370
and it could be the same in robot too

and it could be the same in robot too
but then you have to select what is

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900
but then you have to select what is
 

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.630
but then you have to select what is
relevant and what is not relevant and
