Ambient sound: story being read to children


00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.910
DANA SHERIDAN:
The Cotsen Library

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
is a wing of rare books
and special collections.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.150
And it's the benefaction
of Lloyd Cotsen,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.330
who was in the class of '50.


00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.760
And it is over five
centuries worth of books,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.200
original artwork, documents,
manuscripts, toys,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.690
educational objects that are
all related to childhood.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.800
Rare Books is within
Firestone library,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.630
and the Cotsen Gallery
is in Firestone as well.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.430
When Mr. Cotsen donated his
collection to the university,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.810
he also said he wanted
a public gallery

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.530
for children and
outreach programming

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.720
for children that promote
a love of literacy.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.290
And the result here is
Bookscape, the Bookscape

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.670
Gallery, which is
open to the public.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.490
And it is free of charge,
as are all of our programs.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.150
It's a community portal
here at the university.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.740
At night, he sleeps in his
secret hiding place and has--

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.920
JOANI ETSKOVITZ: Kids just
have this natural sense

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.040
of wonder about everything.


00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.630
They want to learn,
because they're

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.330
genuinely fascinated by it,
because everything is magical.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.120
And I think that when you give
a kid a box of rhinestones,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.440
or a box sparkles, and a
little bit of inspiration--

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.090
a story or craft-- it just
excites that sense of wonder.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.070
And I hope that they
carry that wonder

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.110
into the rest of their lives,
as well as a love of reading

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.900
and creating.


00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.630 position:97%
 


00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.090
RYAN BUDNICK: I've
learned to never

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.720
be surprised by how
incredible these kids are.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.610
They'll astound you
with how much they know,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.240
and how quickly
they'll learn, and what

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.710
they're willing to try.


00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.320
MIRANDA MARRACCINI: It's
great working with the kids.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.630
Sometimes, they come back into
the office and ask what we do.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.260
And kids are always
really interested to hear

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.700
about what it is we do in
special collections libraries,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340
and to see the
books behind glass,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.490
and to know what they're for.


00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.750
And they're just really
eager to learn about it.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.770 position:97%
 


00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.900
ANDREA IMMEL: One of the
things that really gives us

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.080
continuing pleasure is the
fact that sometimes scholars

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.050
who have had
fellowships come back

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.790
later with their grandchildren
or their children.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.170
And sometimes, the
students who work for us

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.470
become scholars who use the
collection for their JPs,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.150
their senior theses.


00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.830
The synergy is
really a pleasure.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.050
And when I started
in 1995, I never

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.730
would have predicted
that we would

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.860
have had this kind of success in
fostering what Mr. Cotsen hoped

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.830
would happen.


00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.220 position:97%
 


00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.510
JARED CROOKS: As much as
this is for the children,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.390
at the same time, it's a space
for the students as well,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.960
like a little
hideaway that says,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.000
hey, remember this
when you were a kid?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.710
Remember when you
thought big things,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.460
and you dreamed crazy thoughts?


00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.890
This is still on campus.


00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.280
And so I feel like it's
a part of the community,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.790
just as it's a
part of ourselves.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.960
There is some part
of us that's hidden,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.920
and we see that
it's more childlike,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.410
and we can revert
to that safe space.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.970
And I think that this
does for the Princeton

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.810
campus what that place in
our heart does for ourselves.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.310 position:97%
 


00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.020
RYAN BUDNICK: We're
just hoping that they

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.070
leave with a better love
for knowledge and desire

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.780
to seek out new knowledge.


00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.790
And every once in
awhile, we'll hear

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.090
from an alumni of Cotsen
Critix, and they'll just talk

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.570
about whatever they're doing.


00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.920
And it's really incredible to
see that from this program,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.880
they both are getting a
lot and that they go on

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.140
to do incredible things.
