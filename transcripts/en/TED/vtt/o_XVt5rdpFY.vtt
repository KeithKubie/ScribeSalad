00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.656
I love learning foreign languages.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.736
In fact, I love it so much that I like
to learn a new language every two years,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.856
currently working on my eighth one.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.496
When people find that out about me,
they always ask me,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.616
"How do you do that? What's your secret?"

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.656
And to be honest, for many years,
my answer would be,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.000
"I don't know. I simply
love learning languages."

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.976
But people were never
happy with that answer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.976
They wanted to know why they are spending
years trying to learn even one language,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.536
never achieving fluency,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.616
and here I come, learning
one language after another.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.856
They wanted to know
the secret of polyglots,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.600
people who speak a lot of languages.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.816
And that made me wonder, too,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.136
how do actually other polyglots do it?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.656
What do we have in common?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.616
And what is it that enables us

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.080
to learn languages
so much faster than other people?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.720
I decided to meet other people
like me and find that out.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.816
The best place to meet a lot of polyglots

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.136
is an event where hundreds
of language lovers

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.016
meet in one place
to practice their languages.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.336
There are several such polyglot events
organized all around the world,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.736
and so I decided to go there

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.200
and ask polyglots
about the methods that they use.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.136
And so I met Benny from Ireland,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.320
who told me that his method
is to start speaking from day one.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.136
He learns a few phrases
from a travel phrasebook

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.736
and goes to meet native speakers

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.576
and starts having conversations
with them right away.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.376
He doesn't mind making
even 200 mistakes a day,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.840
because that's how he learns,
based on the feedback.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.616
And the best thing is, he doesn't
even need to travel a lot today,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.576
because you can easily have
conversations with native speakers

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.296
from the comfort of
your living room, using websites.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.096
I also met Lucas from Brazil

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.600
who had a really interesting
method to learn Russian.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.856
He simply added a hundred random
Russian speakers on Skype as friends,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.776
and then he opened
a chat window with one of them

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.240
and wrote "Hi" in Russian.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.576
And the person replied, "Hi, how are you?"

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.056
Lucas copied this and put it
into a text window with another person,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.656
and the person replied,
"I'm fine, thank you, and how are you?"

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.656
Lucas copied this
back to the first person,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.136
and in this way, he had two strangers
have a conversation with each other

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.576
without knowing about it.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.856
(Laughter)

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.776
And soon he would start typing himself,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.936
because he had so many
of these conversations

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.976
that he figured out how
the Russian conversation usually starts.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.336
What an ingenious method, right?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.856
And then I met polyglots who always start
by imitating sounds of the language,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.296
and others who always learn the 500
most frequent words of the language,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.720
and yet others who always start
by reading about the grammar.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.896
If I asked a hundred different polyglots,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.536
I heard a hundred different
approaches to learning languages.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.176
Everybody seems to have a unique way
they learn a language,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.080
and yet we all come to the same result
of speaking several languages fluently.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.416
And as I was listening to these polyglots
telling me about their methods,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.736
it suddenly dawned on me:

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.896
the one thing we all have in common

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.456
is that we simply found ways to enjoy
the language-learning process.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.256
All of these polyglots
were talking about language learning

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.536
as if it was great fun.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.136
You should have seen their faces

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.776
when they were showing me
their colorful grammar charts

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.296
and their carefully handmade flash cards,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.336
and their statistics
about learning vocabulary using apps,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.560
or even how they love to cook
based on recipes in a foreign language.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.416
All of them use different methods,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.216
but they always make sure
it's something that they personally enjoy.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.136
I realized that this is actually
how I learn languages myself.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.736
When I was learning Spanish,
I was bored with the text in the textbook.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.496
I mean, who wants to read about Jose

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.656
asking about the directions
to the train station. Right?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.016
I wanted to read "Harry Potter" instead,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.176
because that was
my favorite book as a child,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.856
and I have read it many times.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.496
So I got the Spanish translation
of "Harry Potter" and started reading,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.856
and sure enough, I didn't understand
almost anything at the beginning,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.096
but I kept on reading
because I loved the book,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.256
and by the end of the book, I was able
to follow it almost without any problems.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.896
And the same thing happened
when I was learning German.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.216
I decided to watch "Friends,"
my favorite sitcom, in German,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.336
and again, at the beginning
it was all just gibberish.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.536
I didn't know where one word finished
and another one started,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.216
but I kept on watching every day
because it's "Friends."

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.616
I can watch it in any language.
I love it so much.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.656
And after the second or third season,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.040
seriously, the dialogue
started to make sense.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.136
I only realized this
after meeting other polyglots.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.736
We are no geniuses

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.176
and we have no shortcut
to learning languages.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.016
We simply found ways
how to enjoy the process,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.416
how to turn language learning
from a boring school subject

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.640
into a pleasant activity
which you don't mind doing every day.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.696
If you don't like writing
words down on paper,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.416
you can always type them in an app.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.256
If you don't like listening
to boring textbook material,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.576
find interesting content on YouTube
or in podcasts for any language.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.296
If you're a more introverted person

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.336
and you can't imagine speaking
to native speakers right away,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.696
you can apply the method of self-talk.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.296
You can talk to yourself
in the comfort of your room,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.216
describing your plans for the weekend,
how your day has been,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.376
or even take a random
picture from your phone

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.136
and describe the picture
to your imaginary friend.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.656
This is how polyglots learn languages,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.536
and the best news is,
it's available to anyone

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.240
who is willing to take the learning
into their own hands.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.616
So meeting other polyglots
helped me realize

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.656
that it is really crucial
to find enjoyment

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.776
in the process of learning languages,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.840
but also that joy in itself is not enough.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.416
If you want to achieve fluency
in a foreign language,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.920
you'll also need to apply
three more principles.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.360
First of all, you'll need
effective methods.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.576
If you try to memorize a list of words
for a test tomorrow,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.976
the words will be stored
in your short-term memory

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.905
and you'll forget them after a few days.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.336
If you, however,
want to keep words long term,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.296
you need to revise them
in the course of a few days repeatedly

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.536
using the so-called space repetition.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.816
You can use apps which are based
on this system such as Anki or Memrise,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.176
or you can write lists of word
in a notebook using the Goldlist method,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.896
which is also very popular
with many polyglots.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.656
If you're not sure which methods are
effective and what is available out there,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.696
just check out polyglots'
YouTube channels and websites

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.496
and get inspiration from them.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.440
If it works for them,
it will most probably work for you too.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.816
The third principle to follow

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.000
is to create a system in your learning.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.936
We're all very busy and no one
really has time to learn a language today.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.736
But we can create that time
if we just plan a bit ahead.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.176
Can you wake up 15 minutes earlier
than you normally do?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.496
That would be the perfect time
to revise some vocabulary.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.256
Can you listen to a podcast
on your way to work while driving?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.736
Well, that would be great
to get some listening experience.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.216
There are so many things we can do
without even planning that extra time,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.896
such as listening to podcasts
on our way to work

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.576
or doing our household chores.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.896
The important thing is
to create a plan in the learning.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.416
"I will practice speaking
every Tuesday and Thursday

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.496
with a friend for 20 minutes.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.936
I will listen to a YouTube video
while having breakfast."

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.096
If you create a system in your learning,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.016
you don't need to find that extra time,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.480
because it will become
a part of your everyday life.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.096
And finally, if you want to learn
a language fluently,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.840
you need also a bit of patience.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.336
It's not possible to learn
a language within two months,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.256
but it's definitely possible to make
a visible improvement in two months,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.016
if you learn in small chunks every day
in a way that you enjoy.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.176
And there is nothing
that motivates us more

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.440
than our own success.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.016
I vividly remember the moment

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.720
when I understood the first joke
in German when watching "Friends."

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.136
I was so happy and motivated

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.176
that I just kept on watching that day
two more episodes,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.936
and as I kept watching,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.176
I had more and more of those moments
of understanding, these little victories,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.656
and step by step, I got to a level
where I could use the language

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.536
freely and fluently to express anything.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.080
This is a wonderful feeling.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.496
I can't get enough of that feeling,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.336
and that's why I learn
a language every two years.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.416
So this is the whole polyglot secret.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.296
Find effective methods
which you can use systematically

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.616
over the period of some time
in a way which you enjoy,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.520
and this is how polyglots learn
languages within months, not years.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.776
Now, some of you may be thinking,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.136
"That's all very nice
to enjoy language learning,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.696
but isn't the real secret
that you polyglots

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.320
are just super talented
and most of us aren't?"

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.400
Well, there's one thing
I haven't told you about Benny and Lucas.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:54.976
Benny had 11 years of Irish Gaelic
and five years of German at school.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.216
He couldn't speak them
at all when graduating.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.416
Up to the age of 21, he thought
he didn't have the language gene

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.856
and he could not speak another language.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.816
Then he started to look
for his way of learning languages,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.696
which was speaking to native speakers
and getting feedback from them,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.680
and today Benny can easily
have a conversation in 10 languages.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.416
Lucas tried to learn English
at school for 10 years.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.056
He was one of the worst students in class.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.696
His friends even made fun of him

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.336
and gave him a Russian textbook as a joke

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.096
because they thought he would never
learn that language, or any language.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.496
And then Lucas started
to experiment with methods,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.320
looking for his own way to learn,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.696
for example, by having Skype chat
conversations with strangers.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.536
And after just 10 years,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.880
Lucas is able to speak
11 languages fluently.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.560
Does that sound like a miracle?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.040
Well, I see such miracles
every single day.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.096
As a language mentor,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.536
I help people learn
languages by themselves,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.856
and I see this every day.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.056
People struggle with language learning
for five, 10, even 20 years,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.936
and then they suddenly take
their learning into their own hands,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.256
start using materials which they enjoy,
more effective methods,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.096
or they start tracking their learning

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.056
so that they can appreciate
their own progress,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.016
and that's when suddenly

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.240
they magically find the language talent
that they were missing all their lives.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.656
So if you've also tried
to learn a language

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.096
and you gave up,
thinking it's too difficult

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.376
or you don't have the language talent,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.936
give it another try.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.816
Maybe you're also
just one enjoyable method away

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.602
from learning that language fluently.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.896
Maybe you're just one method away
from becoming a polyglot.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.136
Thank you.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.360
(Applause)
