the kind of nuclear family model and
we've maybe we did that because of the

we've maybe we did that because of the
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.190
we've maybe we did that because of the

it's a mystery if you will how that

suggested for religion that they
wouldn't do for anything else after all

people is difficult unless you can just
 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.770
people is difficult unless you can just
blast them with a big weapon but if you

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780
blast them with a big weapon but if you
 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.590

have as in the early days of religious

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600
have as in the early days of religious
 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.479
have as in the early days of religious
wars where you have to actually go up to

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489
wars where you have to actually go up to
 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.000

somebody and cut their throat or beat
 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.039
somebody and cut their throat or beat
them up or do something that's hard work

them up or do something that's hard work

them up or do something that's hard work
and generally people do not want to be

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330
and generally people do not want to be
 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.539
and generally people do not want to be
killed and so they fight back and so

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549
killed and so they fight back and so
 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.250
killed and so they fight back and so
you've got quite a struggle going on

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260
you've got quite a struggle going on
 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.229
you've got quite a struggle going on
when all you're trying to do in your own

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239
when all you're trying to do in your own
 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.240
when all you're trying to do in your own
mind is perfecting the world for God or

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
mind is perfecting the world for God or
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.699
mind is perfecting the world for God or
you're gone it's a very interesting

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709
you're gone it's a very interesting
 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.670
you're gone it's a very interesting
question why that happens

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
 
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.830
 
it does seem that some religions are

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
it does seem that some religions are
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.350
it does seem that some religions are
somewhat more peaceful than others which

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
somewhat more peaceful than others which
 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.230
somewhat more peaceful than others which
is in principle a good thing except that

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240
is in principle a good thing except that
 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.650
is in principle a good thing except that
they may then get over rot or overrun by

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660
they may then get over rot or overrun by
 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.590
they may then get over rot or overrun by
more truculent religions and that has

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600
more truculent religions and that has
 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.910
more truculent religions and that has
happened we've seen it repeatedly it

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920
happened we've seen it repeatedly it
 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.620
happened we've seen it repeatedly it
it's almost certain that some religions

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630
it's almost certain that some religions
 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.590
it's almost certain that some religions
are better than others in the sense of

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600
are better than others in the sense of
 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.199
are better than others in the sense of
providing a peace of mind a sense of

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
providing a peace of mind a sense of
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.140
providing a peace of mind a sense of
social comfort a sense of decency than

social comfort a sense of decency than
 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.319
social comfort a sense of decency than
other religions one of the interesting

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329
other religions one of the interesting
 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.300
other religions one of the interesting
things about the Christian religion is

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310
things about the Christian religion is
 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.820
things about the Christian religion is
the notion of original sin or the
