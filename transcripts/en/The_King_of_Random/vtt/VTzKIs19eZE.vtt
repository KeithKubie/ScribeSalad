00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.390
Chances are you’ve thrown these things in
the trash without even knowing it. But if

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.919
you use them like this, they’ll spawn an
electric arc hot enough to melt any metal

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.690
known to man, and even turn rocks into lava.
In this project we’re modifying a fire brick

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.830
and some flashlight batteries, to build an
electrical arc furnace, on a budget.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.000
Let’s start this project, with a heavy duty
lantern battery, and this alumina silicate

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.940
refractory brick. The brick is 3” tall,
4.5” wide, and 9” long.  Let’s get to work making

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.900
the furnace by measuring lengthwise, and marking
at 3”, 4.5”, and 6”. This is where it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.059
needs to be cut, so it’s a good idea to
draw perpendicular lines with something like

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.690
a combination square to make it as accurate
as possible. Now get a mask ready, because,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.170
according to the safety sheet, silica dust
is something you really don’t want getting

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.579
into your lungs. These refractory bricks are
extremely lightweight and full of air bubbles,

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.899
which is why they’re so great at insulating
heat, but it also means we won’t need any

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.440
fancy tools to cut them. A simple wood saw
is all you need because the bricks are so

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.980
soft. In reality, you could probably carve
them out with kitchen utensils, if you really

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.150
needed to. I put a couple of bricks under
the edges to help channel the dust, and prevent

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.330
the blade from scratching the table when it
cut through. Ok, the 3 lines are cut, and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.250
you can see they separate the brick into 4
pieces. I designed it this way so that one

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.010
fire brick will make two furnaces, effectively
cutting the cost in half as well. Let’s

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.810
move on to carving out the reaction chamber,
and giving the furnace some special features.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.000
I’m using a 3/8” drill bit and a 2”
Forstner bit I got at my local hardware store.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.600
The Forstner bit makes it easy to target the
exact center of the brick, and doesn’t take

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.030
much of an effort to begin chewing away at
the refractory material. Drilling too fast

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.500
could rip the brick apart, so let’s take
it slow and steady until the hole’s around

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.730
2” deep, which should leave a 1” base
of insulation at the bottom. Clean out the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.760
dust, and you’ll see we’ve got a nice
little chamber for our reactions to take place.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.070
Now let’s turn the brick on it’s side
and use a 3/8” drill bit to burrow down

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.980
near the top. When it penetrates into the
chamber, keep going straight down into

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.950
the other side. And when it pops out the bottom,
gently push the bit outward to break through

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.190
the wall, exposing the holes. Let’s do the
same thing with the front end of the furnace,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.640
except this time we’re not going to go through
the other side. We’ll need to modify this

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.000
hole by drilling inward at about a 45º angle
until the tip of the bit meets the bottom

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.980
of the chamber. If we carefully work the bit
upward until it breaks loose, and clean up

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.230
the edges a bit, the bottom half of the furnace
is finished and looks awesome. The holes on

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.780
the sides are for the electrodes, and this
last one has a dual purpose. For watching

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.070
the reaction, and pouring molten metals. Now
the two smaller pieces are the lids for the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.840
furnace, and should only need a very small
modification. Two 3/8” holes drilled 1”

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.840
from the ends, and 3/4” from the sides to
form a place where we can safely store the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.920
electrodes when they’re glowing orange,
and too hot to put anywhere else. Speaking

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.250
of electrodes, we’re going to need carbon
rods like these to strike the arc, because

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.060
they’re the only things that will handle
the extreme temperatures. I went to a local

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.770
super center and picked up a 2 pack of 6 volt
lantern batteries for under $5. These ones

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.300
are the “Heavy Duty” kind. And don’t
worry if they’re new or used, because completely

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.120
dead batteries will work just as well. Now
we need to crack open the container and my

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.100
tool of choice for doing that is a pair of
wire cutters. If we break the lid off the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.250
top and cut the two wires holding it on, we’ve
got easy access to the 4 battery cells inside.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.710
Go ahead and snip the wires connecting the
cells together, then pinch the caps in the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.340
center, and gently pry them upward. With
a little bit of effort they should pop right

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.710
out of the casing, and just like that you’ve
got a carbon electrode ready to go. But that’s

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.090
not all. These batteries have all kinds of
fun things hiding inside. The casings on these

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.030
cells are made of zinc, and they’re packed
with manganese dioxide. So use something like

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.130
a screwdriver to scrape around the inside,
pulling all that crumbly gunk out. The

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.700
manganese dioxide could be saved for other
experiments, but in this project we’re just

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.310
interested in the carbon rods, and the zinc
casings. And I’m really excited because

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.100
we just scavenged 8 of them. Now just for fun, I wedged the zinc battery casings in my bench

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.150
vise, and started cranking to see if it would
make the casings a bit smaller. Apparently

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.300
you can crush them down so they’re really
compact, and that’s great because we need

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.910
them small for an experiment we’re going
to try in just a minute. The last thing we

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.980
need to make for the mini arc furnace is a
pair of adjustable stinger grips. I made a

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.670
trip to the hardware store for two 5’ lengths
of 8 gauge stranded copper wire, two 1/2”

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.980
copper couplings, #20 stainless steel hose
clamps and two sets of 6” locking pliers.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.290
I modified the pliers by removing the rubber
handle grips to expose the metal, then stripped

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.180
the end of the cables to expose the copper,
so they could be secured directly to the pliers

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.910
with the hose clamps. Now, if you put the
copper couplings on the other ends of the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.850
cables, and hammer them flat or clamp them with a bench vise, they make little copper lugs

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.590
you can hook up to an arc welder for power.
Like this homemade version I put together

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.250
with microwave parts. You might remember that
project where we center tapped the two transformers

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.940
so it could power the arc furnace on 120 vAC.
However it works much better on 240 volts,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.820
so let’s just leave it as is. Now since
the electrode grips are adjustable, they can

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.000
be set to bite perfectly onto any size carbon
rod we need, and hold them firmly in place.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.980
But there is something you need to know about
these scavenged rods before you use them.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.000
The first time they make electrical contact,
they’re going to catch on fire. There’s

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.430
some kind of wax in the rods that bursts into
flames as soon as they touch, and it’ll

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.820
take anywhere from 20-30 seconds to burn it
all out. It generates a lot of heat and a

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.270
lot of smoke, so try to do it outside and
away from anything flammable. At this point

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.780
our mini arc furnace is completely ready for
operation, so let’s test it out, with the

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.930
zinc battery casings we scavenged earlier.
With one casing in the chamber let’s go

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.750
ahead and set the lid in place, then power
up the arc welder so the electrodes are charged

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.470
and ready for action. The magic happens when
the rods are pushed through the holes in the

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.660
sides, and suddenly bump into each other,
striking a dangerous and blindingly hot arc

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.210
of electricity. In less than 10 seconds, you
can see the rods are already blazing hot, and amazingly,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.000
the metal has already liquified. 8 casings
later the chamber is full of liquid zinc.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.250
So now that it’s runny, let’s test out
the functionality of our built in pour spout.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.090
This is how easy it is to transfer molten
metal from the mini arc furnace, into makeshift

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.760
ingot molds. Now zinc has a relatively low
melting point, but this furnace is resilient

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.020
enough to tackle high temperature metals like
copper, and even steel as well. So if you’re

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.070
in the mood to see glowing streams of molten
copper, or sparks flying around the room,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.550
look for those extreme experiments in another
project video. Alright, our zinc muffin has

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.930
hardened, so let’s knock it out of the muffin
tray with a screwdriver, then dip it into

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.490
a bowl of water to quickly cool it the rest
of the way. The result is a beautiful chunk

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.180
of solid zinc, to add to our homemade metal
collection. As a word of caution, in you breathe

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.389
any of the zinc oxide fumes when melting zinc,
there’s a small chance of catching metal

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.820
fume fever. So if you recycling zinc yourself, be sure to wear a respirator, or do your

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.360
experiments outside to reduce the risk. Well
now you know how to extract carbon electrodes

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.169
from old flashlight batteries, and carve insulating
fire bricks into custom arc reaction chambers.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.760
By the way, if you cut the brick into 3”
blocks, you’ll get 3 furnaces. And you can

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.120
even modify them to hold graphite crucibles
for smaller experiments. Well that’s it

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.100
for now. If you liked this project, perhaps
you’ll like some of my others.
