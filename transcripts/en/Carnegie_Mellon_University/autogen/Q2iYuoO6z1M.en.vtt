00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.949
a look at the amount of money that we're
spending we're buying about 6 billion

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959
spending we're buying about 6 billion
 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.559
spending we're buying about 6 billion
barrels of oil more a year and that

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569
barrels of oil more a year and that
 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.500
barrels of oil more a year and that
comes out to more than 400 dollars a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
comes out to more than 400 dollars a
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.449
comes out to more than 400 dollars a
barrel for what it is that we're buying

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
barrel for what it is that we're buying
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.090
barrel for what it is that we're buying
we have to understand that oil costs us

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100
we have to understand that oil costs us
 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.080
we have to understand that oil costs us
a lot more than the current market price

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090
a lot more than the current market price
 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.730
a lot more than the current market price
so what are we going to do we have to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
so what are we going to do we have to
 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.909
so what are we going to do we have to
realize that oil is more expensive and

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
realize that oil is more expensive and
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.100
realize that oil is more expensive and
that the price of gasoline is more

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110
that the price of gasoline is more
 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.510
that the price of gasoline is more
expensive than what we're paying right

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520
expensive than what we're paying right
 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.620
expensive than what we're paying right
now rather than eking out small rises

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630
now rather than eking out small rises
 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.070
now rather than eking out small rises
every month every year in the price of

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080
every month every year in the price of
 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.650
every month every year in the price of
oil we have to understand that we want

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660
oil we have to understand that we want
 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.180
oil we have to understand that we want
to look forward to what the real price

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190
to look forward to what the real price
 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.990
to look forward to what the real price
of oil is and do something about it now

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000
of oil is and do something about it now
 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.460
of oil is and do something about it now
Europe and Japan currently priced

gasoline at about

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729
gasoline at about
 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.299
gasoline at about
gallon I figure that's probably about

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:50.309
gallon I figure that's probably about
 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:53.299
gallon I figure that's probably about
right at seven dollars a barrel I'm

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:53.309
right at seven dollars a barrel I'm
 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.879
right at seven dollars a barrel I'm
sorry seven dollars a gallon we would

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889
sorry seven dollars a gallon we would
 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.249
sorry seven dollars a gallon we would
start reducing our demand for oil we

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259
start reducing our demand for oil we
 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.019
start reducing our demand for oil we
wouldn't have to have Congress tell us

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.029
wouldn't have to have Congress tell us
 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:01.790
wouldn't have to have Congress tell us
that we need more stringent fuel economy

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800
that we need more stringent fuel economy
 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.679
that we need more stringent fuel economy
standards consumers would go out and

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689
standards consumers would go out and
 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.860
standards consumers would go out and
they buy those vehicles and so we don't

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870
they buy those vehicles and so we don't
 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.510
they buy those vehicles and so we don't
have to do a lot of stuff with more

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
have to do a lot of stuff with more
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.670
have to do a lot of stuff with more
government regulation all we have to do

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680
government regulation all we have to do
 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.989
government regulation all we have to do
is have a price that justifies that if

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:14.999
is have a price that justifies that if
 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:20.389
is have a price that justifies that if
we then have this $7 a gallon price that

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:20.399
we then have this $7 a gallon price that
 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:23.659
we then have this $7 a gallon price that
is a $4 a gallon tax on gasoline what

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669
is a $4 a gallon tax on gasoline what
 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.790
is a $4 a gallon tax on gasoline what
would that do to the economy well it

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800
would that do to the economy well it
 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.649
would that do to the economy well it
would raise about five hundred billion

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659
would raise about five hundred billion
 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.219
would raise about five hundred billion
dollars a year in new taxes he if you

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229
dollars a year in new taxes he if you
 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.779
dollars a year in new taxes he if you
had five hundred billion dollars a year

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789
had five hundred billion dollars a year
 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.329
had five hundred billion dollars a year
probably what most economists would

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339
probably what most economists would
 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:37.760
probably what most economists would
recommend is that you get rid of the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770
recommend is that you get rid of the
 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.639
recommend is that you get rid of the
payroll tax it is terribly regressive

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:40.649
payroll tax it is terribly regressive
 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:44.420
payroll tax it is terribly regressive
and it is very harmful to the economy if

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430
and it is very harmful to the economy if
 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.040
and it is very harmful to the economy if
we could get rid of that we would really

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050
we could get rid of that we would really
 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.799
we could get rid of that we would really
boost the economy and if we got rid of

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:48.809
boost the economy and if we got rid of
 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.350
boost the economy and if we got rid of
the payroll tax on the first $20,000

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360
the payroll tax on the first $20,000
 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.079
the payroll tax on the first $20,000
worth of income the poor would actually

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.089
worth of income the poor would actually
 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:56.089
worth of income the poor would actually
be better off they would have more money

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099
be better off they would have more money
 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.719
be better off they would have more money
to spend in their lives than they'd have

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729
to spend in their lives than they'd have
 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.909
to spend in their lives than they'd have
to pay for the additional price of

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919
to pay for the additional price of
 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.610
to pay for the additional price of
gasoline and so by doing something

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620
gasoline and so by doing something
 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.909
gasoline and so by doing something
intelligent about our energy policy we

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919
intelligent about our energy policy we
 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.559
intelligent about our energy policy we
would also be something doing something

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569
would also be something doing something
 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.199
would also be something doing something
intelligent about getting our economy

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:12.209
intelligent about getting our economy
 

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:14.209
intelligent about getting our economy
out of this recession that we seem to be

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219
out of this recession that we seem to be
 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.499
out of this recession that we seem to be
going into if we now take a look at this

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509
going into if we now take a look at this
 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.269
going into if we now take a look at this
is one more thing that we could do and

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279
is one more thing that we could do and
 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.179
is one more thing that we could do and
that is currently when you buy a new car

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189
that is currently when you buy a new car
 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.699
that is currently when you buy a new car
you you're told what the fuel economy of

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:25.709
you you're told what the fuel economy of
 

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:27.739
you you're told what the fuel economy of
that car is I've got a different

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:27.749
that car is I've got a different
 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.230
that car is I've got a different
suggestion why don't we put on the

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240
suggestion why don't we put on the
 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.129
suggestion why don't we put on the
sticker of the car how much that car is

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139
sticker of the car how much that car is
 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.339
sticker of the car how much that car is
going to use over its lifetime of

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349
going to use over its lifetime of
 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.040
going to use over its lifetime of
150,000 miles if you were buying a large

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050
150,000 miles if you were buying a large
 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.339
150,000 miles if you were buying a large
SUV that got 15 miles per gallon then

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349
SUV that got 15 miles per gallon then
 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.559
SUV that got 15 miles per gallon then
over 150,000 miles you'd have to buy

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569
over 150,000 miles you'd have to buy
 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.769
over 150,000 miles you'd have to buy
10,000 gallons of gasoline at $7 a

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:48.779
10,000 gallons of gasoline at $7 a
 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.379
10,000 gallons of gasoline at $7 a
gallon that's $70,000 that's enough to

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389
gallon that's $70,000 that's enough to
 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.230
gallon that's $70,000 that's enough to
make you think if instead you bought a

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240
make you think if instead you bought a
 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.360
make you think if instead you bought a
Prius at 50 miles per gallon you'd have

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370
Prius at 50 miles per gallon you'd have
 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.399
Prius at 50 miles per gallon you'd have
to buy about 3000 gallons of gasoline

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:58.409
to buy about 3000 gallons of gasoline
 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:59.850
to buy about 3000 gallons of gasoline
over its lifetime

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860
over its lifetime
 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.070
over its lifetime
the difference between those two that is

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080
the difference between those two that is
 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.830
the difference between those two that is
7,000 gallons at $7 a gallon it's

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840
7,000 gallons at $7 a gallon it's
 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.999
7,000 gallons at $7 a gallon it's
$49,000 that's enough to send your kid

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009
$49,000 that's enough to send your kid
 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.969
$49,000 that's enough to send your kid
to college right and I think that those

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979
to college right and I think that those
 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.159
to college right and I think that those
kinds of marketplace signals would

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169
kinds of marketplace signals would
 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.649
kinds of marketplace signals would
replace any need for regulation they

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:16.659
replace any need for regulation they
 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:18.540
replace any need for regulation they
would get us to go in exactly the right

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550
would get us to go in exactly the right
 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.170
would get us to go in exactly the right
direction I have this hope this hope is

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180
direction I have this hope this hope is
 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.600
direction I have this hope this hope is
that we will begin to think seriously

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610
that we will begin to think seriously
 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.879
that we will begin to think seriously
about our energy policy that will begin

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:26.889
about our energy policy that will begin
 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:29.249
about our energy policy that will begin
to do something about our imports of

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:29.259
to do something about our imports of
 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.730
to do something about our imports of
petroleum and in doing that I think we

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740
petroleum and in doing that I think we
 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.529
petroleum and in doing that I think we
would do the best thing we can to

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:34.539
would do the best thing we can to
 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:36.360
would do the best thing we can to
resolve this international terrorism

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370
resolve this international terrorism
 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.379
resolve this international terrorism
issue that faces us if we stop sending

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:40.389
issue that faces us if we stop sending
 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.899
issue that faces us if we stop sending
this 500 billion dollars a year overseas

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:42.909
this 500 billion dollars a year overseas
 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:46.980
this 500 billion dollars a year overseas
to buy oil then we would be starving the

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990
to buy oil then we would be starving the
 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.040
to buy oil then we would be starving the
terrorists I have this dream this dream

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.050
terrorists I have this dream this dream
 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.980
terrorists I have this dream this dream
is that we would force Osama bin Laden

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:52.990
is that we would force Osama bin Laden
 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.050
is that we would force Osama bin Laden
to start having bake sales in order to

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060
to start having bake sales in order to
 

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.360
to start having bake sales in order to
finance his terrorism that's what it is

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.370
finance his terrorism that's what it is
 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.770
finance his terrorism that's what it is
we need to do that's what the
