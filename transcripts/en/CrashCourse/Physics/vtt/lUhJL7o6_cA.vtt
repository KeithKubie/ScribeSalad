00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.720
E=mc^2

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.880
You hear it all the time.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.880
But what does it mean?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.370
During his study of special relativity, Albert
Einstein found that mass and energy are equivalent,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.559
and that they can be converted back and forth
between one another.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.620
He described that relationship mathematically,
saying that the energy of a particle is equal

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.340
to its mass, times the speed of light squared.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.790
This mass-energy equivalence is critical to
the study of nuclear physics – the study

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.790
of the atomic nucleus.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.560
This is a branch of physics that introduces
you to two of the four fundamental forces.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.620
One in which an element can turn into an entirely
different element, in just an instant.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.870
And one that has allowed us to unleash the
incredible energy that’s contained inside

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.260
every atom.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:53.860
[Theme Music]

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.280
Before we can dive into the wonders of nuclear
physics, we need to recall a little bit about

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.020
the thing that makes it all tick: the nucleus!

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.360
The nucleus of any atom consists of protons
and neutrons.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.690
The proton is positively charged, while the
neutron is electrically neutral, and both

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.210
particles have nearly the same mass.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.330
With the exception of hydrogen, which only
has a single proton in its nucleus, every

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.300
element has both protons and neutrons.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.600
Because of this, we’ll often refer the two
particles collectively as nucleons.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.990
We can describe how many protons and neutrons
are in an atom’s nucleus using its atomic

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.990
and mass numbers.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.660
An atomic number is how many protons are in
a nucleus, which also determines what element

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.940
the atom consists of.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.820
The mass number, meanwhile, is how many protons
and neutrons combined make up a nucleus.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.650
So if there are 6 protons and 6 neutrons in
a nucleus, then its atomic number would be

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.960
6, making it a carbon nucleus, and the mass
number would be 6+6, or 12!

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.100
And if there were 6 protons and 8 neutrons,
then it would still be a carbon nucleus, but

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.390
with a mass number of 14.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.560
Let’s put these carbon nuclei in nuclear
notation to better show the differences between them.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.320
First, we start with the chemical symbol for
the nucleus, which is determined by its atomic number.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.920
Then on the bottom left of the chemical symbol,
we write the atomic number, which will be

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.410
the same for both Carbon nuclei, 6.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.640
Finally, we write the mass number on the top
left, to signify how many protons and neutrons

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.720
there are in the nucleus.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.920
So for our carbon atom with six neutrons,
we’d take the Carbon chemical symbol, a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.630
capital C, and write the atomic number, 6,
in the bottom left and the mass number, 12,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.630
in the top left.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.010
For the atom with two extra neutrons, the
upper left mass number becomes 14.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.330
Any two nuclei that have the same atomic number
but different mass numbers are known as isotopes,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.990
with most elements having one isotope that
is more common than the others.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.060
For instance, 99% of the carbon on Earth is
Carbon-12, carbon with a mass number of 12.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.940
Only a tiny fraction of all carbon on earth
is Carbon-14, since carbon is most stable

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.319
when the number of protons equals the number
of neutrons.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.820
It’s important to know the masses of different
nuclei, since nuclear interactions are all

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.790
about mass-energy conversion.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.120
To quantify the mass of a nucleus, we use
the unified atomic mass unit, written just

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.120
as a small u, with a single neutral carbon-12
atom equaling exactly twelve unified atomic mass units.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.500
This means that one unified atomic mass unit
is equal to 1.6605 times 10^-27 kilograms.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.300
Okay, now that we have a notation for describing
elements and their isotopes, we can talk about

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.250
the energy associated with a nucleus and its
bonds.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.160
The first thing you should know is that the
total mass of a stable nucleus is always less

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.849
than the total mass of the individual protons
and neutrons put together.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.360
For instance, the mass of a neutral helium
atom is 4.002603 unified atomic mass units.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.500
But two neutrons and two protons – the component
parts of a helium atom – taken together

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.170
have a mass of 4.032980 unified atomic mass
units.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.880
That means that the nucleus of a helium atom
has 0.030377 unified atomic mass units less

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.020
mass than its component parts.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.111
How can that be?

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:58.020
Well, that difference in mass is equal to
an amount of energy, specifically the total

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.850
binding energy of the nucleus.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.959
That binding energy is how much energy you
would have to add to the helium atom in order

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.450
to break it apart its nucleus.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.730
The amount of energy required to break up
a nucleus into its component particles gets

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.790
larger as the atomic number increases, with
iron having one of the highest binding energies

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.790
per nucleon.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.481
But while the total binding energy still increases
for nuclei larger than iron, the binding energy

00:04:20.481 --> 00:04:23.240
per nucleon, in fact, decreases.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.840
This means that very large nuclei are not
held together as strongly as small nuclei.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.940
And since binding energy accounts for the
missing mass, you can calculate it using – you

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.310
guessed it! – e equals m c squared.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.330
Now, you might be wondering how a nucleus
is held together in the first place.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.310
You’ve got neutral neutrons that have no
problem getting close to one another, but

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.830
what about all the positive protons? Shouldn’t
the repulsive electric force keep them apart?

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.070
Well, one of the four fundamental forces of
physics is the strong nuclear force, an attractive

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.220
force that acts between protons and neutrons
in a nucleus.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.650
This strong force is substantial enough to
overcome the repulsive force between protons,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.400
but it only acts over very small distances,
while the electric force acts over longer distances.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.820
Since the strong force only works across such
tiny distances, larger atoms with high atomic

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.040
numbers actually require additional neutrons
to overcome the electromagnetic force and

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.300
maintain stability within the nuclei.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.270
Those extra neutrons are necessary for atoms
with atomic numbers higher than thirty or

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.220
so, as you can see in this chart relating
the number of neutrons to the number of protons

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.380
in a stable atom.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.830
And when a nucleus is UNstable, it can break
down into a more stable state.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.180
This decay of unstable nuclei, accompanied
by emission of energetic particles, is known

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.400
as radioactivity.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.380
Natural radioactivity was first discovered
by Henri Becquerel, who observed how a chunk

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.900
of mineral that contained uranium affected
a photographic plate that was covered up by paper.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.320
Even though the paper was blocking out visible
light, the radiation from the uranium penetrated

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.680
the paper and left its mark on the plate.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.080
Later scientists studied such decays and categorized
the emitted rays or particles into three different

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.760
groups, based on their penetrating power.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.760
First, there’s alpha decay, which is released
when an unstable nucleus loses two protons

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.290
and two neutrons, becoming a different element
in the process.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.919
In alpha decay, there’s a parent nucleus
– which is the original, unstable nucleus

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.510
– and it decays into a daughter nucleus
and an alpha particle, which is actually just

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.150
the nucleus of a Helium atom.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.800
This decay occurs because the parent nucleus
is too large, and the strong force is no longer

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.210
sufficient to hold all the nucleons together.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.199
For example, if the parent nucleus is radium,
it would decay into radon and emit a single

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.199
alpha particle.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.040
The process of the nucleus changing from one
element to another is known as transmutation.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.830
Note that the atomic number of radon is just
two units less than that of radium, and the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.250
mass number is four less than radium’s.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.520
In alpha decays, the sum of the atomic and
mass numbers are always equal on either side

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520
of the equation.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.530
But even though those numbers of nucleons
add up, remember: Mass and energy are equivalent.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.910
So the products of this reaction always have
less total mass – as measured in unified

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.710
atomic mass units – than the parent nucleus
has.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.040
The rest of mass turned into kinetic energy,
and the kinetic energy released in nuclear

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.860
reactions is what’s used to generate nuclear
power!

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.270
But alpha particles have the least penetrating
power of the three groups – they’re barely

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.070
able to pass through a piece of paper.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.770
The second type of decay that can occur is
beta decay, when an unstable nucleus emits

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.850
a beta particle, which is just an electron.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.670
You’ll see that whenever an electron is
produced, so is a neutrino.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.919
A neutrino is a particle with a very small
mass that is electrically neutral.

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.930
Its existence is inferred from the conservation
of energy.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.979
For example, when a nucleus at rest decays
into two fragments, it should give each fragment

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:32.789
the same amount of momentum.

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:37.199
If the nucleus decayed into the daughter nucleus
and an electron, the electron would always

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.669
have the same momentum, and the same energy.

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:43.940
But electrons from beta decay have been found
to have energies that vary greatly.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.760
This suggests that a third particle must be
carrying away the rest of energy.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.259
And experiments have confirmed that these
tiny, neutral neutrinos are responsible for

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:53.460
that missing energy.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.490
Now, a unique part of beta decay is that no
nucleons are emitted during the decay process.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.500
Instead, one of the neutrons changes into
a proton.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.319
And to compensate for the change in charge,
the neutron emits an electron.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:09.450
And although these electrons come from nuclear
decay, they’re the same kind of electrons

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.440
that orbit a standard nucleus.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.870
Once the neutron changes into a proton, the
nucleus changes from one element to another,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.020
again an instance of transmutation.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.780
And beta decay is caused by the fourth fundamental
force, the weak force.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.410
While the strong force acts on nucleons, the
weak force alters quarks, the fundamental

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.120
particles that make up both protons and neutrons.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.729
By converting quarks of one type into another,
the weak force causes the neutron to turn

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:34.729
into a proton.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:38.979
As for their penetrating power, beta particles
are typically stopped by a few millimeters

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:39.979
of aluminum.

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:44.010
The third kind of decay is gamma decay, which
is what results when a nucleus emits high-powered

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.290
photons, in what are known as gamma rays.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.300
This kind of decay usually occurs when a nucleus
is in an excited state, which can happen because

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.230
the nucleus is decaying from a larger form,
or because it collided with a high-energy

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.310
particle, among other reasons.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:03.110
But the point is, when a nucleus is excited,
it wants to transition to a lower-energy state,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.940
which it can do by releasing a photon.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.090
Unlike alpha and beta decay, no transmutation
occurs in gamma decay.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.690
Instead, the excited nucleus just decays into
a ground state nucleus and a gamma ray.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.600
Gamma rays have the highest penetrating power,
requiring large amount of concrete or lead

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.930
to stop their propagation.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.410
And there’s so much more we could talk about
if we had the time! Half-lives, radiocarbon

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.360
dating, the basics of nuclear power, just
to name a few.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.670
But, e=mc squared – now at least you know
what it means, and how such tiny objects as

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.010
atoms can release such enormous power.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.300
That’s worth 10 minutes of your time, right?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.500
Today we learned the very basics of nuclear
physics, including atomic number, mass number,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.779
and how to use them in nuclear notation.

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:48.050
We also discussing binding energy and mass-energy
equivalence, as well as the strong and weak

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.120
nuclear forces.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.220
Finally, we discussed the three major types
of radioactive decay: alpha, beta, and gamma.
