&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I'm very excited to welcome
Nancy Schulman and Ellen Birnbaum to Google

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.069
today.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.710
Nancy and Ellen met about 30 years ago.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.039
They were neighbors in a New York apartment
and happened to be pregnant expecting boys.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.439
Nancy, her first.

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.829
Ellen, her second.

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.279
And were due within a month of each other.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.789
Needless to say, this chance meeting led to
a very long friendship.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.160
They not only became life-long friends, their
children grew up together.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.940
Their boys are still very close friends.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.860
Coincidentally, they also were both working
in Early Education when they met.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.280
A few years into their friendship, they soon
found themselves working side by side at one

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.130
of the most admired nursery schools in the
country--the 92nd Street Y--where they worked

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.790
together for about 20 years building the school
and supporting families during the very special

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.790
preschool years.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.780
Today, Ellen is the director of the 92nd Street
Y and Nancy has recently joined the Avenues,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.810
the World School, to head their early education
program, which is opening next September.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.270
I'm sure 30 years ago, neither one of them
thought that they would end up writing a book

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.570
giving parents like themselves wisdom and
sharing their insights as they raised their

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.570
children.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.340
If you have not read their book, "Practical
Wisdom for Parents," I highly encourage you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.590
to check it out.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.830
We're selling copies in the back.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.180
Drawing from their 50 plus years of early
education experience, they cover topics in

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.060
the book like selecting the right preschool
for your child and family, discipline, potty

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.060
training.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.150
The book talks about play and activities that
are supportive and encouraging child's early

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.150
development.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.880
They even address topics like talking to your
child about moving, death, divorce, and sex--something

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.090
I really didn't think would end up in a book
about preschool years.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:18.959
So, I'd like to just welcome Nancy and Ellen
to share their insights on the preschool years.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.470
Throughout their talk, please feel free to
ask questions, share your insights, and we'll

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.770
have questions in the end as well.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.250
So, thanks for being here.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.651
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Thank you.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.651
Thank you very much.

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:33.651
[applause]

00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:34.651
Thank you, Faith, for inviting us.

00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:35.651
We're very excited to be here.

00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:36.651
This is our first time at Google.

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:37.651
So, we're excited.

00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:38.651
But the most exciting part is to see--.

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:40.650
I can't believe how many fathers are here.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.650
It's really cool.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.920
I mean, mothers we always see.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.630
But dads, this is really cool.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.630
I'm Nancy.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.320
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: And I'm Ellen.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.430
I think it's very clear to both of us, since
we've been doing this, the role of fathers

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.171
has changed dramatically in the last 15 years.

00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:02.890
And there is so much more hands-on parenting
from dads.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.970
And we've seen a shift in the nursery school.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.640
Fathers always came to parent conferences,
but when Nancy and I started having parent

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.290
conversations, we started to see increasing
numbers of dads over the years.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.190
And we're so happy to see that because it's
the consistent messages that go from both

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.370
parents to children that are so important.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.280
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: So, we really think that
the preschool years--.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.470
And we're talking about two-year olds through
five-year olds-- is the most important time

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.900
in the life of a family and in the life of
parents.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.830
This is an amazing period of time and it's
the time that's very exhausting and overwhelming

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.480
as new parents are moving into this phase,
but it is by far the time when parents have

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.290
the most influence on the life of children.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.290
You're there.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.739
You're spending a lot of time with your children,
too.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.739
And you're really laying the foundations for
who you're gonna be as a parent at this time.

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.650
You define what's important to you, what's
important to your family, what the rules are

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.739
in your home, thinking about all of those.

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.840
How to create children who are decent and
good and compassionate and cooperative and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840
respectful.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.959
All of those things really happen during these
preschool years.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.370
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: And the most challenging
part of being a parent of a preschooler is

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.109
the transition from the infant/toddler parent
to the preschooler parent.

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.979
And you can see we have an infant on the floor
and you have to keep your eye on them all

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.140
the time because there's no end of trouble
that they're gonna get into because they have

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.680
no idea about limits and boundaries.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.960
And as you transition into the parent of a
preschooler, you need to take a little bit

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.090
of a step back so that you can support their
independence from you because that's your

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.090
goal in life.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.300
It's to care for them so that there can be
a person in the world without you.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.930
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: So, the first thing that
really starts to happen, and if you have two-year

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.070
olds, you probably heard, "I want to do it
myself."

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.730
That's the first thing that they start to
say when they have this growing independence.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.949
And one of the greatest things that parents
can do for children is to really allow them

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.160
the time and the ability to do things for
themselves.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.710
It's the thing, probably more than any other
thing, that helps build a feeling of confidence

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.710
in children.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.790
When they feel competent that they can handle
their own needs, do the things that they need

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.650
to do for themselves, you see this incredible
puffed out feeling of competency and confidence

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.660
that comes from just doing basic things for
themselves.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.100
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: So, in an early childhood
classroom, children are taught this wonderful

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.630
Maria Montessori coat flip.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.110
Have you ever seen a child--?

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.250
You put the coat in front of your toes, backwards,
with the collars facing you.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.510
And the child digs their hands in and then
they flip the coat over their heads.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.009
And you see this incredible "Aha, I did it"
moment.

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.509
And that's the beginning.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:59.680
But children also in classrooms will put that
coat on their hook each day.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.240
They will come to the table and eat and sit
in a chair and have a conversation in there

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.419
and pour their own water.

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.370
They'll throw their things away in the garbage.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.759
They're expected to clean up the classroom
materials.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:18.070
So, all of those things fostering this great
sense of pride and independence.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.960
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: One day in the nursery school,
we saw parents coming in and there was a father

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.880
who was bringing their two and a half-year
old daughter to the classroom.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.139
And I was just watching from afar and she
did this thing that was so funny.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.380
She just took her coat and let it drop behind
her very dramatically in that way.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.009
And I just watched to see what he would do.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.490
And he did what most of us would do-- the
expedient thing.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.229
He picked it up and he put it on her hook
for her.

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:50.130
And later on, we were telling this story to
a group of parents and a mother looked and

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.130
said, "Oh, that was my daughter for sure,
and my husband for sure."

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.009
And we said, "Yeah, we weren't gonna tell,
but yeah.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:58.009
It was."

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.419
Because it's those little moments of thinking
about what to do and how to support a child

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:07.790
that means you have to raise the bar a little
bit at each stage--every few months as they

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:13.190
get greater and greater capability of doing
things, to have the expectations grow at the

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.880
same time their skills are growing in that
way.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.010
So, that father in that moment, because he
was probably in a hurry to get to work or

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.110
doing whatever he was doing, picked up the
coat and did that.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.250
But as soon as he left, when the teachers
came out, they were gonna expect this child

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.340
to do that for themselves.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.450
So, it's always a confusing message.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.699
So, parents need to keep pace with children
as their development happens.

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:38.690
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: So, right now there seems
to be an emphasis from parents and from the

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:44.400
culture for children to assume skill sets
that they don't really need.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.550
I mean, a child doesn't really need to learn
to play tennis when they're three, or join

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.440
a soccer league when they're two and a half.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.289
But they do need to be able to do all these
other things.

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:00.639
One day, we have an after school program at
the nursery school and one of the four-year

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:05.500
olds was taking a tennis lesson up on the
racket ball courts on the top of the Y.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.849
But he had left his backpack on the sixth
floor where the nursery school is.

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:14.950
So, I went up with it and his caregiver was
there and she was spoon-feeding yogurt to

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.950
him.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.260
Tennis lesson, couldn't feed himself.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.270
It was a little confusing to me, so I went
downstairs and I called his mom.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:28.380
And I said, "I thought you should know that
your caregiver was feeding him and I was a

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.380
little confused."

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.729
'Cause he was able to play tennis.

00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:31.860
He should be able to feed himself.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.249
"Oh, I'm gonna talk to her.

00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:35.249
I told her not to do it anymore."

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:39.439
And of course, the next day, the caregiver
came up the elevator and threw her arms around

00:08:39.439 --> 00:08:42.619
me and hugged me and she said, "I told her
I shouldn't be doing that anymore."

00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:49.239
So, she knew clearly that the bar should be
the same for all of that.

00:08:49.239 --> 00:08:53.619
If you're expecting your child to be able
to do that kind of thing, they should go to

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:59.829
the bathroom on their own and wipe themselves
and be able to do the basic stuff.

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:03.709
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: It's interesting because
when you think about what children need from

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:10.339
parents at this age, all those things, it
can't be done with small bursts of high-quality

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:11.339
interaction.

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:15.540
I think the idea of quality time was a really
bad thing because the definition of quality

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.519
time means there can be no negative interaction
if we want it to be high-quality.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:27.959
So, small bursts of high-quality time with
children, or large bursts of low-quality time

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:28.959
with children are not gonna--.

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:30.089
They need both from parents.

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:37.100
They need to be able to spend time doing fun,
focused activities together, playing together

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.819
and doing those kinds of things.

00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:44.259
And they also need to get ready for the bath
and to have a conflict over who's gonna eat

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:45.470
your peas.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.499
And all of those kinds of things are what
children need from parents.

00:09:48.499 --> 00:09:50.769
It can't be just one way or the other way.

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:51.769
They need to know.

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:53.630
They need to know when you disapprove of them.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:59.100
They need to know when those things are happening
and they only get it when it comes from the

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.160
parent directly.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.600
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Nancy was talking about
having the courage of your convictions.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.509
If you think what they're doing-- whoever
is telling you right or wrong--isn't right,

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:15.439
you need to be able to stand up to them and
for them.

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:19.329
Wendy Mogel, who wrote this wonderful book
called "Blessing of the Skinned Knee," talks

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:22.310
about assuming a mantle of authority with
your children.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.260
You need to be in charge.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.639
You're all in business.

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:28.500
You have a certain authority in the workplace.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.009
Children need that from you as well.

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:34.059
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: My daughter used to say
to me when I perfected the look--.

00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:36.540
You know the look, the disapproving look?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.410
Every parent should have one of them.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.839
And she used to look at me when she was about
three-- 'cause I had to do it a lot with her--

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.420
she used to say, "Stop yelling at me."

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.879
I never said a word.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:46.049
And I thought, "Good.

00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:47.049
She gets it.

00:10:47.049 --> 00:10:48.290
She knows."

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.009
They need to know your approval and they need
to know your disapproval.

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:55.699
It's how they take on their own sort of moral
development in that way, too.

00:10:55.699 --> 00:11:00.890
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: When Nancy and I first got
the opportunity to write the book, we were

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.079
struggling with what should come first.

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:07.089
Should we talk about home or should we talk
about school?

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:10.769
School was the thing we were most comfortable
with.

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:16.480
And then we thought about the children who
were so happy at school who were really successful

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.519
at being at school.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:23.970
And we said, "If parents understood the expectations
of what we were doing here and they could

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:28.819
mirror it some way at home, we could have
this wonderful consistency which works so

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:29.819
well with children."

00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:33.699
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: So, the thing that works
so well with children in school that's easily

00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:37.329
translatable to home is certainly consistent
expectations.

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:41.860
When you're managing a group of 16 children,
you have to have consistent expectations every

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.860
day.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.679
When you're a parent at home where there's
two parents or a caregiver and two parents,

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:51.310
or one parent and a grandparent-- whatever
your dynamic is at home--the consistency of

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.290
expectation is essential.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.139
And if that consistency can match the consistency
of what teachers expect at school, you see

00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:02.639
children coming to school with a level of
comfort and confidence about "I get this.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.209
I know what they're expecting of me.

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:05.339
It's similar at home.

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:08.209
I'm asked to put my toys away at home.

00:12:08.209 --> 00:12:11.959
So when they ask me to put my toys away here,
it's not an unfamiliar concept."

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:16.110
We have a movement class where children have
to take their shoes and socks off.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.299
Well, taking your shoes and socks off is very
easy for a three-year old and a four-year

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:20.299
old.

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:21.299
Putting them on--another story.

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:22.470
It's a little more difficult.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.230
So we always tell parents and we laugh at
class because at the end, you can always tell

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.579
children who have never had the expectation
of doing that for them.

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:32.459
They sit at the end of the movement class
with their feet out like this.

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:35.689
It never occurs to them to attempt this.

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:37.170
And it's hard to put socks on.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.309
That's not an easy skill.

00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:40.619
But you need some time and you need to break
it down.

00:12:40.619 --> 00:12:42.720
And you need to support it as they're doing
it.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720
I'll do a little.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720
You do the rest.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.860
And give them that time.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.170
But it takes time to do all that, too.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.540
And it's not easy.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.999
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Predictable routines.

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:53.410
Children are creatures of habit.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.970
They love the same routines.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.449
Start, first we're gonna do this and then
we're gonna do that and then we're gonna do

00:12:59.449 --> 00:13:00.449
that.

00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:01.449
And that's how classrooms are organized.

00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:03.939
They come in in the morning and there's free
play.

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:08.619
And they know the Play-Doh is gonna be on
one table and can have toys and manipulatives

00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:09.619
on the rug.

00:13:09.619 --> 00:13:15.189
And then there's a signal and a transition
to come together as a group.

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:18.779
And most classrooms will have a little bit
of a group time.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:22.899
And there's no conversation or discussion
about it because every day, the teacher's

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:26.569
gonna do the same schedule for the child.

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:28.949
And they have internalized it.

00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:34.129
We now have a visual schedule in every classroom
of what comes next.

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:40.259
They don't have that little agenda book, which
I use-- 'cause I'm still a Luddite-- or a

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:44.540
little a little PDA that you can go into your
calendar to see what's happening that day.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.139
So for them, it organizes them.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.209
It makes them feel very comfortable.

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:51.850
And on top of things, when they can predict
what's happening next.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:57.549
They don't tell time by looking at a watch,
but they know after snack there's outdoor

00:13:57.549 --> 00:14:02.800
time and after outdoor time, we're gonna have
story and then we're gonna go home.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.360
And the organization of that from the outside
is internalized in them.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.779
And it really gives them that executive functioning
that we're all looking for.

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:17.100
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: So, things like routines
at bedtime and routines in the morning where

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.860
there's the most conflict--they don't wanna
go to bed, they don't wanna get dressed to

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.860
go to school.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.929
The times when you're rushing out you need
them-- anything that can be put into a routine

00:14:25.929 --> 00:14:27.290
is so helpful.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.839
We've had parents tell us that they've taken
this concept of a visual schedule before bedtime

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:36.399
and they'll do a little thing where they'll
actually take a picture that they'll post

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:43.470
on the child's wall of "first, there's bath
time and then teeth brushing and then story,"

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.490
and then they'll actually take a picture of
them in their bed.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.939
And instead of having a fight over "come on,
it's time to brush your teeth.

00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:52.850
Come on, it's time to take your bath," it's
just there.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.589
OK, this is the thing.

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:55.589
And it works.

00:14:55.589 --> 00:15:00.259
And it works because children know exactly
what to expect and it's the same every time.

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:04.189
If you change it up from day to day--.

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:11.029
Children have this incredible sense of knowing
where to zone in on the weak spot on parents.

00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:12.329
It's kind of radar-like.

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:17.620
It's like, "Well, if you say the answer is
yes today and the answer is no tomorrow and

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.669
it's maybe the next day," they're gonna zone
in right where you really aren't sure of yourself.

00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:24.240
And that's where the conflict arises.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.119
So, the more you can put into a routine and
a sense of order for them, the easier it is

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:32.100
for them to respond to something like that.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.319
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Nancy and I, a few years
ago, realized that there were a whole group

00:15:35.319 --> 00:15:41.129
of other people involved in the lives of children
that we were not including in the messaging.

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:46.030
And that was the caregivers who are watching
children when they weren't at school, or they

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.030
weren't with their parents.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:53.079
So, we started having meetings and including
them into what the self-help skills we were

00:15:53.079 --> 00:15:56.149
using, what the children were learning at
school every day.

00:15:56.149 --> 00:15:57.769
And we noticed a change.

00:15:57.769 --> 00:16:03.979
So, it's very important whether it's grandparents,
whoever your children are spending time with

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:09.470
to have those conversation about what your
expectations are, what are the rules in your

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.470
house?

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:16.259
What do you feel comfortable with in terms
of language with your child?

00:16:16.259 --> 00:16:17.879
What is that schedule?

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:22.669
When my daughter went off with her husband
and left her two-year old with us, I got a

00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:27.169
very detailed schedule of what his day should
be like.

00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:34.670
And I kind of played around it--don't tell
her--but I tried to stick to it to a certain

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.290
extent because I knew that would make him
feel more comfortable.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:43.100
He was in my house and it was unfamiliar to
him in the way his own routine might have

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.100
been.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.069
And it was very helpful to know what times
of day certain things that happened.

00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:52.369
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Another thing that's really
important that we are aware of in classrooms

00:16:52.369 --> 00:16:56.410
and it's great to have at home is the time
the children need to make a transition from

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.379
one activity to the other.

00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:03.100
Classrooms use great techniques of you play
a musical instrument, you sing the clean-up

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.100
song.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.620
You sing a million different songs to get
them from one activity to the other.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.970
You have little techniques to get children
to say a warning.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:10.990
Every child needs a warning.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.170
They need a five minute warning.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.139
"In a few minutes, we're gonna start cleaning
up and then come over to meeting, getting

00:17:16.139 --> 00:17:17.389
ready for lunch."

00:17:17.389 --> 00:17:18.579
Whatever it is.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.419
Because they can't move from one thing to
the other.

00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:24.480
They're really intensely involved in play
when they're doing it.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.610
And they really can't move from one to the
other.

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.529
So, it's great to give them the warning so
they can get themselves ready.

00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:33.130
It doesn't mean they'll pay attention to you,
but they get themselves ready.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.500
I always have this image in my head of a child
sitting in their room and they're playing

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.830
with their Lego and they're making this incredibly
imaginative world and they're doing that.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.210
And someone's yelling from the other room,
"Come on in.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.480
It's dinner."

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.900
And the child is hearing, "Wa wa wa wa."

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.909
And then, the second time.

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:52.909
Again, "Come on.

00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:53.909
I called you already.

00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:54.909
Dinner."

00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:56.670
And they're hearing, "La la la la la."

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.670
Something out there.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.179
And the next thing they do is they look and
there's some kind of lunatic adult standing

00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:04.470
at their door yelling at them, "I told you
five times to come in."

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.860
And 'cause they just didn't have that direct
contact, if you walk in and you get on their

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:15.429
level and you look in their face and you say,
"Andy, it's time to start cleaning up.

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:16.790
We're going to have dinner in a few minutes.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.790
Why don't I help you?"

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.340
And then get them ready and transition them
to the next activity.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.139
It enables them to really do that for themselves
and incorporate that kind of ability to move

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:27.159
along in their day.

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:31.389
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: The other thing is to really
understand a child's pace.

00:18:31.389 --> 00:18:36.860
They're not in the same hurry we are to get
to that next thing.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.059
And they really like to finish what they're
playing with.

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:44.659
They have this unfinished like, thing that
they--.

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:49.770
So, putting whatever they're doing aside or
saying, "We can come back to that," is often

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.240
the thing that gets them able to move forward.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:19:00.480
Or, planning in your life time so that they
can get dressed by themselves, or time enough

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.670
to travel to where you need to get to.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:09.250
We had one parent at one of our lunch talks
say she was rushing to work.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.690
She had to get her daughter to preschool.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.380
And she was wearing a cardigan sweater.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.530
And she wanted to button it herself.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.539
And you know how many buttons are in a cardigan?

00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:25.281
And she looked at her watch and said, "Well,
I can either get to work a little late, get

00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:29.180
to preschool a little late, but she's gonna
be able to do this."

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.679
And she allowed her child the time to do that.

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:35.259
So, it was very satisfying for the child.

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:41.519
You have to be a little bit aware of their
temperament and their timing and pacing.

00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:46.820
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: One of the hardest things
for parents to deal with is discipline because

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:52.159
none of us wanna feel like we're being bossy
with our kids and whatever, but discipline

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:54.909
I think is often misinterpreted as punishment.

00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:57.240
And discipline is not punishment.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.330
Discipline is the external order that children
need to have and have repeated in order for

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:07.940
them to internalize a set of rules and a set
of understandings for them to really get what

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.730
it is that's really important about behaving.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:18.490
And unless they've had the external part of
this really defined for them, they can't really

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.690
internalize all of it and with its consistency.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:28.659
I always like to think about like, the job
of the parent is to hold a limit here.

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:30.940
And the job of the child is to press up against
that.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.919
They will press wherever they can press.

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:33.919
And they're gonna keep pressing.

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:38.340
And sometimes it's exhausting 'cause it'll
take 15 times of saying no about the same

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.679
thing in order for them to get it.

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:46.990
But if you keep pressing and the expectation
is a moving target, they don't know when to

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.200
stop pressing.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.490
So, if you really believe something is important,
if you really want to establish a set of clear

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.169
limits in your own household, you have to
just be consistent about it.

00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:58.360
I had this--.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.860
My daughter, when she was three, was a child
who needed limit-setting because she was always

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.700
pushing the boundaries.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.500
And one day she looked at me and she said,
"Can I have ice cream for breakfast?"

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.790
And I said, "No."

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.539
And then Day Two came and she said, "Can I
have ice cream for breakfast?"

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:14.539
And I said, "No."

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:15.539
Day Three, Day Four, Day Five.

00:21:15.539 --> 00:21:16.539
"Can I have ice cream for breakfast?"

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:21.039
And I'm thinking to myself, "Oh, what's the
big deal.

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:22.610
It's milk."

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:27.039
[laughs] I'm rationalizing why I don't have
to keep saying no to a child.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:31.630
She not asking for anything so off on then,
the light bulb went on and I said to myself,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.630
"Oh, God.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:39.620
If I don't say no to her now, this conversation
is going to be really impossible at seven,

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.100
thirteen, and seventeen.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.750
We're gonna have so many big issues."

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.710
And that's why it's important to think about
the tone and setting those limits at this

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.340
age because you can't start doing it when
suddenly, they're 13 and they're asking you

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:59.220
to go to a really big party where there's
going to be nobody there disciplining, or

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.010
nobody there supervising.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.740
And so, you have to start from the beginning
and you have to know your child and what they

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.330
need and decide what's important to you in
your life 'cause they absolutely need to know

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.620
where those limits lie.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.080
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: And your children might
be different.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.509
My, our--we didn't have these children together--but
my older--

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:17.509
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: [ laughs and comments inaudibly
]

00:22:17.509 --> 00:22:21.100
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: child and Nancy's older
child were very self-regulating.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.940
They were the kids who always put their things
away, knew when it was time to get ready for

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.899
bed, and brush their teeth.

00:22:27.899 --> 00:22:31.230
Our second children were both much more challenging.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.840
And one day, my daughter, who was five years
older than my son, looked at me and she said,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.539
"You know, Charles thinks he's in charge of
us."

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:41.289
And I said--I had my "aha" moment--and I said,
"Oh.

00:22:41.289 --> 00:22:46.500
I guess I better set some more limits for
him than I'm already doing because I did not

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.220
need to do that the first time around."

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.860
So, they may be different.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:56.460
And you may have one of those marvelous, self-regulating
children, but you have to be the parent to

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.039
each of your children in the way.

00:22:58.039 --> 00:23:01.679
But children do love rules.

00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:02.899
They crave them.

00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:04.730
They need them.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:10.331
And in every classroom at the nursery school,
beginning of the school year, the teachers

00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:14.169
brainstorm what are gonna be the rules of
the room that year.

00:23:14.169 --> 00:23:15.581
And so, we include it in the book.

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:17.490
We included some of those rules.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.960
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: OK.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.220
This is rules from four-year old children
they made.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.539
Now, if you give a four-year old an unlimited
set of time, the rules will be endless.

00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:29.510
You will have 50 rules because they're craving
the rules.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.910
So this is a short list of four-year old rules:
Play nicely with your friends.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.169
Fighting isn't nice.

00:23:35.169 --> 00:23:37.360
Running around playing monster is dangerous.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.941
Absolutely no punching, pushing, kicking,
hitting, choking, pinching, pulling hair,

00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:44.519
and biting.

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:47.249
Try to figure out a way for everyone to play.

00:23:47.249 --> 00:23:48.990
Always tell the truth, even if you don't want
to.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:53.610
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: I love this one: Listen
to your teachers all of the time.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.610
Don't tattle.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:55.610
Work it out.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.450
Don't laugh at someone's mistake.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.450
Speak in a medium loud voice.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.049
No guns.

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:02.049
Ask for things.

00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:03.049
Don't grab.

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:04.600
No teasing anyone.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.440
Don't knock other people's buildings down.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.620
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: I think these are good rules
for all of us to live by.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.620
[Ellen Birnbaum laughs]

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.809
I think this works.

00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:11.809
But it's very funny.

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:15.250
I was in a classroom last year with a group
of parents and we were walking around.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:20.259
And on the board, there were the classroom's
list of rules.

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:23.799
So, I said to the children in front of this
group of parents, "What is that?"

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:25.389
They said, "It's our rules."

00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:27.309
And I said, "Who wrote it?"

00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:28.309
And they said, “We did."

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:29.760
And I said, "What's Number Five?"

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.350
And they said, "Hands on your own bodies."

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.169
I mean, they all knew it.

00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:34.269
They didn't know how to read.

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:36.929
They just knew this was their rules.

00:24:36.929 --> 00:24:39.409
Therefore, they could really use them.

00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:46.350
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: The other thing that comes
up a lot is watching how adults handle children's

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.450
frustrations.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:54.360
I think our first instinct is to swoop in
and fix things for children and smooth the

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360
way for them.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.909
You don't want to see them frustrated and
struggling through.

00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:05.960
But the best thing you can do is to stand
back and allow them time to work through problems.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:13.249
It is the child in the classroom, or in life,
who is going to tenaciously stick with something

00:25:13.249 --> 00:25:15.519
until they've accomplished it.

00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:20.210
And in order to do that, they have to experience
frustration along the way.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.790
When the building falls down, we're gonna
build it back up.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:27.039
If things aren't exactly right, what can we
do?

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:28.980
How can we brainstorm?

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.460
How can we work together to make that problem
go away?

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:37.070
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Even at the youngest level,
when your toddler, near 18-month old, who

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.970
are the most dangerous things on the planet--you
just have to keep them alive every day.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.980
That should be your goal with a toddler.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.220
'Cause they get into all kinds of stuff and
they don't know any danger.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.910
You watch what happens when they fall down.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.270
The first thing they do is look at your face.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.870
They look at the face of the parent to check
out if they're OK or not.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.940
It's like a titration for pain.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.490
And if you look at them and go like, "Oh,
my God.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.759
What's in my baby?"--they're gonna cry automatically,
whether they hurt themselves or not.

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:05.720
But if they look at you and you say, "OK.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.260
Let me help you up.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.260
Let's go."

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.490
You see a whole different mental set for the
child.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.760
And they're looking for you to say, "It's
OK."

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:21.240
And when it is OK to help them be resilient
in that way, they learn that it's OK--.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.750
When you think about what people need in the
workplace when they grow up, they need to

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.960
be self-regulated.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.929
They need to be also resilient.

00:26:27.929 --> 00:26:31.549
You need to figure out how to solve a problem
when things don't go well.

00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:32.809
That's really important.

00:26:32.809 --> 00:26:38.259
How to help children move towards that starts
really, really young.

00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:43.470
And parents can set the tone for that in every
interaction that you have by doing that over

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.720
and over, saying, "It's OK.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.289
We're all OK."

00:26:47.289 --> 00:26:49.169
And giving them the OK message all the time.

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:55.059
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Another thing we've been
talking about so much is--you're all in a

00:26:55.059 --> 00:27:01.049
cooperative, creative kind of work here--and
when we're watching children in classrooms,

00:27:01.049 --> 00:27:10.940
what we want to encourage them to do is to
take some risks and to experience success

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:19.490
sometimes and failure other times and to be
able to tolerate not having things go exactly

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.100
right all the time.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.830
And so, we're commenting on their attempts.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.400
"I can see you really took a long time with
that."

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.759
Or, "That was really difficult and you really
stayed with it."

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:38.380
And we're encouraging parents to do the same
thing as opposed to praising them for accomplishments.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.029
It's a very, very different kind of message.

00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:45.259
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: One of the things that we've
observed, obviously, over the last number

00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:49.770
of years is the pace of life for children
and for adults.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:55.590
I think all of us are very pushed to be moving
in a very fast-paced kind of world that we

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.940
live in.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.950
And as a result, children--.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:05.149
We, as adults, we manage our own paces of
what we need, but children are being pushed

00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:10.350
through in terms of over-scheduling and through
paces really, really quickly.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.080
It is not healthy for children, in any way,
to be over-scheduled.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.909
And I think for us, we're feeling really the
pressure that parents are feeling to make

00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:25.320
sure that they're getting as early as possible
every advantage into life and every opportunity

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.460
to, what we were talking about, playing tennis
at three or being on the soccer team or playing

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.999
the violin, or whatever it is.

00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:33.690
You have to accomplish so much.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:41.700
JoAnn Deak, who is a fabulous brain researcher,
says "an overloaded brain does not grow well."

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.860
It's a great thing to understand how children
learn.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:51.809
And children learn by playing and being involved
and having hands-on experiences of all kinds--digging

00:28:51.809 --> 00:28:56.890
in the dirt, doing the things that probably,
hopefully you really imagine and remember

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:01.039
from your childhood of the things that really
made you happy and the things that really

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.119
gave you satisfactions.

00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:08.150
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: So we know because we both
are committed and believe that a play-based,

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:13.570
early childhood, nursery school, or school,
is how children learn best.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:17.100
And they learn best from doing.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.580
Children cannot learn virtually.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.940
They can't watch something and learn it.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.619
They have to manipulate real things in real
time to understand them.

00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:26.619
That's how children--.

00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:28.580
They learn through all of their senses.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.309
They learn from touching and tasting and moving
their bodies through space.

00:29:33.309 --> 00:29:40.200
I mean, in a classroom, if a classroom teacher
wants to teach the children about the color

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.570
orange, they're gonna mix yellow and red at
the easel.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.369
They might eat oranges.

00:29:45.369 --> 00:29:49.580
They might go on an orange hunt throughout
the classroom and find things that actually

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.809
are that color.

00:29:50.809 --> 00:29:55.590
They're gonna sing a song about it, 'cause
there's gonna be an auditory learner in the

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.000
group.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.330
And they might do it in lots of different
visual ways.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.779
But that's how children learn everything.

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:05.460
And we cannot deprive them of that.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.620
You can't make up the zero to five time.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.320
They can only learn between those years.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:18.269
That's when the brain is most opened and fluid
and all those synapses are taking place.

00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:25.309
The other thing JoAnn Deak talks about is
the need for the time for a child's brain

00:30:25.309 --> 00:30:27.720
to process that information.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.610
And that only happens during down time.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.559
You know that time where you think they're
bored 'cause they're not doing anything?

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:38.059
That's when their brains are regrouping, like
a computer.

00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:40.919
They're consolidating the information.

00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:43.610
They need sleep to be able to do that.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.399
Sleep is when all of that happens.

00:30:45.399 --> 00:30:48.830
And quiet time is when all of that happens.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.860
And they can't do it without it.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.900
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: It's interesting.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.669
We see definitely the impact of what happens
when children have too much going on in their

00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:59.970
lives in the classroom.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:05.820
When they have too much too soon, or too many
things that go on, you see children who lack

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.299
focus, who talk about being bored.

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:11.169
It's very interesting that boredom doesn't
mean that at all.

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:12.919
They need a lot of direction.

00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:17.019
They're not very creative because they can't
really think for themselves because they've

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:19.370
gone from one structured activity to the other.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.820
And everybody's telling them what to do--line
up here, do this, let's kick the ball, let's

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.820
do this.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.999
And they can't really think for themselves
about the kinds of things that creativity

00:31:27.999 --> 00:31:29.960
really comes from.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.960
And they often say--.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.909
It's very sad to see a three- or four-year
old in a classroom looking around a wonderful

00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:40.049
classroom with a lot of wonderful things and
great activities going on saying, "I don't

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:41.710
know what to do."

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.850
They can't initiate play for themselves.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.590
They can't really think for themselves.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:49.960
And they can't really make choices because
the choices keep being made for them.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.650
And so, they haven't practiced the skill of
making a choice and making a decision and

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.740
then finding they don't really like that or
they do really like that.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.370
And those are the things that really push
children to really be creative thinkers and

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:02.370
problem solvers.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:07.429
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: You know, in the book, when
we went to research toys because our kids

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:12.440
were pretty old by the time we wrote the book,
and we went into a toy store.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:18.460
And there was actually a video on digging,
as opposed to like, going to the park and

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.220
taking a shovel and digging.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.340
A child would be actually--.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:26.010
The idea of a child sitting on a sofa at home
watching somebody dig?

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.010
It was horrifying.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.080
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: It was horrifying.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.299
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: It was a horrifying moment.

00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:37.610
But one day, one of the teachers was showing--trying
to show--a film on the VCR and it was broken.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.799
And we had this old-fashioned TV at school
with VCR.

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:42.320
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: VHS.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.850
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: VHS.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.489
And Nancy said, "I'm gonna replace it."

00:32:46.489 --> 00:32:47.489
And what?

00:32:47.489 --> 00:32:48.489
What happened?

00:32:48.489 --> 00:32:51.070
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: I went to every store on
86th Street to replace this thing to watch

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.320
the end of this stupid video tape.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.320
And I walked into the store--

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: They were laughing.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.809
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: and it must have been the
moment in time when there were no more TV

00:32:58.809 --> 00:33:00.889
sets and everything was a flat screen.

00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:01.970
And I walked in and I looked at them.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.720
I said, "I need a TV with like a--."

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.129
And they looked at me like I landed from another
planet.

00:33:08.129 --> 00:33:09.129
And I said, "No, no.

00:33:09.129 --> 00:33:10.129
I really need--.

00:33:10.129 --> 00:33:12.090
It comes in a box and it's kinda square.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.269
You may have seen them.

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:17.830
I'm sure you might have one in the back corner
of a dusty store room."

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:22.779
They actually found me the last TV on the
planet, which I brought back to the classroom,

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:23.860
told the children the story.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.590
And I left the box in the room with this.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.570
And the guessing game that just happens around
"what's in the box?"

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.179
Now of course, we took the TV out of the box.

00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:33.759
And you know what the end of the story is.

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:38.289
They played for the rest of the day with the
box because the box was so much more interesting

00:33:38.289 --> 00:33:41.030
than anything else that you can imagine playing
with.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:46.499
But I think that a great reminder in looking
at toys for children is that a toy should

00:33:46.499 --> 00:33:49.529
be 90 percent kid, ten percent toy.

00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:52.369
If it has a battery, it's not a good toy.

00:33:52.369 --> 00:33:55.860
If you can't play with it in more than three
ways, it's not a good toy.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.581
You need to have something that you can play
with in many, many different ways and that

00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:04.169
the child can determine how the play needs
to go, as opposed to the toy determining how

00:34:04.169 --> 00:34:05.259
the play needs to go.

00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:06.639
[Ellen Birnbaum clears throat]

00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:11.339
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: I was gonna say that one
of the best class trips that our children

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:16.940
go on each year is they go to Central Park
and they dig for worms in the Spring.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:22.340
You can't imagine the joy of finding your
first worm and putting it into a jar.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.409
Then we have to tell the parents to pretend
they're having a good time, too.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:27.540
But they do because they're children are.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.990
But there's so much about nature that is important
for children.

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:39.309
And if you live in New York City, you still
have lots of access to parks and playgrounds

00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:43.919
and going along the waterways and talking
with your children and experiencing nature

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:44.919
with your children.

00:34:44.919 --> 00:34:47.810
And it is a very important part of life.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.980
They need to be connected to this planet,
to this world that we live in.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.210
And there's nothing like a first-hand experience
with real things.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:00.180
It's also a great way to talk about death
with children.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.010
It fits into the cycle of life.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.220
You know, this plant is green and this plant
is brown.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.930
What's the difference?

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.339
But there's all of this.

00:35:09.339 --> 00:35:14.339
And the Academy of Pediatrics, the American
Academy of Pediatrics, really stresses the

00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:18.550
importance of outdoor play and moving their
bodies as well.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.030
You get that opportunity, too.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.280
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: The other thing that the
American Academy of Pediatrics says, has come

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:29.390
out recently with the position on is no TV,
video, or computers for children under the

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.970
age of two.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.369
And it is almost--.

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:38.880
It is the most natural thing in the world
for a child to pick up their parent's technology

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.920
and just, they just do it.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.819
And they just obviously can do it, but there's
nothing in it that they can really learn that

00:35:44.819 --> 00:35:47.510
they really need at that point in time in
their lives.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:53.290
And I think that the National Association
of Education for Young Children has come out

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:58.549
with a position paper on technology and media
with children from birth to age eight.

00:35:58.549 --> 00:35:59.900
And it needs to be limited.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.400
It can be used in very effective ways, but
it really needs to be limited.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.680
And the time spent using it needs to be limited.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:11.819
And it's very hard for parents, and for children,
who find it very seductive to be working on

00:36:11.819 --> 00:36:14.910
computers and to be doing games with children
on computers.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:20.829
They're so into it, but children really learn
only by doing and being involved in interactive,

00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:22.780
three-dimensional real things.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.150
And they must have time for play.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:30.599
And computers absolutely have a role in their
life and will continue to.

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:33.020
But it must be on a limited kind of basis.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:38.390
And children need time to do things like every
day stuff--doing the laundry with you, going

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.890
shopping at the supermarket, walking down
the street.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:45.760
In terms of technology--I just wanna mention
one other thing-- it also means that parents

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.630
have to turn off, too.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:54.549
We asked parents a couple of years ago to
say, "If you can think about how many minutes--'cause

00:36:54.549 --> 00:36:59.200
it really comes down to minutes--in a day
that you spend with your child that's undivided

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:07.319
time when you're not distracted by looking
at something else, texting on something else,

00:37:07.319 --> 00:37:12.950
working on the computer, making dinner, reading
a book, reading the newspaper, looking through

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:19.770
your mail, whatever it is, checking email
constantly, whatever that time is, is time

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.340
that children do not understand you're focused
on them."

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:27.030
Children only think you're focused on them
when you're actually making eye contact with

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.060
them--when you're on their level and looking
at them.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.000
If you're doing this and you're using your
thumbs and you're doing this and talking to

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.849
them at the same time, they do not know that
you are actually listening.

00:37:38.849 --> 00:37:39.849
They need you to--.

00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:40.849
You should tell the story about the car.

00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:44.650
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Well, I was getting dressed
for work one morning and there was a wonderful

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:50.020
program on NPR about this couple, who were
going on trip with their children.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:57.150
And the mom left her device, her cell phone,
Blackberry, whatever, in the trunk of the

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.190
car.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:03.140
And she was forced to have this interaction
with her children.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:08.300
So they were playing games and they were looking
for punch buggies along the highway.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:16.190
And then she realized that it was such a wonderful
opportunity to actually converse and play

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.000
with her kids.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.349
It was more relaxed.

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:21.010
She wasn't distracted.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:25.460
So, she and her husband, after that experience,
took turns leaving--.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.020
You know, because it's very irresistible.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.200
If you have it, you're gonna use it.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.930
So, putting it away is the only way to control
that.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:40.790
But I was thinking we had a language specialist
also in our last conference and talked about

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:48.380
how the technology is affecting language acquisition
of children who came from homes where the

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:54.690
parents were at a certain level of education,
always had a distinct advantage of acquiring

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:59.940
language and vocabulary at a much more rapid
rate than people who are less well-educated

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.470
because we naturally go into a narration of
the world.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.570
From the time our babies are born, we're talking
about them and what we're doing.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:12.859
But that has decreased with all the distraction
of devices.

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:19.550
And there is a risk for a child not to hear
the language, not to be interacting.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:23.359
When they're two, you're supposed to have
two back and forth conversation--.

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:28.950
You know, a child should be able to answer
back two times, a three-year old three times,

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.099
four-year old.

00:39:30.099 --> 00:39:33.630
Back and forth conversation should be at a
flow.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:39.540
But a child's not gonna be able to do that
if they're not made eye contact with and they're

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.260
not being talked to.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.170
So, that's a big risk.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:51.010
And what Nancy's saying is that you have to
put together some kind of diet for yourself

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.500
with the technology, both for the child and
for the parent.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.760
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: And you have to give permission
to yourself to play because children really

00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.960
wanna do that.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.670
So, being outdoors, running, climbing, jumping,
throwing, drawing, pretending, reading, telling

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.670
stories.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.440
They love to hear stories about you when you
were a child, too.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.220
Playing games, solving puzzles--those are
the ways in which interacting with children

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:17.569
on their level at this age is the most wonderful
kinds of interactions that you can have.

00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:22.260
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: One of my favorite memories
of playing with my kids is creating tents

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.260
in my house.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:27.260
You know, you take the big blanket and you
have a flashlight and you put it over the

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.260
chairs.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.700
I think every child-- you can remember doing
this when you were a child.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.530
It was just a lot of fun.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:38.069
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: So, one of the things that
we did when we wrote this book--.

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:39.880
We were talking before we wrote the book.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.349
We were talking about why it is that certain
children seem so comfortable in their own

00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:53.079
skin and why they come to school feeling like,
really able and capable and confident in all

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:54.170
those ways.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.800
And we said, "No one reads anymore.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.020
Let's see if we can figure out what are the
commonalities that are in the lives of those

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.780
children that make them feel so good in their
own skin."

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.780
So we came up with a page of bullet points
of all the things that we could discover about

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.850
these children and their families.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.940
And we said, "All right.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.500
We can do this on one page."

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.500
Which we did.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.010
And we put together bullet points that were
on one page to give to parents.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:24.260
And then we wrote 352 more pages about all
of those things and a few more things, too.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.750
[chuckling] But we thought we'd just close
with sharing with you some of the things that

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:29.750
really parents--.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.150
Parenting is definitely not a sprint.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.680
It's a marathon.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.849
And there's an awful lot of things that you
can do a lot of mistakes in your life.

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:42.220
But if you can incorporate as much of this
stuff into your lives with your children,

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.430
it makes all the difference in the world.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:52.710
So, some of those are establishing clear routines,
encouraging age appropriate self-help skills,

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:58.180
sharing family meals whenever you can, allowing
children to experience frustration and cope

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.180
with disappointment.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.799
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Helping children problem
solve and be resilient, teaching respect for

00:42:03.799 --> 00:42:07.910
others, the difference between right and wrong
and the importance for taking responsibility

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:15.140
for actions, insisting on basic manners, especially
saying "please" and "thank you," thinking

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.980
about the family as a team and understanding
that all of a child's developing skills are

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:26.800
important, not just their academic skills,
setting aside unstructured family time.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.960
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Giving children time and
space to play, limiting after-school activities,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.750
understand that though school is important,
the most important influence in children is

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.750
home.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:43.640
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: I think we end with the
two most important things that, as a parent,

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.170
if you do nothing else, you need to do these
two things.

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.570
You need to love them unconditionally.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.839
Love the child that you have, not the child
that you wanted to have.

00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:55.940
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: And also to set limits.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.260
There's a lot of things that you can make
mistakes in, but when you do this and you

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:05.299
set limits and love your child unconditionally
and know who they are, they grow up as healthy,

00:43:05.299 --> 00:43:06.869
secure children.

00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:08.869
If you do one and not the other, it's not
enough.

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:10.490
You have to do both those things.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:14.010
Anything else of these other things that you
can layer into your life as parents makes

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.380
all the difference in the world.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.940
It also means to have fun, to have a sense
of humor, and to know that there's no such

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.319
thing as a perfect parent.

00:43:21.319 --> 00:43:25.670
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: And if the days seem endless,
the years fly by.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.859
And the one thing you can't get back is that
time.

00:43:28.859 --> 00:43:31.599
So, worry less and enjoy it more.

00:43:31.599 --> 00:43:37.630
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Thank you and we would love
to hear some questions from you.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:38.829
[applause]

00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:41.770
So what are some of the things you guys struggle
with?

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:42.770
Yeah?

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.200
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: In my case I
have two things that are regarding the attitude

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.290
of my two and a half year old.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.329
I'm worried about patience.

00:43:49.329 --> 00:43:50.451
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Yours or your child's?

00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:51.451
[laughter]

00:43:51.451 --> 00:43:52.451
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: A little bit
of both.

00:43:52.451 --> 00:43:53.451
Not of both, but his.

00:43:53.451 --> 00:43:55.619
He actually thinks patience is the rainbow
circle on the iPad.

00:43:55.619 --> 00:43:57.390
He calls that patience.

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:02.010
And so, you read the M&amp;M story--the famous
M&amp;M story--and I'm just wondering, are there

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.090
ways that parents can teach that in this on-demand
world?

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.780
We'll listen to the radio and he's like, "Play
Lady Gaga again."

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.320
And I'm like, "I can't.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.550
It's on the radio."

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:14.599
But they just assume, in this on-demand world
that can happen.

00:44:14.599 --> 00:44:19.280
So I'm just curious kind of in this digital
world, how do we teach about patience?

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:30.830
And the other one is entitlement, especially
for these New York kids.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.980
They have nannies.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.119
They are going to preschool and have somebody
hovering over them all the time.

00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:39.119
I try to go out of my way to try to ignore
them sometimes.

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:40.119
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: That's great.

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:41.119
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: It's because
I am concerned--.

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:42.119
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Good for you.

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:43.670
I think the fact that you're thinking about
it at all is going to make a difference.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:46.920
I think we set an example in terms of patience,
too.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:53.480
I think if we're so fast-paced and New Yorkers
talk so fast.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.270
It's so hard to keep up sometimes for children.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:03.010
So, I think just the fact that you're slowing
down and you're setting a different pace will

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.010
help them.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:06.559
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: It's also, I think, nature
has a really great place.

00:45:06.559 --> 00:45:07.559
You know what?

00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:08.559
Plant a seed.

00:45:08.559 --> 00:45:12.890
I was just thinking about like, as an opportunity
for learning.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.570
You plant a seed.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.210
The seed doesn't come up the next day.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:17.720
You have to water it.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.720
You have to check it.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.839
You have to keep going back and checking it.

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:25.430
Having things that are not obviously instant
gratification in their lives, to give as many

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.700
examples of those things that are possible.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.910
I think it' a hard thing to fight against.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.109
It's great that you're thinking about it.

00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:37.160
I think in terms of the caregiver piece of
this, one of the things that we started doing

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.930
a number of years ago, was really including
caregivers in our conversations at school

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:43.910
because when you think about it--.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:48.309
I think when you have someone who is helping
out, taking care of your child, you're paying

00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:50.500
them to do something that's for your child.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:56.309
And I think that what is really important
is that they understand and include as many

00:45:56.309 --> 00:46:01.050
conversations as you can have with your caregiver
about your expectations.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:06.560
And that it's OK for them to struggle getting
dressed by themselves and that it's OK for

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.400
them to figure something else out by themselves.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.650
I think that doesn't happen naturally unless
you set the tone for that and explain that's

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.650
really important.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.390
And we've started to do that with caregivers
because they're such an important part of

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:23.890
a child's life that you wanna make sure that
that consistency of expectation is there for

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.510
everybody who's interacting with your child.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:32.020
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: I wanted to speak to your
point about entitlement because I think if

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:37.440
you're fortunate enough to have the ability
to send your children to these quality programs

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:43.020
and you're living your life in that way, you've
set an example for your children in the way

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.250
you give back and allowing them to participate
with you.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:54.869
We just had Thanksgiving, so at the nursery
school, we have a bake sale, but part of the

00:46:54.869 --> 00:46:57.750
bake sale was to bake things for--.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:04.420
Goddard Riverside has Feeds the Homeless,
so the children from some of the classes bake

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.440
baked goods for Goddard and then we have them
make cards for it.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:15.339
You can do that with your children in whatever
way that you can teach them that part of being

00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:19.030
a responsible person is to give back and to
help take care.

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.010
And that could start in the home.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:26.180
Just having them help you take care of things
in the house and making them feel like they

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.869
have some responsibility back to the family
team that we were talking about.

00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:34.450
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: I think doing things like
helping make the salad, doing things where

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:39.250
it's really like doing something that helps
everybody else--cleaning up your toys, doing

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.250
that thing.

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:43.510
There's a great story that Wendy Mogel tells
also.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:44.960
It's about buying things for your kids.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.680
I think as working parents, we overly worry
about the guilt stuff.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.950
Guilt is such a wasted emotion.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.630
And it really interferes with good common
sense.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:58.730
But in terms of thinking about things like
what we buy for our kids, in terms of that,

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:02.250
she tells a great story about a little boy
who loved his Matchbox car.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:05.250
And everywhere he went, this Matchbox car
came.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:10.110
So his father went out and bought a whole
case of Matchbox cars for him because, of

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.470
course, more is better.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.059
And the child stopped playing with the cars
entirely.

00:48:14.059 --> 00:48:18.030
And the father said to the child, "Why don't
you play?

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.980
I thought you loved your Matchbox cars.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.099
Why don't you play with them anymore?"

00:48:21.099 --> 00:48:24.530
And he said, "I just don't know how to love
this many cars."

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:31.410
And it's such a poignant story because it
just is so easy to slip into that feeling

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:37.270
of "it's coming from a good place and I want
to do more for my child," but in doing that,

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:41.619
you're also doing something that undermines
the value of what they have.

00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:45.950
If something that it breaks that's replaced
right away, it's undermining that value.

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:51.000
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I was just wondering
if you had any thoughts on the difference

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.460
between a child that goes to a day care and
a child that stays with a stay-at-home mom.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.350
And what type of daycares actually do as good
of a job or better?

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:06.350
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Well, I have a grandchild
at a very high-quality daycare.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:10.720
His experience is extraordinary and now, the
nine-month old is there.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.809
It depends on the program.

00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:18.690
I see a very healthy, well-developed child
because the child's needs are being met over

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:20.240
the course of this long day.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.010
The pace of the learning and the pace of his
day at each and every age and stage was very

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:27.390
appropriate.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:36.030
And I watch that my daughter and my son-in-law
were focused on their children when they were

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:37.030
home.

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.089
And so, there was a very nice balance.

00:49:39.089 --> 00:49:45.569
So these children went off and they understood
what it means to be part of a group and could

00:49:45.569 --> 00:49:46.569
accommodate.

00:49:46.569 --> 00:49:54.089
So, I think you have to just look for a program
that you feel comfortable with that has trained

00:49:54.089 --> 00:49:59.460
teachers and is going to be very good at communicating
with you.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:05.420
Because if you have your child in school from
8:30 to 4:30, or whatever your needs are,

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.130
you're gonna need a lot of communication from
that school.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.079
And the school should want a lot of communication
from you.

00:50:11.079 --> 00:50:12.980
So that's a really important thing to ask.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.470
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: I think it's a hard decision
because there's no right and wrong with this,

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:17.470
either.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.740
And you have to do what you think is most
appropriate for your life and your family,

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.740
too.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.300
I would say that the one thing about putting
your child in daycare or keeping your child

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:30.720
at home is that they do have, at least starting
around age two, some group experiences with

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.809
other children.

00:50:31.809 --> 00:50:35.190
So, between two and three, they become social
for the first time.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:38.500
They're not parallel playing, but they’re
really playing with each other.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.020
And I think children really get a tremendous
amount from spending time with other children.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:49.380
You don't really learn to share [chuckles]
unless that truck is going to be battled over.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:54.859
And you need to have those experiences to
figure out what you need to do to negotiate

00:50:54.859 --> 00:50:56.319
your way in the world.

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:58.970
But there's not a right or wrong decision
about--.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:06.020
I mean, you can spend time at home and really
not be doing some high-quality things.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:11.430
And a daycare can go from being something
really incredibly high-quality to also being

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:12.430
not.

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:15.220
I would look at the track record of the teachers
there.

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:19.430
I would look at their qualifications and the
turnover rate at any daycare and talk to parents

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.980
whose children go there to see about their
satisfaction with it.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:29.750
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: So, my 15-month
old son is starting to make projectiles out

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.020
of an increasing number of things--

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.020
[laughter]

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.910
including food and books and you know, he
just likes to see things go--

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:37.910
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: It's fun.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.910
It's fun.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:39.910
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: and fly through
the air.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:40.910
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Where are they gonna land?

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:41.910
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Right.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:46.750
So, it's obviously difficult for him to understand
what is OK to throw and what is not.

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:50.470
And we're starting to develop tactics for
disciplines.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:55.630
So, at what age do you think kids can understand
"no" and at what ages are different forms

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:57.690
of disciplines effective and appropriate?

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:01.140
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Well, he can understand
the difference right now of "yes" and "no."

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.400
And I think it's a hard thing 'cause you don't
want him to not throw things, but you don't

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.059
want him to throw that thing then.

00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:11.079
So, I think one of the things about 15-month
olds that are wonderful is that they're easy

00:52:11.079 --> 00:52:12.079
to distract.

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.079
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Yeah.

00:52:13.079 --> 00:52:14.779
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: I mean, he's looking for
your reaction.

00:52:14.779 --> 00:52:18.220
There's no question that you know, you throw
something and you get a reaction.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.329
And that's the fun part of doing that.

00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:22.839
But it's really easy to say, "OK.

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:25.779
Let's go in the other room and throw socks
at the bed."

00:52:25.779 --> 00:52:31.279
You can turn it so that you can make it an
appropriate activity as opposed to saying

00:52:31.279 --> 00:52:32.500
"no."

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.410
And then, just turn it a little bit, too.

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:39.339
But when you're picking up something to throw
that's going to break something or hurt someone,

00:52:39.339 --> 00:52:41.750
there's just this simple thing is "no."

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:42.990
You take it away.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:44.250
You change the activity.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.250
Remove him from the room.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:46.500
And you say "no."

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.819
And you say it very clearly and very firmly.

00:52:49.819 --> 00:52:51.510
And you change the look on your face.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.070
It's not like, "No, sweetie.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:54.329
We don't throw things."

00:52:54.329 --> 00:52:55.660
That doesn't get anybody anywhere.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.660
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Right.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.900
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: You have to change the look
on your face.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.820
You have to change tone quality.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.860
And you say "no" and you take it away.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:06.000
And then you can't expect them to be happy
because they're going to be really mad at

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
you.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.319
And when they're about three, they'll tell
you they hate you because you've done it.

00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:13.420
And they don't mean that, but they mean it
in the moment.

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.750
But you have to be clear.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.020
He can understand it right now to do that.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:24.590
But distraction is the first round and then
a clear "no," removing the object, changing

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:25.590
the activity.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:30.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: So, at what age
do you certain time-outs and words--?

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:37.180
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: The rule of thumb with time-outs
is that this is a chance to take the temperature

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.390
down, change the activity.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:44.049
I don't think until three, probably, that's
very effective because they won't stay.

00:53:44.049 --> 00:53:45.049
[laughs]

00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:46.049
They just won't.

00:53:46.049 --> 00:53:47.049
You can't get them to.

00:53:47.049 --> 00:53:48.049
You can't make them.

00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:52.170
And usually the rule of thumb is time-out
is no more than the age of the child.

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:55.890
So, you would never have a time-out more than
two minutes or three minutes for anything.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:59.910
And sometimes, it just means you have to stop
the activity and move it elsewhere, or just

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.910
to say--.

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:05.089
In school, we wouldn’t call it a time-out,
but we would call it just like, "We need to

00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:06.089
take a break.

00:54:06.089 --> 00:54:09.599
We need to just take some big deep breaths.

00:54:09.599 --> 00:54:10.839
Let's just do something else."

00:54:10.839 --> 00:54:17.450
Sometimes, it's just changing your like, -- Their
engines are running fast.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.590
You want to turn the engine down a little
bit.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:23.470
And even describing it to them as an engine--for
little boys, that's a great technique, too.

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:25.110
Let's see if we can turn it down.

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:28.110
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: The other thing is when
they're there, you need to be here.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:33.309
You need to really keep your tone down.

00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:37.910
And we all talk too much at children when
they're like that.

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:39.769
That's the other major no-no.

00:54:39.769 --> 00:54:43.260
So, moving them, we need time to think, calm
down.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.260
It helps.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:45.840
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Thank you.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.039
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Hope he didn't break anything.

00:54:48.039 --> 00:54:49.039
[laughter]

00:54:49.039 --> 00:54:51.599
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I have a question.

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:54.440
It's probably my son's fault that your son
throws things 'cause they play together.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.750
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Oh, let's blame it on each
other.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:56.750
It's a great technique.

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:57.750
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Setting a bad example, yeah.

00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:01.660
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I have a question
about TV watching.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:02.660
I'm gonna bring it up.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.740
I'm totally guilty.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:06.640
My two-year old loves TV, loves movies.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.089
And for me, it's actually a saving grace in
the day.

00:55:09.089 --> 00:55:10.089
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Of course.

00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:12.420
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I need that 30
minutes where he can watch a TV show.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:16.310
And I'm trying to be careful about selecting
what he's watching and making sure that it's

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:17.359
age appropriate.

00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:22.869
But I would say he's probably watching 30
minutes, sometimes up to an hour a day.

00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:24.769
And I know, I don't know.

00:55:24.769 --> 00:55:28.630
I guess I'm wondering how bad that is and
am I really the only one that's doing this

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:29.630
'cause it feels like--.

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:30.630
I can't imagine--.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:33.319
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: If anyone denies that they're
doing that, they're lying.

00:55:33.319 --> 00:55:34.319
[laughter]

00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:35.319
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Guess what.

00:55:35.319 --> 00:55:36.319
We both did that, too.

00:55:36.319 --> 00:55:37.319
I mean, you know what?

00:55:37.319 --> 00:55:42.470
There's sometimes you just need the time and
there's nothing like it.

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:47.039
I think you have to think about what they're
watching and when they're watching.

00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:53.370
One thing we did learn is before bedtime is
a really bad thing to do because the images,

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:55.470
the flickering, gets the brain all--.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:59.099
They look calm, but it's getting them all
like, agitated.

00:55:59.099 --> 00:56:04.869
So, one of the things we discovered was doing
it earlier in the day if you need that break

00:56:04.869 --> 00:56:05.869
time.

00:56:05.869 --> 00:56:07.440
This would probably be better.

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.440
And then the what.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.440
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Yeah.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.440
I think you're being thoughtful about what's
age appropriate.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:17.279
It's always so horrifying when we have children
come to school, and especially when you have

00:56:17.279 --> 00:56:22.269
older siblings it's really hard to control,
but one will tell us they'll have seen something

00:56:22.269 --> 00:56:24.220
that you think like, "What could they be thinking?

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:28.519
They let this child--," if you think about
the imagery on some of these things.

00:56:28.519 --> 00:56:33.090
The other thing to add, so I think a half
an hour or a little more, if you have to use

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:36.450
it from time to time, it is sometimes a parent's
life saver.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:40.770
The other thing to be aware of is that, at
times, you putting TV--.

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:42.529
I know I use TV in the background.

00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:45.579
My husband said to me just the other day,
"How can you do three things when the TV's

00:56:45.579 --> 00:56:46.579
on?"

00:56:46.579 --> 00:56:47.579
I said, "'Cause I'm not really watching it.

00:56:47.579 --> 00:56:48.579
It's just like background noise."

00:56:48.579 --> 00:56:52.700
And what happens is, is if you put on the
news or some other thing and you have a child

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.500
in the room, they're not filtering it out.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.089
They're watching it and they're not understanding
it.

00:56:58.089 --> 00:57:00.950
So, if there's like--.

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.089
There's horrible things on the news that you
gonna see.

00:57:03.089 --> 00:57:07.150
There's fires and earthquakes and horrible
things happening in the news.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:11.200
They don't filter that out and they also don't
know it's not happening near them or right

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.510
now or whether they're in danger.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:15.110
And they're very upsetting images.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:20.099
And it's important to think about that aspect
of your own TV.

00:57:20.099 --> 00:57:23.940
And monitoring your own TV watching as a role
model for your children's TV watching, too.

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.510
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Do you have a son?

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:26.510
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I do.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:27.510
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: I hate to be sexist, but--

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:28.510
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Yeah.

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:31.349
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: but my grandson watches
these videos called Mighty Machines and it's

00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:34.540
fabulous because it's about real things.

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:39.289
So, one goes into a salt mine and there's
farm equipment and you follow them.

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.710
And they talk and it's fabulous.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:46.650
So I think there's a learning component in
some way and there's something that's very

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:50.720
satisfying about watching things happening
that are very real.

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.150
Like, there's a logging machine.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:53.730
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: And it's also not happening
fast.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.250
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: No, it's very slow.

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:56.250
You've seen it.

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.250
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: It's not fast-paced.

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:58.880
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: It's very slow-paced, which
is quite nice.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.650
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Thanks.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:01.650
That's helpful.

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:02.650
Thanks.

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:03.779
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: And hopefully you don't
feel really guilty, too.

00:58:03.779 --> 00:58:05.019
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Don't feel guilty.

00:58:05.019 --> 00:58:07.160
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Hi.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:11.490
My son, my first son, is a two-year old and
two weeks.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:14.019
And he's a very good boy.

00:58:14.019 --> 00:58:16.119
He's very independent.

00:58:16.119 --> 00:58:19.619
He's very caring and sensitive.

00:58:19.619 --> 00:58:27.130
And usually, when he accidentally hit us or
hit something, I make the face that I was

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.130
hurt.

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:29.789
Well, not make face when I'm hurt--when I'm
really hurt or something.

00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:34.359
He will just immediately come to hug me, to
make me feel better.

00:58:34.359 --> 00:58:36.210
And he would also hug his animals.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:40.250
But one question that I have right now is
I wonder at what--.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:45.089
But there was one little issues that when
in the morning sometimes, when I need a little

00:58:45.089 --> 00:58:47.090
bit extra sleep, he just wouldn't give me.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:49.720
He really wants me to get up and play with
him.

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.720
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Sure.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.720
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: And yeah.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.269
I know that that's the thing that I should
not really force him to accept that, but a

00:58:55.269 --> 00:58:58.839
couple of months back, he was better when
we told him that Mama needs a little sleep,

00:58:58.839 --> 00:59:00.820
he would just go with Papa.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.710
But now, he's getting more attached to me
maybe.

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:05.510
So he wants me to get up.

00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:06.789
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Well, you're pregnant.

00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:08.960
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Yeah, that's
also why I do need more sleep sometimes.

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.960
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Sure.

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I just wonder
at what point is he gonna be more understanding

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:15.309
about other people's needs.

00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:16.390
He's only two.

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:21.480
I understand he wouldn't be able to understand
it so much right now, but how to tell him

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:26.760
little by little so that he can let me get
more time.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.400
Because we also need to prepare for the next
one.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.401
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: I think the one thing you
should be aware of is that your two-year old

00:59:32.401 --> 00:59:35.260
being that sensitive and empathetic at this
age is unusual.

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:39.950
I mean, you already have a very caring and
empathetic child.

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:44.510
I think he's probably feeling a little more
needy of you because he's aware of something

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.350
else that's happening in his life shortly.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.350
[chuckles]

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:49.869
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: He can't fit into your lap
in the same way.

00:59:49.869 --> 00:59:56.060
Just beginning with then, what Nancy's saying,
is they're incredibly egocentric at that period

00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.380
of their lives.

00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:00.200
They are the center of the universe for them.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:08.380
It takes really, all these years between two
and five and six for them to really understand

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:13.019
and become that empathetic and understanding
kind of person.

01:00:13.019 --> 01:00:14.599
So, you have to be a little patient with him.

01:00:14.599 --> 01:00:17.500
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: And the truth is, after
the baby is born, he's gonna need--.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.000
You're gonna need more sleep and he's gonna
need more of you, too.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.670
So, if you can carve out some special alone
time with him, that's gonna ward off a little

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.670
bit of that, too.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:31.680
But if he has some favorite toys or there's
something that can keep him busy and you can

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:37.470
be sleeping, but have some toys in the bed
with you and doing that, maybe if he can play

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:41.670
a little bit quietly, you might get a little
more time, but probably not too much.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:44.940
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Yeah.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.940
I feel like he wants us to play together with
him.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:46.940
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Yeah.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.330
But I mean, I think you can say, "This is
quiet time and you can play these games near

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.119
us, but we need to do that."

01:00:50.119 --> 01:00:54.529
But it's a little young for them to be understanding
that Mommy needs her sleep.

01:00:54.529 --> 01:00:55.529
Yeah.

01:00:55.529 --> 01:00:56.529
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Yeah.

01:00:56.529 --> 01:01:01.420
I sometimes try to tell him that you see when
you need to sleep or when you are tired, we

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.050
wouldn't force you to do anything.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.580
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Developmentally, he's not
quite there.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.880
With children, until they're at least five,
really don't really put themselves in somebody

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880
else's shoes.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:16.369
Just as a psychological understanding of that,
they're not really able to do that.

01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:17.559
You know, "This is what I need."

01:01:17.559 --> 01:01:22.170
They know what they need, but they're really
not able to make that switch quite yet.

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:24.220
So developmentally, they're not really there
yet.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.820
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Will it still
be useful to find the opportunity to tell

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.820
him?

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:33.329
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: You can tell him and you
can talk to him about it, but he's only going

01:01:33.329 --> 01:01:35.270
to understand it on a very limited basis.

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.720
He's definitely looking for more from you.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.230
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: So, basically
I just have to find a balance.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.230
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Exactly.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:44.950
And that's the secret of any kind of parenting
issues is finding that balance that works

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:47.660
for you, works for him, trying to figure that
out.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.660
That's the hard part.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.269
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I'll just make
myself more time.

01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:51.269
[laughter]

01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:55.059
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: I think that's gonna be
your life for a while, I'm afraid to say.

01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:57.000
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Yeah, just kind of tough
it out.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
[laughter]

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: It does get better eventually.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
&gt;&gt;Female Announcer: So that's all we have
time for.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Thank you so much for coming.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
&gt;&gt;Nancy Schulman: Thank you.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Thank you.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
&gt;&gt;Ellen Birnbaum: Thank you for having us.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Thanks.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.001
[applause]
