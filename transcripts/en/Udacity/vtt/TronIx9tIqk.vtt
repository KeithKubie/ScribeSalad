Okay, guys, we are going to discuss HTML.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Or, HyperText Markup Language.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
HTML documents are the heart of the web.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The web is basically made up of these documents

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that can do a number of things.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So HTML is made up of text content, which is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
what you see, it's made up of markup,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is what that content looks like,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or how it's arranged,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it's made up of references to other documents,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
like images and videos,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you may have something that looks like this,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and you've got some text, and you'll have an image in your page,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or like the page you're looking at now,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which has got a video in the middle of it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You know--the page you're looking at now,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it's made up of HTML, and it's got references

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to a big fat video.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And it can be made up of links to other pages.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I'm sure you're very familiar with what links are,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and how they are used.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let's play around with HTML a little bit.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is a simple HTML editor we have

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so we can play with things and test them out.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You can follow along by either,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I think there should be a link in the course notes,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
or you can also go to www.udacity.com/html_playground

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and that should get you this little page

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where you can kind of experiment a little bit.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is kind of a fake little test browser.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, the first thing I'd like to show you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is that if we have just some blank text,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
if we were to render this as HTML,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
it would look the same.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Plain text is plain text in HTML--for the most part.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But if we want to make the text look different

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
we need to use something called markup,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which is one of the other facets of HTML,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.148
and let's learn a little bit about markup.
