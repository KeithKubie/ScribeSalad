GREG DALESANDRE: Hi.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.030
Welcome to the App Engine
Fireside Chat.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.060
Apparently we have
a big firepit.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.700
So I think what we'll do is--

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.680
the people who we are waving to
are members of the team, so

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.500
if you think we're waving to
you to come up on stage--

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.090
So we'll do a quick round of
introductions so you know who

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.880
all the people are on stage--

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.610
when I say quick,
pretty quick.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.260
And then start to answer
questions from the audience.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.860
Talk about topics that
you're interested

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.830
in us talking about.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.010
Let us know what you think.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.290
Please use the microphones
on the side so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.800
that it can be recorded.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.940
I guess I'll start intros, and
then I'll go to Alfred next.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.140

JUSTIN HA: Justin Ha, serving

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.690
infrastructure, software engineer.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.270
TOM EDWARD HAZEN: Tom

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.200
app engine.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.615
GREG DALESANDRE: All right.

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:23.570
So this is actually a pretty
good portion of the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.330
team you have here.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.960
And so we're happy to talk about
the topics that you're

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.580
interested in us
talking about.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.590
We could talk amongst
ourselves.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.440
That might not be
as interesting.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.900
Does anyone have any questions
or topics they want us to get

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.150
started with?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.770
I heard something about
new pricing.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.060
Yes?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.160
MAX ROSS: Yes, there
is new pricing.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.780
GREG DALESANDRE: So you might
have seen yesterday that we

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.830
announced that we are going to
be leaving Preview later on

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.100
this year, which we're
very excited about.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.080
Leaving Preview also comes
with a new pricing model.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.700
Let's see.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.810
There's a lot of questions on
our external list. I guess I

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.760
could talk about some of
those in person, if

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.710
that would be useful.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.550
Whoever yelled it out.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.565
What sort of thing would
you like to hear about?

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:13.950
AUDIENCE: Differences!

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.930
GREG DALESANDRE: Differences.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.290
I can't see who it
is who's yelling.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.430
There's just a voice
back there.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.100
So the main differences
in the pricing model

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.470
are going to be--

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.340
where before there were free
apps, and then apps where you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.050
could turn billing on, and
then you would pay

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.250
for what you used.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.550
In the new model, there's
going to be

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.410
essentially three types.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.530
There's going to be
free apps, still.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.410
We believe very strongly that
we want to give people free

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.600
apps that they can use forever,
so that they can get

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.570
started, they can try things.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.150
There are then going
to be paid apps.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.290
So instead of apps where you
have billing turned on, paid

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.430
apps are $9 per app, per month,
in addition to the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.610
usage that you use.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.550
But with this $9, you get
an SLA, a 99.95% SLA.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.880
And then there's going to
be premiere accounts.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.880
And premiere accounts
are $500 a month.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.890
You can have as many
apps as you want.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.860
I guess I should have said--

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.220
the paid apps, you can
also start paying

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.745
for additional usage.

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:17.910
So you can start scaling.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.250
With the premier accounts, it's
$500 per month, but you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.790
get operational support,
as well as all of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.260
your apps can scale.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.060
You don't have to pay an
additional fee per app or

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.290
anything like that.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.840
So that's the usage
side of things.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.130
Then one of the big changes is
we're going from CPU hours to

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.510
instance hours for billing.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.050
So CPU hours is broken
into two parts now.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.600
Before what we were doing was
charging everyone just based

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.280
on the CPU that they
were using now.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.720
For your code that's running,
we're going to be charging

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.920
based on the number of instances
that are running,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.780
and how long they're running.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.890
And so essentially, one of the
main reasons we did this-- and

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.760
this is something we talked
about a little in the group--

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.100
is right now, because we just
used CPU, there's no way to

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.850
essentially account for people
who want to use high-memory

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.160
applications or high-latency
applications.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.100
And so what happens is we
just don't scale it.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.510
I don't know if any of you
have run into this.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.920
If your latency is two seconds
in your app, what ends up

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.290
happening is, it just doesn't
scale in App Engine.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.000
Because essentially, we don't
know how to how to treat

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.320
applications like that.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.000
So charging for instances
essentially now opens up this

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.460
possibility for everyone who
wants to write applications

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.480
and essentially doesn't want to
be constrained by, it only

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.850
has to be based on CPU.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.620
They can write high-latency
applications, high

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.350
memory-intensive applications,
and essentially pay for their

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.140
usage of those.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.030
The other thing that CPU
hours were used for is

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.910
for all of the APIs.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.890
We've essentially taken those
APIs and converted what we

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.270
were charging before
into operations.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.720
So before, we would charge you
some amount of CPU hour per

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.210
XMPP stanza, and now we just
call it a stanza and charge

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.270
per stanza.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.480
And again, this was done for
sort of better transparency in

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.180
terms of allowing people to
estimate and figure out what

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.370
it is they're using, and
how much it will

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.620
cost them to use it.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.910
I think I saw a hand go
up at some point.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.570
ALON LEVI: Feel free to
queue up at the mike.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.210
Questions don't have to
be about billing,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.052
but they can be.

00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:35.060
AUDIENCE: I just have two kind
of specific questions.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.490
One, with the XMPP
in the stanza.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.120
What about presence
notifications?

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.770
GREG DALESANDRE: So I think with
presence notifications--

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.007
MAX ROSS: You're asking about
pricing for presence

00:06:46.007 --> 00:06:46.120
notifications?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.280
GREG DALESANDRE: Yeah, yeah for
presence notifications.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.580
AUDIENCE: I mean, I suspect
that I know what a stanza

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.306
constitutes, but I'd just like
to be clear on presence

00:06:54.306 --> 00:06:58.483
notifications that I saw was
relatively recently added.

00:06:58.483 --> 00:07:02.280
If users go on- and offline, et
cetera, it [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.690
the app.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.035
So is that additional
charge, or?

00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:09.340
BRETT SLATKIN: We're still
figuring out little

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.200
details like that.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.710
That's a great example,
because it's a very

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.510
high-frequency event that
costs basically nothing,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.720
because there's very
little information.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.550
So I think that these are the
kind of things we're still

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.270
trying to work out, before--

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.580
GREG DALESANDRE: Our XMPP person
is not here today to

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.760
talk in more detail about it.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.890
But I'm in the middle of putting
an FAQ together to

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.148
sort of post to the list, and
I'll add that into it.

00:07:32.148 --> 00:07:33.980
AUDIENCE: So just one
more small question.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.820
And that is, currently the HR
data store has what is it, a

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.330
3X multiple on API CPU usage.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.080
Is that going to be eliminated
as well so that HR and

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.146
master/slave are just the same,
as far as cost goes in

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:54.080
the operation?

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.590
GREG DALESANDRE: Do you want
to take it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.980
MAX ROSS: Yes.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.450
We want everyone to use high
replication data store.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.380
And we've got other things
planned that will encourage

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.460
you to move in that direction.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:10.750
Yes.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.378
Good things.

00:08:11.378 --> 00:08:13.250
Yes, carrots.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.800
GREG DALESANDRE: Not beatings.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.300
MAX ROSS: Good things.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.550
Carrots, not sticks.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.260
AUDIENCE: So the growth of
the platform is kind of

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.932
phenomenal.

00:08:21.932 --> 00:08:25.992
So maybe you could talk about
how you're dealing with the

00:08:25.992 --> 00:08:29.125
technical complexities, as well
as the growth in your

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:34.140
team, and how to manage that
sort of complexity?

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.299
GREG DALESANDRE: Someone from
SRE maybe want to talk about

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.950
some of the growth and
technical complexity?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.450
MATT WILDER: Well, probably the
biggest example of this is

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.260
building the high-replication
data store, right?

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.620
Something that brings more
liability and more

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.240
scalability.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.120
And one of the things that we
learned is, when you have a

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.980
service that's really big, a
very small percent of errors

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.150
are really painful
so our users.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.020
So this is kind of one of the
first things that I think that

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.390
we did to really address the
scalability of the product.

00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:08.080
MAX ROSS: Just in terms of
growing the team, one other

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.491
thing I would say is, you know,
last year we did one of

00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:11.660
these fireside chats.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.370
I don't think any
of our SREs--

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.120
you guys weren't up
here with us.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.720
We didn't make a big
announcement that hey, the App

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.070
Engine team now has SREs.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.620
But in the lifecycle of a
product within Google, that's

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.520
actually a pretty big milestone,
because SREs are in

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.260
very short supply.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.600
And so you have to be important
to have these

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.270
skilled people helping
support your service.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.720
And that was relatively
new for us around

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.350
this time this year.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.547
It's probably been, I don't
know, closer to fifteen or

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.545
sixteen months.

00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:43.850
AUDIENCE: SRE means what?

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.260
MAX ROSS: Site reliability
engineers.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.270
So yeah, thank you.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.520
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.530
MICHAEL HANDLER: Yeah.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.060
So there's been SRE engagement
with App Engine

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.310
since January of 2010.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.110
And I'm giving a talk on it at
3 o'clock over in the other

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.700
hallway, Life in Production.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.750
And you know, I'm not going
to just reveal everything.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.355
I'll just take over the
rest of this and give

00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:07.940
the talk right now.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.730
Just get it done.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.340
Dry run.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.600
But It's fantastic.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.140
Google is a moving environment
in same way that app engine

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.470
scaling is a moving
environment.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.820
So we're getting tremendous
growth.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.950
People are using the platform
in ways that we never

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.670
anticipated.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.050
And we're thrilled about that,
but at the same time, Google's

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.950
not standing still saying, well,
this is what we offer.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.180
Google is growing.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.890
We've got other products
coming online.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.910
Infrastructure changes,
disruptions that are caused by

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.550
changes in the infrastructure,
surprises that come to us.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.030
And this is all what I end up
talking about, and the high

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.250
replication data store is based
very explicitly on what

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.910
we learned, and I talk very
explicitly about some of the

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.930
things that happened to us,
some of the things that we

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.430
know could happen to us, some
of the things that we're

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.230
afraid could happen to us, and
that HR data store handles way

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.640
better than the master/slave
data store ever could.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.530
So come see my talk.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.060
GREG DALESANDRE: The other thing
I just wanted to add is,

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.300
we're also seeing a wider
variety of customer types.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.800
Right?

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.270
You know, it's kind of like
when you're just getting

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.490
started and people are just sort
of trying something out

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.665
that's new, there's a certain
sort of type of developer who

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:20.600
will kind of give it a shot.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.730
Now we're seeing a very wide
range of people to--

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.160
enterprises you wouldn't expect
who are looking into

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.740
using it, as well as one person
startups who are our

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.940
doing it on the weekend.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.170
And so I think it's been
interesting trying to support

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.895
and handle such a wide
variety of customers.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.354
AUDIENCE: I had a more technical
question, and that

00:11:47.354 --> 00:11:50.730
was, is there is a good way to
sink the memcache across

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.980
different instances?

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.860
BRETT SLATKIN: I mean, every
instance should have the same

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.190
view of memcache?

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.190
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.770
BRETT SLATKIN: So could
you clarify?

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.890
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.730
One application that I've
got is collaborative

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:13.780
story-writing, and we'll have
50 or 100 people come in and

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.790
they're all exchanging messages,
and stuff like that.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.990
But I've got a thing that's
checking to see if their

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.867
browser needs to refresh
based on what it's

00:12:24.867 --> 00:12:25.870
giving for the memcache.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.905
And I found the when it was 20
new instances, it didn't have

00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:31.165
that same information.

00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:32.830
They had to--

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.770
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah, I mean,
memcache is supposed to be a

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.830
consistent view shared
by all instances.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.430
Sometimes you get evicted, and
then you lose the information

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.330
so it can go away.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.090
But I think that you should
definitely check out the new

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.980
backend feature that they
launched yesterday, which kind

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.800
of lets you write your own
stateful memory resident

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.500
backend that has a
consistent view.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.310
And maybe that'd be a
better fit for what

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.850
you're trying to do.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.620
But if you could stop by our
office hours and kind of give

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.990
us some more detail, I think
that would be really helpful.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.330
Because that's not how
it should work.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.360
It should be there.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.570
That's the point.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.820
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.640
AUDIENCE: I was curious about
the integration between Google

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.590
Apps and Google App Engine, and
what's there now and what

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:23.970
do you see as far as being able
to access corporate data

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.980
stored in docs that's related
to Google Apps?

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.270
PETER MAGNUSSON: We plan
to improve that.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.550
Great question.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.270
ERIC MORRIS: Echo the great
question from the sales side

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.478
of the house, as well.

00:13:45.478 --> 00:13:47.960
We need a better answer.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.430
We're actively working to
make better and tighter

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.430
integrations between those,
because it's something that

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.680
people ask us about
all the time.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.640
AUDIENCE: We use your
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.070
to interact with other services

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.320
outside of app engine.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.246
Unfortunately, we work with
Apple for its notifications,

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:10.800
and that has to connect on
a non-HTTP protocol.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.760
Is there any plan to make
something which is

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.750
non-HTTP-based, URL patch or is
this something that doesn't

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.350
work with Google infrastructure,
or

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.590
something like that?

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.250
SEAN LYNCH: One of the things
that we're currently working

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.510
on is adding support
for sockets.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.832
So you will be able to reach out
on non-HTTP connections.

00:14:27.832 --> 00:14:28.294
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:14:28.294 --> 00:14:29.540
Any timeline on that?

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.140
Because we're actually
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.870
notification.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.260
SEAN LYNCH: No timeline
at the moment.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:34.738
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:34.738 --> 00:14:35.216
Cool.

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:38.130
Thank you.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.302
AUDIENCE: There is a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:42.980
initiative back in India, which
is probably the world's

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.830
largest private cloud
that we're building.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:50.240
And currently, they are
planning to use a

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.770
[? nautical ?]

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.763
database, which is based on
the Bigtable whitepaper

00:14:54.763 --> 00:15:00.070
because App Engine is not open
source, and you don't have

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.554
support for private clouds.

00:15:02.554 --> 00:15:05.690
Is there any initiative from
that [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.652
other option for such kind
of large private cloud

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:10.902
initiative?

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.160
SEAN LYNCH: So the whole
discussion of private cloud

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.200
and things like that--

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.660
first options, there are
actually two separate open

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.440
source implementations of the
App Engine API, a Tycoon AE

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.530
and AppScale.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.600
And they're using projects like
Cassandra to sort of back

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.480
the API equivalent of a
data store in terms of

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.770
functionality.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.560
From our perspective, when we're
talking about things

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.330
like HRD, there's just
not a way that we

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.300
can bottle that up.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.755
The fact that we have Mike and
Matt working behind the scenes

00:15:50.755 --> 00:15:53.190
to do sort of failovers between
multiple data centers

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.250
at once isn't sort of something
that we can put in a

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.010
box and let you throw
on a rack.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.390
And that's sort of the
fundamental difference when

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.030
people talk about private clouds
as sort of an option.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.310
You don't have these guys, you
don't have this team actually

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.010
maintaining the data store
or the database, whatever

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.080
technology you choose.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.350
So for private clouds, there
are a lot of really

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.140
interesting open source projects
in the no-sequel

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.490
space that provide similar or
complimentary functionality,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.660
but you can't get a lot of the
things that the public cloud

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.780
gives you, especially when you
look at examples like HRD,

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.490
behind your firewall.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.870
Unless you hire these
guys and--

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.090
GREG DALESANDRE: Don't
hire these guys.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.360
That's not an option.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.140
AUDIENCE: Google as a company
doesn't have any plans to do

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.690
open source or create
services?

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.829
Are other companies creating
service of

00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:50.470
their own at open source?

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.520
GREG DALESANDRE: Well, as Sean
mentioned, our APIs are open

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.910
sourced, and there are two
external, third party

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:04.829
companies that are building App
Engine compatible servers.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:05.089
SEAN LYNCH: Yeah.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.460
I mean, at Google, our
proficiency is the cloud.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.799
That's what we know.

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:12.280
And we do very, very
well at that.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.450
And so that's where we
will continue to

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.950
do very, very well.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.843
AUDIENCE: So one of the great
things about App Engine is,

00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:22.795
there's no [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:22.795 --> 00:17:23.210
it.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.510
You don't have to pay.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.900
Will the change to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.450
the billing, change that?

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.650
If I have more instances, am
I been billed for that?

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.980
GREG DALESANDRE: So one of
the things, again, on the

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.130
[UNINTELLIGIBLE],

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.120
we talked about a lot--

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.980
it's still designed to be pay
as you go, in terms of, if

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.540
there are instances serving
traffic, you're paying for

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.160
those instances that are
serving traffic.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.410
One of the things that we have--
and there was a talk

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.390
about this yesterday--

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.770
we have a scheduler which
essentially decides how many

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.520
instances should be running
based on the amount of traffic

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.630
that you have coming in.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.130
And that's what essentially
spins up new instances when

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.530
the traffic demands it, and
takes down instances when

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.870
traffic is no longer needed.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.470
We're in the process of
essentially improving that

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.740
scheduler or, to be more
precise, making that scheduler

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.130
fit with the instance model.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.560
And so that essentially is
going to choose how many

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.370
instances you have running.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.320
But the point is, for instance,
if you have no

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.780
traffic at all, you shouldn't be
paying for instances unless

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.610
you've made a decision that
you want to have instances

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.960
running just in case new
traffic comes along.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.730
But again, that would be sort of
a decision you'd make of, I

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.340
want to leave instances
up, just in case new

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.300
traffic comes up.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.354
Does that answer the question?

00:18:45.354 --> 00:18:48.160
OK.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.220
AUDIENCE: Should we expect
to see tighter BigQuery

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.470
integration?

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.760
GREG DALESANDRE: Oh, BigQuery.

00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:04.280
Anyone on stage who
can talk to this?

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.040
So I think the short answer is,
it's definitely an area

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.940
where we're looking at.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.720
You probably saw the Google
Storage announcement

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.300
yesterday, as well.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.730
And all of these parts, we
definitely want to and are

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.870
working on playing more
closely with.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.626
As I'm sure you're used to
hearing this answer, we can't

00:19:24.626 --> 00:19:28.150
give timelines as to when
they're going to be done.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.730
But it's certainly absolutely on
our roadmap of things that

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.790
we're looking at doing, is
integrating with some of the

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.090
other sort of cloud services
from Google.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:36.400
ALON LEVI: Yeah.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.920
Another way to answer that
is that we want all the

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.590
integrations.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.040
Right?

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.560
We think all this stuff
is really cool.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.780
We'd like to have it
all integrated.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.810
It's just a matter of

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.420
prioritizing everything, again.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.690
Stability improvement and
other things like that.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.420
So yeah, we definitely
want it to happen.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:49.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.480
And that's really the gist
of the question.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.780
It's priority for me, but--

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.780
GREG DALESANDRE: SSL is
a higher priority on

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.030
our list right now.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.650
WESLEY CHUN: The ability to have
an App Engine application

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.310
as an input source to analysis
is certainly something that

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.800
we're looking at as a use
case for the platform.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.260
BRETT SLATKIN: I was just going
to add that I think also

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.980
a lot of this fall under the
OAuth2 kind of heading.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.130
So we're starting to deploy
OAuth2 for services, which

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.050
makes these integrations
a lot easier.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.880
The docs integrations that
someone else asked about

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.780
earlier using the Google Apps
or Google Docs APIs, is hard

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.140
now for a variety of reasons.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.860
One of them is Auth.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.500
So authorization authentication
is hard, and

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.530
OAuth 2 simplifies that a lot.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:46.225
So as we move more and more of
our services to use OAuth2,

00:20:46.225 --> 00:20:49.395
then stuff like integrating App
Engine with BigQuery or

00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:51.880
App Engine with Google
Apps will get easier.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.050
So the other Auth teams at
Google have been laying the

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.680
foundation to let us simplify
the problem.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.220
So I think that's kind of a
bigger picture answer, too.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:01.490
GREG DALESANDRE: Right.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.450
And I think that'll help.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.570
But that being said, we also
want to make sure that it's

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.600
easy to run App Engine
with non-Google--

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.660
you know, I think we try in
general not to do anything too

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.730
crazy custom just to have a
single point of integration.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.760
I think we do, in general, as
much as possible, try to make

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.240
the integrations sort
of generalized.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.470
And so for instance OAuth 2
is great example of that.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.640
OAuth 2 is something that parts
of Google are moving to,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.870
and so it'll work well together,
but it's also

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:39.290
something that third parties
outside of Google can use

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.860
OAuth2 and then we'll work
well with them, too.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.760
AUDIENCE: Thanks, gentlemen.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.752
GREG DALESANDRE: Sure.

00:21:44.752 --> 00:21:45.557
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:21:45.557 --> 00:21:47.007
Thank you very much
for App Engine.

00:21:47.007 --> 00:21:50.290
It's a really fun product
form to develop with.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.200
My question is, in the last two
days, we've seen a little

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.010
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.260
that it's going to make the
product form way bigger and

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.770
maybe less simple.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.930
And one thing that I've noticed
with App Engine is,

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.820
there's like a very good
best practice.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.330
But if you don't follow it
because you don't know it or

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.300
whatever, and then you push the
production, migrating data

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.220
or anything kind
of complicated.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.620
So my question is, what
resources or guidelines or

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.156
ideas can you give us so we can
keep up to date with the

00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:17.820
best practice as a whole
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:24.450
Just the mailing list?

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.240
GREG DALESANDRE: I can answer,
unless somebody else wants to.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.540
WESLEY CHUN: The mailing
list is good.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.680
Our blog is good.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.430
A number of our Dev Advocates
and DevRel people

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.650
also blog, as well.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.500
I think our documentation
is excellent.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.860
So the documentation is fairly
sparse, but it's enough

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.890
information to get
you started.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.296
So part of the members of the
developer relations team, our

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:54.420
job is to take the stuff and
build more realistic examples

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.540
that you would use.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.420
So keep an eye out for a blog
post, as well as articles

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.560
under the documentation that
give you more of that.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.050
And we're also working
on a best

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.480
practices article, as well.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.320
MIKE AIZATSKY: We also have been
talking for years about

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.380
having some kind of
community-driven documentation

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.210
project like wiki.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:16.730
Unfortunately, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.940
is like SSL stuff and
other things.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.400
So if you guys write App Engine
app which is a wiki,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.900
we'll be happy to contribute,
certainly.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.870
If someone tells me, hey, we
need two lines about best

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.760
practices to use memcashe,
I would just

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.064
go and write something.

00:23:34.064 --> 00:23:36.520
So just collaborate
together guys.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.770
Give us a place to contribute
that kind of best practices.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.420
TOM EDWARD HAZEN:
And two things.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.610
First is that we're planning
some specific best practices

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.700
documents, one related
to security.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.550
I'd like to take some of the
stuff that Guido and Justin

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.850
talked about in their scaling
talk yesterday and create a

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.160
document about best practices
in regard to scaling.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.060
Second is that if anybody wants
to actively contribute

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.550
to App Engine documentation,
we're

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.970
looking for another writer.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.820
So if you'd like to write some
best practices documentation,

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.080
please see me after the talk.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.706
ALON LEVI: I should also add
that as you see places where

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:19.280
it's a little murkier, it's
not clear what the best

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.070
practice is, please come on the
forums and ask questions

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.170
for clarification and things
like that, you know?

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.280
There's a lot more of you than
there are of us, and so when

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.500
you point out something that
we can take a look at and

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.580
provide an answer to,
it's pretty helpful.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.290
GREG DALESANDRE: And we do
monitor the forums, and

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.250
respond when other people aren't
responding or when it's

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.740
important for Google
to respond.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.150
But yeah, I would say the two
main places to look are our

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.368
blog, which is quite active,
as well as the forms.

00:24:45.368 --> 00:24:45.816
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:45.816 --> 00:24:48.510
Thank you very much.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.707
AUDIENCE: What sorts of services
are you looking to

00:24:50.707 --> 00:24:54.710
provide in the $500 a month
kind of enterprise tier?

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.460
And as an agency, we're kind
of continually running up

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.300
against the like ten apps
per user count.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.472
Is that the sort of thing that
would go away once the

00:25:02.472 --> 00:25:03.550
pricing's in place?

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:03.810
GREG DALESANDRE: Yeah.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:08.200
So for the premier accounts that
are $500 per month, one

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.850
of the main things that you'll
get is operational support,

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.980
which a lot of our customers
have been asking us for, so

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.050
that they know that they
can contact somebody.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.730
So asking a question on the list
will almost always get

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.690
you a response, but a lot of
times you want essentially a

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.140
guaranteed response on it, not
sort of waiting when somebody

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.510
gets to it, essentially.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:32.870
But the other thing it does give
you is as many apps as

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.590
you want, all of which
can scale.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.010
So if you're trying to run
hundreds of apps, it's

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.030
probably a good way
for you to go.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:48.190
Those are the two sort of main
aspects that you get with it.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.100
There are things that, over
time, we might start adding

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.520
in, that are kind of much
more of the sort of like

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.040
enterprise-y type features.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.210
But for the most part, that's
what it is right now.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.181
Does that make sense?

00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:01.490
Great.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.590
No more questions?

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.085
Come on.

00:26:03.085 --> 00:26:03.580
There's got to be
more questions.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.070
ALON LEVI: Come on, guys.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.840
We're not even halfway done.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.070
AUDIENCE: SSL?

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.380
GREG DALESANDRE: SSL?

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.440
So what do you mean by--

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.690
I'm just kidding.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:19.430
SSL is a very high
priority for us.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.140
We don't have a date that
we can announce it--

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.195
PETER MCKENZIE: I can
say something.

00:26:30.195 --> 00:26:32.310
So I'm responsible for SSL.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.790
GREG DALESANDRE: I was just
trying to protect him!

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.990
That's all.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.640
PETER MCKENZIE: We are actively
working on it and

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.230
making good progress.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.200
We can't give a date, but it's
certainly high priority.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.990
To be honest, we would have
liked to have launched it by

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.070
now, but it's certainly foremost
in my thoughts, and

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.190
in the thoughts of several
others of my team.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.060
BRETT SLATKIN: Two things
that would speed it up.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.570
Get everyone to install
an S&amp;I browser.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.730
So upgrade everyone to IE9
or Chrome or whatever.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.320
If you do that, that'd
be cool.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.130
Other thing is, everyone
move to IPV6.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.730
That would also help us
get the shift sooner.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.220
So if you could help us out
there, that'd be great.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.526
We're working on our side.

00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:17.290
AUDIENCE: Is there a way to do
the first with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:17.580
BRETT SLATKIN: No.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.780
You get this warning prompt that
says you're going to die.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.876
I mean, it doesn't work, yeah.

00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:23.670
So that's a problem.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.290
If you don't have a browser
that's compatible to SNI, then

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.090
you can't use it.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.710
It looks like you're
being phished or

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.975
hacked or stolen from.

00:27:31.975 --> 00:27:35.889
AUDIENCE: Triple w dot domain,
and then do a little browser

00:27:35.889 --> 00:27:37.610
test, and direct
to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.900
BRETT SLATKIN: You can't even
test. It just freaks out.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.090
When you try to get somebody
to go to a site, it just

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.830
rejects it outright.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.620
So that's the issue.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.796
You can't even test for it.

00:27:47.796 --> 00:27:51.140
MICHAEL HANDLER: I'd just like
to say operationally that I'm

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.320
thrilled that all the mistakes
we made with HTTP, we managed

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.500
to make again with HTTPS as a
community, that it's great,

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.190
because it means full
employment for me.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:03.540
So when we're designing
protocols, let's keep it up,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.000
make the same mistakes over and
over again, and I can't

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.570
wait to have a funeral for all
of the hacks that we need

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:11.930
system Y to deal with this.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.180
GREG DALESANDRE: There are
a lot more questions now!

00:28:20.695 --> 00:28:23.050
AUDIENCE: So you guys just
announced support for Go.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:27.320
What other languages would you
like to see App Engine run on?

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.180
GREG DALESANDRE: What would
we like to see, or--

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.820
MAX ROSS: What would
you like to see?

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.370
GREG DALESANDRE:
We don't really

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.200
matter in this equation.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.550
So, well, you got
what you wanted.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.795
No.

00:28:41.795 --> 00:28:42.910
AUDIENCE: I want Python 3!

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.370
GREG DALESANDRE: Right, OK.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.800
So definitely Python 3.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.360
One or two people might
have asked for PHP.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.770
I don't know if we've,
have we heard?

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:52.710
Just kidding.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.770
Lots of people ask for
PHP all the time.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.320
And that's certainly another
language we know people are

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.980
asking for.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.920
I think people have talked
about like Node.js,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.230
that sort of thing.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.300
You know, we announced the
experimental Go run time,

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.930
which we have Andrew here from
the Go team who's going to

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.090
answer questions about that,
if people are interested in

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.290
asking about that.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.240
We don't have any other
run times we can

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.980
announce at this point.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.980
AUDIENCE: Would you support
languages that weren't

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.910
internally used at Google?

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.520
GREG DALESANDRE: Would we?

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.830
Sure.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:29.470
I mean, there's nothing to
stop us from doing that.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:33.250
Again, it's a matter of
prioritization, integrations,

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.210
and all these other things.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.480
MICKEY KATARIA: And just
a quick comment.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.900
For those of you who have been
paying attention to our public

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.950
roadmap, Python 2.7's
on there.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:44.660
We are working on
support for 2.7.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:44.840
PETER MAGNUSSON: Yeah.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.620
So I wanted to go to respond to
the notion of if it's got

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.060
to do with internal languages.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.840
It's not that there's a policy
that no, we're not going to

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.380
support other languages.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.620
It's that we have a Go team
internally, and we do Go work

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.250
internally.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.120
I'm hoping that we'll be able
to figure out ways to allow

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.672
external communities to
participate in adding more

00:30:04.672 --> 00:30:05.476
languages and so forth.

00:30:05.476 --> 00:30:07.560
We'll see what happens
down the road.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.720
I do want to emphasize, though,
that with Go, we're

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.790
adding something that's
fundamentally different than

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.560
we would have with the other
language options, which is

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.140
that that's a generally
compiled, low-level language

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.050
that we'll be able to
run in App Engine.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.520
So that will be very useful
for services and so forth.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.620
ANDREW DURAND: I was just
going to say that it was

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.680
actually at the Go team's kind
of impetus that we started

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.650
this project.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.470
And we didn't kind of detract
resources from the App Engine

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.780
team proper and pull their
engineers onto it.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.220
It was actually, we got more
people on the Go team, and

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.166
expanded our efforts to make
this happen with the help of

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:46.290
the App Engine team.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.440
So none of the bugs on the
issue tracker that you're

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.590
feverishly waiting to
be fixed didn't get

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.470
fixed because of Go.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:54.720
So don't hold that against us.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.810
BRETT SLATKIN: And to add to
that, Go as a language has an

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.220
unsafe package.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.740
PHP does not have an
unsafe package.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.770
I think that's just dot
PHP is the unsafe

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.390
package for PHP, right?

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:10.860
So I think part of this is about
isolation, security.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.770
When people say PHP, they
don't mean the language.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.180
They mean the environment.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.300
They mean it running
in Apache.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.840
They mean a very specific set
of C extensions that are

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.970
community-driven.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:24.510
So I think that if you try to
understand how easy is it for

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.450
a language to be brought into
App Engine, you need to think

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.220
about the full picture of
what it means, right?

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.450
A language is not
just a language.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.155
You've been able to run PHP as
just a pure language on App

00:31:33.155 --> 00:31:34.570
Engine through [? Quirkus ?],

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.650
through the Java run time,
for a very long time.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.180
But that's not what people want,
and that's not what they

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.540
consider PHP.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:46.870
So that's another thing to
remember, is that when people

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.290
ask for language, they're
asking for how

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:50.890
they program now.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.150
MIKE AIZATSKY: And the other
thing to keep in mind is that

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.740
we'd like to have all languages,
but I'm part of run

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.670
times and API teams, as we call
it, but the whole process

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:00.736
does not care.

00:32:00.736 --> 00:32:02.760
So just let me give
you a picture now.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.580
When you want to implement an
API, you have to implement

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.070
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.610
You have to implement
API in type.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.375
You have to implement
API in Java.

00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:12.455
You have to implement API in
Python developer server, and

00:32:12.455 --> 00:32:15.160
you have to implement API in
Java developer server.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.660
Now the Go comes in.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.170
So you now have to implement
it Go API.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.340
Fortunately they use Python
developer server.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:25.550
But every extra language adds
a tremendous maintenance

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.260
complexity for us.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.980
And the whole process
does not scale.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.600
If you threw in five languages
more, we would be like 100% of

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.160
the time just catching up the
languages with each other.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.840
So we'll have to start
somewhere.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:46.000
But we would definitely like
to see more languages.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.410
ANDREW DURAND: And
just one to add.

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:52.570
Late last year, we added a page
to the Go website which

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.170
allows you to run
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.020
Go code in a sandbox environment
on Google servers.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:01.450
And so we have the Go expertise
on the Go team to

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.320
make that happen, and we already
demonstrated that we

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.310
could do that.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.550
And so taking that sandbox and
showing that to the App Engine

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.640
team, saying, hey, we've already
done this, it was much

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.440
easier for them to take us on
board than to look at a

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.830
totally unfamiliar language,
which we don't have domain

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.330
expertise in and try
and approach

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:19.580
that colossal problem.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.240
AUDIENCE: Are there any plans
to support sharing a data

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.842
store between apps?

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.990
MAX ROSS: Yes.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.010
We talk about that
all the time.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.750
I think I've probably even
answered that same question up

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.570
here in years past. But it's
actually getting closer to

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.660
becoming a reality.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.420
There's some infrastructure
improvements that are going to

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.350
make that a lot easier for us.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.000
It's somewhat similar to what
Brett was talking about with

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.360
OAuth, although the details
are different.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.970
But there are pieces that make
it hard today that are going

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.930
to become easier very soon.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.150
You may have seen--

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.400
well, actually, I don't want
to get too much into the

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:05.950
details of it.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:09.080
But the types of things that
we have in mind are the

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.610
ability to use the same data
store service API that you're

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.110
used to in whatever language
that you program against. But

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.375
have some way to have those
calls just transparently

00:34:18.375 --> 00:34:20.090
redirected someplace else.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.065
And we've got to get the
plumbing right, and we've got

00:34:22.065 --> 00:34:24.590
to make sure that we are
connecting things in a safe

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.969
way, we've got to get
the apples right.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:29.800
I think we understand it pretty
well, but we need a

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.639
couple of infrastructure pieces
in place, and then we

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.630
need to prioritize
it appropriately.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:39.610
But it's closer this year
than it was last year.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.670
And we do have some very
concrete ideas about how this

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.792
might work.

00:34:42.792 --> 00:34:44.042
That's the best I
can tell you.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:48.885
AUDIENCE: Just a quick
question about

00:34:48.885 --> 00:34:50.730
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.549
How will the certificate
management work?

00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:56.358
Will it be bring your own
certificate, or does Google

00:34:56.358 --> 00:34:58.590
have a CA that will issue--

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.354
PETER MCKENZIE: It will be bring
your own certificate.

00:35:01.354 --> 00:35:03.798
You'll be able to upload your
certificate, and we'll serve

00:35:03.798 --> 00:35:05.048
that for you.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.090
GREG DALESANDRE: That's
what I like to see.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.340
More questions.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.780
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.270
What are you doing with regard
to roles for administration?

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:26.330
I noticed recently there were
little enhancements there.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.640
Can you talk about what you
might be doing going forward,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.600
and then also, just any
discussion you can give us

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.040
around some of the experimental
sequel server

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.530
stuff that's out there?

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.720
GREG DALESANDRE: So for role--

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.430
Guido, you want to
talk to it, or?

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.600
GUIDO VON ROSSUM: We don't have
any specific plans to

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.950
sort of add more roles
or more probations.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.180
But the sort of infrastructure
we have for roles certainly

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.070
would support more roles.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.160
So if we get sufficient feedback
saying, well, there's

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.000
a particular category of
administrator in our system

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.460
for which we would like to have
a role that can do this

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.040
but not that, and
yet sort of--

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.996
then we can certainly relatively
easily add that to

00:36:11.996 --> 00:36:13.350
the system.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.760
So write up exactly what kind of
role you would like to have

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.540
added, and we'll look at it.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:20.938
GREG DALESANDRE:
And in response

00:36:20.938 --> 00:36:22.970
to the sequel question--

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:29.160
so sequel is actually currently
in trusted tester.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.790
It has been for a
little while.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.810
This answer is going to
sound similar to SSL.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:37.030
We're working hard on it.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.520
We know it's really important.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.380
Although sequel actually
is in trusted tester.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.150
So if you're interested in
trying it out and seeing what

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:45.820
it's like, you can certainly
join our

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.850
trusted tester program.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:50.730
We know how critical it is, and
it's a high priority to

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:55.645
get it out there, but
things take time.

00:36:55.645 --> 00:36:57.680
AUDIENCE: This is probably
more of an office hours

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.026
question, but since you're
running out of questions.

00:37:00.026 --> 00:37:01.466
It's a dumb debugging
question.

00:37:01.466 --> 00:37:04.230
I've got a Python App Engine app
that's been running fine.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.470
It's not production yet, so I'm
not worried about the bug.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.820
But what's happening is I'm
getting very intermittent--

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.500
it uses OpenID OpenAuth to
connect up to fusion tables.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.640
And very intermittently, I'm
getting 403 Forbidden errors

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.990
when I try to connect
to the app.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.990
It runs fine for days, and
then all of a sudden, I'm

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.560
getting 403 Forbiddens
for a while.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.970
And it'll be on one browser
but not another browser.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:26.810
It's not cookies.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.562
You don't have to look
at all that stuff.

00:37:28.562 --> 00:37:31.093
Take a brand new browser, and
if VM has never seen the app

00:37:31.093 --> 00:37:32.580
before, it'll get it, or not.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.900
It's just pretty intermittent.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.513
Anything jump out at anybody,
or I'll do some more

00:37:36.513 --> 00:37:37.910
troubleshooting on my own.

00:37:40.862 --> 00:37:41.354
No?

00:37:41.354 --> 00:37:41.846
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:41.846 --> 00:37:43.820
the team!

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.065
AUDIENCE: It's hard to
debug when you don't

00:37:45.065 --> 00:37:46.750
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.220
GREG DALESANDRE: Debugging
on stage, huh?

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.200
MICKEY KATARIA: One possibility,
and I don't know

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.080
off the top of my head for
fusion tables, is that a lot

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.680
of the APIs do sort of IP-based
limiting or some kind

00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.560
of limiting which
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.740
maybe occasionally you're
running into some of these.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.720
So that's one area to look at.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.025
AUDIENCE: Possibly.

00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:06.340
Yeah, I can't even connect to
my app, is what's happening.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.420
But I'll do some more
troubleshooting.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.998
GREG DALESANDRE: Or you can
come by office hours.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.890
AUDIENCE: Again, this question
is about the asynchronous API

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.740
that recently came up for
Data Store that's

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.644
currently in Java.

00:38:23.644 --> 00:38:27.190
I want to understand whether
it's there on Python already.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.765
And a follow-up question
to whether there is any

00:38:30.765 --> 00:38:31.020
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.950
in using async API.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.200
Is it ready to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.830
where sync merely a waiting
call, or is satellite

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:40.420
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.020
you create keys with
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.050
new, fresh entities?

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.740
Two different [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:53.560
ALFRED FULLER: So the async
API for Python is out.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.660
Was that 150?

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.550
GREG DALESANDRE: 150, yeah.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.810
ALFRED FULLER: Yeah.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.180
It was out in 150.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.420
It's in every level.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:03.180
So it's in ext.db, and
datastore.py, and even lower.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.580
So I recommend you
check it out.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.990
And synchronous calls
call the async calls

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:08.186
and then call block.

00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:08.592
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:08.592 --> 00:39:09.810
So no worry.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:10.125
ALFRED FULLER: Yeah.

00:39:10.125 --> 00:39:11.500
You should totally use it.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.280
It's awesome.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.510
AUDIENCE: Any word on expanding
the one megabyte

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:18.760
limit for entities?

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.187
MAX ROSS: You know, we've got
some ideas about how maybe we

00:39:26.187 --> 00:39:26.890
could split it up.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:31.960
But we have some internal limits
on transaction ties

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.370
that we would need to clear
out first. And those are

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:39.480
limits that are not just in our
layer, but in layers that

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.560
go further down the stack.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:46.880
So we would love to get rid of
that one, but we've got our

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.370
work cut out for us to do it.

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:53.460
BRETT SLATKIN: I'd just add
that Mike has deployed the

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.120
file API that just came out.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.340
It's a little experimental,
but it's deployed in the

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.000
Mapper framework,
[? mapperdev.appspot.com. ?]

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.170
And it solved this
problem for me.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.050
I've been doing a bunch of
things with it where I have to

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.940
write, you know, 100 megs of
random data, and then index it

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.006
based on other properties.

00:40:10.006 --> 00:40:11.830
So that's what I've
been doing.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.970
So the size of my entity only
really needs the blob key,

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.300
blob reference property, and
then a bunch of other stuff.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.100
And that scales out
as big as I want.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.190
Because of relation indexes, I
can go as large as I possibly

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.810
could imagine.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:27.600
So I think that it requires
you to kind of move things

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.440
around a little bit, but I
don't find this to be a

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.790
problem anymore because
of the file API.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.360
So that's still experimental,
but I encourage you to try

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.230
that and to use that instead.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.340
If you need your indexes to be
larger than 1 meg, you can add

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.400
multiple trial entities
to do those queries.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.420
That works really well.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.145
If you need even more data to
be indexed, maybe the full

00:40:53.145 --> 00:40:54.690
text search thing that they
were talking about earlier

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.540
today is a better fit.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.680
I don't know beyond that.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.895
But that's how I've been working
around this, and I've

00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:02.145
had success with it.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.854
AUDIENCE: Are there any plans
to allow copying an app in

00:41:10.854 --> 00:41:13.125
production, including production
data, for like

00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:14.375
testing purposes?

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.110
MIKE AIZATSKY: If you deploy
at least one Python

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.660
[UNINTELLIGIBLE],

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.780
which might be absolutely empty,
then you're going to

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.410
have the data store
admin pages.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.185
And there is two functions
and they're just

00:41:33.185 --> 00:41:33.990
through admin right now.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.820
The first one is to delete
data and the other

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.490
one is to copy data.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.560
So you could set up another
app, open remote API.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.530
There are like some instructions
how to do that.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.635
But you can actually
pick these entities

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.470
and copy them over.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:51.270
And it will start the Mapper
job, and it will copy the data

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.090
to the other app.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:58.560
And it can override data, so you
can actually catch up on

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.810
changes, whatever.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:04.560
GREG DALESANDRE: Just as
a side note on that.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.770
We often get questions about
sort of what's kind of the

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.660
intended deployment process
for App Engine, right?

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.990
If you want to have like a dev
app, a test app, and a

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.220
production app, something
like that.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.490
And this is something that we've
been talking about sort

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:26.980
of putting more effort into
around trying to, again,

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.510
prioritize against all
the other stuff, too.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.670
But just because, I think this
question comes up a lot,

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.280
because I imagine that's
what you were

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.640
trying to get at, right?

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.920
You want to sort of have a clone
of these things, and if

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.980
you use live versions, then
it's all in the same data

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.720
store, and so you want
multiple apps.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.110
And so we'll look into sort of
figuring out what the right

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:50.980
way to do that is, and then sort
of making that easier and

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.310
making kind of the tools.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.595
We might try to do a best
practices before that, just so

00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:58.030
that people are sort
of heading on

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:00.030
down the right path.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.580
MATT WILDER: So in terms of
copying data from one

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.410
application to another, this
is the primary way we're

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.910
working on having applications
migrate to high replication.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.120
Because we have to copy your
data from the master/slave

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.850
data store to the high
replication data store.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.070
And so we're hard at
work building out

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:16.720
the tools to do that.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.060
It's very likely that those new
tools, will be able to use

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.020
to do other sorts of migrations,
as well.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.241
GREG DALESANDRE: Peter, did
you have something?

00:43:25.241 --> 00:43:26.320
PETER MCKENZIE: Well,
I'm not sure I'm

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.420
answering the same question.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.623
But in terms of testing and
different app versions, name

00:43:30.623 --> 00:43:34.800
spaces could also play into
that, and how you manage your

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.580
roll-out process.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.570
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to know
about data source import and

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:45.510
export tools that you can pull
out in your roadmap.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:48.326
Data tools, import and
export tools, how

00:43:48.326 --> 00:43:49.576
that's coming along?

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:57.700
BRETT SLATKIN: Well, we have the
bulk loader, and there's

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.810
an experimental version.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:43:59.690
I think it's in SVN?

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.260
Yeah, it is.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.700
So there's a newer
version of it.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:05.860
I think it's the
old prototype.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.990
It's experimental.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.700
It's in the bulk loader
SVN repository.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.900
But effectively, it does all
of the stuff on the server

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.870
side, exports to using the file
APIs to some giant blob.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.790
You download the whole blob, and
then you can reupload it,

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.790
and then import from
that blob again.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.720
So those kind of tools are
really good for backups, or

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.900
for saving and restore, or for
copying between apps, or for

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.260
saving golden data that
you then upload

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.580
for staging and testing.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.430
So we've made progress
in that direction.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.640
The tools are not ready
for primetime.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.470
I think this fits in also with
the tools we're using for high

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.140
replication data store.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.350
So a lot of effort in that
direction, and I think all

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.600
these tools will kind of
converge really soon.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.910
AUDIENCE: I'm curious if you see
adding official support to

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.970
any number of open source
projects, or if that actually

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.567
enables you to use resources for
other things that aren't

00:45:04.567 --> 00:45:07.000
covered by existing open
source projects.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.095
Basically, how do open source
projects fit into the grand

00:45:11.095 --> 00:45:12.345
scheme of things?

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.850
BRETT SLATKIN: I feel like
you're talking to me.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.040
Well, we have a bunch of places
where we talk about

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.670
open source projects.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.760
Especially like Objectify and
some other kind of specialized

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.570
ORMs that are really--

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.880
or like in Japan, there's
something called flim3.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.420
That's the biggest
thing for writing

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.420
web apps on App Engine.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.170
So these are not officially
supported.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.620
But the community has built
tools that are, for certain

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.280
styles of programming, much
better than the tools that

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.610
we've built, depending on the
kind of developer you are.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.730
Like if you're a spring guy,
there's some tool that's

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.080
better for spring guys.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.660
So I think maybe we should
officially support these.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.070
But we have the list of tools,
will it work on App Engine,

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:54.890
and stuff like that.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.620
And we try to maintain
those kind of

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.070
things the best we can.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.830
But maybe a rubber stamp would
be useful to you, like

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.176
recommended or something
like that?

00:46:03.176 --> 00:46:05.034
AUDIENCE: Where integration
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:05.034 --> 00:46:05.810
a large part--

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:06.360
sorry.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.190
Where integration of projects
that still some missing,

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.700
functionality gap that maybe is
not general enough to meet

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.900
everyone's needs.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.790
Things like sessions or RPC.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.000
GREG DALESANDRE: So the other
thing I was going to say as

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.420
well is that it's hard
to say what kind of

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.710
official support means.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:30.290
Although I think we want to
encourage the open source

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.340
community as much as possible.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.663
We talked earlier about the
other open source, some

00:46:34.663 --> 00:46:36.540
limitations of App
Engine itself.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:42.290
And I think we like that,
we want to encourage it.

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:47.120
It takes some amount of time
on our side when we open

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.880
source APIs and those sort of
things, for instance, and so

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.660
it's, of course,
all a balance.

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:55.970
But over the course of the year,
I think, we'll start to

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.070
figure out if there's more
things we can do to sort of

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.510
encourage some of
these projects.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.990
MIKE AIZATSKY: The one thing
which I wanted to

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.750
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:07.050
by our 20% project is, I wanted
to create, and I still

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:11.190
want to create an open source
community to fulfill those

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.260
smaller parts which do not
have their own project.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.470
And I call this operation
afterburner, because

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.830
afterburner makes
you run faster.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.370
And I always tend to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.720
produce [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.310
Google [UNINTELLIGIBLE],

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.900
but I want to announce
it really soon.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.990
But it's not going to
be the place for us.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:29.470
It's not going to be like
official support.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:33.100
We just want to have one single
space for people.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.480
If you've got some use
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.550
to it, you know there is a place
to go to look at, or a

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.880
place to contribute it to.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.697
So I want to announce
it maybe in a month,

00:47:44.697 --> 00:47:47.679
something like that.

00:47:47.679 --> 00:47:50.950
AUDIENCE: Hey, if I want to
use my new Chromebook for

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.860
development of an app engine
in the cloud, do I have any

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.530
options for that?

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.570
BRETT SLATKIN: I think
it's control T.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.100
It'll go to the shell, and
then you can just--

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.940
no.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.666
GUIDO VON ROSSUM: There
will be something.

00:48:05.666 --> 00:48:07.110
It's not ready.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:10.250
SEAN LYNCH: There's a couple of
third party ones available

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.910
right now, too.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:16.440
I think Cloud9 just launched
sort of an IDE, and they do

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.840
deployment into App Engine.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.550
I think if you look around,
there's actually a couple of

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.820
different options that are
sort of cloud-based or

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.535
web-based development
environments that we'll sort

00:48:23.535 --> 00:48:25.646
of hook into App Engine.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.510
AUDIENCE: The Python SDK is 100%
open source, but is there

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:38.630
any thought of opening the
Java SDK in the same way?

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.790
MAX ROSS: Yes.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:47.630
I believe with 150, there's a
little bit of it that's open

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.260
source, and I think you can
expect to see a lot more in

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.360
the next release.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:53.910
So, yeah.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:57.100
We want all of it open source,
and it's taken us a little

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.190
while to get our
ducks in a row.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:02.120
But just that little bit of open
source in 150, that means

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.360
all of the hard work has been
done, and now we've got some

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.680
busy work to do to get
the rest of it out

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.640
there, but it's coming.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.460
SEAN LYNCH: One plug is that
the Go run time is already

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.900
open sourced.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.380
So they beat the Java guys.

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.565
ANDREW DURAND: We are an open
source project, so we've got

00:49:18.565 --> 00:49:19.815
an unfair advantage.

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:27.745
AUDIENCE: There was quite a
huge outage this March.

00:49:27.745 --> 00:49:33.875
Who broke Python run time, and
what did you do to make sure

00:49:33.875 --> 00:49:35.730
that this won't happen again?

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:42.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:49.940
MICHAEL HANDLER: There's always
surprises coming.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.820
And you should come
to my talk.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:58.930
And things break in ways that
we didn't think that we ever

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.330
had to monitor.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:04.455
And the first thing that we do
the minute something happens

00:50:04.455 --> 00:50:08.620
that we don't expect, after
we fix it, is we say, OK.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:11.450
How can we detect how that
would happen again?

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:13.920
How can we detect those
classes of problems

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.500
beforehand, before it
hits production?

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.700
How can we detect that in devel,
in QA, in our early

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.360
internal instance, so that we
find that beforehand and go,

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.570
wait, stop.

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:24.650
We broke that.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:26.690
And let's not make that
happen to production.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.480
And we have really good
coverage, but reality is

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.680
always ready to surprise you.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.910
So that's unfortunately as much
as I can say about that

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.260
particular incident.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.850
SEAN LYNCH: There is also
a public postmortem.

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:44.120
I'm assuming it was like
the March 8--?

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.120
So there's a public postmortem
that we posted as well.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.930
So I don't know if you got
a chance to see that.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:51.380
MAX ROSS: It took us a little
bit longer than usual to get

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.160
that one out there.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.150
But we take these public
postmortems really seriously.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.410
We're not trying to blow smoke
in anybody's eyes.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:00.360
If you think that we are not
being transparent enough, we

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:00.630
want to know.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.550
Because we want to be as
transparent as we possibly can

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:05.950
with you about what went wrong
and we're doing to prevent it

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:07.200
from happening again.

00:51:09.977 --> 00:51:11.861
AUDIENCE: Is there any specific
reason why the

00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:14.903
planned outages, or is that like
5 PM in the area most of

00:51:14.903 --> 00:51:15.785
your developers would live?

00:51:15.785 --> 00:51:18.790
That's sort of in the middle of
our work day, and sort of

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:20.575
affects our revenue at
a very serious peak

00:51:20.575 --> 00:51:21.810
time for our users.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.840
GREG DALESANDRE: That sounds
like someone not running HR.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.580
MATT WILDER: I was going
to say two things.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.660
One is, you don't have
to worry about

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.460
these if you use HR.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.920
Two is that the procedure
involved in performing that

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.440
maintenance--

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.810
we talked about this a little
bit in our HR [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:38.510
talk--

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.410
requires an engineer to do a
whole bunch of very specific

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:45.890
steps, and we don't want to be
up at five in the morning.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:49.890
Also, there are things that can
go wrong, so we want more

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:52.800
than one person around when
those things happen.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.985
GREG DALESANDRE: We also are,
you know, people are using App

00:51:54.985 --> 00:51:56.250
Engine across the world.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.600
And so it's always going to be
inconvenient for someone.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.780
MATT WILDER: It's always
5 PM somewhere, right?

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.100
ALFRED FULLER: Also, the data
store, which is what causes

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.110
these planned maintenances, for
the most part, to take an

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:13.160
hour, as we talked to this
morning, uses common

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.400
infrastructure.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.410
And so if something goes wrong,
we want those teams to

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:20.760
be available and around to make
sure that you experience

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.450
as little down time as possible
in those rare

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:25.460
situations.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.105
So one of the reasons why we do
that is because it doesn't

00:52:28.105 --> 00:52:29.340
just involve us.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.940
It involves a lot of other
teams. And in those times,

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:34.210
they're more available than they
would be if we did it at

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:38.205
midnight, or some other time.

00:52:38.205 --> 00:52:38.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.500
BRETT SLATKIN: I'm just
going to plug the

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.530
HR data store again.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:44.280
I have two apps that are very
dear to me that I run.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.220
One is on master/slave, and one
is on the HR data store.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.060
I launched something on the HR
data store an hour before the

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.175
maintenance this last week.

00:52:53.175 --> 00:52:54.470
I didn't even know.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.140
I had no idea.

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.780
And I'm like pushing code
and doing everything.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.220
So I think that I've just
forgotten about it.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.620
Meanwhile, I'm getting paged on
my phone because my other

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.910
app was having some issues.

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:09.700
So I think that, just in my own
experience, it's totally

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.870
changed my frame of mind to
have the HR data store.

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:14.990
I've had to work around the ways
that it's different, but

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:17.422
really, see if you
can move to it.

00:53:17.422 --> 00:53:20.080
It's not a gimmick.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.362
It's really serious,
what it gives you.

00:53:22.362 --> 00:53:23.611
AUDIENCE: I have a follow
up question, but I'll

00:53:23.611 --> 00:53:26.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:28.045
AUDIENCE: This is the additional
question on OpenID

00:53:28.045 --> 00:53:30.430
implementation on App Engine.

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:34.540
You know the single sign on
for social networks like

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.030
Facebook and Twitter is
very small, is you

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.426
really look at it.

00:53:37.426 --> 00:53:41.670
But the OpenID implementation
for Google,

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:42.660
it's a little shaky.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:48.320
Probably because Google accounts
and the Google app

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.346
are two different log ins,
and if you have to do

00:53:51.346 --> 00:53:52.850
a single sign on--

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:55.100
BRETT SLATKIN: So Twitter is
everybody but OAuth, and

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.350
Facebook is OpenID.

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.890
I'm saying, they're
not, right?

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.730
So could be more specific
about what the--

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:08.690
AUDIENCE: For example, if you
have a Like button, you know,

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:12.060
once you have logged in into
Facebook, you don't have to

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:16.540
really worry about when you go
to a different site, click on

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.680
Like if you want to
be logged in.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.610
But in Google, you don't
have [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:22.430
in Gmail or in, let's say,
you're in a domain like

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:23.590
[UNINTELLIGIBLE],

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:25.214
you don't know which one
you are in, right?

00:54:25.214 --> 00:54:26.180
So.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.776
BRETT SLATKIN: So this
is by design.

00:54:27.776 --> 00:54:30.295
This is because if it weren't
like that, if there were paths

00:54:30.295 --> 00:54:33.420
of login everywhere, then people
could drive by, steal

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.050
your information.

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.910
So they could put a widget in
the bottom of a page, you go

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:41.380
to the page, and then you send
a request off to their site,

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.740
you're automatically logged in,
and now they know who you

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.620
are, or your ID, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.655
It works great for Facebook and
for a lot of single sign

00:54:47.655 --> 00:54:50.580
on things, because they're
the center of it, so

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.820
they are OK with that.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.310
Publishers pull that too.

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:56.410
But if you apply that to every
App Engine app, and there's

00:54:56.410 --> 00:55:00.230
200,000 of them, then you've
got a security problem.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.160
And so I think that we're trying
to strike the right

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.480
balance there.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.690
If you can think of some good
ideas of how to work around

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.440
that, we'd love to hear them.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.820
But that's, I think, the
best balance we've

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.900
been able to find.

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.770
SEAN LYNCH: Specifically on
the OpenID implementation,

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:14.770
we've got some--

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.295
I don't think they made it to
IO, but some changes, or some

00:55:18.295 --> 00:55:22.090
new features coming along that
way that should also smooth

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:24.090
out some of the integration
bits.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.936
So that might help you address
your problem, as well.

00:55:30.268 --> 00:55:30.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:36.240
When you're deciding how to
price App Engine, I'm curious,

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.858
going forward, how do
you view the typical

00:55:38.858 --> 00:55:41.098
customer of app engine?

00:55:41.098 --> 00:55:43.860
Given that there's an enormous
variance of price sensitivity

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.412
between the enterprising folks
that would be otherwise

00:55:46.412 --> 00:55:49.424
spending millions of dollars on
Oracle and then the other

00:55:49.424 --> 00:55:53.350
people that are writing the
Facebook fad of the week app.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:56.670
GREG DALESANDRE: So we're
relatively transparent about

00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.340
that by our sort of three
different usage types of free

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:04.450
apps, paid apps, and
premiere accounts.

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:08.010
Where we really sort of thought
about it from the

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:14.620
perspective of free apps are
designed to allow people to

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.660
try out App Engine, if they want
to try out App Engine, or

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.920
if they want to use App Engine
for a long period of time

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.960
without paying anything.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.150
It's designed to do that.

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:26.170
But you know, you get
to a point where--

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.010
you know, you're all trying to
run businesses, and we're

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:34.460
trying to run a business
as well, right?

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:40.150
And so the paid app is then, for
kind of the profile of it,

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:42.440
we're sort of small people--

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.070
not small people, but
small businesses.

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:53.870
Like a couple people who were
looking to run their apps, but

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:56.660
don't necessarily need
operational support, it's OK

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:59.860
for them to go to the
list. $9 a month.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.020
I think somebody on the list
said that it was two cups of

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.530
coffee a month.

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:04.840
Actually, these days, depending
where you go, it's

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.630
one cup of coffee a month.

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:15.390
But the goal was, it's important
that there's a

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:20.800
monthly fee in there to pay
for the SLA, and also to

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.920
essentially establish
a contract with us.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.740
It's very difficult to have an
SLA, and a lot of them-- we

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:29.430
got the feedback from customers
before where they

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:33.150
really, really wanted to just
have a relationship with us,

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:36.760
where they wanted to make sure
that we felt accountable to

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.480
them, but their usage wasn't
that large, even though they

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.790
felt like what they were doing
was important to them.

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:44.840
And so it's kind of hard, when
you're getting something for

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.800
free, to come into Google and
be like, I can't believe it

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.190
went down, this thing that
you're letting me do for free.

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.120
So the paid apps are really for
small businesses, and then

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.490
the premier accounts are for
enterprises, large businesses,

00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:03.530
or even like consulting
organizations, those kind of

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:06.740
people, who are using a lot
of apps to do a lot

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.211
of different things.

00:58:07.211 --> 00:58:10.810
AUDIENCE: I guess what I'm
wondering is about the part of

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:15.045
the ecosystem that has very high
traffic apps with very,

00:58:15.045 --> 00:58:16.295
very small margins.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:23.050
PETER MAGNUSSON: So just
to be clear, the price

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:23.160
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.860
that we're doing now is targeted
at the self-selected

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.840
group of current App
Engine users.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.790
So it was pretty much entirely
driven off of analysis of

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:35.580
current usage, current apps.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:39.110
And we did extensive--

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:42.050
you know, we're a
metric-oriented company.

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:44.520
We did extensive slicing and
dicing of all those numbers,

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.190
and looked at how this
impacted different

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:47.680
kinds of use cases.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.860
And we targeted so that for
the vast, vast majority, a

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:56.820
very high percentage of current
users, would look at

00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.500
the price as being, OK, well,
this is still a really good

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.020
deal, and it's cheaper
than any alternative.

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:03.930
There's going to be pathological
cases where

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:07.150
you've basically been riding on
the fact that we've had a

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.650
subsidized service, and
that you might have

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:11.050
to look at it again.

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:13.840
I've talked to some developers
that have said, well, OK, we

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.510
just needed to go in and
rearchitect a little bit, and

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.230
optimize a little bit, and guess
what, then the usage

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:21.780
numbers went down by a
certain percentage.

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.280
But it should be a very small
percentage who are

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.930
impacted in that way.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:30.790
Conversely, for most apps that
are paying money, the

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:32.520
consequence is going to
be that you're going

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.280
to be paying more.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.390
I mean, there's no ifs
or buts about that.

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:39.970
But that is also by intention,
because we want this to be a

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:43.570
really successful commercial
product for Google so we can

00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:44.870
build on it.

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:46.460
And it also should
not be compared

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.470
with unmanaged services.

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:52.470
I've seen some online
discussions about, you know,

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:55.550
it's cheaper to do
x over here.

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:58.000
When you do the aggregate
comparison, you should look at

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.380
the aggregate of your whole
service, and you should

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.135
consider the fact that on App
Engine, you're getting a fully

01:00:03.135 --> 01:00:05.300
managed service.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.020
So we're happy to look at any
particular benchmarks.

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:12.590
We had internal, a dozen or so
different models for different

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.662
use cases, where we wanted to be
competitive on all of them.

01:00:15.662 --> 01:00:18.420
So I think at the end of the
day, the community is going to

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.850
still find it's a really,
really good deal.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.840
GREG DALESANDRE: So I think
we're almost out of time.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.474
So maybe one last question?

01:00:30.474 --> 01:00:33.360
AUDIENCE: I've just got
a really simple one.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.982
Is there any prospect of being
able to map a custom domain to

01:00:36.982 --> 01:00:39.160
a specific version of an app?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.110
ALON LEVI: Not at present, no.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.200
But that's an interesting
feature [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.450
we can look into.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.080
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.590
Or have it mapped to a back
end, or have it--

01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:58.390
Yeah, that's definitely
something we'd

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:00.630
like to look into.

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:03.050
GREG DALESANDRE: This is an
area where we're actually

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:06.330
looking at right now anyway, of
what's the best way to do

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:06.790
some of that.

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:08.565
And so I'm glad you
mentioned that.

01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:11.360
It was something we hadn't
specifically talked about.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:11.890
ALON LEVI: Good feedback.

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:12.640
Thank you.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.630
GREG DALESANDRE: Thank you.

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.040
ALON LEVI: So I guess
that's it for us.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.430
Thank you for attending, and
feel free to find any of us

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.680
afterwards.
