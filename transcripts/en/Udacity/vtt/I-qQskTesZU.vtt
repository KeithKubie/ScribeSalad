00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.580
Now that we saw some of the git basic

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.689
functionalities in practice, let's go a step further. If

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.420
you remember I mentioned before that many of these

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.250
version control systems are actually integrated into IDE's. So

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.540
what were going to look at next is what happens

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.500
if we put together git and eclipse. And the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.960
result is egit, or EGit is a plug in

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.520
for the eclipse IDE that adds git functionality to eclipse.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.880
So let's see how that works in practice. So

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.400
support for git is available in many IDE's including

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.920
Eclipse. And if you want to get github

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.620
for Eclipse, you should go to eclipse.github.com and you can

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.445
download the plugin. So this bring us to the

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:44.530
plugin page and you can use the provided URL

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.060
and directions to install the plugin. In this case

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.945
we're going to copy this address. So we're going to

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:54.110
Eclipse, Help, Install new software. We can click on Add

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.810
to add a new site from which to get software. We

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.110
paste the location that we just copied here. And we

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.842
can give it a descriptive name. In this case I'll just

00:01:02.842 --> 00:01:06.645
call it Eclipse Git plugin. Then when I click okay,

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:09.720
Eclipse will go, and look for plugins. And as you can

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.510
see, there are two options. We can select both of them,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.180
and click on next. You can see that the Eclipse identified

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.330
a few dependencies. You can click next and accept them. You can

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.540
accept the terms and conditions for the plug in, and then just

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.730
finish. And at this point, Eclipse will install the plugin, which might

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.610
take a little bit of time. So we're just going to speed it up.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.110
And when Eclipse is done, you will get this prompt that will

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.670
tell you that you need to restart Eclipse for the plugin to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.990
be actually installed. And at this point, you want to click yes. And

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.550
when Eclipse restarts. You'll have your plugin. We're going to go to the git

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.030
repository perspective that we can select here. And when we click

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.160
OK, you can see that our display will change. And since

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.360
we don't have any repository yet, we are provided with the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.620
possibility of adding an existing local git repository, cloning a git repository

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.330
or creating a new local git repository. We're going to add an

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.800
existing local repository. This is the one that we created earlier,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.170
so we'll select it and click finish, and you can see

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.660
that my project is now added to this set of git repositories.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.240
Now let's check out the project from the repository by selecting import

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.530
project. And here you can import something as an existing project, you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.300
can use a new project wizard, and in this case I chose

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.680
the option of importing as a general project. Then I click Next and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.870
as you can see, I have the project name up there and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.630
I can click Finish. So now, if I go to the resource perspective

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.740
by clicking here, I can see that the project has been added

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.760
to my set of projects. And I can see all the files within

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.440
the project, particularly, if I click on the README, you can see

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.190
that we have the Readme file that we created before. Same thing for

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.930
the test file. One thing I can do at this point, it

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.070
to execute different git commands, perform

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.430
different git operations by using the team

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.010
submenu in the contactual menu. And here there are several things

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.650
I can do including some advanced commands. And just to give it a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.200
shot, I am going to try to click show local history, and this

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.180
shows the history of the file. For example it shows the author and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.200
it shows when he was created, when he was authored. let's make

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.810
some changes to this file by adding some new content. Okay. I saved

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.160
the file and now I can see that error that indicates that my

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.620
file was locally changed. So now if I go to the team menu,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.380
you can see that I have the option to add to the index,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.686
to stage the file. And now I got this new label that star

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:17.980
that shows the files added to the index. And now at this point,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.270
I can go to the team menu again and I can actually commit

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.480
the file by selecting the corresponding entry. This allows me to enter

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.390
the commit message, exactly in the same way which I could do

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.250
that from the command line with the textual editor. And after I

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.050
put the comment there, I can actually commit. And now if we

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.320
look at the history view, we can see here that we have

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.960
a new version for the file that we just modified. And we

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.250
can also see the commit comment. And, at this point, if we

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.450
had remote repository we could push our changes to that remote repository

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.330
as well. Again, using the team submenu and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.170
the contextual menu. And, speaking of remote repositories, what we

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.230
are going to see next is how to use GitHub

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.640
repositories which are remote repositories that are hosted on GitHub.
