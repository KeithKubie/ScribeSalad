00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.260
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good morning,
everyone, and thank you all

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.960
for coming despite the bad weather.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.190
I'm delighted to see you all here
for this very special program

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.800
to celebrate with us the gift by
the Afghan Media Resource Center

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.590
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.050
It gives a unique digital
archive of 94,650 photographs,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.280
1,200 hours of videos, 350 hours
of audio recordings on Afghanistan.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.420
That's the largest --
the largest collection

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.480
of its kind anywhere in the world.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.670 position:56%
We're here today to recognize the
work that was done by so many people

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.770
in Afghanistan and in Washington,
D.C. I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.120 position:56%
Chief of the African and Middle
Eastern Division here at the Library

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.620
of Congress, and I will be your
host for the rest of the program.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.650 position:56%
For the sake of time, I will
introduce each speaker very briefly,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.400 position:56%
and have put on your seats their
fuller bios, so you have their bios,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.560
so you can have a better
idea of who each person is.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.320
Throughout the presentation we
will have a slideshow of some

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.610
of the images from the archive
that illustrate the wide range

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.420
of subjects that are covered
by this 30 year-long project.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.720
I will now begin by calling on
the acting Librarian of Congress,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.360
David Mao, would directs the
operations of the Library

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.350
of Congress and overseas this
entire library, which is,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.870
as many of you know, the
largest library in the world.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.530
He oversees its various
units to ensure

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.950
that the library services the
Congress, the American people,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.460
and the world are provide
effectively.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.760
So, David.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.350
&gt;&gt; David S. Mao: Thank
you very much, Mary-Jane,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.650
and good morning to all of you.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.820
As Mary-Jane mentioned, my name is
David Mao and I have the privilege

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.620
of serving as the acting librarian.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.630 position:56%
I am very, very honored to be able
to welcome all of you to the Library

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.930
of Congress here today so that we
can celebrate this very important

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.380
project and learn more about the
project, a product of cooperation

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.990
between the Afghan Media
Resource Center in Kabul

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.470
and various U.S. government
agencies,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.010
including the United
States Department of State

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.200
and the Library of Congress.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.990
As you can see on the
slides on either side,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.330
the cooperation has
produced unique photos.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.100
There is also video and audio
digital archives in these archive

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.200
on Afghanistan covering the
period from 1987 to 2012.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.260
We now at the Library of
Congress hold the digital copies

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.680
of that archive and we will
eventually make it available

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.770
to the public through
our reading rooms.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.400
Over the next hour
or so you will hear

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880
from these distinguished
speakers here are the at --

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.970
at the table talking about
how this project came about

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.410
and really what does this
archive mean to the world.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.520
Just a little bit of
information, we are here in the --

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.010
what's known as the
Northeast Pavilion,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.120
or the Government Pavilion
here at the Library of Congress

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.650
in the historic Thomas
Jefferson building.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.950 position:56%
And, as you can see, there are lots
of symbols that represent this room,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.650
the government of the United
States, the government itself

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.180
in the medallion on the -- on the
ceiling and the representations

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.730
around the wall of the
different regions of our country,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.530
as well as different
executive branch agencies

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.850
within the United States,
at least at the time

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.440
that this building was created.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.630
So you will see representations of
the treasuring State Department,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.380
Justice and Post Office
Departments, Agriculture

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.230
and Interior, War and Navy.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.740
And I think in a way that these
representations symbolize very well

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.380
the Afghan Media Resource Center
collection here at the Library

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.440
of Congress, because these
themes that are represented

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.170
on these walls can also be seen
in these digital representations,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.470
whether it be in the pictures

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.920
or in the audio visual
materials in the collection.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.370
They talk about different
regions in the area.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.080
They talk about different
things that happened,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.980
whether it's sharing a meal
together or negotiation,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.240
whether it's building or
destruction, whether it's dying

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.500
or planting and enjoying
bountiful harvest.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.240
These are all represented by the
different areas in our country

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.630
and in the different symbols of the
departments that we represent here.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.690 position:56%
So I think it's particularly fitting
that we're in this room to be able

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.460
to talk about this collection.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.760 position:56%
So with that said I'm very glad that
all of you are here today to hear

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.410
about this very special gift,
and to hear from those folks

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.790
who have been instrumental
in making this all happen.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.900
I know you'll really enjoy
hearing about the archives,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.280
the story about its creation,
and the way it came about.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.150
And I hope it will inspire
you to come and learn more

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.980
about the Library of Congress, not
only to use these materials to look

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.200
at them, but also to look at them
for research, and also perhaps

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.990
to look at more of the materials
here in the collection of Library

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.720
of Congress from around the
world that are preserved here

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.760
and can be used for all of you.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.100
So with that I want to thank
you again and welcome you

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:55.390
to the Library of Congress
[applause].

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.540
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank
you, thank you so much.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.840
Thank you.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.140
Well, thank you, thank you, David.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:06.580
He has an extremely busy schedule
and he has come especially to be

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.260
with us today, so we
really appreciate this.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.760
And before I introduce our
speakers, I would like to recognize

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.620
and thank some of the people
who made this project possible.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.130
First, I would like to thank
the Afghan Media Resource Center

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.130
and its director, Haji Sayed
Daud, who is with us today,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.400
and all the MRC staff who have
produced the original photos

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.330
and videos and then
organized, archived,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.000
and stored these materials,
and later worked tirelessly

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.150
to produce the metadata in
Pashto, Darti [phonetic], English,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.940
as well as in translation
and in transliteration.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.370
That transliteration is
a complex library system

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.590
that transcribes phonetically
various scripts, in this case Darti

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.560
and Pashto, into Roman
script, without which,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.680
without this metadata this
collection could not have been

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.090 position:56%
absorbed by the Library of Congress.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.370
Haji Daud is an extraordinary
man, who has dedicated his life

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.360
to recording in photos and
videos the history of Afghanistan

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.510
in the last three decades.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.980
He has created the single,
most important record

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:38.190 position:56%
of Afghan contemporary history and
society in existence anywhere today.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.270
He has accomplished this feat
by training Afghan journalists,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.910
whom he has sent to every region
of Afghanistan to film, videotape,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:53.200
record, and photograph the
lives of ordinary Afghans.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.540
And as the librarian said,
in war and peace, in planting

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.220
and harvesting, in
negotiation and in fighting,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.260
in bringing up children, in caring

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.470
for the living, and
caring for the dead.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.220
He has risked his life many
times so that this unique record

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.190
of Afghanistan's history
is preserved,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.290
and so that the world becomes
aware of what the people

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.650
of Afghanistan have been through
in the last three decades.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.770
In my mind he's a hero who has
brought his life's work to us here

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.440
at the library so that we
can store and preserve it

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.800 position:56%
and make it available to scholars
and researchers, and to all who want

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.550
to know more about Afghanistan.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:44.160
Having said this, I move on
to the speakers and I would

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.200
like to thank the Department
of State, here presented

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.740
by U.S. Ambassador Peter Tomsen,
who has been a tireless supporter

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.520
of the AMRC project, and has
met on a number of occasions

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.600
with the Library of Congress
executives to make the case

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.410
for the importance of this archive
and the need to have it included

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.350
in the library's collections.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.530
I want to thank Tess Delprete,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.230
who is here representing
the State Department also,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.420
without whose financial support to
the Afghan Media Resource Center,

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.360
this project could not have
materialized or have become part

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.960
of the Library of Congress's
collections.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.100 position:56%
I also want to thank Stephen Olsson,
who is sitting here at the table,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.650 position:56%
for helped with the founding AMRC
1986, and for returning years later,

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.100
as you will hear, to take on
the training of the AMRC staff

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.650
to digitize this collection
for the Library of Congress.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.220
He did so with Nick Mills [assumed
spelling], who is s with us.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.780
He's a professor of
journalism at Boston University

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.940
who has spent 12 hours at Logan
Airport to come and see us,

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.830
due to weather issues, and he
trained also Afghan journalists

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.280
for AMRC 1986 and then return
to Kabul for this project

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.600
for the Library of Congress.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.870
Steve has come all the way from
California to be with us today

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.360
and make, as we pointed out,
all the way from Boston.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.330
I want to thank Library
Services, here represented

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.020
by the Associate Librarian
for Library Services,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.560
Mark Sweeney [assumed spelling],
and the Director of Collection

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.140
and Services, Selina Zinkam
[assumed spelling], who,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.630 position:56%
unfortunately, could not be with us.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.840
But they supported -- they have
provided support for this project

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.770
and have recognized its importance.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.260
My thanks go to my colleague,
Greg Lukow, who is sitting here,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.100
and his staff for the
incredible work they have done

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.120 position:56%
with the video and audio recordings.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.440
Greg will recognize those in the
motion picture and recorded sound

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.520
who have worked on this
project later in the program.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.740
Thanks go to [inaudible] from my
division, who has worked closely

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.360
with me throughout this project
and has been enormously helpful

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.750
in numerous ways, including
being responsible

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:08.890 position:56%
for reviewing the metadata in Darti,
English, and in transliteration.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.400
Thanks go to [inaudible] and
Fung Tran [assumed spelling],

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.920
also at the library, who
reviewed the metadata in Pashto.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.850 position:56%
To Marzea Rafi [assumed spelling]
and Michael Chiat [assumed spelling]

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.560
for their help with
cataloguing issues.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.210
[inaudible] has done
incredible work with the photos.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.950
He's responsible for uploading
these into the library system

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.040
and also making available
these photos today.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.310
And thanks to Mike Newbert [assumed
spelling], to whom we went time

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.040
and again for advice on IT
procedures regarding the inclusion

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.890
of this collection into
the library system.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.560
My role in this project has been
that of bringing people together,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.330
who needed to work together.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.540
I met Haji Daud eight years ago
when he came to the library to see

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.650
if there was any way we could
work together to digitize

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.270
and preserve his endangered
collection in Kabul.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.740
Endangered because it was
threatened by war, by conflict,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.230
but also by natural elements,
such as dampness, extreme cold,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.610
or extreme heat, insects, etcetera.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.250
Together we worked to get
copyright permissions,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.060
set up an operational budget,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.600
and get the library's
approval for the project.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.210
Within Ambassador Peter Tomsen,
Jim Hoagland [assumed spelling],

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.060
and Michael Malinowski
[assumed spelling],

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.620
who are all present here today, we
met then with Associate Librarian,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.920
Deanna Markham [assumed spelling],

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.800
and explained the importance
of that archive.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.870
She gave me the green light to
pursue this project and agreed

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.030
that the library should hold a
digital copy of these materials

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.260
if we were able to
make this project work.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.590
For four years we searched
for funding for the project,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:51.110
and then in a perfect Library
of Congress way, perfect story,

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.460
someone from the Department
of State came

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.610
to the library seeking a
project for the preservation

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.410
of Afghan [inaudible]
that the Office

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.840
of Public Diplomacy could fund.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.450
The rest is history.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.740
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul and was
notified, applications were filled,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.540
the grant was given,
and the work began.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.400
The people on this panel will
tell you their part of the story

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.590
and I will stop here only
to add that this huge

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.240
and very complex project was
completed in record time,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.790
stayed within budge,
which is a feat in itself,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.910
and that those digitized materials

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.950
and the metadata are now
safely here at the library.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.920
And now let me introduce the
next speaker, Peter Tomsen.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.510
And Peter has been working with us
ever -- from the very beginning.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.000
And, again, I will
introduce people very briefly.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.120
Ambassador Peter Tomsen's 32 year
diplomatic career focused primarily

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.900
on South Asia, China,
and the Soviet Union.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.200
He was a U.S. special envoy to the
Afghan resistance with the title

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.150
of ambassador from 1989 to 1993,

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.250
and served as U.S.
ambassador to Armenia.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.070
So we've had him here
before on another topic.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.530
He is the author of The Wars of
Afghanistan, Messianic Terrorism,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:22.000
Tribal Conflicts, and the Failures
of Great Powers, Peter Tomsen.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:33.820
[ Applause ]

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.000
&gt;&gt; Peter Tomsen: Thanks, Mary-Jane,
for the pitch on the book.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.160
Today we celebrate the
integration of the copy

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.140
of the huge Afghan Media Resource
Center archive into the Library

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:53.430 position:56%
of Congress' world-renowned
collection of records and knowledge.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.120 position:56%
In doing so we pay tribute to acting
Librarian of Congress, David Mao,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.500
who just spoke, and all of the
fabulous Library of Congress staff

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:09.850
who were engaged in this long-term
AMRC digitization project.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.380
Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,
as she indicated here,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.700
was our coordinator throughout
the process during this eight year

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.160
journey to get to the finish line.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.440
Crossing it would not have
been possible; however,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.890
without the dedication and hard
work of Mary-Jane's colleagues,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.630
whom she has just highlighted.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.410
Director Haji Sayed Daud

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.350
and his AMRC office were
already fully operational

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:44.270
when I first arrived in Peshawar,
a special envoy in June 1989.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.120
Before leaving Washington on
my first trip to the region,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.990
I met several hill staffers
who had helped launch AMRC.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.350
In the early 1980's, a
bipartisan group of senators

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.790
and congressmen took the
lead in appropriating funds

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.730
to get AMRC off the ground.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.150
Notably, Senator Humphrey
[assumed spelling],

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.120
Senator Dole [assumed spelling],
Senator Byrd [assumed spelling],

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.950
and Congressman Charlie
Wilson [assumed spelling]

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.850
and Don Richard [assumed spelling].

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.720
But as always in Congress,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.730
the Congressional staff did the
heavy lifting behind the scenes

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.600
to make this happen.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.950
We are very fortunate
to have a major player

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.980
in that process guiding the AMRC
legislation and appropriations

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.750
through Congress with us today.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.090
Mike Pillsbury [assumed spelling],
would you please stand up?

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.670
Mike is in the front row here.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.510
And, as I mentioned, a major
player in getting this done.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.120
Tom Klein, who was with Mike
on Senator Humphrey's staff

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.770 position:56%
and [inaudible] relations committee,
he was set to fly here this morning

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.160
with his wife and join us,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.630
but because of inclement
weather he could not come.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.240
I'd also like to mention other --

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.900
two other staffers who stand out on
the hill who helped get AMRC going,

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.210
Charlie Schnable [assumed spelling]
and Dick Damato [assumed spelling].

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:18.010
Early on there were many State
Department and USI officials

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.110
in Pakistan and in Washington
who played critical roles

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.620
in assisting Haji Daud at the AMRC.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.400
Time prevents me from naming all
of them present and not present,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.500
but three stand out for
their vital contributions.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.050
One is with us today, Richard
Hogland [assumed spelling].

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.510
Would you please stand up, Dick?

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:44.610
[ Applause ]

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.250
I'm sorry, two are with us
today, John Dixon is here, too.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.510
Would you please stand
up, John, please?

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:55.720
[ Applause ]

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.550
And Mike Malinowski.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:02.000
In her remarks Mary-Jane Deeb
gave well-deserved praise

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.270
to the State Department's
indispensable role in facilitating

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.900
and fund the AMRC digitization
project.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.480
We are happy that Tess
Delprete from State South

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.280
and Central Asia Bureau is also
with us today and will be speaking.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.180
The AMRC's coverage of
the Afghan wars began

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.200
in 1986 and ended in 2012.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.980
75% of the archive, the
heart of the collection,

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.750
focuses on the nine year, blood
soaked, Soviet Afghan war,

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.960
during which a million
Afghans perished,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.440
plus the three additional years
it took for the Mujahideen

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.600
to overthrow the Soviet
sponsored Najib regime.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.120 position:56%
The archive contains many
thousands of news items brought back

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.140
by AMRC media teams from
inside Afghanistan during the

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.150
Soviet occupation.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:03.120
As David Isby [assumed spelling]
mentioned, had Afghan eyes

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:10.700
on the war and reported it through
the AMRC Afghan Institution,

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.640
which was devoted in Peshawar
to tracking the Afghan war.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.460
The news reports -- their news
reports portrayed the desperate

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.950
fighting and the valiant
spirit of the Afghan people.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:30.170
The teams gave their microphones to
Afghans, villages, elders, women,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.680 position:56%
children, Afghan commanders, and
their Mujahideen inside the country,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.310
allowing them to speak directly
to a worldwide ordinance.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.150
The archive also carries
reports from Pakistan,

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.550 position:56%
from the refugee camps, from various
presenting Mujahideen headquarters,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.400
from diplomats, and foreign
embassies, and consulates

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.980
that were watching and
reporting on the Afghan war.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:00.690
I met with Haji Daud and his AMRC
office on every visit to Peshawar.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.970
It was completely an
Afghan operation.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.090
An AK-47 leaned on his
bed in a corner room,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.920
attesting to the dangers
that he faced every day.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.990
No foreigners were
present, only Afghans.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.940
They were all young,
dedicated and well-trained.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:24.210
When not editing film or processing
photos, they were going back

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.110
and forth into Afghanistan,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.230
operating out of Mujahideen
areas sometimes for weeks,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:34.220
sometimes for months,
bringing windows on the war

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:40.030
in every Afghan region to
audiences around the globe.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.000
Let's now pause for a
moment, if you will,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.670
to ponder why the AMRC
archive built by Haji Daud

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.460
and his AMRC journalists
is so unique,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.510
and indeed so historically
important.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.570
In large part the answer
lies in the relative paucity

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:05.630
of reliable reportage the war
following the 1979 Soviet invasion.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.210
In the U.S., and internationally,

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:13.010
it is easy to access the prolific
media coverage of World War II,

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.940
the Korean War, the Vietnam War,

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:21.320
not to mention the post-9/11
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.580
But there is a huge gap, almost I
would say a blank space regarding

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.250
on the ground coverage
of the Soviet Afghan war.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.870
Some of you in this room made
it past Pakistani border guards

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.240
and Soviet outposts to
report on the fighting,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.650
but not many Western journals and
cameramen were able to venture

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:47.220
for long periods inside
most of Afghanistan.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.520
Soviet propaganda, of course, was
bountiful throughout this period,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.430
but it delivered a false
and cynical narrative

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.520
of the true situation
inside the country.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:04.250
The vast, usually originally
sourced AMRC archive now housed

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:10.170
in the Library of Congress will
fill this nearly blank space.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.310
For the decades to come it will
be the most authentic source

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:17.210
for anyone, anywhere,
seeking accurate information

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.600
on the Soviet Afghan war to include
historians, scholars, authors,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.280
policymakers inside and outside
governments, members of the media,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.060
the military, diplomats,
and politicians.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.220 position:56%
And the archive's importance does
not end, as Haji Daud will tell you,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:42.030
with the Soviet [inaudible]
Najib regime's overthrow in 1992.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.700
For in the global and
strategic context,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:50.120
Afghanistan had been a major
battlefield of the Cold War,

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.320
one that had spread the collapse

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.570
of the last political totalitarian
empire of the 20th century.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.110
But then, sadly and immediately,

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.840
Afghanistan became
a major battlefield

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.250
against the first religious
totalitarian movement

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:11.250
of the 21st century, and that
conflict tragically continues today

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.050
without letup.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.360
In closing, let us again
hail Haji Sayed Daud,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.930
for his many achievements as a
director of AMRC, for his courage,

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.320
and for his persistence

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.790
in overcoming the most
daunting obstacles in his path,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.980
and also the Library of
Congress for accepting

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:37.230
and digitizing the entire AMRC
archive and making it available

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.100
in three languages to all.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.900
Thank you.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:49.500
[ Applause ]

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.920
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And now we are
going to hear from the man himself,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.540
Haji Sayed Daud, the director of
the Afghan Media Resource Center,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:08.000
who will give us a brief
overview of 30 years of his work.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:23.610
[ Applause ]

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.280
&gt;&gt; Haji Sayed Daud:
Good morning, everyone.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:34.350
It is my great pleasure to be among
my family, friends, and colleagues.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.800
I would like to thank the staff
at the Liberty of Congress

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.630
for putting together the ceremony.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:52.070
If I telling you that story
I think the last 30 years,

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:57.510
we have just three or five
minutes, we don't have enough time.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:05.360
Just [inaudible] the Afghan
Media Resource Center set

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.000
up by Afghan professional,

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:14.570
by funding of Boston
University in 1986.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:24.100 position:56%
The person who came first, that was
Nike Mills and his three colleagues.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:31.740
Nick Mills and [inaudible]
two colleagues,

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:39.210
they started training program
for the Afghan refugees.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:44.000
They started training in
video, photo, print reporting.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.360
When they finished that training

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:54.690
for the first session they
started second session of training.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:26:03.760 position:56%
In that time just I was
[inaudible] proposal for production.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.010
When these young Afghan refugees
[inaudible] from this training,

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.220
what will be the future
for these people?

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:20.470
I think when we finished the
second session of the training many

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:27.870
of my colleagues I am glad they
are here, John Dixon, Dick Hogland,

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.930
and Bret Hanson [assumed spelling].

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:37.030
We worked together in that time,
with Stephen and Nick [inaudible]

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.580
with all these political leaders.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:47.450 position:56%
And I met these guys, all the
political leaders, and I asked them,

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:53.930
look, these are our [inaudible]
and brothers, they got training

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.610
and they equipped by
Boston University.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.870
We want to coverage
Afghanistan situation,

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.600
which that was very
tough in that time.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.050
Because all the foreign journalists
they are sitting in Peshawar,

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.910
and they are making report
from inside of Afghanistan.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:23.850
Few of these film producer, I
think include Stephen Olsson,

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:29.660
they visit Peshawar camps and
they did their documentaries.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:36.670
I think one of these people,
which is very, very --

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.440
they did a great job in that time.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.050
His name is [inaudible] and
his crew, which is [inaudible]

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:48.760
and also the guy, his name
is Andy [assumed spelling].

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.950
They are three British-based
film producers.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:28:00.180
They -- for the first time they
travel to north Afghanistan,

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:08.640
and they also shoot film
from [inaudible] and for all

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.290
who are the [inaudible] provinces.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:21.260
All these, and other documentaries
in 1980's, in the early '80s,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.310
just producing from Peshawar
and [inaudible] camps,

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.810
some of them they went
to like [inaudible],

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:33.350
nobody coverage from [inaudible].

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:43.890 position:56%
When we did finish that training and
we spoke with the political leaders

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.360
and I ask them for support letters,

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.540
and also they must give
us some representative,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.520
and all these parties they
gave us support letter,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.750
we support this mission,
and they introduced us

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:05.300 position:56%
as they are representative, which is
last former President, Hamid Karzai,

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:10.240
was representative
of Mujahideen party.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:16.250
They call them Afghanistan
National Liberation Front.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:21.380
[inaudible] for all these
Afghans who are intellectual,

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.130
who belong to the parties,
we started production.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:32.920
In three months we
started distribution.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:40.790 position:56%
I think Stephen did a trip to London
and he talked with [inaudible]

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:46.880
and CNN, because nobody knows
about Afghan Media Resource Center.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.940
That was the first time
these people thinking, oh,

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.230
that Afghan come demand
[inaudible] photographer,

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.340
they are doing their own coverage.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.380
And also he did talk
with the [inaudible],

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:05.190
Black Star [assumed spelling],
and [inaudible] agencies.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.770
We started our distribution.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.500 position:56%
In that time I want -- I
[inaudible] want to mention the name

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.580
of the people, just that
it's very, very important

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:21.730
because in the beginning
we did a proposal.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.570
This is Independent Media Center.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:30.240
In that time [inaudible] and
Prime Minister [inaudible],

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:36.530
he tried to take over this project
to one of the political party.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:41.610
I think our friends,
some of them they are --

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.560
he is here and I don't
want to mention his name

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.640
because I don't have permission.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:53.140 position:56%
And just [inaudible] and he pass
away in [inaudible] and he stand up,

00:30:53.140 --> 00:31:01.330
support AMRC and talk
with [inaudible] Humphrey,

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.950
and [inaudible] Humphrey
directly called [inaudible].

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:11.980
And later [inaudible] agree
the AMRC will be independent.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.720
And second time that was, I
think, [inaudible] is here

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.750
and also [inaudible] was the
Ambassador of United State

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:29.830
and Islam, but we are very
good friends in that time.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.220
And Peter Tomsen was
also special [inaudible].

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:40.280
And [inaudible] he tried
to transfer AMRC to AIG,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.310
they called him Afghanistan
[inaudible].

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:51.950
And these guys asking them
we couldn't support AMRC

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.130
when you guys want to
transfer that to AIG,

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:59.740
and this is independent center.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.870
That was the second time.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:13.670
And just we did a coverage from
2000 -- sorry, from 1986 to 2012.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:20.140
That coverage is included Soviet
invasion, internal fighting

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:29.080
of Mujahideen, Taliban
period, and also 9/11 post-war

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.550
of Afghanistan what going
on there until today.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:41.620
The thing is this material belong
to all 34 province of Afghanistan.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:46.570
And that contain more than 30
subjects, like agriculture,

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:52.560
education, fighting,
[inaudible], election,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.610
human rights, women rights.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:05.450
We did collect all these
material, like 3,000 hours videos,

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:15.350
150,000 photograph and slides,
and three -- 2,000 audio.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:22.060 position:56%
When I make [inaudible] for the
first time that was January 9, 2008,

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.710
and I think John Dixon was
also with me in that meeting.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:31.900 position:56%
I ask her, what about this material,
because that's very difficult

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:37.700
to keep the quality of the
videos and audios and photos.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.660
She told me that's fine
and you can approve it.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.060
This is your material.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:49.740
All this belong to you, because
we are wondering someone else

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.680 position:56%
or the Afghan government [inaudible]
mentioning this material belong

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.630
to Afghanistan.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.720
Finally, I got back to Kabul.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.640
I call Mr. Karzai offices,
Hamid Karzai

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.090
and I set up appointment with him.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.070
And I asked him, look,
President Karzai,

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.650
if you need this archive I want
to donate it to the government,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.120
because this is the
property of Afghan nation.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.090
This not my own property.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:21.920
I did that for the Afghan
nation, Afghan people.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.860
Just he was quiet for one minute,

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.340
enough that one minute he gave me
answer, Haji Daud, you can keep it,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.700
because if you donate it to
us my staff will be selling

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:37.800
that material to the private TVs.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.380
I asked them, please, I
need a letter from you.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.630
You can write a letter [inaudible],

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.780
his own property belongs
to Haji Daud.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.130
And he asked the [inaudible]
information minister

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:56.040
and he did write that letter to me

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.410
and I collected all the
registration, titles,

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.020
and letter of culture
information from the minister

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.120
and I brought them
to Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.900
It take one year.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.430
Mary-Jane Deeb also
follow up that procedure.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:20.720
Later we get to the U.S.
Embassy in Kabul for the fund,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.990 position:56%
which is Mary-Jane Deeb [inaudible].

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:28.950
She spoke here in Washington, D.C.
I spoke there in Kabul Embassy,

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:33.250
which the guy, [inaudible], he's
working for [inaudible] of America.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.170
He was also in that
meeting because he work

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:39.720
for the Public Affair
Offices there in Kabul.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.320
We did set up proposal in 2011.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.280
I recommended to my colleagues,
who are voluntarily working

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.270
with the AMRC, Nick
Mills and Stephen Olsson.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:57.510
I ask Mary-Jane Deeb, I can
recommend to you these two guys.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.170
They can come to Washington, D.C.,
and they can get the training

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.130
and they can just return
back to Afghanistan.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:11.780
I -- these two guys got the
training and they got back to Kabul

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.560
and they train our staff.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.150
You can maybe see in
the videos and photos.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:22.630
And we started with
our Afghan colleagues

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:28.400
and we selected 1,200
hours video from 3,000,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:36.830
and also we selected 96 --
94,652 photograph and slides,

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:44.570
and also we selected
357 hours audio,

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:50.210
which is that selective material
like [inaudible] metadata

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.630
in three language,
Pashto, Darti, and English.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:37:00.990
And finally I can tell you it's
not the work of one person.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:07.710
If I tell you the reality,
120 Afghan professionals

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:12.190
for the production with the AMRC.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:17.890
And 30 Afghans they're
working with the digitization,

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.810
because it take also seven years.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:26.610
We started 2008 and we
finish it by December 2015.

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.660
This is not the journey
of one person,

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:34.070
of not work of the one person,
150 Afghans was involved with it.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:37.940
And also there is more than
10 foreigners, professionals,

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:44.630
including Stephen Olsson and
Nick Mills from 1986 to 2015.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.290
They stay with us and they
give us advice all the time.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:52.020
We exchange e-mails and
telephone conversation.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:38:01.910 position:56%
And now I'm happy this material will
be gifting one copy, one digital --

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:08.080
digitized copy to the
library, the student scholar,

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.040
and also journalists
can use it here.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.670
Maybe some of our Afghan
colleagues they must be thinking,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.420
what about Afghanistan.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.590
Because you are Afghan, you grow
up there, you went to university,

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.170
you working for national
[inaudible] TV

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.770
and you put this material
here in the library.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.070
What about Afghanistan?

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:37.350
I already did two digitized
copy, same copy,

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:41.860
one copy for Kabul
University Library,

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.750
one copy for the National
[inaudible] TV.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:51.620
The problem is right now in
Afghanistan there is no copyright.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:57.070
I hope [inaudible] fix their
problem and I can donate it

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:03.650
to the Afghan students and
scholar and researchers.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:15.820
And thanks again from Mary-Jane
Deeb, who did a lot of work with us

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:21.840
and she was organized all the
things and thanks for her stuff

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.990
and [inaudible] Gregory Lukow.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:35.910
He's chief of [inaudible]
division and he did a lot

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:40.100
with us in video, audios.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.650
I appreciate his work and
also his staff's work.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.370
And thank you -- thanks
from the State Department,

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:51.750
they're funding this project.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.730
And I think in the beginning we
estimated maybe $1 million project,

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.800
or 600,000 project, and
Mary-Jane Deeb knows

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.210
that we did that with less money.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:09.350
And we calculated [inaudible] I'm
glad they use taxpayer money is

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.650
not wasted.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:15.520 position:56%
And because in these days
everybody talking about Afghanistan,

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.030
there is corruption, the
people is involved with that.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.950
And we calculated cent
by cent, dollar by dollar

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.790
with the U.S. Embassy
people in Kabul.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:28.440
I think the guy who
did with me that is --

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.260
his name is Michael
Huff [assumed spelling].

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.510
He calculated all this
audit reports.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:42.300
And also thanks for all of
our friends and colleagues,

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:46.390
the journalists in this history
given, and thank you again

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:50.060
and thank you for coming
on this rainy day.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.860
Thanks a lot.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:41:02.500
[ Applause ]

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:12.890
And as Haji Daud has pointed
out, we have one copy and copies

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:17.500
of those wonderful materials
remain in Afghanistan,

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.720
so the patrimony is
preserved both here and there.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:29.610
And so those materials will become
available for the use of leaders

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:34.660
and researchers very soon.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:40.710
And now to the next
speaker, Stephen Olsson.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:44.270
Stephen was there at
the very beginning,

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.070
as Haji Daud has pointed out.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:53.240
He is the President of Culture
and Education Media since 1983.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.870
He has produced and
directed documentary films,

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.780
television series, and feature
news reports throughout the world

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:04.350
for U.S. and European broadcasters,
and has won numerous national

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:05.960
and international awards.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.250
And you have the forms, you can
read more about him and his work,

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:14.120
and he's going to share
with us a few minutes

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.510 position:56%
of his own experience with AMRC, so.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:25.060
[ Applause ]

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Olsson:
Thank you, Mary-Jane,

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.630
[speaking foreign language].

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.990
Greetings, everyone.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.150
It's truly a joy to be here.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.470
I don't know if we
ever foresaw this day.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:42.180
But it's such a pleasure
to celebrate the fruition

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.400
of all this work that
Haji has just described,

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.350
and to be a small part of that.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.110
I did have the great pleasure
to travel through Afghanistan

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:58.130
in the 1970's as an
undergraduate anthropology student.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:04.050
I was able to visit various parts
of the country, a fascinating

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:08.580 position:56%
and strikingly beautiful country and
culture that made a profound effect

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:15.480
on me, and I think that's what kept
bringing me back top Afghanistan.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.620
In those times many Afghans called
these times the golden years.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.640
And they still burn brightly
in my memory as a time

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.410
of great hospitality, great
friendship, adventure,

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:32.680
and exchange with so many
of the warm generous people

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.700
that I met in Afghanistan.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.770
And also committed Westerners
even at that time, such as Louis

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.070 position:56%
and Nancy Dupres [assumed spelling],

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:47.260
who sent me to their research
villages in [inaudible],

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:52.600
parts of Afghanistan that
were so precious prior

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.670 position:56%
to the Soviet invasion, and I really
felt so blessed to have been there

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.280
and met wonderful people.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:05.880
This so called golden year period
ended, of course, on December 24,

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.560
'79, with the Soviet invasion.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.580
The Soviet Afghan war had begun

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.200
with a brutal foreign
occupying military force.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.300
And as a lover of Afghanistan and
now a filmmaker, I returned in '83

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.390
to make a documentary film
about the early successes

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.780
of the Afghan resistance.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:27.590
The film was called Afghanistan,
The Fight for a Way of Life.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:31.780
I'm mentioning this because as I
left Afghanistan I gave my film

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.890
camera and many rolls
of film footage

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:40.340
to my Afghan photographer friends,
because it was clear to me,

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.100
and I think many other
filmmakers who were there,

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:47.150
or the few other filmmakers that
were there, that there were parts

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:50.350
of Afghanistan that we just
could not visit any longer.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.180
It was too risky.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.000
We would be spotted.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.820
I died my hair dark brown
and a dark brown beard.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.240
I did that three or four trips.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.410
It just got increasingly dangerous.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:09.320 position:56%
And it was obvious that Afghans were
needed to get close to the story,

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.750
what was really happening.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:16.390
Back in the U.S. I happened to
meet Tom Guttier [assumed spelling]

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.490
and [inaudible] from the
University of Nebraska,

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.980
Center for Afghanistan Studies.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.340
They liked my PBS documentary
and subsequently hired me

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.930
to draft the media
component for their proposal

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.470
to establish an Afghan
Media Resource Center.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.300
Nebraska had the academics.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.410
They had the real Afghan
area experts,

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:39.320
but no communications people.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.920
And as you know, Boston University
had all the communications people,

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.960
but no real Afghan expertise.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.770
I consulted in Omaha for a week.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:55.560
I went back to Pakistan to show my
film to the Afghans who appeared

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.260
in it, and I happened to see in the
Muslim English language newspaper

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.050
in Peshawar, a team of trainers
had arrived from Boston University

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:09.080
to establish a training project
for Afghans in university town,

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.150 position:56%
which was so bizarre because the
University of Nebraska never told me

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.060
who finally got that grant.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.120
Here I was back in Peshawar and
I hope in a rickshaw and got

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.680
to Canal Bank [phonetic]
Road where I meet Nick Mills.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.810
And this amazing feeling,
so happy to be there,

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:30.050 position:56%
so happy the other trainers and
everything, so happy it was going on

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.070
but somehow feeling --
after being so involved

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:38.630
in the continent being oblivious
to how this all happened.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:43.210
Anyway, Nick and I hit it
off and Nick recommended

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.890
to the Boston University
Dean, [inaudible],

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:51.420
who a few days later sent me a
business class ticket to come

00:46:51.420 --> 00:47:02.020
to Boston immediately for an
interview, where after a few hours

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:06.450
of questioning I was hired to
be the U.S. project director,

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:12.050
with a mandate to find an Afghan
director and an Afghan staff.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.840
So Nick had set up meetings

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.620
with Mujahideen parties,
as Haji mentioned.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.880
Haji came to visit the AMRC with
the [inaudible] Islami group.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.470
Haji had a journalism degree.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.150
He was a television producer.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.180
He worked both with news and
with cultural programming,

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.720
which I thought was so important.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.860
We got along very well
professionally and otherwise.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:38.810
And in this sea of war,
refugees, spies, and vast amounts

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:42.960
of well-meaning money, of all
the Afghans that I had met,

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:49.460
Haji Daud struck me as an extremely
honest and trustworthy man.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.960
So with Nick and my
recommendation, Boston hired --

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:58.310
officially hired Haji Daud
to be the AMRC director.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.520
He is a politically
astute media professional

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:07.230
who had wonderful contacts with
all the Afghan resistance parties,

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.710
as well as with exiled
Afghan journalists.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.610
When I say all of the
resistance parties,

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:16.680
I must say he also connected
with [inaudible] groups

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.980 position:56%
from different parts of Afghanistan.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:24.810
Haji Daud was talking [inaudible]
commanders, journalists and,

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:29.610
as you've come to learn many of you
through the big [inaudible] divide,

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:34.110
this was in Afghanistan
very important.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:38.150
We started our first
week training session,

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:41.710
and then started dispatching crews
to different parts of the country

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:46.910 position:56%
with video and photo cameras, story
ideas, and even specific shot lists.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:49.820
We had 25 new video
camera packages to assign,

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.810
50 35 millimeter photo cameras,

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.530
audio cassette recorders,
and lots of work to do.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:58.710
Haji, Nick, and I tried
to spend time

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.220 position:56%
with the cameramen before they left,
reminding them that in addition

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.570
to generating the combat
related footage and stories,

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.120
which was their primarily
assignment,

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:13.240
to also document Afghan cultural
life, wedding, Nowruz celebrations,

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.550
New Year celebrations, children,
families, and other social events.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:23.650
It should be mentioned that this
war was called the Hidden War

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:26.690
because for years virtually no
Western journalists were willing

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:30.170
to take the risks to go
deeply into Afghanistan.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.450
As Haji mentioned, there
were no reports coming

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:36.560
from central Afghanistan or from
the far west or the far north,

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.170
where it would require often nine,

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:43.490
10 days of travel to
reach the location.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:46.100
So for the next year and a
half under Haji's direction,

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.130
AMRC dispatched over 100 two
to three men crews to all parts

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:53.850
of Afghanistan, mostly to
places with no electricity,

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:58.810
no battery chargers, no
phone service, and no roads.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:03.110 position:56%
Our AMRC news teams sometimes
delayed for weeks due to bad weather

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:06.900 position:56%
or being detained by local warlords,
who would eventually return

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.280
to [inaudible] and sit
down with our editors

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:13.230
to create our weekly AMRC news
reports, which we would then rush

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:19.210
to send via DHL to syndication
services in London, like Viz News,

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.890
which is the parent
company of [inaudible].

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:24.770
These services would check
our stories for accuracy

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:28.880
and professionalism and then
feed weekly AMRC stories

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.650
to over 245 broadcasters in
over 100 countries worldwide.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:37.010
Meanwhile, AMRC photos
were being distributed

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.950
through Sigma, Black Star, and AFP.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:45.110
The AMRC was starting to
achieve some of its goals.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.480
Then on December 31,
'87, Boston University

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.350
and Dean [inaudible] were
suddenly phased out of the project.

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:56.750
As Boston left I agreed to stay
on as the senior media advisor,

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:01.290 position:56%
now to an AMRC that was finally
independent, run totally by Afghans,

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:06.310
with no American bosses
or supervision.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.750
Then after setting up the
international distribution,

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:13.490
I was able to do as the British
say, make myself redundant

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:17.290
and leave the project
totally to Haji and his staff,

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:21.600
which was a shared dream of Nick
Mills and mine from the beginning,

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.830
that we should phase ourselves
out of this as soon as possible.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:31.240
Peter Tomsen, Ambassador Tomsen
did a wonderful job describing the

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.500
significance of the project.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:38.940
What I would only like to add is
I think the AMRC was finally able

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.620
to open a window on this hidden
war and generate news reports

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:48.430
and documentation from 25 of
Afghanistan's then 29 provinces,

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:51.020
reports that made an
impact on viewers

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.500
and governments throughout
the world.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.050
In the process, more than
20 of our journalists

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.990
and cameramen were injured,
and two of our cameramen,

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:04.020
[inaudible] were killed while
on assignment for the AMRC.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:14.100
Nick Mills says the best thing he
did for the AMRC was to find me,

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.930
and I say the best thing
I did for the AMRC was

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.510
to hire Haji Daud as
project director.

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:27.040
[ Applause ]

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.310
Aside from the management
and professional results,

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:34.490
there was no theft, fraud,
or embezzlement practices

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.850
which you've heard have
achieved epidemic proportions

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:41.240 position:56%
in this new U.S. funded Afghanistan.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.190
Haji has run an honorable, focused,
tight ship for almost 30 years.

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:51.850
His head of -- his directors of all
departments have stayed with him

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:57.490 position:56%
for over -- for almost 30 years,
reappeared for this archive project,

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:05.400
admirable to see such long-term
faith in real professional Afghans.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.730
In 2002 Haji and I worked
together first drafting a proposal

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:13.320
for funding an archive at
Williams College, and then again

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.610
after September 11 with other
friends, many of whom are

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:23.460 position:56%
in the room, on a new proposal and
budget to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.140
The AMRC archives would
be transferred

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:30.920
onto the highest quality,
uncompressed digital files

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.690
with accompanying metadata to
provide contextual information,

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:38.030
accessibility, and
relevance over time,

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:42.010
over decades, and even
over centuries.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:46.900
I remember speaking with Greg
Lukow and James Snyder at --

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:52.880
here at the LOC about this thing
we call time, and especially

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.280
as a filmmaker I was amazed
to hear that these guys think

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:03.230
of preservation in terms of
300 to 500 years or more.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:08.850
So I think today is a
fine day for Haji Daud,

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.930
for the AMRC, and for Afghanistan.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:15.260
I would like to finish by
showing you a short video

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:19.010
that I put together very quickly
about the digital capturing

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.590 position:56%
and the corresponding metadata logs
that were designed to make this body

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:26.530
of material accessible, to
Africans and non-Afghans alike.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.760
This is just three minutes long,
but hopefully will give you a sense

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.060
of the people and the project.

The Afghan Media Resource Center was
founded Peshawar, Pakistan in 19876.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.290
The goal was to train
Afghan journalists

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.680
to document the Afghan Soviet
war throughout Afghanistan's

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.760
29 provinces.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:03.530 position:56%
Instructors from Boston University
trained over 125 Afghan journalists,

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:05.340
photographers, and video cameramen.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:10.070
Each of the Afghan resistance
parties nominated candidates

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:11.900
for training.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:17.650
Haji Sayed Daud was selected to
be the AMRC project director.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:23.440 position:56%
Video reports produced by the AMRC
were soon broadcast by the BBC, CNN,

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.460
WTN, and other news
syndication outlets in more

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.360 position:56%
than 120 countries around the world.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:35.110
AMRC photographs were distributed
internationally by Sigma,

Photo Agency, and [inaudible] Press.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:41.790
Over seven years the AMRC
accumulated an archive

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:46.280
of approximately 3,000 hours
of videotape, 100,000 negatives

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.750
and slides, and 500 hours
of audio recordings.

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:55.160
This was the largest documentation
of life inside Afghanistan

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.370
from during the Afghan Soviet era.

00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:02.870
In 2011 the U.S. Embassy in Kabul
provided a grant to digitize

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:06.840
and preserve the AMRC video,
photo, and audio archives

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.450
at the Library of Congress.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:13.580
Long-term AMRC project advisors,
Nick Mills and Stephen Olsson,

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:17.140
are tutored at the LOC to
pass on the necessary training

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.030
to the Afghan archivists.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:24.070
Digitization of materials and the
metadata descriptions in Darti,

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.880
Pashto, and English take
over three years to complete.

AMRC archive director, [inaudible],
is joined by his son, [inaudible],

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:38.040
now an Al Jazeera producer who
supervises the digitization

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.090
of this 30 year old video material.

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:44.790
The old, and often dirty, original
tapes require constant cleaning

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:47.710
of the video heads for a
clean digital transfer.

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:52.660
According to the Library of
Congress' precise specifications,

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.730
the metadata for each photo and
video event is logged in English,

00:56:56.730 --> 00:57:00.690
Pashto, Darti, Romanized
Pashto, and Romanized Darti.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:05.630
A copy of all this work will
also be available in Kabul.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.460
The AMRC archive provides
a unique resource

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.250
for understanding Afghanistan and
one of the most important conflicts

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.570
of the last half of
the 20th century.

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:18.840
The preservation of this AMRC
collection will be a great asset

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.450
to scholars, journalists,
and students.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.440
The AMRC archive will now
support historical, cultural,

this unique society and era

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.510

Dr. Mao, Ambassador Hogland,

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:21.920
Ambassador Tomsen, and other
dignitaries and friends,

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.910
good afternoon and thank
you for inviting me

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:28.370
to this warm celebration
on this very rainy day.

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:30.960
It is an honor and a pleasure
for me to be here in support

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.050
of the ultimate success of
the AMRC and its achievement

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:37.730
and its presentation to the
Library of Congress today.

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:40.950
As we -- as has already
been mentioned,

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:46.430
in 1986 the United States
Information Agency, or USIA,

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:50.240
supported the creation of the
Afghan Media Resource Center,

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.190
and with it the creation of one

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:55.930
of Afghanistan's first
independent news agencies.

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:59.730
The AMRC trained journalists
to cover the Soviet occupation,

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.540
and then for years
collective reports

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.450
from all available forms of media.

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:09.230
In 2011 and '12, with the help of
the State Department and others,

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:11.920
the AMRC digitalized this record

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.800
to create what is being
presented here today.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.770
Now a lot of my colleagues

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:23.340
on the panel have already spoken
quite a bit about the significance

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:27.050
to this, but I want to continue on
with that a little bit and mention

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:28.350
that this is quite special

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.370
in that it provides not
only a political narrative

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:34.800
of Afghanistan's past, but also
a glimpse into the human tragedy

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.290
that ensued during and
after this difficult era.

01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:41.750
It is a record made not by
the international community,

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:45.940
but by the Afghan people, of
the Afghan people, and as such,

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:49.500
presents a local perspective
to the world a perspective

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.780
that may not have otherwise
been accessible.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.450
In these days of global and
cross-cultural conflict and strife,

01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:00.080
the value of contextualized
social history cannot

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.250
and should not be underestimated.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:07.130
A lot has changed in
Afghanistan since the days

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:11.590
of the Soviet occupation, and
while conflict is still apparent,

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:15.600
Afghanistan has made remarkable
progress since the partnership

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.370
between our two countries began.

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:20.510
We heard a lot about how this --

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:26.900 position:56%
how the Afghan Media Resource Center
was created and the significance

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.430
and why it was important,
and I appreciate the comments

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:36.210
from my colleagues on the panel
that explained what it was

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.850
like on the ground at that time.

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.730
But I'd like to talk
a little bit of more

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:47.580
about where Afghanistan is right
now and where we're hoping to go.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:52.660
Besides the progress
in the security sector,

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:57.170
Afghanistan civil society
has made leaps and bounds,

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:01.470
progress in democratic development,
economic growth, infrastructure

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:05.910
and transportation, health,
education, and women's empowerment,

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:09.900
Afghanistan's communication
sector has grown exponentially.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:15.920
As of 2015 Afghanistan has
a free and dynamic press

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.170
with over 75 television
stations and 200 radio stations

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:24.580
that together reach over
70% of Afghan households.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:31.370
Household TV ownership has
risen to 58% from 37% in 2007,

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:36.570
and internet use has nearly doubled
in urban areas over the past year.

01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:40.700
Print, electronic, and social media
outlets reflect a range of views,

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:45.880
and while risk remains, there is
increasing space for journalists

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.910
to challenge government
policies and bring attention

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:51.590
to human rights concerns
and to report

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:54.840 position:56%
on instances of corruption or abuse.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.570
Afghanistan has numerous
human rights

01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:01.560 position:56%
and civil society organizations that
bravely do the same, and are working

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.360
to advance and sustain
concrete improvements

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.070
for Afghanistan's people.

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:10.080
And while there is still work
to be done, the changes underway

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.390
in Afghanistan cannot be
measured by numbers alone.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:17.130
Afghanistan is steadily
becoming a country

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.960
where citizens can
celebrate the achievement

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.220
of their own sports teams
on the international stage,

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.760
watch their own television
series, enjoy their own musicians,

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.060
vote for their own leaders,

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.870
and listen to their own
pundits debate public policy.

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:36.780
Our relationship in the years to
come will not be defined by war,

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.610
but by development assistance
and diplomatic support

01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:44.110
to sustain the gains of the past
decade toward a sovereign, stable,

forward to working

with the new Afghan government based
on the principles of mutual respect

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.420
and mutual accountability,
but I want to say a warm

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:01.010
and hearty congratulations
on your fine achievement.

historically rich and textured data,

the archive is perhaps more
importantly a shining beacon

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:12.480

of the Afghan people.

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:11.540
and radio broadcasts,
and sound recordings.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:16.580
And so we are delighted that
he has agreed to include

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:23.050 position:56%
within that large collection of
films the films that came from AMRC.

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:30.870
He has many achievements, which
you will find on the list you have.

01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:34.510 position:56%
And now let us hear from Greg Lukow.

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:39.500
[ Applause ]

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:45.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Greg Lukow: Thank you, Mary-Jane.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.160
Thank you very much.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.460
Thank you all for being here.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.090
On behalf of all of my
colleagues and the staff

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:55.000 position:56%
of the National Audiovisual
Conservation Center, also known here

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.310
at the library as the
Motion Picture Broadcast

01:05:57.310 --> 01:06:01.020
of Recording Sound Division, all
of my colleagues who were involved

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.750
in this project over
the last several years,

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:07.440
it is certainly a great pleasure
to be here with you today

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.780
to celebrate this milestone, the
completion of the digitization

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.960
of the AMRC collection, it's
conveyance to the library

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.660
as a donation, and its
preservation at the Packard Campus

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.700
of the library in Culpeper,
Virginia.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.740
I'm here just to finish putting
in the final brushstrokes

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.560
of the picture that
we've been creating,

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:36.810
or perhaps a more apt metaphor is
the final pixels of the HD video

01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:40.160
that we hope you will all
come away with in your minds

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.730
at the end of this panel.

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:45.680
Our role at the Packard
Campus was basically twofold,

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.140
to help Stephen his
colleagues and technical set

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:53.480
up for the digitization of the
files, and secondly, of course,

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:58.260
the preservation of the digital
collection of the AMRC collection.

01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:02.250
We began working back in
2011 and 2012 with Stephen

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.870
to configure the digitization
workstations.

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:09.620
I think it was a couple of
iMacs that we put together.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:13.400
That was the first time that Apple
had included the Thunderbolt data

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.430
transfer ports and
cables on their iMacs,

01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:20.780
and that greatly facilitated
the process.

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.900
Stephen mentioned one of my
colleagues, James Snyder,

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.500
who is our technical
lead on this project.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:31.420
HE sat down and identified
the digital capture station,

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:36.050 position:56%
the analog to digital converter that
would be hooked up to these iMacs,

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:37.850
and the software that
goes along with it.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:41.090
So he configured and he
tested the workstations

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:45.090
that we ultimately shipped
to Kabul for the AMRC

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:47.140
to digitize all this together.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:50.980
That was actually an important
development for us on our side

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:56.180
as well, because we've used those
systems internally since then.

01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:00.860
We then worked with the AMRC
staff and Mary-Jane's staff

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.530
to configure the metadata.

01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:04.220
You know you're in
a library when three

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.770
of the panelists mention the word
metadata over and over again.

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:09.780
It's very important.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.970
The metadata accompanying all those
digital files that we were going

01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:18.430
to receive from the AMRC would
enable us to ingest the files

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:20.770
into our preservation systems,

01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:23.340
and ultimately will
enable their discovery

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.390
by researchers coming
to the library.

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:31.270
Ultimately we received 44 hard
drives, each one I think was

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:35.100
about three terabytes each,
that were shipped to us

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.320
by Haji Daud and his staff.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.710
We downloaded all the content
from those hard drives,

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:47.620
those 44 hard drives, into our
Packard Campus Data Center,

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.700
our digital archive.

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:55.150 position:56%
Just to repeat the vital statistics,
over 1,200 hours of video,

01:08:55.150 --> 01:09:03.840
357 hours of audio, and
94,652 photographs and slides.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:10.120
Total, 125 terabytes of
digital content were added

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:16.290
to our Packard Campus Data Center,
joining the nearly seven petabytes

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:21.450
of other audiovisual content that
we store at the Packard Campus.

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:25.940
All of the library's audiovisual
content is stored there.

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:30.700
The collection is now securely
preserved at the Packard Campus.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.940
It's backed up as any good
digital archive should be,

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.920
at a mirrored offsite second
location that the library has.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:43.050
All this in addition to the copies
of the materials in the collection

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:48.260
that remain available in
Afghanistan as Haji Daud mentioned.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:51.890
As a next step, we look forward
to collaborating with Mary-Jane

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:56.320
and the -- and her division to
produce the digital access copies

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.020
of the master preservation
files that we're storing

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.920
to make the entire collection
available for onsite access

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.300
by researchers and
[inaudible] reading rooms here,

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.300
like right over there, and in
our Moving Image Research Center

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:13.150
and our Recorded Sound Research
Center which are located

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:15.490
in the library's Madison Building.

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:20.350
For the work that is completed
and all that lies ahead,

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.970
I'd like to acknowledge
a few of my staff,

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:27.730
my colleagues at the Packard
Campus, as Mary-Jane did her staff.

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:30.460
In our Moving Image section,
Mike Michon [assumed spelling]

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.520
and especially Andrea Lee
[assumed spelling], who is the --

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.670
is the head of our process unit
within the Moving Image section.

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:40.460
Similarly, in our Recorded
Sound Section,

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.830
Gene Deana [assumed spelling],
the head of the section,

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:44.130
and Catlin Hunter [assumed
spelling],

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:48.390
the head of the processing unit
and the Recorded Sound Section.

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:51.320
Also, our Technology Office,
Stephen Neise [assumed spelling],

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.140
our chief technology
officer, and most especially,

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.710
I already mentioned James Snyder,
who had been our technical lead

01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:03.340
on this project and collaborated
with Haji and Stephen and others

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.160
on the technical aspects.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:10.600
It has been a great pleasure
to work with Haji Daud and all

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.140
of his colleagues in Kabul,

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.830
some of whom I just saw
pictured for the first time.

01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:17.140
It was actually quite moving.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:22.210
Like Mary-Jane, I saw all
that for the first time.

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:25.270
Haji called to my attention
a couple of his colleagues

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:29.450
that had been instrumental in all
of the technical aspects of this.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:33.710
[inaudible], deputy of the AMRC
and the head of the archive,

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.030
who I think you saw pictured in
the video, as well as [inaudible],

01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:40.830
production manager
and financial officer.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.860
So my thanks to them and to Haji.

01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:47.350
My thanks to Mary-Jane and
her team and the African

01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:49.160
and Middle Eastern Division.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.960
And thanks to all of
you for coming today.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.490
We at the library are
honored to serve as the home

01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:59.270
for the preservation
here in the United States

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:03.860
of this extraordinary collection,
and to serve as, we hope,

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:09.370 position:56%
careful stewards in making these
historic images and sounds available

01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:15.080 position:56%
as living documents to future
generations, not only in Afghanistan

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.960
and in the United States,
but for the world's citizens.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.760
Thank you.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.500
[ Applause ]

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.140
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Different size.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:40.100
It's on. But let us thank this
panel of exceptional people

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.950
and all the people behind them
for the work that they have done.

01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:47.510
So let us give them a hand because
they've done a fantastic job.

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:50.500
[ Applause ]

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:56.010
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
