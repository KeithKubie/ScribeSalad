so when whenever we have a memory about
 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.049
so when whenever we have a memory about
some experience turns out that they're

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059
some experience turns out that they're
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.080
some experience turns out that they're
probably a lot of different systems in

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
probably a lot of different systems in
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.209
probably a lot of different systems in
the brain that are being activated we

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
the brain that are being activated we
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.039

sometimes as scientists we sometimes

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
sometimes as scientists we sometimes
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.620
sometimes as scientists we sometimes
talk about memory systems but I sort of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
talk about memory systems but I sort of
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.830
talk about memory systems but I sort of
think that that's a misnomer because if

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
think that that's a misnomer because if
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.950
think that that's a misnomer because if
you think about what memory is it's it's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
you think about what memory is it's it's
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.370
you think about what memory is it's it's
really plasticity in the nervous system

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
really plasticity in the nervous system
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.050
really plasticity in the nervous system
it's the ability of neurons in the brain

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
it's the ability of neurons in the brain
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.840
it's the ability of neurons in the brain
to change and neurons in every part of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
to change and neurons in every part of
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.459
to change and neurons in every part of
the brain that have ever been looked at

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
the brain that have ever been looked at
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.410
the brain that have ever been looked at
have this capability of changing of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
have this capability of changing of
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170
have this capability of changing of
becoming plastic when their experiences

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180
becoming plastic when their experiences
 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.120
becoming plastic when their experiences
change now from the point of view of a

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130
change now from the point of view of a
 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.750
change now from the point of view of a
neuron and experience is the arrival of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
neuron and experience is the arrival of
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.250
neuron and experience is the arrival of
neurotransmitter being released by

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
neurotransmitter being released by
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.210
neurotransmitter being released by
another neuron so what that does is it

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220
another neuron so what that does is it
 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.720
another neuron so what that does is it
changes the way that neuron responds and

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730
changes the way that neuron responds and
 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.639
changes the way that neuron responds and
across many such events like that in the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
across many such events like that in the
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.340
across many such events like that in the
brain a memory is formed are multiple

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
brain a memory is formed are multiple
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.650
brain a memory is formed are multiple
memories of form so it's really

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
memories of form so it's really
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.360
memories of form so it's really
inappropriate to talk about memory

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
inappropriate to talk about memory
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.149
inappropriate to talk about memory
systems because almost every system in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
systems because almost every system in
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.969
systems because almost every system in
the brain forms memories so what we like

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
the brain forms memories so what we like
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.739
the brain forms memories so what we like
to think about instead or the way I like

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749
to think about instead or the way I like
 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.569
to think about instead or the way I like
to think about is that memory is a

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579
to think about is that memory is a
 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.480
to think about is that memory is a
feature of neurons rather than a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
feature of neurons rather than a
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.669
feature of neurons rather than a
function of brain systems so as

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679
function of brain systems so as
 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.349
function of brain systems so as
information goes through a brain system

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359
information goes through a brain system
 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.809
information goes through a brain system
if that information is significant it

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819
if that information is significant it
 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.899
if that information is significant it
will form a lasting trace as a result of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
will form a lasting trace as a result of
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.179
will form a lasting trace as a result of
the release of the transmitter and the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
the release of the transmitter and the
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.370
the release of the transmitter and the
other things that are going on at that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
other things that are going on at that
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.669
other things that are going on at that
same time will form a trace a connection

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679
same time will form a trace a connection
 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.889
same time will form a trace a connection
between the active neurons and that will

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899
between the active neurons and that will
 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.959
between the active neurons and that will
stay in the brain in the form of what we

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969
stay in the brain in the form of what we
 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.480
stay in the brain in the form of what we
then experience as memory later now

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
then experience as memory later now
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.249
then experience as memory later now
let's take a situation where you're

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
let's take a situation where you're
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.830
let's take a situation where you're
driving down the road and you have an

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
driving down the road and you have an
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.300
driving down the road and you have an
accident you hit your head on the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
accident you hit your head on the
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.739
accident you hit your head on the
steering wheel and you hit it really

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749
steering wheel and you hit it really
 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.870
steering wheel and you hit it really
hard and the horn gets stuck on and so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
hard and the horn gets stuck on and so
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510
hard and the horn gets stuck on and so
you hear this loud annoying noise while

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
you hear this loud annoying noise while
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609
you hear this loud annoying noise while
you're bleeding and pain it's really

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
you're bleeding and pain it's really
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.980
you're bleeding and pain it's really
awful and terrible and then a few days

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
awful and terrible and then a few days
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.559
awful and terrible and then a few days
later you hear the sound of a horn so

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569
later you hear the sound of a horn so
 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.529
later you hear the sound of a horn so
that sound will go to various parts of

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539
that sound will go to various parts of
 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.899
that sound will go to various parts of
your brain simultaneously when it goes

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
your brain simultaneously when it goes
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.370
your brain simultaneously when it goes
to a part of the brain called the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
to a part of the brain called the
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.050
to a part of the brain called the
hippocampus it will remind you of the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
hippocampus it will remind you of the
 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.670
hippocampus it will remind you of the
the situation that you're in that you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
the situation that you're in that you
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.740
the situation that you're in that you
were driving you had an accident that

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750
were driving you had an accident that
 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.670
were driving you had an accident that
you were with John and PEG but you won't

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680
you were with John and PEG but you won't
 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.309
you were with John and PEG but you won't
know it won't have the emotional impact

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319
know it won't have the emotional impact
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.290
know it won't have the emotional impact
unless it also goes to a different part

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300
unless it also goes to a different part
 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.839
unless it also goes to a different part
of the brain called the amygdala which

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849
of the brain called the amygdala which
 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.550
of the brain called the amygdala which
instead of reminding you of the details

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560
instead of reminding you of the details
 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.890
instead of reminding you of the details
of the event will trigger emotional

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900
of the event will trigger emotional
 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.320
of the event will trigger emotional
responses in your brain and body and the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330
responses in your brain and body and the
 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.910
responses in your brain and body and the
ones in the body will feed back to the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
ones in the body will feed back to the
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.250
ones in the body will feed back to the
brain and all of that activity in the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260
brain and all of that activity in the
 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.400
brain and all of that activity in the
brain will give rise to what we call the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410
brain will give rise to what we call the
 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.220
brain will give rise to what we call the
emotion so back to the the fear example

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
emotion so back to the the fear example
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.530
emotion so back to the the fear example
the sound of the horn goes to one part

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
the sound of the horn goes to one part
 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.940
the sound of the horn goes to one part
of the brain the amygdala and gives rise

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950
of the brain the amygdala and gives rise
 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.949
of the brain the amygdala and gives rise
to the emotional response to the other

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959
to the emotional response to the other
 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.660
to the emotional response to the other
part of the brain the hippocampus and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670
part of the brain the hippocampus and
 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.400
part of the brain the hippocampus and
gives rise to the cognitive

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410
gives rise to the cognitive
 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.410
gives rise to the cognitive
representation so we call the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420
representation so we call the
 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.440
representation so we call the
hippocampal memory a memory about the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
hippocampal memory a memory about the
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.690
hippocampal memory a memory about the
emotion whereas the amygdala memory

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700
emotion whereas the amygdala memory
 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.440
emotion whereas the amygdala memory
recall the emotional memory itself now

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
recall the emotional memory itself now
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.610
recall the emotional memory itself now
these two things happen simultaneously

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620
these two things happen simultaneously
 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.009
these two things happen simultaneously
the amygdala memory is triggered

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019
the amygdala memory is triggered
 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.740
the amygdala memory is triggered
unconsciously it don't have to be aware

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
unconsciously it don't have to be aware
 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.240
unconsciously it don't have to be aware
of the stimulus in order for that to be

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
of the stimulus in order for that to be
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.210
of the stimulus in order for that to be
triggered hippocampal memory is probably

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220
triggered hippocampal memory is probably
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.099
triggered hippocampal memory is probably
triggered unconsciously as well but you

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109
triggered unconsciously as well but you
 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.229
triggered unconsciously as well but you
become aware of the memory when it's

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239
become aware of the memory when it's
 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.289
become aware of the memory when it's
triggered because of the but that's what

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299
triggered because of the but that's what
 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.270
triggered because of the but that's what
I hippocampal memory does is it creates

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280
I hippocampal memory does is it creates
 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.370
I hippocampal memory does is it creates
a representation in conscious experience

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380
a representation in conscious experience
 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.490
a representation in conscious experience
but that conscious representation now is

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500
but that conscious representation now is
 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.199
but that conscious representation now is
going to be amplified by the emotional

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209
going to be amplified by the emotional
 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.090
going to be amplified by the emotional
arousal that's taking place which is

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100
arousal that's taking place which is
 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.740
arousal that's taking place which is
going to create a new emotional memory

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750
going to create a new emotional memory
 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.289
going to create a new emotional memory
or new memory about emotion that's going

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299
or new memory about emotion that's going
 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.210
or new memory about emotion that's going
to have that kind of emotional stamp on

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220
to have that kind of emotional stamp on
 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.430
to have that kind of emotional stamp on
it so it's the interaction between

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440
it so it's the interaction between
 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.920
it so it's the interaction between
cognitive systems and emotion systems in

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930
cognitive systems and emotion systems in
 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.960
cognitive systems and emotion systems in
the brain that create what's called

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970
the brain that create what's called
 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.509
the brain that create what's called
sometimes flashbulb memories which are

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519
sometimes flashbulb memories which are
 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.940
sometimes flashbulb memories which are
very vivid strong memories of a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950
very vivid strong memories of a
 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.740
very vivid strong memories of a
particular experience everyone my age

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750
particular experience everyone my age
 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.840
particular experience everyone my age
remembers the assassination of John

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850
remembers the assassination of John
 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.300
remembers the assassination of John
Kennedy in the six days remember where

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310
Kennedy in the six days remember where
 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.650
Kennedy in the six days remember where
we were what we're doing all of those

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660
we were what we're doing all of those
 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.660
we were what we're doing all of those
gory details now it used to be thought

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670
gory details now it used to be thought
 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.210
gory details now it used to be thought
that these flashbulb memories were more

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220
that these flashbulb memories were more
 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.979
that these flashbulb memories were more
accurate than other memories but new

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989
accurate than other memories but new
 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.470
accurate than other memories but new
research by list helps my colleague at

NYU and other researchers who study

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459
NYU and other researchers who study
 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.550
NYU and other researchers who study
humans have shown that these flashbulb

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560
humans have shown that these flashbulb
 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.530
humans have shown that these flashbulb
memories are not more accurate they're

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540
memories are not more accurate they're
 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.319
memories are not more accurate they're
just more vivid so the accuracy is is

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329
just more vivid so the accuracy is is
 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.610
just more vivid so the accuracy is is
kind of suspect and one of the

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
kind of suspect and one of the
 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.020
kind of suspect and one of the
consequences of one of the implications

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030
consequences of one of the implications
 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.280
consequences of one of the implications
of that is that memories are constructed

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290
of that is that memories are constructed
 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.320
of that is that memories are constructed
are reconstructed when they're retrieved

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
are reconstructed when they're retrieved
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.510
are reconstructed when they're retrieved
and at that point of retrieval the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520
and at that point of retrieval the
 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.670
and at that point of retrieval the
memory has the opportunity to be changed

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680
memory has the opportunity to be changed
 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.860
memory has the opportunity to be changed
and that's one of the main topics we've

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870
and that's one of the main topics we've
 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.020
and that's one of the main topics we've
been working on lately is how memory has

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030
been working on lately is how memory has
 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.690
been working on lately is how memory has
changed when it's retrieved

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700
 
 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.640
 
so a good example of the chain the way

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650
so a good example of the chain the way
 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.250
so a good example of the chain the way
memory changes during the retrieval

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260
memory changes during the retrieval
 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.090
memory changes during the retrieval
process is a situation where someone

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100
process is a situation where someone
 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.640
process is a situation where someone
goes to court to testify about a crime

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650
goes to court to testify about a crime
 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.340
goes to court to testify about a crime
that they witness and on the day of the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350
that they witness and on the day of the
 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.540
that they witness and on the day of the
crime they you know gay they gave their

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550
crime they you know gay they gave their
 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.680
crime they you know gay they gave their
summary of what happened to the police

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690
summary of what happened to the police
 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.660
summary of what happened to the police
so there's a police record at the time

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670
so there's a police record at the time
 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.970
so there's a police record at the time
and then when they go into the court

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980
and then when they go into the court
 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.900
and then when they go into the court
they talk about something completely

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910
they talk about something completely
 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.840
they talk about something completely
different which it turns out happens to

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850
different which it turns out happens to
 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.490
different which it turns out happens to
match well they read about in the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500
match well they read about in the
 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.280
match well they read about in the
newspaper and so when they read the

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290
newspaper and so when they read the
 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.290
newspaper and so when they read the
newspaper what they did was they updated

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
newspaper what they did was they updated
 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.290
newspaper what they did was they updated
their memory about the experience and

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300
their memory about the experience and
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.360
their memory about the experience and
then in the future when you retrieve

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370
then in the future when you retrieve
 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.850
then in the future when you retrieve
that memory it's hard to distinguish you

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860
that memory it's hard to distinguish you
 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.160
that memory it's hard to distinguish you
know what actually happened and what

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170
know what actually happened and what
 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.530
know what actually happened and what
you've incorporated since and through

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540
you've incorporated since and through
 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.810
you've incorporated since and through
other kinds of experiences this is now

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820
other kinds of experiences this is now
 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.510
other kinds of experiences this is now
well-known phenomenon that each time a

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520
well-known phenomenon that each time a
 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.760
well-known phenomenon that each time a
memory is taken out the opportunity is

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770
memory is taken out the opportunity is
 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.710
memory is taken out the opportunity is
there for it to be changed and normally

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720
there for it to be changed and normally
 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.530
there for it to be changed and normally
this is an updating process and it's a

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540
this is an updating process and it's a
 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.230
this is an updating process and it's a
useful thing do you meet somebody at a

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240
useful thing do you meet somebody at a
 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.870
useful thing do you meet somebody at a
party and inserts a nice guy then you

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880
party and inserts a nice guy then you
 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.190
party and inserts a nice guy then you
find out he's an axe murderer or

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200
find out he's an axe murderer or
 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.600
find out he's an axe murderer or
something like that you have to you know

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610
something like that you have to you know
 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.340
something like that you have to you know
immediately change your memory of that

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350
immediately change your memory of that
 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.240
immediately change your memory of that
person so you've updated it but in the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250
person so you've updated it but in the
 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.100
person so you've updated it but in the
in the case there are other ways that

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110
in the case there are other ways that
 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.870
in the case there are other ways that
memory gets updated as well which is

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880
memory gets updated as well which is
 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.430
memory gets updated as well which is
that um let's go back to the example of

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440
that um let's go back to the example of
 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.350
that um let's go back to the example of
fear conditioning in the rats so we

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360
fear conditioning in the rats so we
 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.600
fear conditioning in the rats so we
conditioned a rap to be afraid of the

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610
conditioned a rap to be afraid of the
 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.270
conditioned a rap to be afraid of the
tone so the next day he hears the tone

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280
tone so the next day he hears the tone
 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.190
tone so the next day he hears the tone
and he freezes because that's how rats

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200
and he freezes because that's how rats
 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.520
and he freezes because that's how rats
expressed their fear of stimulus but if

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530
expressed their fear of stimulus but if
 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.310
expressed their fear of stimulus but if
immediately after presenting that tone

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320
immediately after presenting that tone
 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.550
immediately after presenting that tone
we give the rat a certain kind of drug

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560
we give the rat a certain kind of drug
 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.920
we give the rat a certain kind of drug
which I'll explain later and we test the

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930
which I'll explain later and we test the
 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.020
which I'll explain later and we test the
rat the next day the memory is no longer

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030
rat the next day the memory is no longer
 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.900
rat the next day the memory is no longer
present or at least can't be accessed so

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910
present or at least can't be accessed so
 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.350
present or at least can't be accessed so
what's going on well it's been known for

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360
what's going on well it's been known for
 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.050
what's going on well it's been known for
a long time that memory formation our

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060
a long time that memory formation our
 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.960
a long time that memory formation our
memory consolidation requires the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970
memory consolidation requires the
 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.120
memory consolidation requires the
synthesis of new proteins in the parts

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130
synthesis of new proteins in the parts
 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.160
synthesis of new proteins in the parts
of the brain that are forming the memory

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170
of the brain that are forming the memory
 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.850
of the brain that are forming the memory
so other researchers discovered then

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860
so other researchers discovered then
 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.210
so other researchers discovered then
that memory that if you block protein

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220
that memory that if you block protein
 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.980
that memory that if you block protein
synthesis after retrieval you can also

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990
synthesis after retrieval you can also
 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.680
synthesis after retrieval you can also
disrupt the stability of the memory

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690
disrupt the stability of the memory
 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.580
disrupt the stability of the memory
later

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590
later
 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.470
later
but that idea kind of got lost in the

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480
but that idea kind of got lost in the
 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.050
but that idea kind of got lost in the
late 60s and didn't stick around what

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060
late 60s and didn't stick around what
 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.940
late 60s and didn't stick around what
stuck around was the idea that memories

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950
stuck around was the idea that memories
 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.830
stuck around was the idea that memories
are consolidated and once they're

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840
are consolidated and once they're
 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.780
are consolidated and once they're
consolidated each time you take it out

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790
consolidated each time you take it out
 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.300
consolidated each time you take it out
you take out that same trace over and

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310
you take out that same trace over and
 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.660
you take out that same trace over and
over again so the the new research which

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.670
over again so the the new research which
 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.290
over again so the the new research which
my lab to help sort of rejuvenate in the

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300
my lab to help sort of rejuvenate in the
 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:21.120
my lab to help sort of rejuvenate in the
year 2000 was about manipulating the

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130
year 2000 was about manipulating the
 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.150
year 2000 was about manipulating the
memory after the route experiences the

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160
memory after the route experiences the
 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.670
memory after the route experiences the
retrieval process so we give the wrap

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680
retrieval process so we give the wrap
 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.890
retrieval process so we give the wrap
the tone and then we block protein

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900
the tone and then we block protein
 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.620
the tone and then we block protein
synthesis after retrieval rather than

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630
synthesis after retrieval rather than
 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.840
synthesis after retrieval rather than
after learning and when we do that again

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850
after learning and when we do that again
 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.140
after learning and when we do that again
the memory is eliminated just as well

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150
the memory is eliminated just as well
 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.270
the memory is eliminated just as well
after retrieval as it is as it's

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280
after retrieval as it is as it's
 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.830

synthesis so the unique feature of our

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990
synthesis so the unique feature of our
 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.750
synthesis so the unique feature of our
experiment was we were able to do this

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:48.760
experiment was we were able to do this
 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.940
experiment was we were able to do this
in the side of the brain where the

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:50.950
in the side of the brain where the
 

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.860
in the side of the brain where the
memory is being formed and stored which

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:52.870
memory is being formed and stored which
 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.360

in the case of fear conditioning memory
 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.630
in the case of fear conditioning memory
is the the amygdala so because we had

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.640
is the the amygdala so because we had
 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.580
is the the amygdala so because we had
done all the the basic work of figuring

00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.590
done all the the basic work of figuring
 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.050
done all the the basic work of figuring
out those circuits we could go in and

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.060
out those circuits we could go in and
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.660
out those circuits we could go in and
put a tiny amount of a protein synthesis

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:03.670
put a tiny amount of a protein synthesis
 

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.180
put a tiny amount of a protein synthesis
inhibitor in the amygdala and that's

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.190
inhibitor in the amygdala and that's
 

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.070
inhibitor in the amygdala and that's
important because you can also do this

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080
important because you can also do this
 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.710
important because you can also do this
experiment by giving the protein

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720

you do if you take a pill that goes into

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:17.320
you do if you take a pill that goes into
 

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.870
you do if you take a pill that goes into
your body and reaches your brain and

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:18.880

everywhere that's why many drugs have

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:22.480
everywhere that's why many drugs have
 

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.600
everywhere that's why many drugs have
side effects so if you take an

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:24.610
side effects so if you take an
 

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.360
side effects so if you take an
anti-anxiety drug it not only relieves

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.370
anti-anxiety drug it not only relieves
 

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.250
anti-anxiety drug it not only relieves
anxiety but it makes you sleepy might

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.260
anxiety but it makes you sleepy might
 

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.580
anxiety but it makes you sleepy might
alter your sex drive blah blah blah so

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:31.590
alter your sex drive blah blah blah so

the bad consequences of protein
 

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.470
the bad consequences of protein
synthesis inhibitors which is it makes

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:37.480
synthesis inhibitors which is it makes
 

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.540
synthesis inhibitors which is it makes
you nauseous and sick and so forth if

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:39.550
you nauseous and sick and so forth if
 

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.930
you nauseous and sick and so forth if
you take it systemically and it is

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:42.940
you take it systemically and it is
 

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.640
you take it systemically and it is
pretty toxic so you've never give a drug

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:44.650
pretty toxic so you've never give a drug
 

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.470
pretty toxic so you've never give a drug
like that to a human this is only

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480
like that to a human this is only
 

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.330
like that to a human this is only
something you can do in an animal

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.340
something you can do in an animal
 

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.560
something you can do in an animal
experiment so the protein synthesis

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:52.570
experiment so the protein synthesis
 

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.420
experiment so the protein synthesis
inhibitor in our study so is put

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:54.430
inhibitor in our study so is put
 

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.250
inhibitor in our study so is put
directly in the amygdala and we avoid

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.260
directly in the amygdala and we avoid
 

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.560
directly in the amygdala and we avoid
all those side effects and negative

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:58.570
all those side effects and negative
 

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.260
all those side effects and negative
consequences since it's a tiny amount it

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:01.270
consequences since it's a tiny amount it
 

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.720
consequences since it's a tiny amount it
doesn't affect the rest of the body so

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:03.730
doesn't affect the rest of the body so
 

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.430
doesn't affect the rest of the body so
when we do that through the the rats the

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440
when we do that through the the rats the
 

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.049
when we do that through the the rats the
next day don't freeze to the tone

00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:07.059
next day don't freeze to the tone
 

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:08.969
next day don't freeze to the tone
remember that the tone is now dangerous

00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:08.979
remember that the tone is now dangerous
 

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:10.979
remember that the tone is now dangerous
so this has triggered a whole wave of

00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:10.989
so this has triggered a whole wave of
 

00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:13.829
so this has triggered a whole wave of
research now on the possibility of using

00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839
research now on the possibility of using
 

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:15.629
research now on the possibility of using
this as a treatment for post-traumatic

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:15.639
this as a treatment for post-traumatic
 

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:17.999
this as a treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder because you know

snakes called water moccasins and we
 

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.250
snakes called water moccasins and we
used to go waterskiing all the time in

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.260
used to go waterskiing all the time in
 

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.100
used to go waterskiing all the time in
every waterskiing spot as this legend of

so i was a really good water-skier

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:58.910
so i was a really good water-skier
 

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.390
so i was a really good water-skier
because i learned to ski without getting

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:01.400
because i learned to ski without getting
 

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.570
because i learned to ski without getting
wet so i would stand up stand on the

wet so i would stand up stand on the
 

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.680
wet so i would stand up stand on the
pier and the boat would take it off i

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:05.690
pier and the boat would take it off i

just jump in on the skis and ski around
 

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.870
just jump in on the skis and ski around
and then just ski back up on the land so

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880
and then just ski back up on the land so
 

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.430
and then just ski back up on the land so

but I you know I don't really worry
 

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.980
but I you know I don't really worry
about snakes anymore I today I when I
