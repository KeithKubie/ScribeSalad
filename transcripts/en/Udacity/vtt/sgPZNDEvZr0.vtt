00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.820
Now that we know the LCD for this complex fraction, we can multiply the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.310
numerator and the denominator by the LCD. We want to make sure we multiply this

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.419
entire numerator by 8x, and this entire denominator by 8x. We do this since

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.322
we're really multiplying by a form of one. So what do you think would be the

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:23.512
product of this multiplication? I want you to write the product for the

00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:27.940
numerator here and the product for the denominator here. Keep in mind you should

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.133
have two terms for your numerator and two terms for your denominator. Good luck.
