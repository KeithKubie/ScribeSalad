Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, hi, this is Jad. Hi. Yay. To meet Jad. And I am Robert. And today's story started when we bumped into an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Well, you're a little bit weirded out as to why we are calling you. Yes, I know. You know what I mean? I just don't understand the whole thing. That story really gets going with a phone call to this woman, Elizabeth Mason. I'm receptionist, last Swissport operator. She works at a research lab in Boston. And one day she's sitting in her desk and she gets a call from a woman who says that she has donated some eyes to them and she wants to know what happened to them.

Speaker 1:          00:36          Call you going every day. I just remember it was just very unusual, right? And to say I didn't know what to do with it. I just felt like I gotta find somebody to help this woman. Today we're going to tell you the story of the, of the woman on the other end of that phone call. This is her story. You might say their story. So for my title, should I say, um, I'm Sarah Gray. I'm the mom. I'm Ross Gray, scree Thomas's dad. And how did you guys meet while we're waiting there and our bar in Glasgow. Really? Yeah. It was on vacation with a girlfriend and a and was it, uh, was it a, was it, uh, what, what, what happened without getting into too many? I think we've got different ideas and different recollection of what happened. But,

Speaker 2:          01:15          well you started dating across the ocean for a year and a half and then he moved to America five days after you arrived. They were married a few years after that. They were pregnant with twins. And when did you first know that something was up? It was at the 12 week screening. They call it the first trimester screening and they're checking for birth defects. I think the most common one is down syndrome. But it was September 30th, 2009 they went in for the screening. The ultrasound tech took a scan of the two fetuses and shortly after the doc came into the room and said that only one of the twins would make it in one of the twins that in unsafely and would die within a few minutes or hours were being born. And he said he could see that because one of the twins had around skull and the other one had a bumpy skull. Huh.

Speaker 2:          02:05          But the bumpy skull showed him that this goal wasn't correct. It wasn't round enough. The brain and skull weren't forming properly, which is what anencephaly is. But for shock, obviously. Yeah. Um, I couldn't believe that. Yeah. It's Kinda, it's difficult to process it, I think. You think, yeah, that can't be right. They've just told us it's identical twins, but one of them is completely different from the other difficult fiction. Ultimately making matters worse. The doctors said that the unhealthy twin was posing a threat to the healthy twin, and if we were to be safe, we would do a selective termination to save the life of the healthy twin. Hmm. So Sarah says they were suddenly faced with this choice. I actually docked to two priests on the phone about it. Really? Yeah. Her family's Catholic. She was raised Catholic. I Dunno, I guess I wanted to see what, what their take was on this.

Speaker 2:          02:51          Yeah. This is probably not the direction we want to go to for this my radio story, but no man suddenly interested in, basically what I was saying is would you come and do a blessing over the selection determination and what they say? One priest said, no, he just said he wouldn't do a blessing over a selective termination. And then the other priest said that because of a Thomas Aquinas rule of like, I think it was called double account or something, basically like the rule that if you, if a train is coming and you like you want to save the life of someone on the train tracks and you shoot the driver, that's the right thing to do. After looking it up, it's actually called the doctrine of double effect. And uh, she's basically right. Maybe not the part about the shooting the driver, but the overall idea is that if you're trying to do good and on the way to doing good, you must inadvertently do some harm.

Speaker 2:          03:45          It's okay in certain circumstances, as long as your intentions are good. Anyway, the priest said, because you're doing this with the intent of saving the healthy twin that he would be there and he would do a blessing. Fast forward a few weeks we'd booked a hotel and we'd packed her bags and the night before was really terrible for both of us cause I dunno, we had seen him on the screen and we sort of were attached to this little kid. Next day they go in for the procedure, we go into the room and the doctor puts the um, sonogram on me and start getting ready and he said, your placenta has moved since the last time you were here and the location where it is right now. Um, I don't think we should do this. He said, if I nick it, if I, if I even just nick it a little bit like you're going to bleed uncontrollably and this is not safe to do.

Speaker 1:          04:37          You said they wouldn't do it on his wife either. What was that like to be on the, on the table you've gone to leave? Was it relief? Really? Yeah, it was a relief. I guess we've in the elevator we just hugged. You were like, Oh, I think the decision is taken at your hands, you know, so it's not our fault. But then your healthy twin is more at risk maybe. Yes. It was like a nail biter for the rest of the six months. And according to Ross, those six months were deeply strange just by, in one of everything. When you know those two babies coming, then we knew we're going to be having a funeral as well. So, you know, I called the, um, what'd you call it? The funeral director and told them, you know, we're going to be having a funeral. And like, well, when was the death and all the guys not even born yet, you know, but I know. All right. So they get to the day of March 23rd 23rd 2010 10:30 AM

Speaker 2:          05:28          Thomas came out first and he's the sick one that had anencephaly and then a minute later column came out. I know it wasn't sure if Thomas was going to be born alive. I sort of expected him to die within a few minutes, but

Speaker 1:          05:40          it was, he was struggling at first when he came at it, they didn't think he was going to last too long, but then he kind of rally rally. Then he was doing pretty good. And then

Speaker 2:          05:48          Lee, it was then Callum, the healthy twin, who started to have some trouble at the beginning. And so he and Sarah went off to the infant ICU. And so Ross says in the delivery room,

Speaker 1:          05:58          no, it was just me and Thomas for quite a while. I see. We're just sitting together. What was that like?

Speaker 3:          06:03          Right. It was,

Speaker 1:          06:06          it was like, you know, it was cute. You know, he's a little slim Brian, you baby. You know what I mean? They cry, but he was like, grab it onto my finger and oh no, it didn't. The kind of things that babies do, you know, there's nothing you can do, but just kind of give him a cuddle, you know, and try and try and stop and cry crying and [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:24          I n I remember coming to the recovery room and Ross had this little bundle in his arms and I said, who is that? And he said, Thomas. And I said, he's alive. And I'm like, Oh, let me hold him. And so I held him and yeah, he was cute. Like he breastfed and we could feed him with the bottle. They ended up taking him home. I didn't really planned on that. Like we didn't have another car seat. Um, we just didn't think of that. And I remember thinking like, what if he's going to beat the odds? Like, do we need to arrange daycare? And like, you know, we hadn't thought of that.

Speaker 1:          06:54          It seems all right and we could hang in here for awhile, you know.

Speaker 2:          06:57          But then soon after Thomas started having seizures, he started having trouble breathing, stopped eating. And at the time I remember thinking, you know what, come on little guy, like just eat some more. Like if you eat some more than you'll be stronger. And I was like, just eat. Just eat.

Speaker 3:          07:13          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:14          Well, so, uh, how, how, how long did Thomas live in the end? Six days. Six days. He died in Ross's arms and he was surrounded by all of the people that loved him. And then right then we called the Washington regional transplant community and they sent a van over to our house and they picked up his body and took him to d c um, children's national medical center.

Speaker 3:          07:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:43          okay. So this is where, uh, the story really gets going? I guess so, yeah. How did that idea of donating his organs, skin come into your head?

Speaker 1:          07:51          Do you see an article in the paper, the newspaper article or something?

Speaker 2:          07:54          Yeah, my mom saw an article about a baby who had an huffily who donated liver cells and most major religions support organ donation. Oh, okay. So the van came, picked up, Thomas. Uh, what happened next?

Speaker 1:          08:08          Nothing happened. Nothing stood up. Follow up for a long time. You know, I think there's some letter we got left letter in the mail, I guess

Speaker 2:          08:15          sorta a form letter. It basically said thank you for your generous donation. Thomas's a cornea [inaudible] sent to this place in Boston where they study a potential cure for blindness and his liver had been sent at this place in Durham, North Carolina, where they study a ways to treat uh, liver disease. It seemed generic to me cause I thought, I want to know like, like who ordered it? Which researcher got it and what study are they working on? But you know, they went on with their lives because they had this new baby Callum Terez. So they put it behind them for the most part. But then Sarah says they got to the one year anniversary, one year anniversary. Yeah, sure. We felt like a big moment to me. Like that's when I can, that's when it stops being in the present and it can being in the past, you know, just explaining it to people.

Speaker 2:          08:57          He's, I can say it was a year ago, so they don't have to feel stressed out when they talk to me. And it felt like a big deal. Like I think we were going to go to the cemetery and put some flowers on his grave and I wanted to tell my family what were the results of his donation. So she called the donor family services person at the place that picked up Thomas's body and she basically asked them like, is there any more information you can give us about the specific study or the researcher of something was published and they didn't have any. So I just thought, okay, well I tried, you know, but she couldn't quite let it go. What do you mean she couldn't quite let it go, you know, curiosity. But also think she was having on some level, like a big conversation with the universe.

Speaker 2:          09:42          They both were like, this terrible thing happened. How do you explain it to yourself? I mean, I think honestly it's shorter. It sort of shook my faith in God and how the universe works. I thought that Karma worked or if I was a basically a good person and I've obeyed the rules, good things would happen to me. Whatever the reason, these thoughts about Thomas and where he ended up, they were just there. She had no real opportunity to act on it, so they would just kind of come in and out of her mind. But then around the two year anniversary, so this is now a year later, I had a business trip to Boston and I was exhibiting at a conference at Heinz Convention Center and I googled it and I saw that Skype bins, eye research institute was just a few miles away. That's where Thomas' corneas had been said, ah, lunch break.

Speaker 2:          10:27          That's exactly what I did. I called Skype ins and I said, you know, I donated my son's eyes to this lab a couple of years ago and I'm here in town. Is there any chance I can come by for a tour for like 10 minutes? Then with the weird, been a weird phone call. Yes. I mean, yes. Yeah, that was like a wake her up or that's Elizabeth Mason again. It was just very unusual. I think she was surprised. I didn't know what to do with it. Had you ever gotten a call like that before? Never have gotten in the car and just been working there for 25 years. She said, hold on, let me connect you to the right person. Don't hang up. A lot of times when I say something they hang up on me. So I said please help line y started searching for someone to speak with.

Speaker 2:          11:07          It's going to take me a while cause I've got to figure out who that is but don't hang up. And they connected me with someone in donor relations but it was financial donor relations. Oh like like the honey. Yeah, organ donor. But they, cause they don't have any other donor relations that you know, like that was the person that gives the tours and deals with the public so that she got to talk to me and she was [inaudible]. The woman was a little bit flustered but super nice and said, we know we've never done this before. But yeah, come on down. We'll give you a tour. I was so excited. I took pictures of the outside of the building and I felt, I stood in the lobby and I put one of the brochures in my purse and I just felt like, I can't believe I'm here.

Speaker 2:          11:52          This is like being in [inaudible] workshop or something. Like I didn't think this was a place you could actually visit. She was taken around and eventually she got taken to the lab where Thomas' corneas went and there were refrigerators with signs that said no food. And then she introduced me to this guy called Dr. James [inaudible] who's a professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Med school and he was eating his lunch at his desk and she explained who I was and he said, you know, thank you for the donation and do you have any questions for me? And of course she did. I wanted to know how valuable the eyes were. Like if they get thousands and thousands or if they get one or two or like when the delivery came. Was everyone excited or was it no big deal? Like was it sitting on a shelf collecting dust or were people doing stuff with it? He put down his lunch and um, he said most of the i's that we get are from people who are older just because most people are older when they die, an infant's eyes are worth their weight in gold.

Speaker 3:          12:49          Wow.

Speaker 2:          12:50          I was like, God, I could barely speak. I was like, um, could you tell me why? He said, because they regenerate the regenerative properties and he said, if you don't mind me asking, how long ago did your son die? And I said about two years ago. And he said, well, we're likely still using your sons cells right now.

Speaker 3:          13:09          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:10          Cause that's how long they last.

Speaker 3:          13:12          Wow. I know.

Speaker 2:          13:15          So at that point Sarah was like, okay, since that worked out so well, why not just go keep going with it and visit all of the places where bits and pieces of Thomas ended up. So, you know, chase down his liver, his retina, his cord blood. How many doctors might that be? Do you have any idea? Like, well there's the Boston one, there's two in North Carolina. She would ultimately discover one in Richmond, Virginia, one in Philly. What if? What if? It turns out that these people, you know, didn't find anything. You know, research is research. You don't always have a head. That's true. She's not hitting for validation necessarily. Here. She might find it. She might get further lost. Well, yeah, but she's going to go. She's going to go and she's not going to stop. Cross your fingers. It's coming up.

Speaker 2:          15:24          watch just moments before the shooting that meant 2016 and I'm to black man shot by police.

Speaker 7:          15:31          Jim was a mental health worker who was trying to return and autistic patient to a group home

Speaker 2:          15:38          host of after effect, a podcast from w n YC studios police. We're trying to shoot the other guy, the Latino autistic man. This is his story. Listen and subscribe to after effect wherever you get your podcasts.

Speaker 8:          15:52          Yes.

Speaker 2:          15:58          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich. Uh, this is radio. Where are we at this point? Okay. Yeah. So Sarah, Greg, when we left her, she was standing in a research office in Boston and feeling good. Yeah, she's gotten this rose of a success. And so after that her and Ross had getting a car and head down south to Durham, North Carolina to track down a Thomas's liver and a bit of his blood cord blood because it turns out that in the delivery room right after both twins were born, nurses had withdrawn a little bit of cord blood from both twins, sent it off to Duke where researchers were studying the disease that killed Thomas and incessantly. She says they walked in, we met the study coordinator, this guy who worked on the human genome project, uh, Grad students. They met all these different researchers who all seemed really excited about her twins blood samples.

Speaker 2:          16:42          I think it was just weird that one of them had anencephaly and one of them didn't and they were genetically identical. So it's a good control study for them to compare. After they all took the tour, one of the researchers even told them that they had compared Thomas' blood to columns and they found there were a thousand differences in epigenetics between both twins. They're called epigenetic differences. I think their genes are the same. But the things that control the genes were different. That's so interesting. So they began identical, but then somehow in utero thousand little changes crept up between them. Yes. Yeah. It's possible that a few of those changes might one day explain the disease. In fact, I even asked the Grad student who worked on it most closely Dierdre crop, I said, were you surprised by what you saw? And she said, for me to be surprised, that implies that I knew what to expect. She said, well, just at the beginning of this, trying to learn about this.

Speaker 2:          17:37          So that's two roses, like this is a, this is an amazing gift visit to sort of kickbox. She's on a roll here. So after visit two, they got in the car, drove down the street to this place called Cyto Net, which is where Thomas has liver. I ended up basically side on it, will take a solid liver and they liquefy it and then they inject the liquid liver into a baby that's waiting on a liver transplant as a bridge therapy. Liquid liver, liver in a tube. Yeah. They went in and got a tour. Refrigerators, petri dishes, the whole thing. The researchers then tell her that they had a little issue with Thomas's liver. His liver was bruised when they got it so they couldn't inject it into a baby. But then they told her that they were able to use it in an experiment to determine what was the best temperature to freeze infant liver cells, which is negative 150 degrees Celsius as you already know, common knowledge, half a rose there, half a rose and she says at one point as they were being walked around the place, we walked through the break room and someone had taken a picture of Thomas that we had handed out and they took the photograph and they taped it up in the break room with a little sign that they wrote on at St Thomas Gray was a donor here in March 29th, 2010 and I was so excited to see that because I thought they're just as curious about us as we are about them.

Speaker 2:          18:54          Like I was wondering who, what kind of person goes to work and opens up a box with liver in it. And they're probably wondering what kind of person takes their loved one's liver and puts it in a box and mailed it over here.

Speaker 8:          19:04          So, uh, my name is [inaudible] Ganguly. Uh, I am a professor in the Department of Genetics at University of Pennsylvania School of medicine.

Speaker 2:          19:14          Now a Rupa Ganguly just switched to her for a second. She studies a kind of cancer of the eye called Retinal Blastoma, which happens almost exclusively in children. And at this point she doesn't know Sarah. She has no concept of this whole search that's happening. She is just studying eyes. Where are we by the way? Philly, Philly, Philadelphia. No, she studies tumors, but she also needs healthy retinas in order to do her work.

Speaker 8:          19:36          Now you can imagine that getting a normal retina is not a very, uh, easy task because why would you get a normal retina from a baby? I must allude that if and when an eyeball comes, it is not a pleasant experience, right? Because for a moment you have to think the origin, the sources of this eyeball, and it's sad and every possible setting, it's sad, sad and frustrating. She says, because only when a normal child dies, that's when I can get this retina. So it's a horrible set up in my mind.

Speaker 2:          20:20          So she says often when the retinas arrive, which happens maybe once a year, and you pull them out of their packaging, you right away you feel like, like maybe you're trading on other people's misery.

Speaker 8:          20:31          And I'm an, it's so bad when a child dies, but I am asking for his or her retina in a way. I had this sense of guilt in my head. No, Aruba had never spoken to a parent of any of her samples.

Speaker 2:          20:51          So when she got that email and she was sitting at a computer and she read the email from the company that provided or the sample saying, the mother of this sample wants to get in contact with you,

Speaker 8:          21:01          ah, I paused, I stopped and uh, uh, doing what I was doing and I thought, um, why does the mother want to talk to me? That was my first question. So I did not reply right away. But after my conversation with the lab, I took I think one day to compose a letter. And I sent it back to Sarah Gray and they ended up eventually talking on the phone. I told her, I think, uh, at the very onset that Sarah, you have to understand that, um, I feel awful.

Speaker 2:          21:43          She said she felt kind of guilty because she wished for this sample, like almost by wishing for it, she had made it happen. She said, you should not feel bad about it. If you didn't use my son's retina, I would have buried it in the ground. Like you're the only one that wanted it. Bad things happen to children. And so by being able to help you with your work, we added a layer to Thomas's life

Speaker 8:          22:09          that was, uh, I was amazed.

Speaker 2:          22:15          Eventually Sarah and Ross visited Arup as lab. She gave them a tour and she sewed them Thomas' retina. She still has samples of it in her freezer. Tiny little, I don't know, tiny little vials, maybe a third. The size of your pinkie filled with frozen liquid liquified right now or in a, it didn't look like much, but it was amazing to think of how many people were involved getting these samples. They're like, we had to approve it. We had to fill out this paperwork. Then the doctor had to come and remove the highs. The NYSE had to be processed and then I'd have to be shipped up there. Then they have to do whatever DNA process they do and just how, I don't know, valuable, maybe even priceless. The sample is, Sarah says that throughout the whole process of losing a child and then seeing him reclaimed bit by bit by all of these different people, something she shifted in me.

Speaker 3:          23:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          23:14          I used to think like the universe treated people the way it should and now I don't really believe that, but um, I do believe that there are, um, really amazing kind people in the world and science and medicine has something to do with that.

Speaker 3:          23:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          23:35          I started feeling that these were Thomas' colleagues in his coworkers and that he was a valuable partner in the important research that was being done and felt an even more fundamental shift. Almost like I had felt like I was a boat on an ocean that was like rocky and choppy with waves. And I've had this feeling that I am, I'm not the boat on the ocean, like the decisions that I make are changing other people as opposed to just, I'm a boat getting slack with waves all the time. Like the thank the Philadelphia Inquirer for getting us going on this. Yeah. Especially, yeah. Big thanks to Michael Vitez for his reporting and to dummy and Marchetti for production support and to lots of Nasr for all that help with research. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
