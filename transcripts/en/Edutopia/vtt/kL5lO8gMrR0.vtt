00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.476
&gt;&gt;You hear about data-driven
schools all the time,

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:14.456
but we are truly data-driven.

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:17.836
Sharing the data the
way we do at our school,

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:19.676
I think it's super important.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.886
Because once you have
everybody working together,

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:24.746
you have the teachers, you
have the interventionists,

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.116
you have the aides and now
you've got the parents on board,

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.706
you can't have anything
but success.

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:33.276
In the last five years,

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.286
we started really sending
home data with explanations.

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:39.136
When I send the data home then
parents will start calling.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.096
I leave my first half hour
of the day free so that

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:46.356
if I have phone calls or if
they are dropping their kids off

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:48.356
and have a question,
they can come down here.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:49.576
They know I'm open.

00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:53.646
We have a parent data night

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:55.516
at the beginning of
every school year.

00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:59.306
We try to have it after
work hours and I get

00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:01.786
up on the overhead and I
explain what the data is,

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.916
what it looks like, what we
do, what we're looking for

00:01:05.206 --> 00:01:09.286
and what they can
do at home to help.

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:11.776
I make a folder on every
single student that I see.

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:16.386
It shows every single test that
we did, every single indicator

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:20.236
that we did and where they
fell in each individual test.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.676
It also gives them a cheat
sheet on the acronyms,

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:25.826
because teachers have a
tendency to talk in acronyms

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:27.526
and talk in teacher-ese.

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:30.536
So if it says "oral
reading fluency,"

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:32.086
I give them a cheat
sheet that says,

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.196
that is how many words
you read a minute.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:36.896
They do get a standard
report card too,

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:39.756
but sometimes it's like,
"I got a B in reading.

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:40.496
What does that mean?

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.636
My kid can read."

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:44.786
&gt;&gt;Maureen: So when
Tony came in August,

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:47.246
this is an average C
student in the green.

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:49.886
This is a below average
student in the yellow.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.516
And this is well below
average in the red.

00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:56.216
If he follows this path, which
is what we're expecting him

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.406
to do, then he will
be an average student

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:00.966
in second grade by May.

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:05.556
The first test that we gave him
is the nonsense words fluency

00:02:05.556 --> 00:02:06.986
correct letter sounds.

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:08.726
These are your nonsense words.

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:12.116
Now they look kind of odd for
adults, but if you think of them

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:15.066
as like syllables, like
"re" is a nonsense word,

00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:18.556
"peat" is a nonsense word, but
together they're a word, repeat.

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:21.046
So at the beginning of the
year when we tested him,

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:22.856
he read thirty-one sounds.

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.336
But now that we've been
working with him for six weeks,

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:26.936
he's up to seventy sounds.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:27.196
&gt;&gt;Mom: Great.

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:27.666
&gt;&gt;Maureen: I know.

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:29.676
And if you're going to
work with him at home,

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:32.096
really encourage him to
read them as whole words.

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:35.566
&gt;&gt;Nine out of ten parents
say, "What can I do to help?"

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:38.366
And if you just say, "Read
with them," well, read what?

00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:43.246
Getting down to specific
skill gives the parents some

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:46.566
empowerment to do something
about getting that grade better.

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:51.316
&gt;&gt;Felicia: I think definitely
it's made me more engaged.

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:54.086
I know what to work
on with Brayden,

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:55.846
so I pay attention more.

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:59.896
We've practiced a
lot with reading.Z

00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:01.806
&gt;&gt;Brayden: She helps
me read a lot,

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:08.356
helps me get the harder
books and harder chapters.

00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:10.806
&gt;&gt;Maureen: Everyone wants their
kids to do well, so they want

00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:12.196
to know exactly where they are

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:16.106
and how we're going
to get better.

00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:17.386
&gt;&gt;Carla: Jose was way behind.

00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:21.086
It started in kindergarten all
the way through second grade,

00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:24.006
he was below grade
level, and he started

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:25.646
at Humboldt his third
grade year.

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:29.446
&gt;&gt;Maureen: He was well,
well below average.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.506
He had no confidence
and he said,

00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:33.036
"I can't read" and
"I don't read."

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:34.686
His parents were
kind of defeated

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:36.416
because he'd been getting
bad grades where he was,

00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:38.356
and mom got a data report.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.036
&gt;&gt;Carla: She handed me the
folder and I opened it up

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:45.096
and I was just in awe
and shock and tears,

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:48.686
because I could see right
away the growth on the chart

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:51.926
where he was way down,
and he was way high now.

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:54.266
&gt;&gt;Maureen: And he ended
up staying in Title I

00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:57.446
because he had a tendency to
go up and down, up and down.

00:03:57.776 --> 00:03:59.766
But to see that he
was making progress,

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:01.786
it motivated him,
it motivated her.

00:04:02.256 --> 00:04:05.816
&gt;&gt;Jose: She pressed her left
hand to her cheek and smiled.

00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:07.526
&gt;&gt;Carla: I could
see the progress

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:10.916
and I could see his achievements
and I felt like what I was doing

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:15.086
at home was helping with what
they were doing at school.

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:17.396
&gt;&gt;Jose: I read a lot.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.066
I read about bats.

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:21.006
I read about animals.

00:04:21.546 --> 00:04:23.556
I learn lots of things
and my grades go higher

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:24.346
and higher and higher.

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:29.096
&gt;&gt;Carla: He went from not
wanting to read to, "Look Mom,

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:31.636
I got a chapter book, and
this book's about the--

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:33.146
can I read this to you?"

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:34.306
And I'm like, "Of course."

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:39.786
I believe if you have
communication between teachers,

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:44.366
parents, staff, that
parents feel comfortable,

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:47.996
kids feel comfortable
and I think it's valuable

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.166
that they communicate with
you because then you know

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:51.456
where your child's at.

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:54.746
&gt;&gt;Maureen: The fact that we all
work together as one big group,

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:58.106
I think a lot of our success is
part of that, and the success

00:04:58.106 --> 00:04:59.176
that we've had as
a school tells us

00:04:59.176 --> 00:04:59.976
that we're doing
the right thing.
