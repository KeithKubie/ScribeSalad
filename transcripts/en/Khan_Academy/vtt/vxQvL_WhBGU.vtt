00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.820
In the last video, we had this
rectangle, and we used a triple

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.170
integral to figure
out it's volume.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.000
And I know you were probably
thinking, well, I could have

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.100
just used my basic geometry
to multiply the height times

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.940
the width times the depth.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.720
And that's true because this
was a constant-valued function.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.320
And then even once we
evaluated, once we integrated

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.630
with respect to z, we ended up
with a double integral, which

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.840
is exactly what you would have
done in the last several videos

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.580
when we just learned the
volume under a surface.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.560
But then we added a twist
at the end of the video.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.000
We said, fine, you could have
figured out the volume within

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.160
this rectangular domain, I
guess, very straightforward

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.000
using things you already knew.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.080
But what if our goal is not
to figure out the volume?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.790
Our goal was to figure out the
mass of this volume, and even

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.240
more, the material that we're
taking the volume of-- whether

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.060
it's a volume of gas or a
volume of some solid-- that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.050
its density is not constant.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.080
So now the mass becomes
kind of-- I don't know--

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.550
interesting to calculate.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.740
And so, what we defined, we
defined a density function.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.770
And rho, this p looking thing
with a curvy bottom-- that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.855
gives us the density
at any given point.

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:11.370
And at the end of the
last video we said,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.830
well, what is mass?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.050
Mass is just density
times volume.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.750
You could view it another way.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.170
Density is the same thing
as mass divided by volume.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.630
So the mass around a very, very
small point, and we called that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.750
d mass, the differential of the
mass, is going equal the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.450
density at that point, or the
rough density at exactly that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.790
point, times the volume
differential around that point,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.100
times the volume of this
little small cube.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.140
And then, as we saw it on the
last video, if you're using

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.240
rectangular coordinates, this
volume differential could just

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.390
be the x distance times the y
distance times the z distance.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.690
So, the density was that our
density function is defined

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.730
to be x, y, and z, and we
wanted to figure out the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.560
mass of this volume.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.140
And let's say that our x, y,
and z coordinates-- their

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.990
values, let's say they're in
meters and let's say this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.340
density is in kilograms
per meter cubed.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.270
So our answer is going to be in
kilograms if that was the case.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.480
And those are kind of the
traditional Si units.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.210
So let's figure out the mass of
this variably dense volume.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.150
So all we do is we have the
same integral up here.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.860
So the differential of mass
is going to be this value,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.996
so let's write that down.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.920
It is x-- I want to make sure
I don't run out of space.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.390
xyz times-- and I'm
going to integrate with

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.890
respect to dz first.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.910
But you could actually
switch the order.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.750
Maybe we'll do that
in the next video.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.810
We'll do dz first, then we'll
do dy, then we'll do dx.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.490
Once again, this is just
the mass at any small

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.310
differential of volume.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.760
And if we integrate with z
first we said z goes from what?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.770
The boundaries on
z were 0 to 2.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.255
The boundaries on
y were 0 to 4.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.890
And the boundaries on
x, x went from 0 to 3.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.910
And how do we evaluate this?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.900
Well, what is the
antiderivative-- we're

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.370
integrating with
respect to z first.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.660
So what's the antiderivative
of xyz with respect to z?

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.080
Well, let's see.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.080
This is just a constant so
it'll be xyz squared over 2.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.040
Right?

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.810
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.690
And then we'll evaluate
that from 2 to 0.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.870
And so you get-- I know I'm
going to run out of space.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.420
So you're going to get
2 squared, which is 4,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.990
divided by 2, which is 2.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.460
So it's 2xy minus 0.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.070
So when you evaluate just this
first we'll get 2xy, and

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.410
now you have the other
two integrals left.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.260
So I didn't write the
other two integrals down.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.820
Maybe I'll write it down.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.680
So then you're left
with two integrals.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.660
You're left with dy and dx.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.710
And y goes from 0 to 4
and x goes from 0 to 3.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.480
I'm definitely going
to run out of space.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.200
And now you take the
antiderivative of this

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.110
with respect to y.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.640
So what's the antiderivative
of this with respect to y?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.240
Let me erase some stuff just
so I don't get too messy.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.040
I was given the very good
suggestion of making it

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.340
scroll, but, unfortunately,
I didn't make it scroll

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.090
enough this time.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.160
So I can delete this
stuff, I think.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.220
Oops, I deleted some of that.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.860
But you know what I deleted.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.290
OK, so let's take
the antiderivative

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.290
with respect to y.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.640
I'll start it up here
where I have space.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.545
OK, so the antiderivative of
2xy with respect to y is y

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:08.430
squared over 2, 2's cancel out.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.870
So you get xy squared.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.270
And y goes from 0 to 4.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.000
And then we still have the
outer integral to do.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.395
x goes from 0 to 3 dx.

00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:24.215
And when y is equal
to 4 you get 16x.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.050
And then when y is 0
the whole thing is 0.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.300
So you have 16x integrated
from 0 to 3 dx.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.210
And that is equal to what?

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.215
8x squared.

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:42.700
And you evaluate
it from 0 to 3.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.560
When it's 3, 8 times 9 is 72.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.040
And 0 times 8 is 0.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.810
So the mass of our figure-- the
volume we figured out last

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.230
time was 24 meters cubed.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.160
I erased it, but if you
watched the last video

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.210
that's what we learned.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.570
But it's mass is 72 kilograms.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.420
And we did that by integrating
this 3 variable density

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.090
function-- this function
of 3 variables.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.230
Or in three-dimensions
you can view it as a

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.440
scalar field, right?

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.910
At any given point, there
is a value, but not

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.420
really a direction.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.020
And that value is a density.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.540
But we integrated the scalar
field in this volume.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.650
So that's kind of the new
skill we learned with

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.620
the triple integral.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.280
And in the next video I'll
show you how to set up more

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.460
complicated triple integrals.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.820
But the real difficulty with
triple integrals is-- and I

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.180
think you'll see that your
calculus teacher will often do

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.630
this-- when you're doing triple
integrals, unless you have a

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.290
very easy figure like this, the
evaluation-- if you actually

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.500
wanted to analytically evaluate
a triple integral that has more

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.910
complicated boundaries or more
complicated for example,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.280
a density function.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.850
The integral gets very
hairy, very fast.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.610
And it's often very difficult
or very time consuming to

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.760
evaluate it analytically just
using your traditional

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.270
calculus skills.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.790
So you'll see that on a lot of
calculus exams when they start

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.500
doing the triple integral, they
just want you to set it up.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.520
They take your word for it that
you've done so many integrals

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.490
so far that you could
take the antiderivative.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.820
And sometimes, if they really
want to give you something more

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.530
difficult they'll just say,
well, switch the order.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.930
You know, this is the integral
when we're dealing with

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.700
respect to z, then y, then x.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.510
We want you to rewrite
this integral when

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.730
you switch the order.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.700
And we will do that
in the next video.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.270
See you soon.
