00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.180
In the last video, we made
a visual argument as to why

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.800
this expression has
to be less than 1/3,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.780
and this expression
we already figured out

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.840
is the fraction that are bears.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.990
Now we will make an
algebraic argument,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.221
or I could call it
an analytic argument.

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:16.720
And to make this
argument, I'm going

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.219
to leave this expression-- we
know this is the fraction that

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.530
are bears-- and I'm going to
write this 1/3 in a form that

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.290
looks a lot like
this, and then based

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.110
on the information we have,
we can directly compare them.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.160
So how can I write 1/3?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060
Maybe with the b as a numerator.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.950
Well, 1/3 is the same
thing as b over 3b,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.090
which is the exact same thing
as b over b plus b plus b.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.030
So now, this is
looking pretty similar.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.500
The only difference between this
expression right over here, b

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.945
over c plus d plus
b and b over b

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:56.010
plus b plus b is that our
denominators are different.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790
And the only difference in our
denominators, this denominator

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.360
has a c plus d here, while
this has a b plus b over here.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.770
Now, we have to ask
ourselves a question.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.000
What is larger?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.249
Is c plus d larger
than b plus b?

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.040
And I encourage you to
pause that and think

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.480
about that for a second.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.149
Well, yes.

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.440
We already see right over here.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.030
It was given to us
that c is greater

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.940
than d that is greater
than b, so both c

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.720
and d are greater than b.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.920
So c plus d is definitely going
to be greater than b plus b.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.850
So this denominator right
over here is greater,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460
so this has a
larger denominator.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.550
This right over here has
a smaller denominator.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.980
And since we know this
has a larger denominator,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.940
this has a smaller
denominator, they

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.340
have the exact same
numerator-- they both have

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.970
b as a numerator-- we know
that this whole thing must

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.290
be a smaller quantity.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.710
If you have the same numerator
but one expression has a larger

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.120
denominator, it must be smaller.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.286
Wait, so how does that work?

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.236
Well, just remember.

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:09.110
I mean, just imagine.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.401
You have the same numerator,
what's going to be bigger,

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:16.800
a over 7 or a over 5?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.272
Well here, you're
dividing a by 7.

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:20.480
You're dividing into many
more chunks than over here,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.000
so this right over
here is smaller.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.230
This right over here is larger.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.530
So this is the larger.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.420
This right over here is smaller.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.330
So the same numerator, the
larger the denominator,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.226
the smaller the
quantity is going to be.

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:35.850
So going back to the
original question,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.730
this is the smaller quantity,
and this right over here,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.310
1/3, is the larger quantity.
