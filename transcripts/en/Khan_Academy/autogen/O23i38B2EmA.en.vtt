00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:02.151
 We've already seen that enzymes 

00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:05.285
 catalyze reactions, but let's explain once more how they do it. 

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:10.285
 This is our enzyme, we have a substrate, 

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.885
 which is associated with the active center 

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:15.718
 of the enzyme. 

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:18.685
 It is associated with this part of the enzyme, 

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.251
 which we call an active center. 

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:23.918
 The substrate binds to the active site and the enzyme catalyses 

00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:26.085
 reaction. It can divide the substrate 

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:27.995
 of two smaller molecules. 

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:32.605
 After the reaction 

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:34.925
 the enzyme 

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:39.718
 remains unchanged, 

00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:42.818
 but the reaction is catalysed. 

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:48.052
 Now we have a substrate that is divided, 

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:50.617
 in this case at least two smaller molecules. 

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.718
 I can draw them. This is one. 

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.085
 And here is the other one. 

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.251
 They come from the active center. 

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.085
 Once the reaction is catalysed, they no longer have it 

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.851
 affinity to the active center and detach themselves. 

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.747
 The enzyme has catalysed the reaction. 

00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:08.068
 In this video I want to explain how this process can be inhibited 

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.051
 and more specifically, 

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:13.350
 how it can be inhibited competitively. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.685
 We will talk about competitive inhibition. 

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.785
 Competitive - 

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:19.918
 I'll write it here. 

00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:24.284
 Competitive 

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.084
 inhibition. 

00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:28.284
 inhibition. 

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:31.285
 We will begin with the classic variant of competitive inhibition: 

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.618
 when there is a molecule that competes 

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:38.584
 with the active center substrate. 

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:39.884
 As we shall see, this is not the only form 

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.151
 of competitive inhibition, but it is the one that 

00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:44.651
 most often can be found in textbooks. 

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.352
 Again, we have our enzyme. 

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.251
 This is the enzyme. 

00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:53.684
 We have already seen that this part, 

00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:56.718
 which I surround, is the active center. 

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:01.718
 Active Center. 

00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.318
 If the molecule, the exact substrate 

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:07.418
 get to the active center we will have 

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:09.284
 the first scenarios here above. 

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:11.351
 However, in the classical competitive inhibition, 

00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:13.818
 or at least the version I'm going to show right now, 

00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:17.060
 we may have another molecule, 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.351
 which may seem like this. 

00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:21.784
 It will compete for the active center 

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:26.118
 and if he comes to him first, 

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:27.685
 if he gets first, 

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:30.218
 let me show what happens. 

00:02:30.218 --> 00:02:33.185
 Then we have our enzyme, 

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:38.151
 we also have the other molecule, which is not the substrate, 

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.250
 it connects to the active center first. 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.651
 Now the predetermined substrate, 

00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:45.850
 the one with which the enzyme can catalyze a reaction, 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.918
 can not be linked to the enzyme, therefore the reaction will not occur. 

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:51.785
 You can see very clearly that they are competing 

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:53.417
 for the enzyme and in this case, 

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.652
 for the active center. 

00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:58.517
 This is not the only form of competitive inhibition. 

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:00.485
 Another type of competitive inhibition 

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:03.485
 is allosteric competitive inhibition. 

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:04.984
 Let me write it. 

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:08.052
 We have allosynthetic-- 

00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:10.495
 Allosteric 

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.635
 competitive 

00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:17.705
 inhibition. 

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:19.018
 Today I find it hard to write. 

00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:21.118
 Inhibition. 

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:25.284
 The allosteric center is different from the active center. 

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:28.518
 In allosteric competitive inhibition 

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:30.184
 or competitive allosteric inhibition 

00:03:30.184 --> 00:03:32.951
 we have a case, 

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.117
 where the competitor does not connect to the active center, 

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.151
 but with a different center, 

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.051
 called the allosteric center. 

00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:44.718
 The competitor can connect here, 

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:46.584
 this is clearly not the active center. 

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:49.018
 The competitor may look like this. 

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:51.817
 It does not connect to the active center, 

00:03:51.817 --> 00:03:56.817
 but when it connects here, the active center can no longer connect 

00:03:57.217 --> 00:04:01.650
 with the intended substrate, so we have the same effect. 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.052
 We have the same effect as this substrate 

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:07.317
 will not connect to the active center. 

00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:09.417
 But if the substrate connects first - 

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:11.618
 Let's draw this case. 

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.317
 If the intended substrate is first connected, 

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:17.652
 then the competitor can not connect. 

00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:20.518
 In this case, if the substrate succeeds 

00:04:20.518 --> 00:04:22.485
 to get to the active center, 

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:24.385
 the competitor can not connect, 

00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:25.584
 so the two molecules compete again. 

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:27.752
 I will draw the competitor here. 

00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:29.552
 It is essential that 

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.851
 which of the two molecules, the substrate or the competitor will get first to the enzyme. 

00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:33.784
 In this situation, the competitor will not contact. 

00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:35.485
 This is true if we talk about 

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:37.317
 competitive inhibition whereby the molecules compete 

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:39.851
 for the active center. If the competitor gets first, 

00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.831
 the substrate will not connect. 

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:45.864
 The reaction will not be catalyzed. 

00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:48.751
 But if the substrate gets first, 

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:51.151
 the competitor will not be able to connect. 

00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:52.551
 We may have a situation, 

00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:56.285
 where the competitor will not be able to connect, 

00:04:56.285 --> 00:05:01.285
 because the substrate has come to 

00:05:01.618 --> 00:05:03.052
 active center first. 

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.451
 When talking about allosteric competitive inhibition, 

00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:07.118
 again we have competition for the enzyme. 

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:08.885
 Only one of the two competing molecules will connect. 

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:10.551
 If one gets to the enzyme first, 

00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:12.351
 the other will not be able to connect. 

00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:15.484
 They compete for the enzyme, but the competitor, 

00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:18.451
 which is not a substrate, is associated with the allosteric center. 

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.350
 By associating with the allosteric center, 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.084
 the competitor changes the conformation of the enzyme, 

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:26.952
 so that the active center can no longer connect to the substrate. 

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.651
 I want to pay special attention to this, 

00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.152
 because when I first taught him I told myself, 

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:31.351
 "Oh!" 

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:33.185
 Very often it can be confusing, 

00:05:33.185 --> 00:05:36.067
 because if you read on the internet, you may encounter sources, 

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:39.051
 which call allosteric inhibition 

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:40.818
 uncompetitive because the competitor and the substrate do not fight 

00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:44.718
 for the active center. But this is not the case. 

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:46.818
 In case of uncompetitive inhibition for which 

00:05:46.818 --> 00:05:50.051
 I will make a separate video - 

00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:54.785
 In non-competitive inhibition, the inhibitor 

00:05:54.785 --> 00:05:58.351
 can be associated with the enzyme, regardless of whether the substrate 

00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:01.785
 has been linked or not, but when the inhibitor binds, 

00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:04.051
 it prevents the reaction from continuing. 

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:06.684
 The inhibitor changes the conformation of the protein, 

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:09.118
 so that it can no longer catalyze the reaction. 

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.684
 In noncompetitive inhibition both the substrate and the inhibitor may bind, 

00:06:11.684 --> 00:06:12.985
 but if the inhibitor is bound, 

00:06:12.985 --> 00:06:15.084
 the reaction will not take place. 

00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:16.850
 In competitive inhibition, whether we are talking 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.252
 for allosteric or non-parasite competitive inhibition, 

00:06:20.252 --> 00:06:24.084
 only one - or the substrate or inhibitor 

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:25.918
 will be able to connect to the enzyme. 

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.200
 They compete for the enzyme.
