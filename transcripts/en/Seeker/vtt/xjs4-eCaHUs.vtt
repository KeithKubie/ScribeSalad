00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.230
Today, I’m going to tell you a little story
about balls.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.490
Hey shady ballers, Jules here for Dnews.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.150
If you’ve ever been to Los Angeles, you
may have seen a ton of little plastic balls

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.440
floating on top of their water reservoirs.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.860
There are millions of them!

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.980
So many that from far away, they look more
like a blacktop than a gigantic, wet, Chuck

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.190
E Cheese ball pit.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.340
But before diving in face first, consider
that these balls actually serve a very important

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.340
purpose.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.160
Reservoirs, like the ones in Los Angeles store
the city’s drinkable and potable water.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.300
But Federal law says that they can’t just
leave this water exposed to the open air.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.010
When the EPA enacted this mandate in 2006,
it was responding to an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.630
[crypto-spor-idy-osis], a stomach illness
contracted from drinking contaminated water,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.140
namely from reservoirs.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.510
But Crypto-whatever is not the only side effect
of exposed reservoirs.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.850
Uncovered water can be pooped in by birds,
or just get dirty from dust and dirt settling

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.850
on top.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.370
In the aftermath of 9/11, a lot of people
were concerned that open reservoirs would

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.780
be targeted by terrorists - like the enemy
would fly by on a plane and drop in toxic

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.150
chemicals, infecting entire populations.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.670
But Batman-based terror attacks aside, the
biggest concern when it came to exposed drinking

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.260
water, at least for LA County, was a chemical
reaction that occurs when the water interacts

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.330
with sunlight.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.210
LA’s reservoirs contain a small amount of
chlorine as a disinfectant.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.950
In direct sunlight, when chlorine combines
with a natural element found in groundwater,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.360
bromide, it creates a chemical called “bromate”.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.550
Bromate sucks to ingest, and can cause stomach
pain, nausea, and in high doses, serious damage

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.670
to the kidneys and nervous system.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.330
Sunlight can also lead to algae growth, which
isn’t harmful in itself.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.350
But when algae breaks down and the organic
components mix with chlorine, it creates byproducts,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.580
which have been associated with birth defects
and even certain cancers.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.000
So, LA county needed to cover up their reservoirs.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.850
And they considered a few ways of doing it.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.939
The most logical solutions were to build a
huge roof, or use a massive tarp.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.240
But these alternatives were going to be really
expensive.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.570
Like, $300 million dollars expensive.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.130
That’s like three quarters of the average
cost to launch a damn space shuttle.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.260
So instead, LA County went with “shade balls”.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.420
The idea was pretty simple: 96 million 4-inch
diameter plastic balls would float on the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.780
reservoir, preventing evaporation and protecting
the water from harmful airborne pollutants23.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.290
The balls were also coated with a black carbon
colorant that repels ultraviolet light, which

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.860
can cause plastics and other materials to
degrade.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.550
This chemical coating is intended to protect
them for up to 25 years.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.530
Thankfully, shade balls are also economical.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.430
Each ball costs just 36 cents, representing
a total savings of roughly $250 million dollars

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.750
for LA County.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.920
This is all fairly new.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.569
In fact, LA is the first county to use shade
balls for this purpose.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.590
But they’re getting a lot of attention,
especially as a way to mitigate the effects

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.520
of this never-ending drought.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.441
The Los Angeles Reservoir’s shade balls
are expected to prevent roughly 300 million

00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:18.180
gallons of water from evaporating every year.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.739
The only downside?

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.140
The balls jokes.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.140
So what do you think?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.700
Could shade balls be the future of environmental
protection?
