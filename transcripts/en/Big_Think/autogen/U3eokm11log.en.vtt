are actively involved in athletics so
 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.089 align:start position:0%
are actively involved in athletics so
we've<00:07:25.550><c> now</c><00:07:25.760><c> seen</c><00:07:26.510><c> kind</c><00:07:27.139><c> of</c><00:07:27.200><c> a</c><00:07:27.380><c> blurring</c><00:07:27.740><c> of</c><00:07:28.039><c> the</c>

we've now seen kind of a blurring of the

we've now seen kind of a blurring of the

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 align:start position:0%
injury now now it's true men are tend to
 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.650 align:start position:0%

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 align:start position:0%
be much more involved in contact sports
 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
be much more involved in contact sports
so<00:07:35.660><c> there's</c><00:07:35.870><c> certain</c><00:07:36.169><c> types</c><00:07:36.410><c> of</c><00:07:36.500><c> injuries</c>

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:36.770 align:start position:0%
so there's certain types of injuries
 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.589 align:start position:0%
so there's certain types of injuries
there<00:07:37.130><c> but</c><00:07:37.580><c> women</c><00:07:37.849><c> are</c><00:07:37.970><c> more</c><00:07:38.330><c> and</c><00:07:38.479><c> more</c>
