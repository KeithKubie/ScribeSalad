around after the scientific sessions
 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.060

were over speculating about who was

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070

that I get to speak about my work the

that I get to speak about my work the
 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.540
that I get to speak about my work the
size of my research group has has grown

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550
size of my research group has has grown
 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.160

that's made it possible for me to be

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170
that's made it possible for me to be
 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.890
that's made it possible for me to be
involved in more and more new kinds of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900
involved in more and more new kinds of
 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.600
involved in more and more new kinds of
physics but it's made it harder and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610
physics but it's made it harder and
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.520
physics but it's made it harder and
harder for me to be intimately familiar

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530
harder for me to be intimately familiar
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.100

with all the things that are going on so

with all the things that are going on so
 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.190
with all the things that are going on so
there's a kind of a tension between the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200
there's a kind of a tension between the
 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.950
there's a kind of a tension between the
joy and doing lots of new things and the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960
joy and doing lots of new things and the
 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.900
joy and doing lots of new things and the
desire to understand them better and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910
desire to understand them better and
 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.380
desire to understand them better and
better another thing that I never would

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390
better another thing that I never would
 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.800
better another thing that I never would
have imagined would have been one of the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810
have imagined would have been one of the
 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.440
have imagined would have been one of the
results of becoming a Nobel laureate is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
results of becoming a Nobel laureate is
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.990
results of becoming a Nobel laureate is
that I ended up meeting people who are
