00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.590
I try to hear everything that's

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600
I try to hear everything that's
 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.440
I try to hear everything that's
happening and that that can be very very

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450
happening and that that can be very very
 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.450
happening and that that can be very very
difficult and and someone who tells you

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460
difficult and and someone who tells you
 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.980
difficult and and someone who tells you
oh I hear everything that's happening on

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990
oh I hear everything that's happening on
 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.560
oh I hear everything that's happening on
stages line because there's there's

almost no way I think to really do that

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150
almost no way I think to really do that
 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.330
almost no way I think to really do that
but as an exercise I do try to identify

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340
but as an exercise I do try to identify
 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.400

okay what is that musician the third

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410
okay what is that musician the third
 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.890
okay what is that musician the third
flute playing and I try to make sure I

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900
flute playing and I try to make sure I
 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.350
flute playing and I try to make sure I
can hear that but you have to hear

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360
can hear that but you have to hear
 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.670
can hear that but you have to hear
what's going on because if you're

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680
what's going on because if you're
 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.000
what's going on because if you're
there's a way I've used the analogy it's

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010
there's a way I've used the analogy it's
 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.819
there's a way I've used the analogy it's
like it's like a ball a very big ball

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829
like it's like a ball a very big ball
 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.639
like it's like a ball a very big ball
you can affect the way the ball rolls

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649
you can affect the way the ball rolls
 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.900
you can affect the way the ball rolls
and you can change the direction that

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910
and you can change the direction that
 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.520
and you can change the direction that
the ball is rolling if it's already in

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530
the ball is rolling if it's already in
 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.190
the ball is rolling if it's already in
is if it's already in motion but you

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200
is if it's already in motion but you
 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.799
is if it's already in motion but you
can't suddenly have it turn an abrupt

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809
can't suddenly have it turn an abrupt
 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.440
can't suddenly have it turn an abrupt
angle there's a natural way that the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450
angle there's a natural way that the
 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.450
angle there's a natural way that the
ball can be guided so even though you're

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460
ball can be guided so even though you're
 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.370
ball can be guided so even though you're
steering the ball there's a natural

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380
steering the ball there's a natural
 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.080
steering the ball there's a natural
momentum that the ball has that you

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090
momentum that the ball has that you
 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.440
momentum that the ball has that you
can't interfere with so if the orchestra

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450
can't interfere with so if the orchestra
 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.930
can't interfere with so if the orchestra
has a certain flow you can affect the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940
has a certain flow you can affect the
 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.940
has a certain flow you can affect the
flow but there's a natural way to do

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950
flow but there's a natural way to do
 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.930
flow but there's a natural way to do
that and there's a way that actually

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940
that and there's a way that actually
 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.329
that and there's a way that actually
would interrupt the natural flow so it's

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
would interrupt the natural flow so it's
 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.439
would interrupt the natural flow so it's
not that you can just do whatever you

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449
not that you can just do whatever you
 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.320
not that you can just do whatever you
want you have to take into account what

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330
want you have to take into account what
 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.609
want you have to take into account what
is happening on what is being offered

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619
is happening on what is being offered
 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.649
is happening on what is being offered
from the player so that means really

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659
from the player so that means really
 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:12.880
from the player so that means really
being in touch with what they're doing

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890
being in touch with what they're doing
 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.920
being in touch with what they're doing
and hearing them as well as you can and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
and hearing them as well as you can and
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.170
and hearing them as well as you can and
it's surprisingly difficult to really

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180
it's surprisingly difficult to really
 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.690
it's surprisingly difficult to really
identify not even with two or three or

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700
identify not even with two or three or
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.490
identify not even with two or three or
four lines but even just one line to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500
four lines but even just one line to
 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.510
four lines but even just one line to
really hear what the the will and the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520
really hear what the the will and the
 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.120
really hear what the the will and the
and the sense that the players are

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130
and the sense that the players are
 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.160
and the sense that the players are
giving to one line to really listen to

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170
giving to one line to really listen to
 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.020
giving to one line to really listen to
them to actually be able to react to it

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030
them to actually be able to react to it
 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.670
them to actually be able to react to it
in a meaningful ways is surprisingly

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
in a meaningful ways is surprisingly
 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.899
in a meaningful ways is surprisingly
difficult

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909
 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.749
well that's difficult and and what

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759
well that's difficult and and what
 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.870
well that's difficult and and what
happens is if there's more than one

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880
happens is if there's more than one
 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.289
happens is if there's more than one
current if their conflicting currents on

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299
current if their conflicting currents on
 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.099
current if their conflicting currents on
stage then you have to make a choice you

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109
stage then you have to make a choice you
 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.010
stage then you have to make a choice you
have to either give in or insist and for

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020
have to either give in or insist and for
 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.929
have to either give in or insist and for
the other musicians on stage if they

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939
the other musicians on stage if they
 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.639
the other musicians on stage if they
sense two currents if they say for

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649
sense two currents if they say for
 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.109
sense two currents if they say for
example if I show one thing and they

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119
example if I show one thing and they
 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.550
example if I show one thing and they
hear a response to that that is not in

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
hear a response to that that is not in
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.770
hear a response to that that is not in
sync then they have a dilemma they have

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780
sync then they have a dilemma they have
 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.359
sync then they have a dilemma they have
to choose do I go with what I see from

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369
to choose do I go with what I see from
 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.859
to choose do I go with what I see from
the conductor or do I go with what I

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869
the conductor or do I go with what I
 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.619
the conductor or do I go with what I
hear so I very often tell tell

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629
hear so I very often tell tell

orchestras even York Philharmonic I say

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750
orchestras even York Philharmonic I say
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.140
orchestras even York Philharmonic I say
you know I really want you to play with

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150

you're following me that precisely it's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610
you're following me that precisely it's
 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.400
you're following me that precisely it's
just that I want to take the element of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410
just that I want to take the element of
 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.250
just that I want to take the element of

something goes wrong then you just have

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829
something goes wrong then you just have
 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.259
something goes wrong then you just have
to use your sense and that's based on

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269
to use your sense and that's based on
 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.059
to use your sense and that's based on
experience either you give in sometimes

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
experience either you give in sometimes

it's better to give in allow it to sort

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989
it's better to give in allow it to sort

you sort of dig your heels in and you

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889
you sort of dig your heels in and you
 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.979
you sort of dig your heels in and you
just say okay no this is where it is and

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989
just say okay no this is where it is and
 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.289
just say okay no this is where it is and
it creates a discomfort an uncomfortable

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299
it creates a discomfort an uncomfortable
 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.960
it creates a discomfort an uncomfortable
moment but you try to use your best

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
moment but you try to use your best
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.680
moment but you try to use your best
sense and I couldn't say it's always one

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
sense and I couldn't say it's always one
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.539
sense and I couldn't say it's always one
way or it's always another way you just

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549
way or it's always another way you just
 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.220
way or it's always another way you just
have to figure out what the best way to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230
have to figure out what the best way to
 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.750
have to figure out what the best way to
get out of those situations and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760
get out of those situations and
 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.319
get out of those situations and
hopefully they're not too frequent
