00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.780
Let's say that I
have the matrix A.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.770
And we know we denote matrices
with bolded capital letters.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.830
So I have the matrix A.
And it is a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.940
And so let's say it's 1,
negative 2, 3, 0, 7, 5.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.220
It's a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.400
And what my question
to myself-- or to you,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.350
if you're listening-- is
what is the transpose of A?

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.400
And so we denote the
transpose like this,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.700
A with this little
superscript T right over here.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:43.922
And all this is talking about
is the transpose of matrix A.

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:45.380
And so your natural
question should

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.430
be, well, what does it mean to
take the transpose of a matrix?

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.270
It sounds very fancy.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.460
Well, it is not that fancy.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.985
All this means is
rows become columns.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.280
And you could imagine, when
the rows become columns,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.190
the columns become the rows.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.100
What do I mean by that?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.030
Well, let's do it
right over here.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.210
So if I have three rows.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.030
So let's be clear.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.350
This is one, two, three rows.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.150
So this is three rows
by one, two columns.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.300
So this is a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.170
If all the rows are
going to become columns

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.230
and all the columns are
going to become rows,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.360
the transpose is going
to be a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.390
It's going to be two rows.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.710
The two columns here are
going to become the two rows,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.900
by three columns.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.820
These three rows are going
to become three columns.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.420
And so it's going
to look something

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.970
like-- let me do it
in that blue color.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.500
It's going to have two rows now.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.570
And it's going to
have three columns.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.230
So I said all the
rows became columns.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.490
All the columns became rows.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.590
Well, I could view
it exactly like that.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.940
I have this first row
here of 1, negative 2.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.090
I can turn that into my first
column now of 1, negative 2.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.790
I have the second row, 3 and 0.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.290
That will be now my
second column, 3 and 0.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.250
And I have this
third row, 7 and 5.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.010
Well, that's going to be my
third column now, 7 and 5.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.101
And you could have
just as easily viewed

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.100
it the other way around.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.150
You could say, look,
I have two columns.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.570
My first column is 1, 3, 7.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.190
So my first row now is
going to be 1, 3, 7.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.740
And then you could say, my
second column is negative 2,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.230
0, 5.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.836
And so my second row
will be negative 2, 0, 5.

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:44.210
Let's do another
example of that,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.050
just so we really make it clear.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.900
So let's say I
have matrix B. Once

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.330
again, bolded capital letter.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.250
And let's just say it's a
really simple 2 by 2 matrix.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.460
So it's negative 1, 5,
pi, and 3 are its entries.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.990
What is B transpose
going to be equal to?

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.290
Well, once again, we have
two rows and two columns.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.050
So if all the rows become
columns and all the columns

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.310
become rows, I'm still going
to have a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.630
But we just have to say,
look, my first row here

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.050
is negative 1, 5.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.230
So that's now going to be my
first column, negative 1 and 5.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.540
I have my second row
here, which is pi and 3.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.030
So now that's going to become
my second column of pi and 3.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.110
And so I have taken
the transpose.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.400
All the rows became columns.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.320
All the columns became rows.
