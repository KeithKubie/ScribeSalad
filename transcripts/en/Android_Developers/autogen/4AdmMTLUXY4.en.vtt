00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.556
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: We have a long story short 

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:07.410
 Please give a brief introduction 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.600
 Tell everyone about your work, your business 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.152
 And your company's strategy to enter the global market 

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:15.700
 Let's start with Mor. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.200
 Ok 

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:19.520
 MOR SHANI: My name is Mor from Jelly Button Games. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.350
 I am one of the company's co-founders and CEO. 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.490
 Our main business is to develop free casual games. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.870
 Our first successful work was Pirate King. 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.110
 50 million downloads so far 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.040
 We are still working hard to enter the global market 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.986
 What else do you want me to talk about? 

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:45.110
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Can you talk about entering the global market? 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.800
 After all, this is your company's goal. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.544
 Or will we talk about this topic later? 

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:50.210
 MOR SHANI: Yes. 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.310
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Ok 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.430
 Then let's talk about this later. 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.210
 Next, please introduce Massimo. 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.460
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: Hello everyone, my name is Massimo. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.820
 Everyone calls me Max 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.450
 This is simpler 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.160
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Oh, really? 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.590
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: Yes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.250
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I didn't know it before. 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.099
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: It's much simpler. 

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.550
 I am one of the co-founders and CEOs of Musixmatch. 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.310
 Musixmatch is the world's largest lyrics database 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.820
 It’s a pity that I am not a singer. 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.510
 Currently, we have downloaded more than 50 million times worldwide. 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.309
 Thank you very much for the invitation from the organizers. 

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:26.600
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Thank you! 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.442
 Then let Andres introduce 

00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:28.400
 ANDRES BOU: My name is Andres. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.450
 Is the CEO and co-founder of Social Point 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 We are a game company based in Barcelona 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.500
 Our best known game is Dragon City. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.040
 And Monster Legends 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.670
 According to statistics, the download volume of Dragon City 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.370
 Has exceeded 150 million times 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.980
 We have also entered the global market to a large extent. 

00:01:54.074 --> 00:01:55.490
 GILBERT WERDAM: Is there a sound in my microphone? 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.281
 FEMALE SPEAKER: No 

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.350
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Is there such a thing? 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.705
 GILBERT WERDAM: Okay. 

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.520
 one two Three 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.190
 One or two 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.490
 Hi 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.190
 Hello everyone 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.700
 My name is Gil. 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.470
 Is the design director of Citymapper 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.590
 Citymapper is a city-built city. 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.060
 Traffic application 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.560
 We collect all kinds of ready-made messy data 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 Try to figure out the clue 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.170
 Then develop and design a product based on this 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.800
 Mainly to guide users from one place to another 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.274
 The app is currently available in 30 cities in 10 countries. 

00:02:37.034 --> 00:02:38.700
 REGINA CHAMMA: Hello, my name is Regina. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.000
 I am the head of business development for Google Play in Latin America. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.360
 Mainly responsible for business in Brazil and Mexico 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.449
 I am very happy to meet you here. 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:47.740
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Ok 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.090
 Let's start talking about it. 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.620
 For the next discussion 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.350
 More interactive 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.980
 I will ask questions, please answer them one by one. 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.190
 After that, more interaction 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.980
 Then ask the audience if there is any problem. 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.800
 If so, please join our discussion 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 First of all, I want to ask you all. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.520
 What is your company's strategy to enter the global market? 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.530
 What are the challenges your company faces in the global market? 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.680
 If you enter the global market, what challenges does your company face? 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.710
 What challenges have you faced? 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.282
 Ok, Gil talks about it first. 

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:30.490
 GILBERT WERDAM: You can basically imagine 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.840
 Globalization is what we have to do 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.140
 Key work 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.560
 Our strategy is always 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.530
 Localize products as much as possible 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.490
 Therefore, every time we launch an app in a city, we will design all the traffic icons by hand. 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.450
 We will go to these cities in person. 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.510
 Specialized responsible personnel are also arranged for each city. 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.440
 In terms of culture 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.330
 Our app has always maintained a humorous style 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.860
 In addition, really understand the accent of the locals 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.130
 Very important for localized train information 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.400
 By hiring local language and local people 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.450
 We have solved this problem to some extent. 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.390
 It’s a bit like doing it inside the company. 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.603
 Always reach the most natural level 

00:04:19.603 --> 00:04:21.019
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Mother tongue check? 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.140
 Does your company conduct a mother tongue check? 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.573
 GILBERT WERDAM: Yes. 

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:26.073
 that's it 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.110
 Ok 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.070
 Everyone continues 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.210
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: For us, globalization is everything 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.850
 Because when we talk about music and lyrics 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.630
 Talking about a huge object, which can be seen from some data. 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.250
 According to statistics, the number of unique music tracks in the world 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.930
 The only thing is that each track is only counted once. 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.260
 About 4 million 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.320
 60% of them are mainly English songs 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.750
 Followed by Spanish, Chinese, Japanese 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.030
 Tracks in many other languages, such as Hindi, Portuguese, Italian, and French. 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.130
 In fact, these languages ​​do cover these languages. 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.490
 We have to cover so many languages 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.640
 Therefore, localization is a strategy that must be implemented for us. 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.450
 I mean, in terms of content 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.460
 We cover more than 80 different languages 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.220
 So the challenge we face is 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.930
 Music is basically a crowdsourcing platform 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.380
 The greater our development in a certain country 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.600
 The more... you mentioned Japan before 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.970
 Japan is very important to us 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.670
 Because the scale of our development in Japan is bigger 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.210
 The more content added by Japanese users 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.190
 We gave the user the right to localize the content. 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.870
 I want to share with you if you launch new content in your app. 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.049
 Whether it's lyrics or other content, no matter what 

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:05.340
 You must localize 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.520
 Must provide localized content 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.020
 However, as you said before, this does not mean just translating the content of the app. 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.570
 But must provide content that meets local needs 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.050
 Very representative of Brazilians who don’t like certain types of music 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.280
 Different from the Germans' preferences 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.920
 American music preferences are different from Japanese 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.090
 Therefore, we must provide content that meets local needs. 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.650
 Also protect the copyright owner’s local rights 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.700
 Because no matter where in the world, we pay the copyright owner the appropriate fee. 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.800
 But I have to say that this is for us 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.130
 Is a very critical strategy to meet the challenge 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.620
 If we can’t do it, we can’t really do business in any country. 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.180
 Just like we are in Japan, but we don’t provide Japanese lyrics. 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.960
 This is a bit... 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.140
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Did you say that your company first published the app? 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.490
 But not localized to Japanese? 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.520
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: I want to say that under normal circumstances, we will not 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.394
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I mean to launch the app first. 

00:07:05.394 --> 00:07:06.186
 Then there are product details 

00:07:06.186 --> 00:07:08.477
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: I mean, we won’t immediately 

00:07:08.477 --> 00:07:09.080
 Localize the app 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.960
 Say back to how to localize the app 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.104
 Our goal is to let users translate 

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:20.520
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: What is the translation? 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.520
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: Yes, translated content 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.180
 And the application itself 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.400
 I mean, when users complain, they will say, can someone help? 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.570
 This is also extremely important 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:36.550
 In addition to letting users use the translation tools provided by Google 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.500
 We also allow users to update local content 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.090
 I think the power to give users something to do 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.460
 And getting advice from them is very important 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.550
 Then we analyze the relevant data and listen carefully and consider the user’s suggestions. 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.490
 I think everyone mentioned here. 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.865
 There are many things you can do with Google Analytics. 

00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:59.550
 I think this is an important resource for us. 

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.430
 With it, you can analyze the steady flow of data about any country. 

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.100
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Ok 

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.258
 Next, I want to ask the representatives of the game industry to talk about it. 

00:08:09.258 --> 00:08:11.466
 MOR SHANI: Then let me point 

00:08:11.466 --> 00:08:12.867
 Something different from them 

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.200
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I want to ask a few questions about the game. 

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.731
 MOR SHANI: Ok. 

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:20.064
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I have talked about cultural adaptation. 

00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:26.090
 Or entering a new market is an act of adapting to culture. 

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.055
 Or simply called localization 

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:31.910
 I want to ask Mor. 

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.041
 How do you see this problem? 

00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:39.565
 The goal is to locate the original APK and localize a version 

00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:41.580
 Still targeting the market [inaudible] APK? 

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.850
 MOR SHANI: First 

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.320
 I think everyone wants to enter the global market. 

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.750
 We are constantly working hard and investing a lot of energy and resources. 

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.010
 Of course, we must also consider the market potential and cost. 

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.250
 After all, the installation cost is too high. 

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.160
 Therefore, as a developer who is still in the early stage of the business, we must be very focused, and good steel is used in the blade. 

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.600
 We must pay great attention to this 

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.540
 So, when Pirate King was just started 

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.230
 We must look at the problem from a strategic perspective. 

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.980
 Consider how to reduce the barriers to localization 

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.700
 Because we are a newly developed game development company. 

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.100
 Can't afford a lot of money 

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.090
 Of course, there is not much money for marketing. 

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.624
 Not much money to enter the global market 

00:09:19.624 --> 00:09:21.540
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So saving budget is the primary goal 

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.380
 MOR SHANI: Developers who have just started a business must consider these issues 

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.140
 We firmly believe that we must do our utmost to focus on developing excellent products. 

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.570
 Create beautiful products for users 

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.600
 Ensure a smooth experience 

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.780
 So I recommend everyone to listen. 

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.050
 A wonderful lecture by George Fan 

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.350
 He is the producer of Plants vs. Zombies. 

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.580
 Although the speech time is really good in 2010, I believe everyone will like it. 

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.929
 He talked about how to convince his mother to play Plants vs. Zombies. 

00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:51.970
 PopCap gave us a lot of inspiration 

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.670
 Including many wonderful processes they designed 

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.350
 George Fan also gave a detailed introduction in the lecture. 

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.360
 First interaction and localization process 

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.410
 He shared a lot of tips and very exciting ideas. 

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.330
 Even talked about how to use pop-up ads with more than eight words. 

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.020
 We realize that as a developer still in its infancy 

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.540
 We must use these techniques as soon as possible 

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.020
 We were really inspired by this process 

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.340
 Therefore, we have embedded such a process in Pirate King. 

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.610
 Later, we worked with the Google Play team 

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.310
 Developed this strategy together 

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.660
 Of course, we have a marketing team now. 

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.390
 We gradually started to enter...actually 

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.080
 Our company is located in Tel Aviv, Israel 

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.580
 So we started with the Israeli market. 

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.010
 Then start in Singapore, Malaysia 

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.150
 Conducting business in Thailand and Southeast Asia 

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.380
 No localization or special treatment for culture 

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.070
 Someone told us that we can't go through localization or special treatment for culture. 

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.970
 Direct access to the Thai market 

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.510
 We replied that we believe that products are everything 

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.790
 We firmly believe that we can bring a satisfactory experience to users. 

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.330
 Our highest record is 

00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:00.380
 Downloads in Southeast Asia alone reached 450,000 times a day 

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.060
 70% of them are downloaded through Google 

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.619
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Have you localized your landing information? 

00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:07.410
 MOR SHANI: No content is localized 

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.595
 We are only localized... 

00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:11.070
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Is the release information all in English? 

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.380
 MOR SHANI: Yes. 

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.910
 We localized a small portion of the store. 

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.310
 We take full advantage of the content community strategy 

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:22.960
 Of course, we also work closely with the Play team. 

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.160
 Pay close attention to the implementation of the strategy and then combine the two 

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.570
 The effect obtained is very significant 

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.230
 As a start-up developer 

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.640
 Must be based on specific markets and the energy and resources that can be invested 

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.370
 Focus on what you can do, then combine these factors 

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.850
 Develop a sound and effective strategy 

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.290
 Currently, we are entering the global market. 

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.230
 We now have the ability to enter the global market 

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.420
 But also pay attention to emerging markets 

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.280
 Our goal today is Latin America and the United States. 

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.930
 Of course, Europe 

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.261
 For us, the road ahead is long and we must continue to work hard. 

00:12:02.116 --> 00:12:05.100
 ANDRES BOU: We have been distributing games all over the world. 

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.960
 We will look at the situation in various countries around the world. 

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.000
 Then will always release the game based on a KPI 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.732
 Because it is easier to manage 

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:15.190
 When we started to focus specifically on certain markets 

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.890
 We will consider it comprehensively 

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.280
 The effect of all KPIs 

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.640
 Such as [inaudible], profitability, etc. 

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.520
 In addition to the core content of the game 

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.460
 We changed a lot of other content 

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.200
 We changed the cover of the Play Store, the name of the game. 

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.980
 We conduct special marketing campaigns for each market. 

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.360
 Marketing activities in different markets are very different 

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.150
 Naturally, we will work with local partners to translate 

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.250
 We will also change the icon 

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.380
 We will set different pricing for certain markets. 

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.770
 In addition, we also provide some [inaudible] or offers 

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.731
 And the solutions for different markets are different. 

00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:58.730
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Your company is outside Barcelona 

00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:59.832
 Are there other offices? 

00:12:59.832 --> 00:13:00.540
 ANDRES BOU: What? 

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.706
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Your company is outside Barcelona 

00:13:02.706 --> 00:13:03.280
 Are there other offices? 

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.720
 ANDRES BOU: We opened an office in Tokyo 

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.130
 In fact, no one is working in Tokyo. 

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.030
 But we did set up Social Point Tokyo there. 

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.220
 We very much hope to expand the scale 

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.220
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Ok 

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.675
 We only have five minutes. 

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.500
 Do you have any questions? 

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.546
 GILBERT WERDAM: Do you still have to ask between you? 

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.160
 If not, let us ask the audience. 

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.420
 Do you have any problems with each other? 

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.820
 There's none? 

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.360
 No 

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.600
 Ok 

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.230
 Let's ask the audience. 

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.584
 Do you have any questions to ask the discussion group? 

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:54.760
 Everyone can ask questions at will. 

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.410
 Ok 

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.440
 Audience: I have a question I want to ask 

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.060
 Constantly changing icons around the world to adapt to the local market 

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:07.440
 Have you ever worried? 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.820
 The company's brand consistency problem? 

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.630
 Have you ever encountered such a problem? 

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.340
 MOR SHANI: Do you mean to change the brand? 

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.770
 Audience: Yes, if you change the icon 

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.400
 And the icon has nothing to do with your brand. 

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.610
 Obviously this will change the user’s impression of the brand. 

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.610
 GILBERT WERDAM: It is for this reason 

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.440
 We have not changed the icon 

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.020
 Because it is part of the brand itself 

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.380
 Instead, I did a lot of A/B tests on the screenshots. 

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.090
 Yes, we have done a lot of A/B tests on this. 

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.650
 As for the icon, at least our situation is not changing the icon 

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.790
 But maybe the game is a bit different. 

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.330
 However, as a practical application 

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.600
 I think icons are an integral part of the brand. 

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.340
 But I really hope to experience this practice. 

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.380
 Because I will be curious if we change the icon 

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.980
 Will it produce significant results? 

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.200
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: One thing happened to us here. 

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.050
 Really scared me 

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.665
 We used a screenshot in the app. 

00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:15.650
 Make the user think of the cover of the album 

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.230
 Once, some of our screenshots were taken from Katy Perry's picture. 

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.950
 Of course, we paid royalties for all images. 

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.010
 In the picture she wears a bikini 

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.260
 It seems that there is nothing wrong with it. 

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:34.360
 As a result, we received a large number of complaints from Arab users. 

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.600
 We didn’t even think that this would happen. 

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.230
 Who can expect such a thing? 

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.360
 Who can expect this to offend others? 

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.450
 So, we started the A/B test from that time. 

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.100
 We no longer use those screenshots 

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.600
 After that we found that the situation improved a lot. 

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.140
 I think this situation is like 

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.800
 You went to a country that you don’t know 

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.900
 There may be some things that are culturally different. 

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.730
 Specific differences vary by country 

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.480
 So you have to know more about it. 

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.660
 You should ask your own users 

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:15.480
 I mean, we are developing too fast and some aspects are not well considered, so I am used to asking users for their opinions. 

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.067
 Get their feedback 

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:19.400
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: You said A/B test 

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.274
 MASSIMO CIOCIOLA: A/B testing is very practical 

00:16:21.274 --> 00:16:24.290
 I think that on this matter 

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.840
 We should all thank Google 

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.800
 As far as beta testing is concerned 

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.480
 We can all say that we got 15,000 employees for free. 

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.210
 As soon as we release the app, the user will test it immediately. 

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.540
 And provide us with feedback 

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.120
 Really great 

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.420
 Unfortunately, not all applications are using this method. 

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.310
 ANDRES BOU: For us, we are just a bit tangled 

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.050
 For example, in most promotional activities 

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.550
 We changed the icon for each country 

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.360
 In Japan, we use a specific icon 

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.980
 In Europe and the US, we use other icons. 

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.420
 In addition, we also change the icon for the same region. 

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.730
 For example, we are currently launching a new version of the game. 

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.410
 Both versions are linked 

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.770
 We replaced the previously used icon with a new icon 

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.880
 But after we made these changes 

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.579
 We are worried about whether the brand will be affected 

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:17.710
 The audience’s question is very good. 

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.319
 So we try to keep the essence of the icon 

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:25.300
 Keep the style of the icon unchanged and add a look 

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.480
 It’s like saying to the user: Hey, the game is launching new content! 

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.570
 Therefore, we take very careful consideration of brand issues when making changes on the icon. 

00:17:37.965 --> 00:17:39.590
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Someone asked here 

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:43.790
 Audience: Ok, thank you. 

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.110
 My name is Alexis and I am from eRepublik Apps. 

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:54.120
 I want to ask Andres a few questions about prices that vary from place to place. 

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.110
 How important is the price to suit the local situation? 

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.484
 For example, I am thinking 

00:17:57.484 --> 00:18:00.140
 In a country like Latin America 

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.570
 Certain types of games may be more profitable 

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.340
 Does the price really have a big impact on the local situation? 

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.420
 In addition to income, will it also affect the retention rate? 

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.140
 In addition, take your multiplayer game 

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.829
 Whether the player will be in communication 

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:16.495
 Complaining about the price? 

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:19.110
 They may say that I play so much in the US and you spend so much, our expenses are different. 

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.420
 What is the risk of this situation? 

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.450
 ANDRES BOU: We have not encountered this situation yet. 

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.670
 You mean that the complaints from users in two different regions are right? 

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.750
 For example, Latin American users have reached 20% of our DAU 

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.300
 And income only accounts for 4% of our total revenue. 

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.704
 If analyzing payment status 

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:44.120
 You’ll find payment methods for Latin American users. 

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.578
 With European users 

00:18:45.578 --> 00:18:47.860
 Or a US user’s payment method is completely different 

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.540
 So we adjusted the corresponding pricing 

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.780
 We have found income in some regions and markets 

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.850
 From 10% to 25% 

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:03.850
 What I want to say is that it is very important to understand the price. 

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.950
 I will not wait and see from the beginning. 

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.165
 I will launch the game and see what DARPU is. 

00:19:10.165 --> 00:19:11.750
 That is, the average daily revenue per user 

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.540
 Then make corresponding improvements and try to increase revenue. 

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.376
 10%, 15%, 20% [inaudible] 

00:19:17.376 --> 00:19:19.280
 REGINA CHAMMA: I want to add a little 

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.900
 I think we are actually in some areas 

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.609
 Price experiment 

00:19:24.609 --> 00:19:27.150
 For emerging markets, this is definitely a new concept. 

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.507
 I am not talking about Brazil and Latin America alone. 

00:19:29.507 --> 00:19:30.840
 But all emerging markets 

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.160
 In fact, Google has invested heavily in these markets. 

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.160
 We are not just introducing technology to these regions. 

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.180
 Still investing in human resources 

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.580
 We are expanding the consumer market 

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.940
 In fact, we are trying to guide users to buy digital goods. 

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.080
 We have not provided such guidance in Japan because people there are already used to buying digital goods. 

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.890
 We have not done this in the United States or the United Kingdom. 

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.530
 Users in these emerging markets are learning 

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:53.700
 How to use your smartphone to interact with digital goods, games, or apps 

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.420
 So actually we need to guide them 

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.180
 For example, we just launched a local payment method in Brazil and Mexico. 

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.810
 Until last year, the Play Store only accepted 

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.410
 International credit card payment 

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.680
 So this is a big effort we made 

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.880
 Not just for Latin America 

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.580
 But for all emerging markets 

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.540
 And we intend to promote it and guide users how to use it. 

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.390
 But I firmly believe that the price is adjusted specifically for certain markets. 

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.830
 Is a very important measure 

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.780
 This is very difficult for everyone because there are too many markets, right? 

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.310
 Therefore, I suggest that you prioritize 

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.970
 For example, is there a 20% install? 

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.240
 Are they from a certain market? 

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.890
 Is there a market that needs to be studied in depth? 

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:45.255
 If the answer is yes, then the strategy you should take is 

00:20:45.255 --> 00:20:49.950
 Try to understand the price that is really suitable for this market 

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.310
 And user behavior in the market 

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.720
 However, this is us 

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.770
 In the next few months or even years 

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.760
 The direction of hard work 

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.050
 If you think of most emerging markets 

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:04.030
 For example, 80% need to adjust the price, then this is a big problem. 

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.730
 We are continually working on it 

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:12.070
 Make sure users know they can spend on the Play Store 

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.180
 I think this is what we have done. 

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.980
 ANDRES BOU: In addition to pricing, there are 

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.681
 Do we have extra time? no yet? 

00:21:21.681 --> 00:21:23.840
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: We need to end the discussion. 

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.590
 If you still need to express your opinion, you can... 

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.914
 ANDRES BOU: I know Alexis, I can talk to him later. 

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:32.580
 HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Ask him later. 

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:42.404
 Thank you for participating in our seminar. 

00:21:42.404 --> 00:21:43.070
 This concludes the discussion on entering the global market. 

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:48.060
 If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. 

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.660
 And ask us questions 

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.720
 thank you all! 

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.490
 Please applaud our discussion team, thank you! 

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.290
