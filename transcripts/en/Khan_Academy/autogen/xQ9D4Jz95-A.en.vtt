00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.880
 Now we'll talk 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.040
 for the distribution of Maxwell-Boltzmann. 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.680
 This is a portrait of the scientist 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.540
 James Clark Maxwell. 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.140
 this is my favorite portrait, 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.430
 here is with his wife Catherine Maxwell and their dog. 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.640
 James Maxwell is one of the titans of physics, 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.540
 known for Maxwell's equation. 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.700
 He makes fundamental developments 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.420
 in color photography 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.720
 and think about the issue of distribution 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.520
 of particle velocities 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.020
 in an ideal gas. 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.420
 The other gentleman is Ludwig Boltzman. 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.540
 He is considered one of the founders 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.880
 of statistical mechanics. 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.980
 The distribution of Maxwell-Boltzmann bears that name, 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.640
 not because they both cooperated, 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.530
 but reach each other independently. 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.380
 Each of them describes the distribution 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.460
 of air particle velocities. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.280
 Let's get some sleep 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.560
 for a thought experiment. 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.060
 We have one court. 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.240
 Here is this. 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.120
 There is air in it. 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.560
 The air consists mainly of nitrogen. 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.720
 To make it simple, let it be full of nitrogen only. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.660
 I'll paint nitrogen molecules. 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.460
 We have a thermometer. 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.040
 I put him in court. 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 The thermometer shows 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.820
 exactly 300 degrees Kelvin. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.420
 What does 300 Kelvin mean? 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.460
 We have everyday life 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.460
 sensory temperature sensation. 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.200
 We do not want to have hot things. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.980
 Let's not get caught. 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.460
 Or too cold things to keep from trembling. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.080
 So our brain 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.300
 perceives the term temperature. 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.480
 But what happens at the molecular level? 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.820
 There is one very accurate 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.320
 way to imagine the temperature: 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.540
 in the language of physics, 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.220
 temperature 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.480
 is proportional to the average kinetic energy 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.460
 of the molecules in the given system. 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.140
 I will write it this way: 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.636
 the temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy. 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.420
 The average 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.100
 kinetic 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.740
 energy 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.700
 in the system. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.940
 I add the "Average" refinement. 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.300
 To be more specific, 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.580
 let's imagine we have two courts. 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.060
 This is one, 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.360
 and this is the other one. 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.320
 These are two other courts. 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.240
 Let's say they contain 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.820
 the same number of nitrogen gas molecules. 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.380
 I will draw 10. 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.820
 Obviously, the example is not realistic: 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.600
 in reality there are many more. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.340
 But to get an idea 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.620
 are enough at ten. 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.760
 Assume that 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.260
 the temperature here is 300 Kelvin. 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.940
 The temperature of the first system is 300 Kelvin. 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.880
 And the temperature of the second system is 200 Kelvin. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.740
 Imagine what these molecules do. 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.800
 They move around, push, 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.200
 are not in sync. 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.740
 The average kinetic energy of the molecules 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.800
 in this system is greater. 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.580
 Take this molecule. 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.840
 It can move in that direction. 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.680
 That's her speed. 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.400
 The other particle has that velocity. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.760
 Tai goes on, 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.800
 and this may almost not move. 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.100
 The next can hurry a lot. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.340
 And let this move very fast. 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.040
 This is what, 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.580
 the other, 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.132
 and this. 

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.200
 If you compare this system with this, 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.440
 you will still find a separate molecule, 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.800
 which moves very fast. 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.060
 It can even move faster 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.800
 from any molecule in the first system. 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.840
 But the average kinetic energy 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.730
 of molecules here is lower. 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.780
 For example, this does so. 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.750
 I paint ... 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.400
 Their average kinetic energy is smaller. 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.100
 This does not mean that each of these molecules 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.110
 is slower than any of the molecules in the first system, 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.160
 or has less kinetic energy than it. 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.760
 But the average kinetic energy of these is smaller. 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.920
 We can draw a distribution curve. 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.600
 We call that 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.382
 distribution of Maxwell-Boltzmann. 

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:15.110
 Let's do it. 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.700
 We draw a coordinate system. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.840
 This is mine. 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.160
 On this axis I will display the speed. 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.140
 Like this. 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.532
 And the other axis will be the number of molecules. 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.720
 Number of molecules here. 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.020
 For the first system, which is at 300 Kelvin, 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.092
 distribution may look like this. 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.840
 Now I will draw an example distribution. 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.740
 Let me use a different color. 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.820
 This is how they are distributed 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.840
 all molecules in the system 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.240
 by number according to your speed. 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.880
 Like this, 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.340
 this is the distribution of Maxwell-Boltzmann 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.172
 for this system, 

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:07.928
 to call it system A. 

00:05:07.928 --> 00:05:10.428
 This is the one here. 

00:05:10.428 --> 00:05:14.420
 The other system, which has a lower temperature, 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.238
 which means that it has lower kinetic energy, 

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:19.676
 there is another distribution of its particles. 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.520
 Most likely with her 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.520
 the largest number of molecules 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.900
 have a lower speed. 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.400
 For example, 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.700
 here. 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.600
 Its distribution appears to be 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.960
 in such a way. 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.800
 I draw it in yellow. 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.280
 Surely it seems logical, 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.700
 that the speed at which I will have the most molecules 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.520
 in system B will be lower, 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.140
 than the speed with most molecules in system A. 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.120
 This is because the average kinetic 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.040
 energy here is lower. 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.235
 The average speed is smaller. 

00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:00.184
 But why is the tip here higher? 

00:06:00.184 --> 00:06:01.800
 Let's recall the two systems 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.440
 have the same number of molecules. 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.350
 Thus 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.910
 the areas under both curves must be equal. 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.900
 Once this curve is narrower, it should be higher. 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.760
 If we increase 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.380
 the temperature of this system even more, 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.780
 For example, if I warm it up 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.020
 to 400 degrees Kelvin, 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.120
 then the distribution 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.470
 will be so. 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.300
 This is for a higher temperature system. 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.800
 Heated system. 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.620
 This is the distribution of Maxwell-Boltzmann. 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.500
 I will not show his complex equation, 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.840
 but this is its essence. 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.520
 And it's a pretty logical idea. 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.010
 When you think about speed 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.600
 of individual particles, for example by air, 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.060
 you may seem seemingly motionless. 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.700
 But imagining that the air around you is mostly nitrogen, 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.660
 you can understand the most probable speed 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.400
 of an arbitrary nitrogen molecule 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.618
 from the air around you. 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.220
 I will now write 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.520
 its most likely speed. 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.039
 You may be surprised. 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.780
 At room temperature, 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.780
 possible speed 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.154
 of the nitrogen molecule 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.620
 at room temperature. 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.400
 Let's say this is the distribution 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.840
 of Maxwell-Boltzmann for nitrogen at room temperature. 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.620
 In our example, 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.450
 that the room temperature is 300 Kelvin. 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.870
 Most likely speed 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.120
 is the one for which we have the largest number of molecules, 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.580
 who are moving 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.420
 at such a speed. 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.980
 Try first to know what it is before telling you: 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.635
 may be surprising! 

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.930
 It turns out that at temperature 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.690
 300 kelvin this speed is approximately 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.846
 422 meters per second! 

00:07:57.846 --> 00:08:00.510
 A total of 422 meters in one second! 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.220
 Imagine how something goes 422 meters for just a second. 

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.700
 In the more familiar unit of measurement, 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.700
 it's over 1500 kilometers per hour! 

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.927
 So right now 

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.850
 around you 

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.120
 the largest number 

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.080
 of the nitrogen molecules 

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.740
 move at speed around this 

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.280
 and they hit you. 

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.860
 This is what creates the air pressure. 

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.600
 And not only at such a speed, there are molecules, 

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.190
 which move faster than that. 

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.300
 Faster and 422 meters per second. 

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.200
 Much faster. 

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.730
 Some of the particles around you are moving 

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.210
 thousands of miles an hour 

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.980
 and they hit you in your body at that moment. 

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.650
 You may wonder why it does not hurt? 

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.040
 This gives you an idea of ​​how small the table is 

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.870
 of the nitrogen molecule, 

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.360
 when he pushes you with thousands of miles an hour 

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.640
 and yet you do not feel it. 

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.400
 It only feels like ambient air pressure. 

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.020
 At first glance, it seems unimaginable: 

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.300
 422 meters per second, 

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.510
 is this faster than the speed of the sound? 

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.440
 The sound moves at approximately 340 meters per second. 

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.780
 How is that possible? 

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:06.860
 Just think about it. 

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.220
 The sound spreads over the air, 

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.970
 by the collisions of its particles. 

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.980
 Therefore, air particles, 

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.780
 or at least some of them, 

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.780
 should move faster than the sound. 

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.500
 Well, not everything around you 

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.740
 is moving so fast 

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.840
 and in different directions; 

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.280
 some particles may be almost immobile. 

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:26.520
 But some of them move extremely fast. 

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.800
 Is not that great?
