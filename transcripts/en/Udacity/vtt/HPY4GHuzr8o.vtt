00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.348
So, how does a neuron work? To answer that, we first need to know the different

00:00:03.348 --> 00:00:07.676
parts of the neuron, because each has a different function. Then, we can take a

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:12.935
more detailed look at precisely how the neuron fires. Which is what we call an

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:16.786
action potential. First, we have the cell body or the soma, it contains the

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.934
nucleus and genetic information, along with components for the maintenance and

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:26.395
function of the neuron. These are the dendrites. They're finger-like branches

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:31.510
that project from the soma to connect to other neurons and receive messages.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.780
Extending out from the soma, on the opposite side of the dendrites, is the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.132
axon. The axon transmits electrical impulses towards adjacent neurons and

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:45.688
stimulates the release of what we call neurotransmitters, we'll get to those in

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:51.518
a second. Some axons have a myelin sheath wrapped around them. The myelin

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:56.290
sheath insulates the axon and makes the nerve impulse more effective. At the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.745
end of each axon are the axon terminals, and the terminal buttons. The terminal

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:07.510
buttons contain tiny vesicles or sacs that contain neurotransmitters. Now, I'm

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.560
going to zoom into these terminal buttons so we can get a closer look at the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.639
neighboring neuron and how the two connect.
