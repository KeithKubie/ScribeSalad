00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.680
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic! I remember it so YOU don't have to!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.400
And welcome to another installment of: "Was That Real?"

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.480
Not utilizing an incredibly popular icon is like not utilizing an incredibly convenient cameo.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.000
Hey, you got any water around here?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.340
[Angry Video Game Nerd] Ohhhh, you want some WATER, yeah?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.680
*splash*

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.780
[Critic] MC Hammer is one of those people.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.400
Known as the music you play at a wedding when you want to show how IRONICALLY white you are,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.560
MC Hammer used to be everywhere!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.860
He had the number one rap album, concert, show appearances, commercials...

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.140
He was all over the place!

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.020
[MC Hammer] Now that's the way the Hammer runs for the border!

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.720
[Critic] And at the height of his popularity came what many consider to be the most EMBARRASSING part of his entire career,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.100
and that's saying a lot!

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.760
The MC Hammer cartoon: Hammerman!

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.600
[MC Hammer] ♪ Hammerman! Hammer!
Hammerman! Hammer!
Hammerman! Hammer! ♪

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.200
Yep, this really happened!

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.540
In 1991, we got a Saturday morning cartoon SO ridiculously bad, that...

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.260
well, we're talking about it here.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.720
Give Vanilla Ice some credit: HE didn't even put a Saturday morning cartoon on TV!

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.760
No, he put his on the BIG screen to embarrass himself!

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.840
It ran for only 13 episodes, and you can QUICKLY see why.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.880
The cheapness value of this show is AWARD-winningly lazy!

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.640
...in that I JUST made up an award to grant it, so I could give it that title!

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.780
Just LOOK at how half-assed this is!

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.220
Did they skip the animation process and just color the storyboards?

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.080
Look at this! They didn't even finish this half of him in the opening!

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.480
Kids would see that every week! You couldn't just move him a little to the RIGHT??

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.540
THAT was too much effort for you?!

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.860
But don't take MY word for it!

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.940
Probably the BIGGEST testament to this show's self-aware humiliation,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.260
is that they spend as much time as possible NOT showing you the cartoon!

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.660
Take the intro for example:

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.200
Most of it focuses on Hammer himself rather than showing much animation.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.100
And tell me if this doesn't feel like the LONGEST, most DRAWN-OUT rap ever!

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.860
After almost A MINUTE AND A HALF of that intro, we then cut to the REAL Hammer dancing with some kids.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.460
Theeen after that, we cut to Hammer AGAIN, literally telling you what you're about to see!

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.760
No! He gives the WHOLE EPISODE away!

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.360
[MC Hammer] Jodie goes all around O-Town, putting graffiti everywhere on everybody's property, and she gets in trouble.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.960
The graffiti comes alive!

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.480
[Kids] What?!
[MC Hammer] I wasn't supposed to tell you that.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.000
[Critic] Sometimes, he even reveals the lesson before you're supposed to learn it!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.100
[MC Hammer] Anybody like graffiti?

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.320
[Kids] No!!!
[MC Hammer] Because most people put it where they're not supposed to.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.660
Now, it CAN be good,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.580
but it's not right when you put it on other people's property, and that's what the show is all about today.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.020
[Critic] Why the fuck would you say the message first, if you're gonna spend the majority of the show HAMMERING it away?!?!

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.160
[MC Hammer] We kicking it off today!

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.140
[Critic] After we cut to even MORE kids dancing,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.760
We FINALLY start the cartoon that's gonna teach you the lesson Hammer just taught you a second ago.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.320
But don't worry... if SOMEHOW you miss the lesson in the beginning AND throughout the rest of the episode,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.260
Hammer pops up AGAIN to tell you once more what it is!

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.580
[MC Hammer] Tagging somebody else's property with graffiti is illegal, and it's wrong.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.840
[Critic] I don't think GAS STATIONS fill this much!

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.860
[MC Hammer] So next time you feel like doing a little artwork, do it on some paper.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.660
And who knows? You might end up drawing on a cartoon like Hammerman one day!

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.720
[Critic] NOOOOO!!! You got it the other way around!! That should be the PUNISHMENT for kids doing graffiti!

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.060
The story, if you missed that Lord of the Rings-length opening,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.400
is about a youth leader named Stanley Burrell, which is Hammer's real name,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.860
who comes across an old man named Gramps and his granddaughter, Jodie.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.800
Gramps has a pair of magic talking shoes...

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.600
I'm just gonna assume they sound annoying...

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.500
[Annoying-Sounding Shoe #1] You were looking at my cards!
[Annoying-Sounding Shoe #2] Was not!
[Annoying-Sounding Shoe #1] Were too!

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.240
[Critic] That's all we need.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.980
They used to transform Gramps into a superhero named Soulman.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.300
But he's retired and looking for a replacement,

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.040
and of course, Stanley literally fills his shoes, and becomes the superhero Hammerman!

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.540
What are his secret powers?

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.320
Well, aside from making the choppy animation look more shitty than a CD-i game,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.560
it's actually kind of hard to tell.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.120
We know he can make objects dance to his music and parachute with his pants,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.960
but aside from that, it seems to be relying on the vague properties of animated music notes.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.540
He also seems to have backup singers, which at first, sounds kind of cool!

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.300
Like, you know, a few sidekicks to help him kick some ass or something.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.020
But, nope! They LITERALLY just sing backup! They don't contribute at all!

[Critic] Yeah, what are their lives like?

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.280
Do they just sit around in alleyways and eat out of garbage waiting for something to get the material to sing about?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.020
[Backup Singers] WHOOOOAA! Whooa-whoa!

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.680
[Critic] But a hero is only as pathetic as his villains, and these are some pretty lousy ones indeed!

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.380
The lineup includes Defacely Mar-Meister, who brings graffiti monsters to life,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.420
Rap-poleon, who wants to shrink the world so that he's taller than everyone else,

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.740
and Paula Onion.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.460
She steals SHOES!

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.500
Monster!

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.980
As you'd imagine, their character development was on par with ANYTHING Batman: The Animated Series was putting out.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.160
[Stanley] You're just doing this because you had an unhappy childhood. You want to talk about it?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160
[Defacely] NO!!!

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.200
[Critic] ...And that's all you need! Two-Face has got NOTHING on THAT backstory!

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.800
They always partake in two pastimes:

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.020
1) Scheming up plans that make no sense,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.100
like drawing graffiti and bringing it to life to rob banks, when you could...

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.160
just draw money and bring THAT to life!

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.580
And kidnapping Jodie.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.880
Yeah, she's the pawn sacrifice most kids' shows used to have.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.380
[Jodie] Put me down! You're asking for it!

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.780
[Critic] Half the time, Hammerman doesn't even need to save her! The bad animation does it FOR him!

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.680
Look at here: "Oh, she's tied up. Who'll save me? Ahhhhh..."

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.040
But literally the next scene, she's just FREE and she runs away!

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.800
What the hell happened there?! Were the villains just like:

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.460
(imitating villain) "Is that too tight? Let me untie that for you."

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.080
"You want a pillow? I can get you a pillow."

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.300
"You want me to just turn myself in? I would LOVE to turn myself in for you!"

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.780
"No? Okay. I-if you could just fill out this survey, please give me ten outta ten, that'd be great!"

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.800
"And hey, if you turn that in the next time you get kidnapped, you get a free cookie!"

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.940
She wouldn't be TOO bad if she was a better character,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.700
but this is ONE DUMB KID!

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.980
She NEVER puts together that both Stanley AND Hammerman are the same person!

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.500
How the FUCK is that humanly possible?!?!

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.480
Even Clark Kent took his glasses off! He doesn't even have the energy to do THAT!!

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.300
[Jodie] Hammerman! Ohhh, I missed him again!

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.760
[Critic] And, okay, even IF puffy pants SOMEHOW manage to disguise a person's identity,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.360
she KNOWS about the MAGIC SHOES!!

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.460
[Gramps] Now I know life's been real hard on her,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.240
spending all that time traveling around with me, looking for the right person to wear them shoes.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.980
[Critic] Yeah! Remember? In the intro, they clearly explained that she's helping Gramps to find a replacement for a superhero!

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.940
And... SUDDENLY a superhero wearing those shoes who looks like her friend Stanley pops up--

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.560
SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?!

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.340
Is his... SEIZURE dancing REALLY too distracting to put two and two together?!

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.720
But I know what you're thinking:

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.200
Does any of that REALLY matter when we get to listen to some of the INCREDIBLE rap that Hammer is capable of?

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.000
[Hammerman] Yo, you guys are livin' small,
but hey, let's play some basketball!

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.400
Gotta fill my minor rap! 
I can't afford to let it nap!

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.020
Everything is in control!
Time for me to hip-hop stroll!

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.560
[Critic] Clearly, yes. That's a hard yes.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.680
Half the time the sound design is so bad, you can't even HEAR the rap!

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:30.000
♪ [muffled, indistinct rapping] ♪

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.340
And like I said, even when you CAN, you're MOSTLY wishing you couldn't.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.860
[Hammerman] I've had it with these crooks, they give me indigestion!

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.300
They're headed back to jail, about that there's no question!

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.460
This is not an effect! I'm a rapper, not a hair donor!

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.580
[Critic] What does that even MEAN?

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.860
Maybe that's why they spell out the sound effects all the time.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.620
They're afraid too many people WON'T do their job and just FORGET to put the ACTUAL sound effect in!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.140
Or they'd figure that the show was just so damn crazy, that nobody would even care!

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.360
And they were right!

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.080
From terrible writing to some of the most low-budget animation available...

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.580
Oh, for God's sake, I CAN SEE THROUGH HIM!!!

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.980
Hammerman is an anomaly you have to see to believe.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.920
You'd swear this was like a PARODY on MadTV or SNL!

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.920
But, no! It's the TV equivalent of Bébé's Kids!

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.000
.....the GAME!

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.080
There's apparently no plans to put the show on DVD, but truth be told...

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.340
That's kind of to our loss!

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.240
Something SO LAZY to the point of surrealism should be remembered!

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.220
It should be documented just for the curiosity of how fascinatingly desperate we can get to put a name on anything!

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.670
Hammerman is just as bad as it sounds,

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.860
but, truth be told, it kind of makes it more fun to watch!

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.120
If you're in the mood for one of the most EMBARRASSING excuses to make a show EVER,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.160
This is definitely one worth the search.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.620
So look online, find those VHS's, and check it out for yourself.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.980
doesn't always mean you necessarily should.

Hey guys, Doug Walker here. Two things to address:

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.500
First off, you might be wondering "Is that the review for this week"?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.620
Uhhh, NO. It actually is NOT.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.160
We needed one more week... on this review,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.900
uh, because it's a review we've kind of wanted to do for a while, and we...

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.760
were trying to put as much effort into it as we can, 'cuz we really wanna get as close to right as possible.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.760
Uh, so yeah. We're taking one more week on this review,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.100
but it'll definitely show... uh, in the final product,

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.220
uh, so look forward to that!

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:05.320
And then of course second, we are doing the Charity Shout-out, and the charity this week is Charity: Water.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.980
And this is a charity that does exactly that:

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:15.720
it gets clean fresh water to people, particularly in third-world countries that don't have access to it, and that's crazy!

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.320
EVERYONE should have access to free, clean water. That is VITAL as what you need to survive,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:28.080
and... it's basically like being punished because of where you were born, not having something that essential.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.980
And this charity goes and they get clean water to these people.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:37.520
They're starting a NEW campaign this MONTH trying to help raise awareness, and you can help as well.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.500
It's just something where you can do anything you want!

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.180
You can bike, you can draw, you can do a triathlon, you can do pretty much anything,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.360
to help raise awareness and raise money and show support for this wonderful cause.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.480
And it's something that's going on right now, and you can go to their website...

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.460
and check it out, and you can see what you can do.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:04.080
It's a wonderful chance to do just ALL sorts of various options to raise awareness of this...

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.460
and the money all goes to getting water to people that really, really need it.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.000
That just need good, clean water to survive to live and to be healthy.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.560
It's the most vital thing you need! It's what we ALL need, and this is a charity that's trying to get it to everybody.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.600
So please, if you have a chance, definitely go check out this website, and see if you can show them your support.
