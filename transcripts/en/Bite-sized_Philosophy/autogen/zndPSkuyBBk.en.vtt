hard for one person to be everything
right you know and I think one of the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
right you know and I think one of the
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.119
right you know and I think one of the
conundrums that face women and this is a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
conundrums that face women and this is a
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.560
conundrums that face women and this is a
tough one and this is why I think women

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
tough one and this is why I think women
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.000
tough one and this is why I think women
are higher and trade agreeableness and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
are higher and trade agreeableness and
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709
are higher and trade agreeableness and
higher and trade negative emotion is

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
higher and trade negative emotion is
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.740
higher and trade negative emotion is
that you know the primary problem that a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
that you know the primary problem that a
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600
that you know the primary problem that a
woman has with an infant is why not

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
woman has with an infant is why not
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.399
woman has with an infant is why not
throw it out a window because it's very

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
throw it out a window because it's very
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.050
throw it out a window because it's very
annoying right I mean it's it's there

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
annoying right I mean it's it's there
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910
annoying right I mean it's it's there
all the time it's constant demand it's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
all the time it's constant demand it's
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950
all the time it's constant demand it's
absolutely constant a man tremendous

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
absolutely constant a man tremendous
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.980
absolutely constant a man tremendous
dependency and so a woman has to be

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
dependency and so a woman has to be
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.350
dependency and so a woman has to be
tilted towards mercy that's how it looks

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
tilted towards mercy that's how it looks
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600
tilted towards mercy that's how it looks
to me right and especially during it's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
to me right and especially during it's
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340
to me right and especially during it's
so important during the especially the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
so important during the especially the
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.690
so important during the especially the
first year when children are so

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
first year when children are so
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.550
first year when children are so
unbelievably vulnerable and so I think

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
unbelievably vulnerable and so I think
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380
unbelievably vulnerable and so I think
it's very difficult for women to be

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
it's very difficult for women to be
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.929
it's very difficult for women to be
merciful like that and to make the shift

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
merciful like that and to make the shift
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.050
merciful like that and to make the shift
to encouraging disciplinarian I think

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
to encouraging disciplinarian I think
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399
to encouraging disciplinarian I think
that's a very difficult thing for people

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
that's a very difficult thing for people
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.550
that's a very difficult thing for people
to do simultaneously although you know

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
to do simultaneously although you know
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920
to do simultaneously although you know
people people I'm not saying that women

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
people people I'm not saying that women
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.780
people people I'm not saying that women
are always only merciful and men are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
are always only merciful and men are
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.940
are always only merciful and men are
always only encouraging disciplinarians

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
always only encouraging disciplinarians
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.980
always only encouraging disciplinarians
but things do sort themselves out to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
but things do sort themselves out to
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690
but things do sort themselves out to
some degree like that and I think also

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
some degree like that and I think also
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969
some degree like that and I think also
the biochemical transformations that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
the biochemical transformations that
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.950
the biochemical transformations that
accompany pregnancy and childbirth and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
accompany pregnancy and childbirth and
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.469

of course famous observation is that you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980
of course famous observation is that you
 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.729
of course famous observation is that you
know if there's mom and child were

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739
know if there's mom and child were
 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.740
know if there's mom and child were
farther in child that relationship can

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750
farther in child that relationship can
 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.479
farther in child that relationship can
get a little closer than it should and

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489
get a little closer than it should and

then the lions get blurry and mixed and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040
then the lions get blurry and mixed and
 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.890
then the lions get blurry and mixed and
I'm not saying that that happens to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900
I'm not saying that that happens to
 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.339

everyone

without sufficient resources and so the
responsibility has to be distributed

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389
responsibility has to be distributed
 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.030

more and like I really do think that

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
more and like I really do think that
