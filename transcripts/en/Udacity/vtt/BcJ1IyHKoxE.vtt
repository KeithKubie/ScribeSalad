00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.310
Now let's discuss the solution to our two bit

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.800
predictor quiz. We have a two bit predictor like

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.201
this. The question is, is there a sequence of

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:11.685
branch outcomes, such that this predictor, starting in the

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:15.390
strong note taken state always mispredicts. And the answer

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.620
is of course yes. Every single predictor has the

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.960
worst case scenario of always mispredicting. What you have

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.490
to do to find out what that worst-case scenario

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.660
is, is simply design a sequence such that whatever

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.360
the state of the predictor is, the sequence goes

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
the opposite way. So, we start in the strong

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.530
not taken state, thus the first decision will be taken,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.370
and that will take us to a weak not

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.716
taken state. The predictor will still predict not taken,

00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:48.410
so we make the branch be taken next time.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.440
Now the predictor goes to the weak taken state and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.110
now we know how to cause the alternation between the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.760
states. So in the weak taken state, we go not taken.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.890
It moves to weak not taken, now we say taken and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.300
so on. So you can just keep doing this. So pretty

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.290
much, even if we do start in a strong taken

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.460
state, there is a way to move us to a weak

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.870
state, at which point we can do this alternation. Note that

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.480
for this particular sequence, there is a way to change this

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.845
predictor so that this behavior doesn't result in

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:24.240
100% misprediction. But in general, every predictor no

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.551
matter how it's organized, will always have some

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:31.190
sequence as it's worst possible outcome. It's just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.520
a matter of how likely is that sequence.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.628
A good predictor will not have this worst

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.550
case behavior for some thing that is a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.060
very likely sequence to happen. So again, every predictor

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.450
has a worst-case scenario where it's doing 100% mispredictions.
