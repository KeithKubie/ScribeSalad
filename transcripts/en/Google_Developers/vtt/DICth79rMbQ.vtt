BRIAN GRADY: Stephen Fromkin
is a VR 360 video producer.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.840
He has been at it for a
bit longer than anybody

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.198
else that I know.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:14.530
And I am so happy that you'd
agree to come down-- or up,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.030
I guess.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.030
You came up and [INAUDIBLE]--
came up to do this for us.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.162
So Steve, I am not going
to waste any more time.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.090
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Thank you.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.018
BRIAN GRADY: You're welcome.

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:24.143
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Thank you.

00:00:24.143 --> 00:00:24.874
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.440
Thank you, Brian, and
everyone for having me.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.200
It's been a really fun day.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.380
And I've had a
great time listening

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.020
to Neil, Todd, and Jolly.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.300
And I'm going to
add a little bit

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.910
that I think will touch upon
probably what each of them

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.690
had said and
hopefully expand on it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.790
a little bit for each of you.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.970
I'm going to do so by
starting with a little video.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.330
And hopefully, the
sound that comes out,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.200
pipes through, will
be powerful enough.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.020
So the background
on this is we were

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.530
asked to help Visa do
some 360 video for an app

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.860
for the Olympics last year.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.530
And this was the product
that-- part of what

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.920
this video is, it's
obviously 16 by 9.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.660
But what it's going
to show within it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.030
is some of the behind
the scenes, the results,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.630
and the experiences.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.690
But because it came out of
an app, the final audio,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.920
it's a little tinny.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.410
So hopefully, bear with that,
but it's pretty interesting.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.944
They did a really great job.

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:41.856
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:45.680
-Ever fly down a mountain
at 90 miles per hour,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.680
or dance on ice across ice,
or jump through the air

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.670
the length of a football field?

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.990
For Olympic athletes,
that's everyday training.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.700
But for the rest of us,
there's the Visa 360 Cam.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.170
It's the first mobile app that
brings wearable technology,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.366
mobile capabilities, and
interactive 360 video together

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:14.260
to get fans close to the
athletes the way only Visa can

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.055
and reinforce the brand
positioning everywhere

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:19.660
you want to be.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.310
It all started
with the athletes.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.774
We rigged them up with as
many cameras as we could.

00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:27.710
Then we turned them loose
to do what they do best.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.924
We took that footage
and stitched together

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:34.106
a panoramic 360-degree sphere.

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:36.074
It works with your
device's gyroscope.

00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.534
By tilting and moving
your mobile device,

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:40.986
you can control the
camera's perspective.

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:41.486
Look up.

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:43.000
Look down.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.860
Look behind, to the side.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.257
You'll see what the
athlete sees and here what

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:50.480
goes through their mind as they
train for the Winter Games.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.700
By toggling between 360,
face and follow cams,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.400
users get new perspectives
on Olympic training.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.899
-[LAUGHS]

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.620
-Even the athletes
were surprised.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.485
They were able to see things
they had never seen before.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:05.465
And fans reacted in kind.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:09.425
In just 30 days, over
300,000 downloaded the app.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:12.890
It was a front-page feature
on the iTunes store.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.860
And then it went global in
over a hundred countries,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.310
from Canada to Japan to Russia,
and places like Google Creative

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.810
Sandbox.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.305
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.013
STEPHEN FROMKIN: OK,
I'm going to stop it

00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:24.570
because short on time.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.140
And their app was wonderful.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.840
It did great, all the metrics.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.670
Hooray.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.510
But the point of that
was those athletes

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.880
had an experience because
VR, because of 360 video,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.886
that they didn't see coming.

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:44.100
OK, strap this rig to my head.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.050
Great, I'll ski
down the mountain.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.390
And the product was, I had
no idea I was doing that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.835
with my foot, because they were
able to watch, turn around,

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:58.480
and say, oh, never knew that.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.610
And so the power of
VR, as we all know,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.310
is somewhat still growing.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.810
We can imagine it,
but we don't know

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.800
exactly what it's going to be.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.460
But this was one of those
scenarios where it happened.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.760
And this was one of those
moments that really reinforces

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.060
what we're all doing and
why maybe a lot of us

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.620
are interested in this.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.845
So real quick, here's what
I'm going to go through.

00:04:26.845 --> 00:04:33.020
I'll give you a real quick
background on me, on what I do,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.450
and give you a little bit of
some of the tech about 360

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.682
video production.

00:04:38.682 --> 00:04:40.140
And then I'll tell
you a little bit

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.140
about what my day-to-day is like
and why maybe I have something

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.208
of value to share with you.

00:04:48.208 --> 00:04:49.540
You can decide on that.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.740
So my background is in
physical production.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.200
I started traditional
media line producing.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.720
I got quickly into
post-production pipelines

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.840
and visual effects.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.830
And I've been doing that for--
[CLEARS THROAT] excuse me.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.490
I've been doing that
for over 15 years.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:20.060
And then about three years ago,
I worked on a 360 video job.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.970
I had no idea what it was.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.040
And since then, I
did a number of them.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.080
And at the end of
last year, I started

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.575
working for a company
called Verse and did

00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:31.990
a few projects there.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.770
And then this year in January,
I began working with 360Heros

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.290
and now service their
head of production.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:45.810
So what that means is I'm on
the phone generally four to five

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.330
times a day having
a conversation that

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.230
goes a little bit like, we
want to do this production.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.030
And we want to do
it with 360 as well.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.350
And that's where
you put the cameras

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.310
on the outside of the
room and shoot in, right?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.900
And we say, no, not really.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.420
And then it starts with
the technical conversation.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.165
So how many folks-- just
to create a baseline,

00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:14.300
how many folks have shot 360?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.830
We've already--
OK, there's a few.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.140
Good.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.900
So 360Heros makes these.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.520
Our owner and founder invented
this little rig right here.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.530
It was the first one
that went to market

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.260
about three years ago.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.800
And it's since sold
over 6,500 through just

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.420
an online e-commerce
type store and since then

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.984
has made multiple versions.

00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:40.025
This is a six-camera rig.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.750
That's a seven-camera rig.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.460
And this is one live-action
solution, live-action data

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.840
capture solution, for 360 video.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.510
We also do some other parts
of the technical workflow

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.240
because as we
started to shoot, we

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.340
started to realize, well,
what about media management?

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.340
There are six times as
many files for every take.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.500
There's seven times.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.400
We have a 10-camera
rig, a 12-camera rig,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.250
and a 14-camera rig.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.560
And so obviously, media
management became a thing.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.900
And so we've been playing with
and experimenting and evolving

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.830
as we've grown.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.420
But to make sure
everybody understands

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.121
a little bit about-- I'm
going to actually skip

00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.620
this video because we've already
seen something very similar

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.670
to this.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.790
And I'm going to skip that
because I think you all

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.070
get this.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:41.420
So I'm going to go straight
to this because this

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.610
is what 360 video is like.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.290
It's truly a visual
effects workflow.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.520
It's the theta that we
were looking at earlier.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.900
And some of the other rigs
out there are fantastic.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.010
They do some unbelievable
things on the fly.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.670
Where a jump is
going is outrageous.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.190
It's exciting.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.560
But ultimately, they're
all common in that they're

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.480
a compromise.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.520
These two, these are a massive
compromise because I can only

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.590
get so much resolution.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.810
I can get a lot.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.220
I can get a little
bit more than some

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.740
of the rigs that are out there,
but it's all a compromise.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.122
And the reason is
we are shooting--

00:08:29.122 --> 00:08:35.945
and I think it was the picture
of the skyline that we saw.

00:08:35.945 --> 00:08:39.000
It was a 2D image,
but it was clearly 3D.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.004
Well, now we're shooting
with cameras that

00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:45.370
have separated nodal points.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.770
And so we're creating
parallax issues.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.874
And the only-- everybody
knows what parallax is?

00:08:50.874 --> 00:08:51.374
Yeah?

00:08:51.374 --> 00:08:52.190
OK.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.610
So if you have an array like
this or anything similar,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.630
you're going to have
to deal with parallax.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.380
You're going to have
to deal with the fact

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.060
that when objects in motion--
people, whatever it is--

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:13.510
cross a scene at different
layers, it's still a 2D image.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.315
It doesn't understand Z depth.

00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:17.630
It's still a 2D image.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.950
And for that reason,
it becomes somewhat

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.110
of a visual effects workflow.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.800
So you can choose how you
want to solve the compromise.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.100
There's that rig there was
done over at Panavision.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.680
And there are a
lot of those rigs.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.150
Those are a bunch of Reds.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.920
And I can only imagine
the fantastic resolution

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.700
that would come out of that.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.240
But that's not going to amount
to a hockey player's helmet.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.580
So just like when
you go shoot, you

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.690
decide what is it
that's most important.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.930
Is it resolution?

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.340
Am I going to shoot a baseball
game or such a wide landscape

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.160
that I need that resolution,
I need to use the Red Dragon?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.355
Or can I get away with
something smaller?

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:08.480
And do I need some smaller
because I am mounting it

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.524
to a head or a car, or I'm
walking around with it?

00:10:11.524 --> 00:10:13.160
And so these are
the conversations

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.510
that I-- these are some
of the conversations

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.190
that I'm having everyday.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:23.660
And they start with the
technical challenges

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.100
that generally surround the
idea, as I said, with parallax.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:34.500
With most of these camera rigs,
you're-- and as you may or may

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.140
not know, these were made
for, designed for, GoPros--

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.630
fantastic, tiny little device
with great resolution and great

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.120
frame rate.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.450
So why is frame rate important?

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.270
If I shoot at 30, I can
get maximum resolution.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.260
Well, sure.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.710
You could shoot all of these
at 2.7K or 4K and on a six rig,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.807
get a 24K file.

00:11:00.807 --> 00:11:03.390
But you're probably not going
to be able to do much with that.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:09.090
I mean, you can save it for
like 2016, or 2020 even,

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.340
when we actually screen those.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.290
But for now, what you want to
do is have a higher frame rate.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.960
Why?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.580
Because with a rig
like this, we're

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.200
not talking about genlock.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.930
We're not talking
about cameras that

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.540
are in sync with each
other, with a black burst

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.780
generator or any other device.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.720
And therefore, they
need to be sunk in post.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.890
They need to be sunk
in your workflow.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.230
So that's, again, one
of the challenges--

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.510
or one of the compromises.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.630
You go and you use the Red
rig and tie it all together

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.400
with Lockit boxes.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.670
Great.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.170
Brilliant.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.050
So there's lots of
different solutions.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.620
It just depends on
what you're shooting.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.290
So let's talk about that.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.952
And this is really
sort of where I

00:11:53.952 --> 00:11:56.410
want to spend most of the time,
which is why I kind of blew

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.720
through a lot of that stuff.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:08.300
So I get into conversations
on a daily basis that

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:14.360
are from either from agencies,
[INAUDIBLE] agencies,

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:23.370
or producers, or just folks who
are really excited about VR.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:28.022
And they have a project that
they want to talk about.

00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:29.730
And they want to figure
out how to do it.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.990
And they want to know if
they should do it themselves,

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.820
they should hire us to help
them with production services,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.767
or a they can just do a hybrid.

00:12:37.767 --> 00:12:38.600
What should they do?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.850
How should they get this done?

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.690
So based on the
folks in the room,

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.140
let me share some
of these stories.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.697
And the first one I
want to share-- well,

00:12:49.697 --> 00:12:51.030
I'm going to leave it up to you.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.020
What's more
important to you all?

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.840
The scenario where-- and
this down here at the bottom,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.200
narrative is where I'm
tempted to talk a little bit

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.750
about based on everything
Neil started with and some

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:11.294
of the fantastic notes
from Todd about editorial.

00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:12.710
So I'm going to
go with narrative.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.480
We cool with that?

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.480
I'm going to start there, OK?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.590
So I get a call.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:21.410
I get a call, and they say,
we want to shoot a short film.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.650
And it's really just two scenes.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.060
And we want to
shoot an interior,

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.030
and there's really just
going to be one guy and then

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.780
another character.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.970
And then we want to
shoot an exterior.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.330
And it's like a crime scene.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.890
OK, well, what's
your point of view?

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.827
Is it mounted to a person?

00:13:42.827 --> 00:13:43.368
I don't know.

00:13:43.368 --> 00:13:44.784
Maybe.

00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:46.680
Should it be
mounted to a person?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.300
That's what the content creator
needs to kind of understand.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.140
So as a content creator,
you're thinking--

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.500
and they don't always
know this right away--

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.430
should I mount it and
make it a point of view?

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.956
Or is it just a fly on
the wall type of scenario?

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:01.830
Sorry, I'm wandering.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.390
I'm supposed to stay
near this for the video.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.890
Sorry.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.564
So Brian, I told you you can
yell at me when I wander.

00:14:07.564 --> 00:14:08.980
BRIAN GRADY: I
don't like to yell.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.063
STEPHEN FROMKIN: I wander.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.770
So the question of camera
position is actually valid.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:23.360
What makes sense for the shot?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.190
And is it always the same?

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:29.180
In one scene, is it
mounted to a person?

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.870
And in another, is it not?

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:39.760
The-- was it Neil who
was showing us the video,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.777
the CGI video, where the police
officer, we're tracking him.

00:14:45.777 --> 00:14:46.610
We're following him.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.390
And wham, now we are him.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.800
That's an interesting approach.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.760
But is that what the
content creator wants?

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.850
I don't know.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.550
I'm telling you about a call
I literally had the other day

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.630
so we don't know yet.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.330
We don't know where
this is going to end.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.210
The next question
is, well, where are

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.170
you going to put this media?

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.540
Is it going to go
to YouTube 360?

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.060
Is it going to go to an app?

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:21.760
Do you want it for Oculus or
Gear, Cardboard, everything?

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.860
Because depending on what
you're going to shoot

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.377
or where you're
going to distribute,

00:15:26.377 --> 00:15:28.460
you want to think about
that when you're shooting.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.990
It's like traditional,
a traditional 16 by 9.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.075
Well, what are my deliverables?

00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:37.450
So we're constantly talking
about what those deliverables

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.250
might be and how we
can facilitate the best

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.147
workflow for that delivery.

00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:45.980
The other thing that
comes into play-- and I

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.713
jumped ahead on the whole
sort of delivery format thing.

00:15:48.713 --> 00:15:51.990
But back to camera position,
what about camera movement?

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:58.260
If it's not mounted to a person,
and it's-- is it in a fixed

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.200
point, or is it moving?

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.290
Well, a still camera's sort of
maybe boring in a narrative.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.460
You want to sort of drift in
on a dolly shot or a slider.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.970
You're coming in on a jib arm.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.000
Well, you're going
to see all that.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.170
What about the lights?

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.600
Narrative, your
lighting-- so all

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.200
of these questions about
where do all the gear go?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.630
And where does-- we actually
had one scenario where somebody

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.520
said, well, if we
shoot on a stage,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.365
do I have to get rid of craft
services and everything that--

00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:39.095
do I have to hide that stuff?

00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:40.600
No, you don't have to.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.370
You just-- you're
going to see it.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.492
Well, so can we just
take out the cameras?

00:16:46.492 --> 00:16:48.879
Yeah.

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:50.170
Well then, what's behind there?

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.940
Well, nothing.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.120
So they were-- but
none of it's wrong.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.060
None of this is wrong.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.920
Take out the camera.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.580
Shoot 180 and comp
something else in.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.420
The idea that you must go out
and shoot with all the cameras

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.710
and come back with a perfect
sphere of live-action footage

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.040
is kind of a tall order.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.540
And as I said at
the beginning, this

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.930
is sort of a visual
effects workflow.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.020
You are capturing pixels.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.650
And after that, you're
manipulating them.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.130
Just by the very nature
of you're putting them

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.700
in a stitching
program, and you're

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.360
warping them and
distorting them,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.290
and you're materially
changing them,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.730
you might as well just
swallow the bitter pill

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.260
that your in an effects
world now and trickery

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.050
is part of the recipe.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.600
You have to deal with parallax.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.490
You have to deal with
the fact that there's

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.107
going to be multiple
seams getting in the way

00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:55.690
and you're going to
have to hide that.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.330
And there's a monopod now you
have to paint out, or a tripod,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.544
or a drone that I can see.

00:18:00.544 --> 00:18:01.960
I wanted to see
the beautiful sky.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.550
Now there's a helicopter.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:10.810
So again, conversations that--
so speaking of narrative, let's

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.295
talk about-- where is Neil?

00:18:13.295 --> 00:18:14.986
Neil, are you still here?

00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:22.924
See, he gave me such
great intro to really what

00:18:22.924 --> 00:18:25.090
I think is some of the most
interesting stuff, which

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.290
is that indeed,
the language of VR

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.990
is not the same as
the language of film.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.104
Screen direction-- everybody
knows what screen direction is?

00:18:34.104 --> 00:18:35.270
Somebody enters in the left.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.675
They exit on the right.

00:18:36.675 --> 00:18:38.145
If they exit on
the right now, it

00:18:38.145 --> 00:18:40.270
looks like they're going
back the other way, right?

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.500
That's just one example
of screen direction.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.500
All of these things that we, as
content creators, as directors,

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.382
as camera operators--
all of these things

00:18:51.382 --> 00:18:55.755
that we have taken as a
foundation for storytelling,

00:18:55.755 --> 00:18:59.770
for blocking, for mise en
scene, all of those things

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.490
are completely turned
upside down, or inside out.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.230
Or they're all around
us, so to speak, right?

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.660
So the questions don't end.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.990
And I'm not going to say
that I have all the answers.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.090
But the discussions are fun.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.820
So let's continue with
that for a second.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:26.350
Neil's example with "Heat"--
Pacino and De Niro at that

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.160
awesome scene in the diner--
master shot coverage-- shot,

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.280
reverse, shot, right?

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.170
I've actually seen somebody
try to shoot coverage in VR.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.136
And so Jamie and Jolly,
and they're-- sorry,

00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:42.960
I'm walking away
from the light again.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.290
Sorry.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.420
So I shoot them,
and I want coverage.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.750
But even in the master shot,
if there's nothing back here,

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.820
what's the point?

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.050
Form meets function.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.590
So if I need that
type of shot, if I

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:05.220
need that type of storytelling,
maybe I don't need 360.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:12.090
Maybe I can just tell
this in standard 16 by 9.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.750
But I want 360.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.510
OK, fine.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.960
So now let's build
the shot where

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.820
it makes sense for
the camera position

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.860
to be a part of
that conversation.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.160
Instead of it being a shot
on De Niro, a shot on Jamie,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.230
a shot on Pacino,
a shot on Jolly,

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.520
instead of back and forth
and what we normally

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.600
know as editorial
and composition,

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.350
we're going to give the
camera a seat at the table.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.220
We're going to put
it at the table.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.810
And just as though
you were a part

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.070
of the conversation in
"Heat," for example,

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.550
you're going to sit there and
watch so that it's up to you

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:56.180
when there's a dramatic
pause, who are you looking at.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.100
But as a filmmaker, as a content
creator, you have to decide,

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.840
is that OK?

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.818
Because what if somebody says,
I wonder what's over here now?

00:21:06.818 --> 00:21:08.630
[CLINKING]

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.990
That's just part of the deal.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.070
So speaking of-- it's like
you did that on purpose.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:20.420
That was perfect-- sound, right?

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.500
So I keep it quiet back there.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.220
Set, be quiet back there.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.610
But when I want
somebody to look,

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:30.670
when I want somebody to jump,
I have that sound go off

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.890
and I draw people's attention.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.050
I use peripheral.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.995
Because right now,
my composition-- I'm

00:21:35.995 --> 00:21:37.870
looking at this gentleman
right in the front.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:38.883
What's your name, sir?

00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:39.650
SEAN: Sean.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.300
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Hi, Sean.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.383
So Sean's sitting there
right at the front, right?

00:21:42.383 --> 00:21:45.890
So if I'm focusing on him, I
have sort of a-- let's call

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.596
it a composition
I'm focusing on.

00:21:49.596 --> 00:21:51.970
Because I'm speaking to him,
so I'm focusing right there.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.780
But if somebody moves over
here, jumps up, starts mayhem,

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.450
I have peripheral vision,
would use peripheral vision.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.390
You can do that.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.852
You have a viewable
area in VR, and then you

00:22:05.852 --> 00:22:07.810
have the area that you
need you go and look at.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.770
So what I'd like
to do is to stay

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.470
on this sort of narrative
idea for a minute

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.780
and open the floor up if
there's any specific questions.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.090
If anybody has a
question, whether it's

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.950
related to what I'm
saying, what Neil said,

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.160
what Todd said about
narrative filmmaking

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.056
in VR, or narrative
content creation,

00:22:31.056 --> 00:22:34.826
because-- who here is a
director, or a producer,

00:22:34.826 --> 00:22:38.060
or controls the
camera, an editor?

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.560
Thank you.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.110
OK,

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:43.950
So if you're going
to get into 360,

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:51.290
you are willfully giving up
the two most precious tools--

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.160
composition and editorial.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.170
They're evolving.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.880
And how do you embrace that as
opposed to let it restrict you?

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.180
What Todd was showing
us with the-- that's

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.350
what they're testing.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:12.020
They're testing how to
embrace the fact that there's

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.470
multiple things I can look at.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.680
They're using a certain
amount of points of interest

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.110
to discern the
likelihood, and then

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:26.985
provide cuts from shot to shot.

00:23:26.985 --> 00:23:29.030
That's exactly what
we're talking about,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:35.190
is changing the way we think
about editorial or composition.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.054
So any questions
to specific-- yeah?

00:23:39.054 --> 00:23:41.813
AUDIENCE: So based on
the experiments of VR

00:23:41.813 --> 00:23:44.411
that have been done
so far, are there

00:23:44.411 --> 00:23:47.333
types of stories that are
particularly well suited

00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:48.997
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:48.997 --> 00:23:50.830
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Types
of fictional stories?

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.752
AUDIENCE: Either way.

00:23:51.752 --> 00:23:55.154
What seems to be working the
best [INAUDIBLE] storytelling?

00:23:55.154 --> 00:23:57.820
STEPHEN FROMKIN: What is working
the best are fictional stories.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.980
Let's start there.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.260
What's most challenging
is narrative,

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:07.180
which is why it's so
fun to talk about,

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.480
because we have a
certain language, right?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.860
I know I'm repeating
myself, but because of that,

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.880
that's what's most
difficult. We're

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.730
used to being
taken on a journey.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:29.710
And it somewhat
changes when we become

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.180
in control of that
journey, whereas we

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.690
were just sort of
passive as opposed

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.440
to active in that process.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.240
What is working is things
that are experiential,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.800
somewhere where you can give
me the best seat in the house.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.420
If you can give me a seat at--

00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:52.174
AUDIENCE: The Super Bowl?

00:24:52.174 --> 00:24:53.340
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Super Bowl.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.570
See, I used Super Bowl
as an example earlier

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.070
today so I didn't
want to double up,

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.630
but it is my favorite example.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.950
50-yard line seats at
the Super, I'm probably

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.270
not going to get those.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.910
But I might get a chance
to watch that in VR.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.830
An equally good example, soccer.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.540
Soccer fans?

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.920
Rabid soccer fans, anybody?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.900
There's no rabid
soccer fans here?

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.596
Brian?

00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:16.340
BRIAN GRADY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.792
STEPHEN FROMKIN: OK.

00:25:18.792 --> 00:25:20.250
Pick a place where
you know there's

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.736
going to be a lot of
energy-- a concert.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.687
A soccer match has a lot of
energy, especially when it's

00:25:29.687 --> 00:25:30.520
not in this country.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.754
When it's elsewhere,
it's more fun.

00:25:32.754 --> 00:25:33.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.200
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Right.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.430
Those types of
places are where you

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:43.240
can experience not just content,
but the energy because it

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.986
becomes immersive.

00:25:45.986 --> 00:25:47.855
It becomes infectious.

00:25:47.855 --> 00:25:51.010
And it's sort of
what we deal with.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.710
As a viewer, we
see reaction shots.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:54.350
We see comedy.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.760
We see tears.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.090
We react to those
emotions generally.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:07.590
So if we feel
connected, it becomes

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:12.070
infectious in the same
way that 16 by 9 would.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.110
That's why Chris Milk keeps
calling VR the great empathy

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.610
machine.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.360
To continue answering your
question, what else is working

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.110
are music videos because
there's not a lot of rules.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.070
You kind of do
whatever you want.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.409
Yes, sir?

00:26:34.409 --> 00:26:36.075
AUDIENCE: It's been
a great talk so far.

00:26:36.075 --> 00:26:37.821
My question is
actually about you

00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:41.065
said earlier regarding
[INAUDIBLE] shots

00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:43.560
don't work because
you lose background.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.306
If I understood that
correctly, you're

00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:47.053
talking about the "Heat" scene.

00:26:47.053 --> 00:26:48.716
And I'm nos so
familiar with that

00:26:48.716 --> 00:26:50.047
as I am with "Pulp Fiction."

00:26:50.047 --> 00:26:55.037
But imagine you've got Honey
Bunny and Ringo in the diner.

00:26:55.037 --> 00:26:58.031
And then you've got
Vincent Vega and Jules

00:26:58.031 --> 00:27:00.027
at the scene at the table.

00:27:00.027 --> 00:27:03.040
Why couldn't you shoot
from different views?

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.340
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Well,
now you're talking.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.750
So that's a great example.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.250
Thank you.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.330
Did everybody hear that?

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.180
AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:16.270
STEPHEN FROMKIN: So the talky
scene with De Niro and Pacino,

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.100
that's just two
guys at a table--

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.610
OK, not physically
the most exciting.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.470
Performance-wise,
drama-wise, great.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.660
So you probably want
to be in there tight.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.270
Because if you were directing
that scene, if you're

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.150
editing that scene, you're
probably going to say,

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.680
yeah, don't pop out
to the wide shot.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.804
Stay in on that tight shot.

00:27:33.804 --> 00:27:36.279
I want to be in with those guys
as much as possible, right?

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.445
I want to be in with their
eyes, and their emotions,

00:27:38.445 --> 00:27:39.880
and their reactions.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.796
But this gentleman--
what's your name, sir?

00:27:41.796 --> 00:27:42.530
AUDIENCE: Chris [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:42.835
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Chris.

00:27:42.835 --> 00:27:43.900
Thank you, sir.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.010
So what Chris' point was take a
scene from like "Pulp Fiction."

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:54.253
In the diner, you've got Samuel
L. Jackson and John Travolta

00:27:54.253 --> 00:27:56.175
and--

00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:57.091
AUDIENCE: Uma Thurman.

00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:58.297
AUDIENCE: Tim Roth is--

00:27:58.297 --> 00:27:59.880
STEPHEN FROMKIN:
It's Tim Roth, right.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.350
And what's her name?

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.670
AUDIENCE: Amanda Plummer.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.340
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Amanda Plummer?

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.006
AUDIENCE: Bunny.

00:28:04.006 --> 00:28:05.950
STEPHEN FROMKIN:
Honey Bunny, right.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.370
And so it's a scene where
there's conflict going on.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.030
There's two people
holding everybody--

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.640
You've seen "Pulp Fiction."

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.056
I'm not going to
ruin this, right?

00:28:13.056 --> 00:28:16.330
two people are holding
up the diner, right?

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.250
And it's not going well.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.790
Tension is high.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.100
There's a guy there with a gun.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.516
There's a girl
there with the gun.

00:28:22.516 --> 00:28:25.720
There's a guy over
here with a gun

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.690
coming in from the bathroom.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:29.730
It's all around you.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.880
And therein lies
where this is fun.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:38.530
Because you could potentially,
if it was blocked properly

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.550
and if it evolved
properly, instead

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.785
of having a shot where
everything's taking place here

00:28:43.785 --> 00:28:45.580
and there's no
reason to look here,

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.380
you kind of open it
up-- maybe not to 360,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:53.570
but maybe to at least
give it such a wide view

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.810
that you feel the
tension because you

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.942
have to look around to see where
the conflict is coming from.

00:28:58.942 --> 00:28:59.900
There's people yelling.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.941
There's people screaming.

00:29:00.941 --> 00:29:02.170
There's people with guns.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.980
So it's a good example.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:10.360
I would rather be a part
of that scene in VR--

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.000
or I don't know
if I would rather.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.620
I wouldn't mind seeing De
Niro and Pacino up close.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.470
I mean, come on.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:21.860
But that is a great example
of narrative storytelling

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:30.500
that would benefit from
just some sort of trial,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.974
just somebody experimenting.

00:29:31.974 --> 00:29:32.890
And that's what-- yes?

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:33.420
Copy that.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.850
Sorry.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.080
So go ahead, sir.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.673
Yes?

00:29:36.673 --> 00:29:38.048
AUDIENCE: Just a
thought on that.

00:29:38.048 --> 00:29:39.524
Great question.

00:29:39.524 --> 00:29:44.444
But I feel like the different
point of view at the same time

00:29:44.444 --> 00:29:47.396
would involve consistent
VR, and it would not

00:29:47.396 --> 00:29:48.872
be highly quantitative.

00:29:48.872 --> 00:29:52.316
But it's a really tough thing.

00:29:52.316 --> 00:29:55.268
But if you can pull that
off, that would be amazing.

00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:56.744
That would be the way to go.

00:29:56.744 --> 00:30:01.172
And if you use [INAUDIBLE]
or anything else,

00:30:01.172 --> 00:30:02.648
the coordination
would be amazing.

00:30:02.648 --> 00:30:05.432
But let me know.

00:30:05.432 --> 00:30:06.515
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Yes, sir?

00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:09.182
AUDIENCE: I've got kind
of two questions that

00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.365
are into this equation.

00:30:11.365 --> 00:30:14.032
And if I may, I'm
going to step up

00:30:14.032 --> 00:30:15.694
there so that it
can be recorded.

00:30:15.694 --> 00:30:16.860
STEPHEN FROMKIN: Yeah, sure.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.230
Go for it.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.771
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:22.410
One of them is the
relationship between 3D

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:23.410
that is immersive audio.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.118
MALE SPEAKER: Speak
into the mic as well.

00:30:25.118 --> 00:30:26.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this one.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.440
Essentially, we live in a
period where, at most, it's

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.230
kicking in.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:35.020
We have object-oriented
sound location.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.590
That means it's going to look
beyond the number of speakers

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.330
that are in your space
for an exhibition.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.510
And that means that you can
have an absolute position

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.370
of a particular
element and sound that

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.630
can drive the narrative, that
can drive where you should

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.480
be directing your attention.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.220
So we have the potential
here that audio

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:58.230
could lead the way for the
narrative to be directed.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.330
And currently, we have
light-field technology

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.400
where there isn't a single
focal point in any direction,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.110
but rather, a series
of focal points

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.290
that you can drive as a viewer.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.190
Do we yet have a
sense that we'll

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:14.340
be able to not only track the
eye's movement within what

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.770
you're viewing this immersive
space in, but also that depth

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.010
of focus within that field?

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.210
STEPHEN FROMKIN: OK.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.411
So I'm going to take
them as two separate.

00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:27.660
First, let's talk about audio.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.000
It's a great question because
audio is a perfect example

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.230
of how to help tell the story.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.360
And it doesn't matter if
it's narrative or not.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.770
Our experience in life
is to respond to sounds,

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.590
respond to motion, right?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.760
So we see something move.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.380
We look.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.510
That draws our attention.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.110
We hear something.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.430
That draws our attention.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.900
Using a either
binaural audio rig

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:06.400
or some other multichannel-type
positional microphone

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.910
based wherever the rig is,
wherever your 360 cam rig is,

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.410
and then post-producing
it in a way that

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:22.840
draws the viewer left,
right, back, up is complex,

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.670
but it's workable.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.486
It's doable.

00:32:25.486 --> 00:32:27.360
There are people who
are using binural audio,

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.005
recording it,
faking it, taking--

00:32:30.005 --> 00:32:31.130
AUDIENCE: Still composites.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.160
STEPHEN FROMKIN:
--taking stems and then

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.930
adding it so the binaural audio,
and it basically matched up

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.490
with the accelerometer,
just like the video is,

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.020
and it can look wherever.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:47.589
I'm not as-- let's take
light-field technology

00:32:47.589 --> 00:32:49.130
and just put that
aside for a second,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:54.680
and just say that as
the tools, whether it

00:32:54.680 --> 00:33:00.390
be light-field technology, or
just getting Z data captured

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:08.540
and being able to adjust
focus, or literally

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.820
push in from the position even
though the camera never moved--

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.760
some of those types of
things are absolutely

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.560
going to add-- what
basically we're talking about

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.410
is, how much more
can we virtually,

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:28.660
digitally, or otherwise
fake the moves of the camera

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:35.704
and therefore build the
story pretty much as we want?

00:33:35.704 --> 00:33:36.620
And that's all coming.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.960
It's just as the
technology evolves.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.381
I got the red light, like
they give the red light when

00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:46.700
the comedian's almost over.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.470
I have a lot of
other-- obviously,

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.330
I have numerous anecdotes that
I could share about production.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.236
I'm happy to share them.

00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:59.580
I wish there was time
to share more with you

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.764
or talk to each of you.

00:34:01.764 --> 00:34:03.430
I'll certainly hang
out for a little bit

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.480
and answer more questions.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.110
I do have-- my last slide is
something that was requested.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.969
If you're going to
start production,

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:16.385
if you're going to go out
there and start doing this,

00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:22.650
and you want to do
so, I highly suggest

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.750
the 7 rig and some of the
other items that are there.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.326
This is all actually
on our website.

00:34:29.326 --> 00:34:30.920
You can buy a lot
of the stuff there.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.159
But we're not the only game.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.644
And we're not the only solution.

00:34:35.644 --> 00:34:36.560
We're just a good one.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.870
And we've been doing
this for a while,

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.560
and we're very open
source about it.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.739
There are a lot of production
companies out there,

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:48.615
and we're just happy
that you're trying it

00:34:48.615 --> 00:34:52.010
and that you're invited
us to share some

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.880
of our info and experience.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.602
So thank you again, Brian.

00:34:56.602 --> 00:34:57.560
BRIAN GRADY: Thank you.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.860
