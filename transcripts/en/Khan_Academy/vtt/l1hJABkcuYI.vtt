00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.870
Part C. Find the value
of the sixth derivative

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.880
of f evaluated at 0.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.320
So you could imagine
if you just tried

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.470
to find the sixth derivative of
f, that would take you forever.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.512
And then to evaluate it at 0,
because this is x squared here.

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:18.970
And you'd have to keep doing
the product rule over and over

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.761
again, and the chain
rule and all the rest.

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.540
It would become very,
very, very messy.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.000
But we have a big clue here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.420
The fact that they made
us find the first four

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.890
terms of the Taylor series
of f about x equals 0

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.600
tells us that there
might be a simpler

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.870
way to do this, as
opposed to just taking

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.800
the sixth derivative of
this and evaluating at 0.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.380
The simplest way to do
this is to just go back.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.590
In the last problem,
we were able to come up

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.860
with the first four
non-zero terms of the Taylor

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.670
series of f.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.960
And if you look at your
definition of the Taylor series

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.510
right here-- and we go into
depth on this in another Khan

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.030
Academy video where we talk
about why this makes sense--

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.360
you see that each degree
term of the Taylor

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.637
series, its coefficient
is that derivative.

00:01:04.637 --> 00:01:06.470
And this Taylor Series
is centered around 0,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.770
and that's what we care about
in terms of this problem.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.270
We see the coefficient is
that derivative divided

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.860
by that degrees, that
derivative evaluated at 0

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.080
divided by that
degrees factorials.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
So the second degree term,
it's the second derivative

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.250
of f evaluated at 0
divided by 2 factorial.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.330
The fourth degree term
is the fourth derivative

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.950
of f evaluated at 0
divided by 4 factorial.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.490
So the sixth degree term--
let's remind ourselves

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.270
what we're even
trying to figure out--

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.080
so they want us to figure
out the sixth derivative of f

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.440
evaluated at 0.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.540
That's what they want
us to figure out.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.320
Well, if you think about
the Taylor series centered

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.290
at 0, or at 0, or
approximated around 0,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.220
the sixth degree term in the
Taylor series approximation

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.310
of f is going to be f prime
of the sixth derivative of f

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.640
evaluated at 0 times x to
the sixth over 6 factorial.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.910
This is going to
be the sixth degree

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.875
term in Taylor approximation,
in Taylor series.

00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:30.370
And we have that term
sitting right over here.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.620
This is the sixth degree term.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.670
We figured it out
in the last problem.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.790
This right here is
the sixth degree term.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.500
So you have x to the sixth over
here, x to the sixth over here,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.020
you have 6 factorial over
here, 6 factorial over here.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.610
So this negative 121 must
be the sixth derivative

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.890
of f evaluated at 0.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.800
So that's our answer.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.120
This is equal to negative 121.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.850
And we're done.
