00:00:03.185 --> 00:00:06.130
So thank you,
everyone, for coming

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.406
to this breakout session.

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:09.905
I'm happy to have
this conversation,

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:11.363
actually I'm really
looking forward

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:14.020
to having this conversation
about making the most

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.090
of student evaluations.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.710
And thanks for self-grouping
into some tables.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.830
That's OK.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.080
Somebody will figure that out.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:28.910
You'll notice that
in front of you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.940
there are some handouts
around a case study

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.790
that we'll comment
later on in the session.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.119
So don't look at them yet.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.660
If you are looking at them, just
put them back in the middle.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.910
OK, so we are here to talk
about making the most of student

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.740
evaluations.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.310
My name is Bill Wisser.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.250
I'm the director of the
Teaching and Learning Lab,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.124
and the lecturer in
education at the Graduate

00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:49.050
School of Education.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.280
Willis Emmons, director of the
Christensen Center Teaching

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.230
and Learning at Harvard
Business School.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.610
And I'm Alexandra Sedlovskaya.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.052
I'm the assistant director
at the Christensen Center

00:00:58.052 --> 00:00:59.760
for Teaching and
Learning, and we'll also

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.910
have with us, our data analyst,
Tara Abbatello who is actually

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.070
doing a lot of our data analysis
around student evaluations.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.040
Right Welcome.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.550
Great.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.490
So the title of
the session is very

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.410
important to framing
how we're going

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.086
to talk about
student evaluations,

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:15.710
making the most of
student evaluations.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.480
Relations We're
thinking about it today

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.400
as formative instruments.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.530
Ways for us to
improve our practice,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.190
and how can we learn
from our students,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.050
how can we learn from
our peers, and how can we

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.930
examine some
strategies that we use

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.000
to make the most of our
student evaluations.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.708
And hopefully, by the
end of the session,

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:36.530
you'll walk away with some
new tools in your own toolkit

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.839
that you can apply when
you're doing your own.

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:41.005
I know that many of you
are-- or maybe close to half

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.050
of you aren't actually faculty
who are receiving student

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.050
evaluations, or some of
the student evaluations,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.060
but through your work
with coaching faculty,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.660
or developing strategies, and
also you're gathering and using

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.890
evaluations for workshops, and
from other events that you run.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.390
We'd like to hear from you
about some of your strategies.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.560
So the way this is
going to work is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.830
I'm going to walk us through
a really brief exercise

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.340
to get us in that
formative frame of mind

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.050
to think about what's positive
about student evaluations.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.570
Not ignoring that there
are some real challenges

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.096
with summative
evaluations as tools.

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:18.596
Well, we're going
to talk about what

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:20.780
are the formative elements
that we can pull of it,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.907
and then we'll listen.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:23.990
Alexandra will take us
through a really brief case

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.290
study about how they
analyzed student evaluations

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.170
over the business
school, and maybe serve

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.294
some generalizable strategies,
and takeaways from that.

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:34.460
And then finally, we'll
hear from some of your peers

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.520
from across the university
that we talked to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.120
in advance of this
session, and also

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.911
learn from you about
some of the strategies

00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:43.410
you use to examine your
student evaluations.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.200
So to kick us off, what I'd like
to do is just think on your own

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.460
for a minute or two,
what's one thing that you

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.414
would like to learn
from your students

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:55.580
to improve your instruction.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.430
Now, this is not about
your evaluations.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.140
This is not about
your instrument

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.090
that your school uses.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.330
One thing that you would like
to learn from your students.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.310
So just think about it
for a minute or two.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.800
Jot down an idea just quietly
by yourself for a minute.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.460
OK, looks like most of the
pens have stopped moving.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.010
Now take another couple minutes,
and just turn to the person

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.660
next to you, or two
people next to you.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.570
What's your idea?

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.340
What's their idea?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.360
Are there commonalities
in your interest

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.710
in learning from your students?

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.410
Something that you learn
from them, from your peer,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.085
that you find interesting about
what they would like to learn.

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:37.160
Just take a minute or
two to share your ideas.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.582
All right, so it sounds like
some great sharing going on,

00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:42.290
some great ideas.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.332
Hopefully, we'll be
able to capture them.

00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:46.790
What I'd like to do now is just
hear from one or two tables

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.379
about one idea that you
heard from either your peers,

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.420
or something that you
brought up that you thought

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.920
was particularly salient
to this conversation

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.220
that we can keep in mind.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.910
And I should say that
my colleague, Emily,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.660
is going to take notes right
into the PowerPoint slide.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.760
There will be a couple
opportunities for us

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.687
to gather notes from
you, and we'll then

00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:09.270
share out the slides
after the session

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.600
so you'll have a record of this.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.546
So what's one idea that you
heard from a table here?

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:15.920
This table, what's
one idea you'd

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.130
like to share that either
you brought up, or up here.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.531
It's not one, it's
three, but I said,

00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:24.405
why are you here, what
are your expectations,

00:04:24.405 --> 00:04:26.099
and what are your goals?

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.890
OK, so you want to
learn from your students

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.980
why are you here, what are
your expectations, what

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.880
are your goals.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.484
And of course, that
could be difficult

00:04:33.484 --> 00:04:35.150
if we're only thinking
about evaluations

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.530
as being one
summative touch point

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.990
at the end of the semester.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.530
You can think
about it moving on.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.321
So what did I learn
from students last year

00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:43.430
that I could apply?

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.290
But it's also to think
about that there's

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.830
a whole continuum of
evaluation or assessment

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.530
that you could employ
in your classrooms

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.194
from day one, all the way to
the end of class evaluation.

00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:57.610
And student
evaluation instruments

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.330
are only just one
tool, one element.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.830
Thanks Bill.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.000
So our table, we found
that we basically all

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.081
had very similar ones.

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:09.330
That we only had one variation
of it that was helpful.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.510
So what things do I do in
class that either increase

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.222
or decrease student
engagement, and basically,

00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:15.680
how are ways that
you can determine

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.820
whether students are engaged.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.660
How does that manifest?

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.710
How can you measure it?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.990
How can you react to
it in a productive way

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.720
before you get students who are
hostile because they totally

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.010
tuned out.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.724
Great.

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:27.390
So what are the
elements of instruction?

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.600
What are you doing to
encourage engagement?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.895
Or what are you doing to
discourage engagement?

00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:34.260
And then how do you know that?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.440
How do we find out.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.170
How can you tell?

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.010
How do you tell?

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.470
Right And one of the
strategies you'll hear later on

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.235
is thinking about
evaluations longitudinally.

00:05:42.235 --> 00:05:43.860
Look at one question
over time, and see

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.969
how it changes based on
an input that you make.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:46.760
How about one more.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.486
How to measure engagement

00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:52.920
An important idea
that came up here

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.840
was pre-assessment,
and understanding

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.610
the baseline
knowledge both to know

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.110
how to best reach
students, and also

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.330
to be able to measure correctly.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.830
Great.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.163
So pre-assessment, and thinking
about the actual student

00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:09.800
evaluation instrument
as being your post-test,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.529
and how did you garner
that pre-test material

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.320
to be able to access
it against the student

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.278
evaluations at the end.

00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:19.407
But again, strategies-- these
will lead to strategies,

00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:20.990
but what I wanted
to first think about

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.786
is what do you want to
learn from students.

00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:25.410
Mean Think about the
student evaluation

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.150
at the end of the semester
as being one vehicle,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.791
one channel to receive
that information.

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:33.290
,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.680
Thanks, Bill.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.510
So the next part
of our session is

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.400
going to be an
opportunity to actually do

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.350
a dive into the feedback that
one faculty member received

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.990
from a Harvard
Business School course.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.055
And what I wanted
to do is to give

00:06:48.055 --> 00:06:49.680
a little bit of an
overview just so you

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.650
have a frame of reference for
what the feedback was given

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.170
for, and then we're going to
have you work at your tables

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.150
to review some of the
data, and essentially,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.450
do a bit of a group, a
little bit of diagnostic,

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.190
and then think about
what advice you

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.600
might give to this instructor.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.340
And I think the
important thing that we

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.990
want to stress here
is that it's not

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.320
about specifically the content
of this Harvard Business School

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.230
class or format, but
to think about how--

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.220
what are ways that
you can use data.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.930
Gary Keen talked
a lot this morning

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.900
about we have data,
to what extent

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.640
are we actually
harnessing that data,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.150
using it in a productive way.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.200
And we just wanted to share
with you at least the process

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.550
that we use at HBS, and
maybe spark some conversation

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.710
both about how it might
be useful for you,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.830
but then what other ways that
you examine data, and again,

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.490
very much in a formative sense.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.823
There was an earlier session
that I think a number of us

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.420
were at around using
these evaluations

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.086
for summative purposes,
and we're really

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:44.180
focusing on the development of
the faculty member formative

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.210
use.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.430
So let me just leave
you a little bit

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.550
of a sense of the
context for HBS

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.820
because it will affect the
kind of feedback you see.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.700
Virtually all of our courses
are taught by the case method.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.890
And so the idea is that
in all of our classes,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.900
it's a very
interactive discussion.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.950
So this comment you
made about engagement

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.470
is a big part of what students
will notice or not notice,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.570
and that comes up maybe
more in the feedback than

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.980
in some others.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.300
We have no undergraduates.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.400
This is going to all
be from an MBA class,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.620
and so that might affect how
you're interpreting the data.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.690
And just to tell you about
our first year MBA program,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.070
for those of you
aren't familiar,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.060
we have 900 students that
are spread over 10 sections.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.730
On every day, for example,
in a marketing course,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.850
they're all taking
the exact same course.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.809
Effectively, the
syllabus is the same,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.110
the case that they
use is the same,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.929
and so there's an interesting
possibility of benchmarking

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.860
across various faculty, but
it also gives you the context.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.300
You're in a room with
90 other students.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.610
Class participation is
actually 50% of the grade.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.870
So there's a lot of
pressure around engagement.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.470
And we have a fixed curve.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.910
So you wonder if these
valuations are somehow

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.530
shaped by grade inflation.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.024
We don't have grade inflation.

00:09:00.024 --> 00:09:01.815
So that's just a little
part of the context

00:09:01.815 --> 00:09:04.320
that I wanted you
to be aware of.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.470
So let me tell you a little
bit about the instrument that

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.860
is used at Harvard
Business School for student

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.690
evaluations of teaching.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.680
We're not going to give
you the entire instrument,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.440
but just to let you know, it
has one section for the course,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.280
and one for the
instructor, and there

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.310
are separate questions for
the course and the instructor.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.150
There are quantitative
ratings, very Likert scale type

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.851
questions only on
a few dimensions,

00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:32.350
and this is for the instructor
we're going to focus on here.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.310
The quality standards the
instructor use, the discussion

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.370
management, again, rating
managerial relevance

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.890
of the material,
and the learning.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.614
Responsiveness to
students, student concerns.

00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:45.030
And then the
question that I think

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.850
we all tend to
zero in on, what is

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.040
your assessment of the
overall effectiveness

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.450
of the instructor?

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.730
And I think as a headline
for what we try to do

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.120
is to move away from
the, I think, obsession

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.090
about the mean value of
this particular Likert scale

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.080
question.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.670
Think about what
more broadly can

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.350
we learn about the
individuals teaching,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.620
and really in an
action oriented way,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.560
how can we provide
advice coaching

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.210
to help that
individual to continue

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.580
to improve as an instructor.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.600
Now, to do that, we really
mind the qualitative questions,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.080
and these are two very
open-ended questions.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.330
One is what are two or three
things the instructor did

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.060
well, and should continue
to do, and the other

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.942
is two to three things to focus
on for improving effectiveness.

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:33.150
And one of the things that
we've done over the years.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.608
And I'll give a
huge shout out here

00:10:34.608 --> 00:10:37.350
to Tara Abatela, our
analyst, is actually

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.120
created a template and
a process for coding

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.780
every single comment
the students make,

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.240
and this allows us to
basically characterize

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.212
the types of feedback.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:47.670
We find that
sometimes they'll just

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.907
comment on the instructor,
their style, their preparedness.

00:10:51.907 --> 00:10:54.240
They'll comment on the process,
and clearly, case method

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.760
teaching involves
a lot of process.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.220
And the other is on content,
the clarity of the content,

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.880
the richness, the scope.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.990
And so what we're able to do
by coding the qualitative data

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.650
is actually create a summary
of strengths and opportunities

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.860
for that particular
faculty member in a visual

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.860
to see on which dimensions
there were strength comments,

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.390
or more opportunities.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.031
And from that, try to
really investigate it

00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:18.780
at a deeper level.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.470
What are some of the drivers
of students assessment

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.144
of effectiveness, and frankly,
opportunities for improvement.

00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.560
We're actually
able to do a couple

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.050
of other interesting things
in analyzing the data

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.850
because there's some demographic
information that we receive.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.430
First of all, we ask a
question on the survey,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.050
for each student
to assess, what was

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.860
your prior knowledge of the
field before taking the course,

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.880
from one to seven.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.920
So that allows us to
actually cut the data

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.140
by novices versus experts,
and to what extent

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.470
do we see differences.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.540
And frankly, when we look
at these mean ratings,

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.930
often, they're disguising
some real variation

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.940
in terms of the distribution
of those ratings,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.880
and to the extent that there
may be some groups of students

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.980
who feel that the
learning was much more

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.010
effective than others.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.410
It would be interesting to
be able to investigate that.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.680
What would be some of
the underlying drivers.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.160
Now, these surveys
are old anonymously,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.350
but it's important
that we're able--

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.250
through the ideas that students
log in on to do surveys--

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.530
to identify gender
and citizenship,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.640
whether they're US
or non-US citizens.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.490
So that allows us to also
cut the data by gender,

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.550
by whether you're
US or non-US, which

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.714
can provide some additional
interesting insights.

00:12:32.714 --> 00:12:34.630
And in fact, the way
we've set up the template

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.617
is that we can do that more
granular analysis on the Likert

00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:40.200
scale questions, but
we can also do it

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.590
on the qualitative questions.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.420
We can produce different
charts that reflect

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.070
the different demographics.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.490
So that's the overview
that I wanted to give you

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.132
as to what you're going to see.

00:12:51.132 --> 00:12:53.090
Now what you're going to
have in front of you--

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.570
and I encourage you now to grab
a little case study that you

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.840
have in front of you.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.340
This is disguised, but
it's based on an actual HBS

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.830
professor, and this
professor, Dave Anderson,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.727
is a first year instructor.

00:13:08.727 --> 00:13:11.060
And you just have a little
bit of bio on the front page.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.601
But let me just walk
you through what

00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:14.760
you're going to be analyzing.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.910
So the first page is,
essentially, a summary

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.900
of the Likert scale data.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.020
So what were the mean ratings
on the various Likert scale

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.610
questions.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.900
What was the distribution
of the instructor rating.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.170
We had some ratings
by demographic group,

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.830
and at the bottom,
we actually see

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.109
how do the ratings differ
by prior knowledge.

00:13:33.109 --> 00:13:35.400
So this is just to give you
a little bit of an overview

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.010
of how to read this.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.540
Now, the second page is what
we call our red blue chart.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.250
This is the visual
graphic that we're

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.880
able to generate by looking at
the strengths and opportunities

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.170
from the qualitative quotes.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.970
And just to get
you oriented on how

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.680
to read, the scale
at the bottom, which

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.510
goes from 0 to 80,
and 0 to negative 80,

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.930
that's just the
number of surveys

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.290
that mentioned a particular
trait or a particular feature

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.480
of the class or
learning as being either

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.330
a straight or an opportunity.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.030
Now, this is actually distilled
from the next two pages,

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.740
which are much more detailed.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.200
So I'll just take
style as an example.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.060
There were almost 80--

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.232
by the way, we have a
very high completion rate

00:14:19.232 --> 00:14:21.440
because the surveys are done
on the last day of class

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.350
in the classroom,
and attendance is

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.670
close to 100% in the
business school classes.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.444
So these are-- for a
class of 90 students--

00:14:29.444 --> 00:14:30.860
will be very close
to that amount.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.000
What was the 50%
number on your slide?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.330
The class participation grade
is 50% of the overall grade.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.400
So again, just to give
you an illustration

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.220
to be able to read
this more effectively.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.290
Style, which is kind
of off the chart

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.140
as a positive for
this instructor, if we

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.310
go to what students are
saying about Dave Anderson's

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.590
style, energy, enthusiasm,
engagement, passion.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.530
We can combine words
that are similar.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.320
About 45 students
mentioned that.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.220
Humor is another area, and then
basically, presentation style,

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.480
and you can do this for any one
of the elements on the chart.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.390
And then finally, I want
to just draw your attention

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.820
to the last two pages
where we've selectively

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.630
pulled some quotations
from students that give you

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.864
even more granularity in terms
of what students are thinking,

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:23.780
and the feedback they're
giving on the course.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.500
And I'll just highlight the
first one here on strengths.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.780
At the end of the quote,
we have in parentheses,

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.610
some of the
demographic information

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.910
that we were able to distill.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.550
So this first quote is from a
female student, a US citizen.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.830
The seven is the
instructor rating

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.370
that she gave to
the faculty member.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.630
So this is someone who gave
a seven to the instructor,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.930
a seven out of seven,
and the prior six

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.190
is someone who was
self assessed as having

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.240
been pretty knowledgeable
about the course

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.800
before taking the course.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.510
So that gives you a
little bit of sense

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.890
where are these
quotations coming

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.100
from in terms of a little bit of
the background of the students.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.017
So what we would love for you to
do is to gather around a table.

00:16:05.017 --> 00:16:07.350
I know most of you are, but
for those of you who aren't,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.860
if maybe you could cluster--

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.390
either join another
table, or create your own.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.990
And I want you to just
individually take a few minutes

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.210
to read through the data.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.170
Come up with your own,
I would say, diagnostic.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.400
What's the sort of
theory of the case

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.710
for this particular instructor.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.690
And then think about
what advice that you

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.520
would give the
instructor if you had

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.120
even two or three high level
recommendations to improve

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.480
teaching.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.740
Read a little bit, think
about this on your own,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.585
and then I'll have
you gather, and talk

00:16:38.585 --> 00:16:39.710
a little bit n your groups.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.168
And we will circulate
to the extent

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.635
that you have some questions
about how to read the data.

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:44.260
Do you have a--

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.320
Sorry, can I ask you
a quick question?

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:45.819
Sure.

00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:48.126
The prior reading scale,
how does that work?

00:16:48.126 --> 00:16:49.750
Yeah, so the student
is asked to assess

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.009
what was your prior
understanding of the field

00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:53.800
before taking the course
from one to seven.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.590
So it's self-reported, but it's
usually a pretty good indicator

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.000
if it's a completely new
or varied experience.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.640
So why don't we take about
five minutes on your own,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.810
and then gather in your groups,
and then we'll do a debrief,

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.329
get a sense of what
your assessments are

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.560
of the information.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.930
I know it's very
hard to break away.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.480
I hear these intense
discussions about Dave Anderson.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.109
And as sort of a
bridge, there were

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:29.085
a couple of questions that came
up as I was circulating around,

00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:30.710
and I did want to
clarify a few things.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.620
First of all, of
this is voluntary.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.080
Faculty come to us to
look at their evaluations.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.820
No one is required to have this
analysis done, and non of this

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.320
is part of the
promotion's process.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.550
The Christensen Center is not
involved at all in promotion.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.280
And the last thing I'll say,
just in terms of the principal,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.780
it was an interesting
comment that I

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.600
think Doug Milton made this
morning about how hard it

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.510
is when you see one or two
quotes that really drive

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.969
you crazy as a faculty member.

00:17:56.969 --> 00:17:58.510
There are a number
of faculty members

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.540
who don't read the feedback,
but they give it to us,

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.400
and I think sometimes
these red blue charts

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.072
kind of take some of the
emotion away in terms of--

00:18:06.072 --> 00:18:08.530
actually, two people said it,
and it may stick in your call

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.360
that only two people
said it, and you

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.100
see that on the diagram.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.960
But those are just a
few contextual factors.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.710
But I think the more interesting
question is what did you

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.210
think about Dave Anderson?

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.420
What's your theory of the case?

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.210
What's your diagnosis?

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.700
And then if you had to give
a couple of recommendations

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.690
to him to improve his
teaching, what would that be?

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.675
So would anyone like to kick
that off from your tables?

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.680
So our feeling was that he's
doing this for the first time.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.020
He's learning to do this.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.000
He's bringing a
lot of knowledge,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.890
a lot of enthusiasm
to the classroom,

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.670
but that perhaps maybe the
focus for him is on him.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.406
That he's really thinking about
what he's going to do next.

00:18:58.406 --> 00:19:00.590
He summarizes well at
the end of the case.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.790
So the parts that he
does, he does well,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.100
but it's coming at a
cost of really listening

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.230
to, and understanding
the students,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.250
and he's not really facilitating
student-student interactions as

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.430
well as he might, or
really building off

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.730
of student comments.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.710
And so our
recommendation for him

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.550
really would be to
relax a little bit,

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.500
and really try to
hear, and engage,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.366
and bring in the students
into the conversation.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.030
Great, thank you.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.730
Other groups, what
would you add to that

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.755
in terms of some of the
diagnosis or some of--

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.630
I'm going to pass that
maybe back behind you,

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.140
and we'll go around.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.220
One of those things our group
noticed was while his style--

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.500
he got great strengths in his
style from the open comments,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:55.030
we gleaned that the women,
and non-US women in particular

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.280
are not as enamored,
that this style is

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.060
working as well for them.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.960
And why do you
think that's true?

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.070
Why do we think it's true?

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.320
Well, drawing on
prior experience,

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.640
I thought he's probably
more of a bro style.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.810
A lecture that maybe
some of his jokes

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.590
are resonating
more with US males

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.490
than they are with
females, and they

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.350
might be gender jokes that
are missing the mark a little.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.740
That would be-- it's
hard to tell, exactly.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.050
Well there is one quote
that would support that.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.470
It was from a male that
it was frat house humor.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.510
I wish I had seen a female who
had given a better indication,

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.310
but we thought that that male
could be highly observant,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.580
and that certainly resonated
with some of the things

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.380
that we were suspecting.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.200
Yeah, and I think that's one of
the things that's really both

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.110
intriguing, and sometimes tricky
about this analysis is that you

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.125
can have some hypotheses
that you're generating,

00:20:49.125 --> 00:20:50.900
that some of that
data-- for example,

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.190
that low mean rating or lower
mean rating from the US--

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.250
I'm sorry, the female
non-US students,

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.700
and why is that the case.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.580
And sometimes you can find
some support or evidence

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.130
in the qualitative data.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.080
I was saying
earlier that we also

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.537
perhaps, had done an observation
of this faculty member

00:21:07.537 --> 00:21:08.370
during the semester.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.520
We may have other data.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.950
There may have been
some midterm surveys.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.000
So there may be
additional ways, but it

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.270
is kind of forensic
analysis to some extent.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.530
And even when we meet
with a faculty member,

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.370
we usually meet for
about 90 minutes.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.430
It's a long debrief.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.210
It's actually started with
a lot of self-reflection.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.710
We ask the faculty
member to reflect

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.819
on what they felt went
particularly well,

00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:30.610
things they would do
differently next year,

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.430
and if they had read the
feedback themselves, what

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.410
surprised them in the feedback.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.570
And that could be an
ongoing exploration where

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.530
we may be trying to test
out some of the hypothesis,

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.560
but I think this was
absolutely affirmed,

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.210
I think, and the
faculty member even

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.420
was able to recall a couple
of jokes or jokey moments

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.140
that added to your sense.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.930
I saw a hand here earlier.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.070
Was there a--

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.569
No, I was very
struck by the fact

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:00.735
that he can't run a seminar.

00:22:00.735 --> 00:22:02.510
I mean, he can't listen.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.110
I thought maybe some Ritalin.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.780
No, I mean seriously.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.500
So the question is
OK, obviously, he

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.295
can't run a seminar that
everybody feels good

00:22:14.295 --> 00:22:17.550
about The question is
what to do about it.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.420
I'm very interested
in that because I also

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.120
don't know how to run a seminar
I'm a physics professor, so I

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.000
don't really have to most of
the time but I'm thinking drugs

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.946
might be a--

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:29.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:32.595
Just so that you don't-- he
sounds like he's interrupting

00:22:32.595 --> 00:22:35.560
a lot, and stuff like that, and
maybe if he just took a little

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.056
bit of something
to repress his--

00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:41.875
but I'm actually kind
of interested in what

00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:43.500
you would suggest,
but it's not obvious

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.991
that just you talking to
him could help him do that.

00:22:45.991 --> 00:22:47.990
And I think one of the
things we'll do sometimes

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.909
is actually go over some video
footage, if we have video,

00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:53.450
so the faculty member can see
what they're like in the class,

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.176
experience themselves.

00:22:55.176 --> 00:22:57.760
But you're right, some
of this becomes really

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.271
a process of thinking
maybe doing some role play.

00:23:00.271 --> 00:23:02.770
We'll do some practicums, try
to work with the faculty, even

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:03.380
some advice.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.060
Why don't you wait to hear a few
students before interjecting.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.290
Give them some things
to practice on.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.615
This is a process of give
and take along the way.

00:23:13.615 --> 00:23:16.330
I'm going to be very--
this is so hard for me

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.060
to stop this discussion because
I feel that we're just touching

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.740
the tip of the
iceberg, but I'm also

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.350
sensitive to what we have left
on the rest of the agenda.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:28.270
I hope this gives you
a taste for what we do,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.250
and I'll be happy to chat,
as will Alexandra and Atara

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.990
afterwards about both
the methodology, the kind

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.920
of insights we derived.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.570
But I think what
I wanted us to do

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.330
in the next just sort of pulling
together, is share with you

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:46.270
a few general lessons, and I'll
hand this over to Alexandra

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.730
to pull together a bit
of what we've learned.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.230
Great.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.500
Well first of all, thank
you for sharing your ideas.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.210
As I was walking
around, I definitely

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.920
had seen very rich conversations
happening all around the room.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.640
So very quickly, just
trying to pull it together.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.380
Let me just find the clicker.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.680
It's right here.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.880
Fantastic.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.480
So very quickly, pulling
the main insights,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.545
and just sharing what we've
learned over the years doing

00:24:10.545 --> 00:24:13.020
this analysis.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.710
Well, first, I think it
became obvious even here,

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.160
just the richness of qualitative
data, which again, moves us

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.665
beyond that one defining,
as Willis had mentioned,

00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:25.945
statistic of our mean
teaching effectiveness,

00:24:25.945 --> 00:24:28.070
to really start unpacking
that number from the more

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.460
developmental standpoint.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.456
And as we look through
the qualitative data,

00:24:33.456 --> 00:24:37.110
and I think we've heard this
already from the panel earlier,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.060
it is important
to systematically

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.173
to avoid this issue
of selective reading.

00:24:41.173 --> 00:24:43.600
Even the most established
professors sometimes

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.320
feel jittery looking at
the negative feedback,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.366
or get fixated on one, as
was mentioned, completely

00:24:49.366 --> 00:24:52.670
unrepresentative, but very, very
strongly worded comment that

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.046
overshadows the rest
of the feedback,

00:24:55.046 --> 00:24:57.360
and that's not very helpful.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.700
And also just even
if you dare to look

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.500
through all the comments,
just the sheer number

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.800
could become overwhelming.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.380
All the noise, or it might
look like it's noise,

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.000
comments that are contradictory.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.140
We talked about Dave
Anderson's humor.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.560
Some say use more humor,
others say joke less.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.145
Is it a wash?

00:25:15.145 --> 00:25:17.790
Well, and as I think we've
already pointed out here,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.500
it's not either/or.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.780
It's really maybe
humor is good, but it's

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.532
the types of jokes
he's making that would

00:25:23.532 --> 00:25:25.282
be alienating to certain
groups of people,

00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:26.560
as you had mentioned.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.650
And so it's really looking
at the qualitative data

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.829
to get this deeper understanding
of what's really going on,

00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:35.120
which is not to suggest that
quantitative data does not

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.360
matter.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:36.951
They do.

00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:39.450
It's just, again, moving beyond
the quantitative statistics.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.659
So perhaps, looking at the
distribution of readings.

00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:43.200
I don't know how
many of you noticed,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.560
I know you had very short
time, but Dave Anderson's

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.532
mean reading is five, but he's
moral rating is actually six.

00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:52.490
So it might be worthwhile
to think about what's

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.480
bringing down his
teaching effectiveness,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.754
or this perceived teaching
effectiveness here.

00:25:56.754 --> 00:25:58.587
And I know when we do
research, sometimes we

00:25:58.587 --> 00:26:00.590
say not to focus
on the outliers;

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.510
sometimes, it could
be just outliers.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.990
But it might be worthwhile,
for example, in this case,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.854
to spend some time on this
lower end of the distribution

00:26:07.854 --> 00:26:10.187
to see whether there is a
certain group of students that

00:26:10.187 --> 00:26:12.960
are just systematically not
learning as effectively as they

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.400
could.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.980
So am I not engaging
my experts adequately?

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.330
Am I losing my novices?

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.330
Am I not resonating my
knowledge, as an example,

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.470
just not resonating with
my international students.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.900
And then in which case,
having this information

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.842
about our students
will be very helpful.

00:26:28.842 --> 00:26:30.850
The demographic
characteristics, or we

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.635
talked about prior
knowledge, but again,

00:26:32.635 --> 00:26:34.010
using this
information carefully.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.720
So we don't want to
dismiss, as we said,

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.985
non-US female students.

00:26:36.985 --> 00:26:39.610
We don't want to say, well, they
just don't like Dave Anderson.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.030
What am I going to do?

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.944
It's more just understanding
how can be effective with groups

00:26:43.944 --> 00:26:47.320
from different backgrounds.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.964
And finally, as we look
through the comments,

00:26:49.964 --> 00:26:51.630
it could be very
compelling to say well,

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.760
it's just not the reality here.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.883
Dave Anderson may
very well feel,

00:26:55.883 --> 00:26:57.101
I am listening to students.

00:26:57.101 --> 00:26:59.100
We talked about not
listening, but he might feel

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.640
I'm listening very actively.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.306
I care deeply about
what they're saying.

00:27:02.306 --> 00:27:04.470
So here, the question
really is, why do they

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.660
feel like I'm not listening?

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.550
What can I do to change
their perceptions?

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.656
And I think taking
this perspective,

00:27:12.656 --> 00:27:14.155
as we've talked
about Dave Anderson,

00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:17.890
and he's listening to students,
I think in the faculty role,

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.342
as we listen to students,
taking their perspective,

00:27:21.342 --> 00:27:23.342
giving voice to students,
to then hopefully help

00:27:23.342 --> 00:27:25.491
us improve in the classroom.

00:27:25.491 --> 00:27:27.490
So this is just one
approach you've been taking.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.976
I know you've been
commenting about the process.

00:27:29.976 --> 00:27:32.519
Of course, a lot of
credit goes to Tara,

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:34.060
and this is just
one way of doing it.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.473
So I'm going to
turn it over to Bill

00:27:35.473 --> 00:27:36.931
to talk about some
other strategies

00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:39.180
that he's been hearing
about across Harvard

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.970
from our other colleagues.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:46.390
So I want to echo that last
point that Alexandra just made.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.340
That you saw one
methodology that

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.670
was very labor intensive
to do, and obviously,

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.850
it was developed over time,
and it was very powerful

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.090
when working with faculty.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.030
And you may not have access
to those types of resources,

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.360
or that type of modeling
that you can do on your own,

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.790
or even with peers.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.300
But what can you do?

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.340
What are some
strategies or takeaways

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.884
that you can apply to your
own student evaluations?

00:28:08.884 --> 00:28:10.550
So we went on a bit
of a listening tour,

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.620
and through the Box Center
at FAS, and through SLATE

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.829
at Kennedy school, and then
through the HGSC Teaching

00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:18.703
and Learning Lab, and
the Christensen Center,

00:28:18.703 --> 00:28:20.410
and talked to some
faculty about what

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.120
are some of their
strategies that they

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.640
use when they think about
their own student evaluations.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.810
And we did a very light-weight
grouping in organization,

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.220
but came up with some
common approaches

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.750
to think about
their evaluations.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.390
First we heard from a
lot of faculty members,

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.840
it the student end of term
evaluation is just one tool,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.590
is just one instruments.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.860
And that should never
be the only feedback

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.584
you get from students, the only
time you hear from students

00:28:44.584 --> 00:28:46.750
about how the class is
going, what they're learning,

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.610
what challenges
they face, and there

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.250
are many different formative
assessment approaches

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.870
that you can use
throughout the semester

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.900
to learn from your students.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.790
Second piece of advice that
several faculty shared was we

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.550
often teach in
similar content areas,

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.429
and in similar
domain areas, maybe

00:29:04.429 --> 00:29:06.470
with similar types of
students, and similar types

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.720
of class sizes.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.820
Maybe having some--
take some time

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.897
and go out for coffee,
and just share some ideas.

00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:14.230
You don't have to pass around
the instrument, especially

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.510
if you're concerned about
those outlier comments,

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.300
and you don't want
your colleague to know.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.429
But if you're having a challenge
with engagement, for example,

00:29:22.429 --> 00:29:24.470
in a large lecture class,
and you're hearing this

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.410
from your student
evaluations, maybe there's

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.080
one or two peers that
have figured that out,

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.600
or have used their
evaluations to figure out

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.660
some incremental
changes they could make.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.070
Another strategy was looking
at one or two questions

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.550
that you think are particularly
get at what you're trying

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.000
to achieve in the classroom.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.870
One faculty member I talked
to was very interested in

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.440
whether students felt
supported in their learning.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.510
Do they have the tools
and support structures

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:56.990
to become better in this
topic area, whatever it is,

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.600
because she knows
that she's never

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.460
going to be able to
teach them everything.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.377
She's setting them up
to be lifelong learners.

00:30:02.377 --> 00:30:04.460
Do they feel like they are
developing that support

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.110
structure?

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.270
And she uses two questions
on her evaluations

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:10.720
to get at that information,
and looks at it over time.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.180
And the last one, just
sort of echoing that point,

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.770
is another faculty member I
talked to at the Ed school,

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.830
he looks at just one-- well,
he looks at the whole thing,

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.954
of course, but he hones in
on one specific question

00:30:19.954 --> 00:30:23.710
over time, that he is very
interested in seeing how

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.390
his course develops over time.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.270
So any incremental changes
he makes to the course,

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:33.040
he uses that one question
as a record of that change.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.520
In what way did it move
the needle in a way

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.230
that he thought
would be powerful?

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.280
So these, remember,
we're going to--

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.520
if you RSVPd for
the conference, we

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.440
have your contact
information, and we will

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.060
share this slide deck with you.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.060
But now I want to hear, just for
a minute, as we're wrapping up,

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.300
what are some of
your strategies.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:58.320
So if the technology works,
there is a poll that is active.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.030
What's one thing you use
in your own teaching,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.750
one way of approaching
your student evaluations,

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.075
one strategy that
you found effective.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.510
And keeping with the drug theme.

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:20.059
How would you deal with
your student evaluations?

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.989
So we see one there,
the plus delta

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:49.405
at the end of every
class meeting.

00:31:49.405 --> 00:31:51.710
That's in line with thinking
of the student evaluations

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.994
as being one tool,
one on a continuum

00:31:53.994 --> 00:31:55.660
of different formative
assessment tools.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.190
Thinking about the entire
evaluation as a whole.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.340
That's one way of getting
past those outlier comments.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.200
Maybe give it some time,
let it sit for a while,

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.747
and then look at
holistically, the evaluation.

00:32:16.902 --> 00:32:19.130
Yeah, the focus group,
you're diving deeper

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:20.301
in particular questions.

00:32:20.301 --> 00:32:21.800
You can do that,
of course, any time

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.049
during the semester as well,
especially when you still

00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:25.370
have them as students.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.760
Do a mid-course evaluation, and
follow up with a focus group.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.740
Just a light-weight
conversation.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.222
Not calling out
particular names,

00:32:32.222 --> 00:32:34.680
but this is a theme that came
up in the midterm evaluation.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.360
I'd like to unpack
it a little bit.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.090
Set outliers aside,
or just ignore them.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.331
Ignore the open resources.

00:32:45.331 --> 00:32:46.080
That's a strategy.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.500
Does anyone have a
strategy, but they

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.980
don't have a device with
them, a way of using the poll,

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.354
but they'd like to share one?

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:10.350
Yes.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.755
Actually look at the outliers.

00:33:12.755 --> 00:33:13.630
Look at the outliers?

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.130
Yes.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:14.950
OK.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:21.028
Because the average-- we always
study the average all the time.

00:33:21.028 --> 00:33:23.770
And you think the outliers
provide you a unique insight

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.230
or a powerful insight?

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.912
Powerful insight in
terms of not dragging

00:33:27.912 --> 00:33:31.950
for example, for Dave Anderson,
is the outliers at the very

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:37.240
left give scores
of one or two that

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.270
drag his mean down
to five, and those

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.778
could be the non-US females.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.049
Yes.

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:52.090
Our teacher evaluations
are public to the student

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.810
population, and so I
just reference them

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.630
at the beginning of each course.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.291
Say this is what
went well last time,

00:33:58.291 --> 00:33:59.540
this is what we're working on.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.250
Keep me accountable on the
things that we're working on,

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.590
and let me know.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.804
And I put the plus delta I use
that as a place to touch base.

00:34:06.804 --> 00:34:07.770
Where is that?

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.130
At the Harvard School
of Public Health.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.090
So every comment is
available for them to see?

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.139
Yeah.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.230
Which is true of the
ED school as well.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.980
It is.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.850
For every question.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.710
Whoa.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.210
So does that just mean
people don't say mean things?

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.122
No.

00:34:21.122 --> 00:34:22.946
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:24.314 --> 00:34:26.350
Wow, that's interesting.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.100
And they are used.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.933
At the ED school, they
are used for students

00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:32.360
when they're thinking about
selecting into courses.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.790
They will review the evaluations
to see what they will learn,

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.179
what the class setup is
like the structure is like.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.260
They find-- student
find them useful.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.459
OK, so again, we will
collect these ideas.

00:34:47.459 --> 00:34:48.750
Or we have collected the ideas.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.840
We will share them with
you, and hopefully, you

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.100
will find some of these
strategies useful.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:58.230
As a way of moving on with
getting back into the classroom

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:02.340
ourselves, including a class
that I teach at 1:00 today,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.060
why are we doing this?

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.800
Why do we care?

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.560
Why should we care?

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.320
And this quote from C. Roland
Christensen, at the business

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.160
school, thinking about
what respect can we

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.060
show our students?

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.390
What value can we take from
them, and give back to them

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.390
about what it means to be an
effective instructor, what

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.974
it means to provide then a
powerful learning experience.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.800
So thanks for your time.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.300
We have a minute
or so left if you'd

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.980
like to talk to
any of us, or ask

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.460
more questions
about the strategy,

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.190
or particularly, the technique
that Willis uses over

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.350
at the Christensen Center.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.970
We'd be happy to talk more.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:44.790
I do have one quick
thing that I thought

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.740
I would mention that we started
doing the last few years,

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.160
and I think has been really
powerful is that when we--

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.243
particularly, working with
a newer faculty member,

00:35:52.243 --> 00:35:54.960
we ask them if they would like
to bring with them a teaching

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.570
mentor to the debrief meeting.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.870
And we found them actually
quite receptive to that,

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.430
and that begins a
conversation with someone

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.309
who is close to them
in terms of the content

00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:07.600
that they're teaching, and
is also helping build trust.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.390
We heard about
trust this morning

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.880
as being such an important
part of this process,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.110
and I think that's been
something that we--

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.040
that's becoming more
of a norm, and faculty

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.600
were comfortable with it.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.870
I think that's been a
very positive development.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.850
I just wanted to
share that with you.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:26.370
Can I ask one
question real quick?

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:29.600
In FAS, they spend a lot of time
videotaping people, and then

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.320
going over the video tapes.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.380
Have you found that that's--

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.980
how helpful is that, actually?

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.480
As

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.400
It's funny, we do that
right at the beginning.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.192
We do a practicum.

00:36:39.192 --> 00:36:41.650
All of our faculty are required
to come to a program called

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.480
Start in July.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.750
It's a three day program,
and they experience

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.224
some case-method teaching
in that program as students,

00:36:48.224 --> 00:36:50.640
and then each of them gets up,
and teaches for 10 minutes.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.650
This is really borrowed
from the Box center,

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.070
and then they give a little
pure feedback to each other.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.740
But then we offer, as
the Christensen Center,

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.700
a two-hour debrief to talk
about teaching in general,

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.277
but to basically go through, and
deconstruct their 10 minutes.

00:37:04.277 --> 00:37:06.610
There's a huge amount of
information in that 10 minutes,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.812
and it begins the relationship
that we then carry through.

00:37:09.812 --> 00:37:11.520
I would say during
the semester, it's not

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.630
unusual to have
a class recorded,

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.870
and then we may
review that recording,

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.550
and share feedback with them.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.850
But we would rarely watch
the video with them.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.409
Or if we do, it's maybe
just a segment of the video.

00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:24.950
But we try to get
them to appreciate,

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.470
and they'll watch
videos of themselves.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.970
Good.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:28.660
Continue with questions.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.880
Thank you so much for coming.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.330
[APPLAUSE]
