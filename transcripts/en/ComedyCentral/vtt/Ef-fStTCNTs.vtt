As we go to our next game,
the Midnight Spoil:

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.538
<i> Batman v Superman.</i>

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.577
Well...

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.312
it's on the horizon.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.849
After a mere 33 years of teasers
and trailers and press tours

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.986
of Batman and Superman staring
at each other

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.522
from various angles
at uncomfortably close range,

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.725
<i> Batman v Superman: Dawn of...</i>
 They're doing it there!

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:28.394
Finally comes out today!
Who will win?

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:29.729
Will it be the bat man?

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.264
Will it be a superman?

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.200
A tired entertainment industry
built on franchise power.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.202
I could tell you,
but I don't want to spoil it.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:37.870
So instead
I'll let the comedians do that

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.273
with our first installment
of the Midnight Spoil!

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.208
Comedians, please give me
as many spoilers

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.077
from<i> Batman v Superman </i>
as you can.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.611
And if you tweet at me
that we're giving away

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:47.413
actual spoilers, (bleep) you.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.148
I'm gonna put 60 seconds...

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.684
They're not... these are
not real. Don't get upset.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.486
Don't yell at me on reddit.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.621
Uh, I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock. And begin.

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:56.622
Jess.

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.025
No matter how good or bad it is,

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.760
-you won't like it.
-Points.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.295
Alison.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.896
Robin Thicke plays Robin.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.032
Points. Nicole.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.100
They (bleep).

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.634
Points.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.636
Finally. Jess.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:13.039
(laughter)

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.708
Uh... Penguin is in it,

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.110
but it is a real penguin.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.112
All right, points. Alison.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.981
Batman's suit has tiny little
kryptonite nipples.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:23.316
Nicole.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:27.454
Wonder Woman finds out bukkake
is not a villain.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:32.492
Points. Nicole.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.828
Um, the whole movie is
just one big long Grindr date.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.631
Yeah, points. Points.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.603
(gruffly):
I, uh...

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.836
I-I couldn't help but notice
you were in my area.
