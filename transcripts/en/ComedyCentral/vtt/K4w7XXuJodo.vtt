00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:03.770
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART.

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:08.308
WE HAVE A VERY, VERY GOOD SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:12.880
BY POPULAR DEMAND, OUR GUEST
TONIGHT SOPHIE DELAUNAY THE

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.749
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DOCTORS
WITHOUT BOARDERS, SHE IS HERE

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:20.053
TONIGHT TO LOOK AT THIS
THING ON MY ANKLE.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:25.559
A LOVELY COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUAL
AS THEY ALL ARE.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:29.196
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO FIRST TALK
TO YOU NOW ABOUT

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.464
PROFESSIONAL FUTBOL.
THE AMERICAN BRAND.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:34.535
IT HAS CERTAINLY SEEN ITS SHARE
OF CONTROVERSY THIS YEAR FROM A

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:35.769
GAY PLAYER THAT APPARENTLY
COULDN'T HIT HARD ENOUGH IS

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.338
TO A STRAIGHT PLAYER THAT COULD
BUT PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE,

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:39.973
SHOULDN'T OF HIT AT ALL, REALLY.
TO A TEAM THAT ON PAPER BEFORE

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:47.214
THE SEASON SHOULD OF
BEEN IN THE HUNT.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.448
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKES, HE'S A
TWO TIME SUPERBOWL WINNING MVP.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:52.085
DO WE HAVE AN OFFENSIVE LINE, DO
WE NOT HAVE AN OFFENSIVE LINE?

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.455
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THE
PREDICTION SCHEMES ARE NOT ONLY

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.959
ILL-DESIGNED BUT ALSO
HILARIOUSLY UNDEREXECUTED?

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:05.732
THE POINT IS THIS [BEEP] ODELL
BECKHAM JR., MAN.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.266
OKAY.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.469
NOT A FOOTBALL CROWD.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:18.478
MORE OF A JOURNALISM CROWD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:24.117
JOURNALISM, NO. UCB, YES.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.654
I GIVE, BY THE WAY, THE WORST
CAREER ADVICE IN THE HISTORY.

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:29.356
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:33.794
YOU SHOULD YOU DROP OUT OF
SCHOOL AND START HANGING OUT

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.394
AROUND THAT IMPROV THEATER.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.329
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.731
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO, LADY.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.502
ANYWAY MY POINT IS THIS, THERE
IS MORE FOOTBALL CONTROVERSY.

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:46.640
&gt;&gt; MEMBERS OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMS
COMING ON THE FIELD WITH AN

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.608
UNEXPECTED MESSAGE.

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.876
PUTTING THEIR HANDS UP.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.043
DON'T SHOOT.

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:53.547
WHAT'S BECOME A SYMBOL OF THE
PROTESTS FOLLOWING FERGUSON.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.983
&gt;&gt; Jon: SYMBOLE OF THE PROTESTS?

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:56.917
IT'S FOOTBALL. I'M PRETTY SURE
THEY'RE JUST GOING,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.854
HEY FELLAS LET'S SCORE SOME
TOUCH DOWNS.

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:03.590
OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST PREPARING
TO DANCE AT TEVYE'S DAUGHTER'S

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:07.961
WEDDING.

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:13.233
♪ SUBMISSION
♪ I'VE GOT NO GUN, SUBMISSION

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:18.305
A RARE INSTANCE OF SOCIAL
AWARENESS FROM THE NFL.

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:23.010
JOINING IN A COMMON SIGNAL OF
SOLIDARITY.

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.611
LIKE THAT "HUNGER GAMES" KATNISS
THREE FINGER SALUTE.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.713
OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY THE
DISTRICT 11 RESIDENTS WHO HELD

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:31.051
UP THEIR HANDS LIKE THAT WERE
IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED BY THE

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.688
POLICE, WHICH IS WHERE
OUR METAPHOR -- ALRIGHT.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:35.856
ANYWAY, WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL?

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.329
&gt;&gt; THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY
POLICE ASSOCIATION CALLING THE

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.766
GESTURE TASTELESS, OFFENSIVE
AND INFLAMMATORY.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:46.567
THEY WANT THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL
LEAGUE TO APOLOGIZE AND TO

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.734
PUNISH THE PLAYERS.

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:51.805
&gt;&gt; TO US IT SEEMS LIKE RATHER
THAN ALLOWING WOUNDS TO HEAL

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.373
THAT THEY'RE FOLKS PICKING
AT THE SCABS.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:03:00.347
[BOOING]
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOLY [BEEP].

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.785
SO THE ST. LOUIS POLICE
ASSOCIATION IS ANGRY AND

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:11.091
OUTRAGED TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
IN THIS HAIL OF GESTURES AND

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:16.496
FEELS THAT THE COMMUNITY WON'T
GET PAST THIS TRAGIC PANTOMINE

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.099
UNLESS SOMEONE IS
HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.869
THAT'S THE ANGLE THEY'RE GOING
WITH.

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:22.836
ALRIGHT.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.238
ST. LOUIS RAMS COACH, JEFF
FISHER.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:31.211
&gt;&gt; THEY WILL NOT BE DISCIPLINED
BY THE CLUB NOR WILL THEY

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:32.279
BE DISCIPLINED BY THE
NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:38.852
&gt;&gt;Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A
QUESTION WHEN DID NICK NOLTE

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:40.020
TAKE OVER THE RAMS.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:45.559
YEAH, FISHER THAT WILL TEACH
YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING!

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:50.631
A NOLTE JOKE. HE'S A RAGTOP
COACH.

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:54.368
ALRIGHT, SO I GUESS WE'VE GOT
OURSELVES AN OLD FASHION POLICE

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.035
DEPARTMENT PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL
TEAM STAND OFF.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.236
WHO IS GOING TO BLINK?

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:05.445
&gt;&gt; THE RAMS CHIEF OPERATING
OFFICER CALLED THE ST. LOUIS

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.313
POLICE CHIEF CALLED TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THE RAMS' HANDS UP

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.614
DON'T SHOOT GESTURE DURING
SUNDAY'S GAME.

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:08.549
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, I THOUGHT, ACTUALLY
I THOUGHT THEY WERE NOT

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:09.716
GOING TO APOLOGIZE.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.053
&gt;&gt; THE RAMS OFFICIAL, HOWEVER,
NOW DENIES APOLOGIZING.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.290
HE SAYS IN PART IN NONE OF THESE
CONVERSATIONS DID I APOLOGIZE

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:19.493
FOR OUR PLAYERS' ACTIONS.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:23.864
&gt;&gt; Jon: ISN'T IT INTERESTING HOW
WITNESS TESTIMONY IS SO

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:24.498
UNRELIABLE. WELL, HOW CAN WE,
HOW CAN WE IN ANY WAY

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:26.633
HOW CAN WE CLEAR THIS UP?

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:27.634
HOW DO WE CLEAR IT UP?

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:32.539
&gt;&gt; IN A TESTY AND BIZARRE
EXCHANGE OF TWEETS AND

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:34.942
STATEMENTS OVER NIGHT POLICE
CLAIM THE RAMS APOLOGIZED.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:36.143
BUT THE RAMS SAID NO.

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:43.250
THEN THE POLICE TWEETED THE
DEFINITION OF APOLOGY INCLUDING

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.218
WORDS "EXPRESSION OF REGRET."

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.085
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THEN, AND THEN THE
RAMS TWEETED

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.220
WTF POLICE? #UNFOLLOW AND THEN,
AND THEN

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:50.824
THE POLICE WERE ALL, THANKS
OBAMA #NOTALLCOPS. AND THEN,

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:56.530
AND THEN THE RAMS WERE LIKE THIS
COULD BE US, BUT YOU PLAYING.

00:04:56.563 --> 00:04:58.365
[LAUGHING]

00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.600
LISTEN, I SEE THE
CONFUSION HERE.

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:04.838
THE RAMS MADE THE SORRY IF YOU
WERE OFFENDED NON-APOLOGY NOBODY

00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:07.774
EVER BELIEVES IS AN ACTUAL
APOLOGY AND INSTEAD OF REJECTING

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:11.845
THE NON-APOLOGY OUTRIGHT LIKE A
NORMAL GROUP, THE COPS CONFUSED

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:17.317
THINGS EVEN MORE ACCEPTING IT
FORCING THE RAMS TO CLARIFY

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:18.819
THE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE NATURE
OF THEIR ORIGINAL NON-APOLOGY

00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:21.855
WHICH MEANS AT LEAST FINALLY IN
THIS COUNTRY

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.792
WE'RE HAVING THE IMPORTANT
NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:25.893
SEMANTICS, WE NEED.
