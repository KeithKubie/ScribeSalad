00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:22.040
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
All of the library I want

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.720
to welcome you all here today
for this Open Mic Series.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.190
The Open Mic Series I
actually like to think

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.460
of a tributary of the
Botkin Lectures.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.620
It's a little bit more informal and
discussion-oriented and allows us

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.950 position:56%
to have conversations with artists,
with leading scholars and researcher

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.190
who are working in
folklore, ethnomusicology,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.930
cultural heritage studies and the
like in oral history as we're going

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.730
to find out more about today.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.390
It is also a great strategy for
us to increase our collections

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.810
and build our collections.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.470
This discussion today will be taped
and will become a permanent part

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.850 position:56%
of our archives and we'll eventually
make its way onto our website

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.220
so that individuals around
the room; around the room,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.670
around the world a little
bigger room [brief laughter]

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.540
and individuals in the future
will be able to listen to this.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.410
So with that said, if you
do have any devices turned

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.450
on like cell phones and the like,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.680
please turn it off right
now and appreciate it.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.920
So, today we're having a
little focus on StoryCorps.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.710
StoryCorps is a partner of
the American Folklife Center

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.070
and it was founded in 2003 by
Dave Isay and started as a booth,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.880
recording booth in Grand Central
Station and now has turned

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.110
into this beautiful airstream

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.040
that is parked behind the Jefferson
building right now and since 2003,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.740
or actually since 2005
when they became mobile.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.630
They had been traveling around the
country documenting, interviewing

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.970
or allowing individuals to come
together and interview each other

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.660 position:56%
and share their stories and all of
these stories are actually deposited

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.760
in the American Folklife Center.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.580
So today, among all of
the collections we have,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.860
today we don't really
have many interviews

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.330
with the individuals
who do the interviewing.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.910
So today we are going to do
switch, or turn the tables here

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.060
and have an opportunity
to hear what interviewers

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.360
and what the interviewers

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.240
from StoryCorps have been doing
overall these years, roaming around

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.280
and traveling and how they
learned to do what they do

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.750 position:56%
and their experiences along the way.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.100
And I want to thank StoryCorps,
I also want to thank WAMU

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.330
who is a partner with this
residency here with StoryCorps

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.020
who will be here until
about mid-May.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.030
They've already been here a
couple of weeks, so we're thrilled

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.930
to have them and thrilled to be a
partner and I'm going to turn this

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.600
over to Nancy Groce, American
Folklife Center a folklife

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.940
specialist who will tell
you a little bit more

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.950
about the individuals that
are going to be talking.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.250
Thanks.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Great, thank you
Betsy and thank you all for coming.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.860
So established in 2003,
StoryCorps is one

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.150
of the largest oral history
projects of its kind in the world.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.950
In 2005, StoryCorps
converted an airstream trailer

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.380
into a traveling recording studio
which you called a mobile booth,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.340
right, and launched its first
cross-country tour visiting cities

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.250
and towns across the
country to record stories

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.870
of the American people, partnering
with local radio stations,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.770
cultural institutions and
community-based organizations,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.440
StoryCorps invites pairs of
participants to spend an hour

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.040
in the mobile booth
recording their stories.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.320
Each week millions of
people listen to excerpts

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.240
of these compelling conversations
on MPR's morning edition.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.080
How many people here listen
to MPR's morning edition.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.670
Ah, okay there you go and there's
also the StoryCorps Listen Page.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.740
In recognition of its activities,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.020
the Brooklyn-based nonprofit has
already received numerous awards

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.920
including two Peabody
Awards and in 2015,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.060
its founder David Isay
received a TED Prize.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.170
In 2015, it also launched the
StoryCorps Act, an innovative tool

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.880
for collecting stories that we're
going to be talking about today,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.200
but before we get there,
I want to introduce

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.230
for four StoryCorps members,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.230
staffers who have been
nice enough to come.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.710
I'll start with Naomi
Blech who began work

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.160
with StoryCorps' Mobile Tour after
earning a degree in sociology

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.450
from Barnard College, and
Naomi is all the way at end.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.960
As a facilitator, Naomi strives
according to what's on the webpage

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.840
and we always believe the
webpage, to create a space

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.610
for all individuals to
meaningfully share their stories.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.460 position:56%
She's particularly interested in the
intersection of personal narratives

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.730
and ethnographic research.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:26.020
Talya Cooper is the archive
manager at StoryCorps and has been

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.050
with the organization since 2007.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.700
She also masters in
library information sciences

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.400
from Pratt Institution
and a bachelor's degree

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.630
in anthropology from Barnard.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.370
Felix Lopez began his
time with StoryCorps

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.330
in the Princeton Animation
Department before starting his

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.380
current role as a bilingual
mobile facilitator.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.330
Prior to working with StoryCorps,
Felix worked in art and education,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.190
sorry, worked in arts and education
administration; is that right?

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.100
And he earned his bachelor's degree
in Chinese language and history

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.350
from the University of Michigan.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.280
And finally, Stacey Todd
is a native of Michigan

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.960
and claims you've sailed
extensively in great lengths,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.070 position:56%
you put that on your bio so, is that
what you wanted to be known for?

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.700
We're quoting; exactly
why we're here.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.340
She earned her bachelor's degree in
linguistics from Brooklyn College

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.220 position:56%
and she's been with StoryCorps since
2013 and you all; now let's see.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.040
Three of you Stacey, Felix
and Naomi are facilitators

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.200
for the Mobile Booth and Talya
is here from the Brooklyn office

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.620
where you're less mobile
is that right?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.010
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Yes, I'm immobile,
but I work with the archive

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.150
so that's what brings me
to my connection here.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: You're mobile today.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.060
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Yes.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.430
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So this is in some
ways sounds like a fascinating job.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.160
So we're going to talk to you just
about what it's like to actually go

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.980
around the country and
record stories and what it's

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.000
like to also make them available

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.020
because it's not just recording
them, it's sharing them

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.790 position:56%
with the people that's also
getting them on media so people sort

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.600
of value the stories and then,
of course, from the Library

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.880
of Congress' view, getting them
to the American Folklife Center

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.220
so that they can become
the permanent narrative

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.080
of our permanent collection
our permanent archive and part

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.530
of record of the American people.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.550
So, let me start with sort
of a softball question,

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.310
actually I just went back a minute
for all of you how did you hear

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.550
about StoryCorps and did you,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.550
were you always interested
in listening to stories?

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.770
Yeah, why don't you start?

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.160
So you've been with
StoryCorps how long Nauomi.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.210
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: I started
as an intern this past June.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.770
So I guess it's coming
up on a year now.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:10.270
In fact, this is actually my
first stop on the mobile tour

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:17.570 position:56%
so I've been recording with the
mobile tour for about two weeks now.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:26.940 position:56%
Yeah, so I'm, probably won't have
that many stories or may not be able

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.910
to answer your questions,
but I heard about StoryCorps

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.260
after graduating with a
bachelor's in sociology and sort

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.870
of being interested in
nonfiction creative storytelling

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.460
in different ways to amplify
the voices of marginalized

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:52.670
of disenfranchised communities
both to empower those individuals

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.880
but also to share those
narratives and make them a part

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.920
of our historical records.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.230
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And how did you
feel, how did you feel about?

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.610
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: So I think
I was still in education

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.740
and I was doing a lot of education
with museums and I was listening

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.050
to a lot of podcasts at this
point and I was really in-tuned

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.130
with storytelling based
on my Caribbean family.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.500
We just over celebrations or what
not I would just tell a story

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.550
and with descriptions and it's
this art of really celebrating life

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.440
and I really got in-tuned with
not just history but oral history

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.940
when I got into Chinese language
and culture and how in-tune

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.880
that culture is to storytelling
with its long history and I wanted

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.490
to get involved with
the organization

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.520
that not only tells the history,
but kind of changes the narrative

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.100
and gives it back to the
people and gives them ownership

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.550
of what they want to say
and how they want to say it.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.620
And that's when I got
into StoryCorps and I saw,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.630
and I've been with this past June
so it's almost coming up to a year

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.930
and seeing the different facets

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.230
of what StoryCorps does not just
seeing it in a broadcast light,

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.920
but all the different perspectives
and missions that StoryCorps does

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.220
to amplify the voices
of everyday Americans.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.520
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, how about you?

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.820
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Sure.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.120
Let's see, I've always
been a people person.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.420
I've always been very curious,
ask a lot of questions.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.720
I had a nonlinear path to school,
so was in the service industry

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.020
for ten years, so I'm a big
customer service person.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.320
I ended up working at
StoryCorps for two years

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.620
in the Public Information
and Services Department.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.920
So I was the person that people
went to when they had questions,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.220
which people have a lot of
questions about StoryCorps.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:25.300
So I worked very closely with Talya

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.050
in the Recording Archives
Department,

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.740
the Education Department, you
know, all of our different booths

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.120
across the country
fielding questions,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.960
sending organization towards them.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.140
But then in January of this year,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.350
I started as the manager
of the Mobile Booth.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.070
But yeah, I studied
linguistics at Brooklyn College

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.390
and that did not lead me
necessarily to StoryCorps.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.350
I needed an internship in
my last semester of school

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.750
so I was an interest StoryCorps.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.050
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which
is in Brooklyn.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.350
It's in downtown Brooklyn, right?

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.650
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yes.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.950
Yes in Fort Greene.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.250
It's a fantastic place
to be an intern.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.100
They're very in demand
these internships.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.240
A very large number of StoryCorps
staff members were interns.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.540
Yeah.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: They
just [inaudible]

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.140
through the organization?

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.440
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.740
It's a six month, five
day a week commitment

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.030
at with StoryCorps
internship typically.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.810
So, yeah, I think Talya
were not an intern right?

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.920
The three of us that are on
the Mobile Tour were interns.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:29.220
Yeah mine was from June
to December of 2013, yeah.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.980
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And Talya
you, how did you get

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.320
to connected with StoryCorps?

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.160
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Well, I've
been with the organization

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.300
for eight-and-a-half years, so it's
a little bit fuzzy to remember.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.600
But.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.750
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: How many people
worked with StoryCorps in 2007?

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.000
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Probably less than
half the number of people that.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, how many
people work for StoryCorps now?

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.200
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper:

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.670
About a hundred-forty people
work at the organization.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.920
We have locations across,
so in addition

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.480
to the Mobile Tour we
have our office New York.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.240
We also have permanent recording
locations in Chicago, Atlanta

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.170
and San Francisco and staff
at all of those sites as well.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:11.560
Yeah, I came to StoryCorps kind
of from a three pronged interest

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.350
in being archivist and coming to
work with a really cool collection.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:22.850
I've also worked in, I'd worked
in radio and audio and music stuff

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.350
so I was just really interested
in sound and sound reporting

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.570
and then I also came from a
background in social sciences

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:39.650 position:56%
and ethnography and kind of the
minutia of everyday life and getting

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:44.200
to be a part of kind of bearing
witness to that and preserving

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.530
that is something that's always
been really appealing to me.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So can one of you
walk us or some of you walk us

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.090
through what happens in
a StoryCorps interview?

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.740
How do people sign up?

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.260
How do you get people to come
there and then how do you walk them

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.870
through what they're going to do,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.320
because one of the interesting
things for me as a folklorist is

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.190
that your model is not

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.720 position:56%
to have someone who's a professional
interviewer do it right?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.180
It's to have people who
know each other and most

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.490
of whom are not done
this very thing before?

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.330
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah, we
prefer it it's not scripted.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.340
We prefer if it's not interviewers,
because that's not the StoryCorps,

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.750
StoryCorps is a forty minute
conversation uninterrupted

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.640
with somebody that you know.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.210
But I'll start with a process
people make a reservation

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.850
for an appointment.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.400
I'm sorry to tell you that all
of our appointments are booked

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.390
for Washington, D.C. You can get
on our waitlist if you'd like to be

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.690
on the waitlist if you're going to
be in D.C. for you know the rest

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.500
of our time here, we'd be happy
to have you on our waiting list.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.990
But you need an appointment, so
the way the Mobile Tour works,

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.270
a couple of weeks before we get
to town our appointments go live

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.360
on our website and people
can make an appointment.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.640
It's a free public service.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.500
So you sign up for an appointment,
you need to have a partner

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.680
and then one our staff members
from our office will call you

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.750
and make sure that you
understand what you signed up for

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.030
and that you have a general idea
of what you're going to talk about.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.040
We prefer that you don't know
exactly what you're going

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.730
to talk about, but you
have a general idea.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.690
So you have a date and a
time for your appointment

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.020
and then you [multiple
speakers], exactly.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.150
The appointment takes about an
hour, but you have forty minutes

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.270
of uninterrupted recording time.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.220 position:56%
So you show up, we ask that you show
up ten or fifteen minutes early,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.840
you fill out a datasheet which
is just how we build a profile

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.810
of our participants in the archive.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.630 position:56%
Why don't, do you want to take it
from there Felix what happens after?

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.930
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Sure.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.100
Once participants come
in, we tell them to come

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.030
in about ten minutes before
their appointment time

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:50.850 position:56%
and a facilitator either me or Naomi
will come in, will come outside

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.470
and introduce ourselves and they'll
fill out a participant datasheet

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.970
which is just to build a
profile for StoryCorps.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.610
But usually what we tell them is
what's the most important part

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.610
about the datasheet, because
there are some questions

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.460
that for some people
may be very particular

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.100
and they might be a
little uncomfortable,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.810
is that all those questions
that they fill out are optional.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.710
They can fill out as much or
as little as they like and so

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.930
after they fill out the participant
datasheet they come into the booth

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.600
and it's always interesting
seeing their different reactions

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.520
to the booth; oh it's quaint or
it's cozy or do you live here?

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.270
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Or it's
bigger than I expected.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.040
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Or it's bigger
than I expected and from there

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.890 position:56%
on out we situate them and make them
feel as comfortable as possible.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.080
When we get into the recording
part, because there's two rooms

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.390
within the airstream
trailer; there's one where we

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.300
and the facilitators database

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.250
and the other room is
the recording studio

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.200
and then we really start
talking to them a little bit

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.670
about what the process looks like.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.100
Within that sixty minute
appointment, forty minutes is

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.260
of uninterrupted conversation time

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.650
and the facilitator is
we're only there just really

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.660
to make sure the sound
quality is okay.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.410
We're going to be jotting
down notes,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.540
summarizing the conversation every
few minutes or so and then also

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.470 position:56%
like we may have some questions
sometimes, but really it is the time

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.110 position:56%
for participants that are there to
really talk about whatever they want

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.750
and participants talk from love
to someone in the their family

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.240
that just passed, recent proposals.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.590
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: I had a proposal
in the booth, yeah, a few days ago.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.890
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: So, do you want to?

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.190
&gt;&gt; Did she say yes?

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.490
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: She did say yes.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.800
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Do you want
to continue from there?

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.150
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: Yeah, sure.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:44.890
I'd like to say that I may
ask some clarifying questions

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:49.110
like if they bring up Bob
and they've never brought

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.140
and they've never brought
him up before just

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.450
for archival purposes,
I would say who's that?

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:07.300 position:56%
Or to invite participants to explore
an area or a topic a little bit more

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:13.040
and in that case it's obviously
always optional, you know,

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.010
it's an appointment
between the two of them

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:26.760
to archive their stories together
so they can always skip that,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:33.910
but I think that you can
sort of tell if they're going

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:39.630
to be receptive to a question
like that and it's often something

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.860
that can enrich the experience.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:47.530 position:56%
So I feel very privileged to be able
to ask those questions every once

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.780
in a while and sort of spark
something in the conversation

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:57.010
that might have gone
overlooked, so I think that's one

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.420
of the coolest parts of the job.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.270
And then at the ends we
stop their recording,

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:05.690 position:56%
we give them you know ten minute,
five minute, one minute hand signals

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.360
and then we give them a CD of their
recording to take home that day

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.610
which is really neat and we
invite them to archive their story

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.460
with StoryCorps and at
the Library of Congress.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.590
It's definitely very optional.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:27.770 position:56%
The release forms range from walking
away with the only copy of the CD

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:33.940
to archiving at the
Library of Congress some

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.640
of our partner archives at that the
Smithsonian, or to just archiving

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.740
at the Library of Congress and
not giving StoryCorps access

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:50.590
to your content, to produce for
radio potential which is only less

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.360
than one percent of that stories.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.860
But or to use for educational or
promotional purposes and things

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.330
like that, but a lot of people
are really excited by sort

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.860
of how easily they able
to open up or what came

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.340
out in those forty minutes
and are excited to archive it,

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.590
so that's also something
that's really neat.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.090
And then we take some photos for
the archive, some group photos

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.950
and some individual photos and we
give individuals the opportunity

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.200
to make a small donation to
StoryCorps and that's about it.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.880
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I was just
going to say that the,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.000
we refer to the recording
space as a sacred space

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.840
and people are often surprised
by how quickly they are able

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.140
to make themselves
vulnerable or share something

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.750
that they've never shared before
or how easy it is to ask a question

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.310
of somebody who, you know, you've
never asked that question before.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Is that
because of the physical space

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.920 position:56%
or is it the event that they've
signed up for and they've agreed to?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.220
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: It's a
combination of all of that.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.520
I definitely think the
physical space helps.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.820 position:56%
It's very dim inside the booth, just
two lights over the participants;

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.120
the light near the facilitator
is usually turned off.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.420
It's pretty cozy.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.720
The booth seats are really worn in.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.020 position:56%
The way it's setup is like a booth
at a diner, yet we need new cushions

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.320
which we're getting, but you
know we have limited resources.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.620
So if our booth seats are a little
squishy that's why, but no I think

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.150
that is, think of we've; the Mobile
Tour has been traveling the country

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:50.450
since 2005 nonstop.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.790
So, think of all the thousands of
people who have sat in that space

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.090
and had a moment, had
shared something you know.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.390
There are lots of tears.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.690
People always say that the
cry during our broadcast,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:56.990
well there's a lot of
crying in the booth,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.290
but it's happy tears
sometimes, of course,

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.590
like people share traumatic things.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.890
It's just, you can, the space has
an energy to it and I do think

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.190
that the space contributes to
the quality of the conversation.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.490
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, can you guess
what people are going to talk

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.790
about by as they come, by the
way they carry themselves,

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.090
the way they look?

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.390
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: No.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.690
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Definitely not.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.990
Definitely not.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Give me an example.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.310
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: I think I
can like even give an example

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.920
from something that
happened yesterday.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.680
Someone from our outreach
organization came in and it was her

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.750
and her husband and they were very,
I mean they were giddy and happy

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.590
and excited, but I think you can't
really assume; one of the things

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.000
about being a facilitator is

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.510
that you really can't assume what
people are going to come in with

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.100 position:56%
or what they're going to say or what
the conversation is going to be like

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.380 position:56%
and so it's kind of like just when
you're meeting a new person, for me,

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.990
I feel like when people tell their
stories it's always a present

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:51.130
for me, because I'm humble in
space where I'm part of your life

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.840
for forty minutes and I'm
hearing things that not a lot

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.390
of people can hear or
will hear in their lives.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.770
And especially with
two people that are

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:02.500 position:56%
so personally connected I think life
is life and that we have errands

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.820
to run and we have things to
do that we never have the space

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.270
to have those conversations

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.280
or we really avoid those
conversations sometimes.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.060
And so with the space, that sacred
space that they mentioned there is

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.250
that time where people are
like asking those questions

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.360
and there's nowhere to go, it's

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.530
like you're going to
say, you're going to.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.000
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: People
can leave if they want.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: They can leave, but.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.770
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: That's one thing
we tell people is you have forty

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.550 position:56%
minutes and people usually use it
all and it usually goes really fast,

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.110
but you don't have to use it all.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.180
If at any moment you feel
like you're finished,

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.100
you can give us a signal
and we stop the recording.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.490
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: But it's like
not like, oh you, but like I feel

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.580
like when it comes to a
very personal conversation,

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.840
when someone asks a question
you feel like this is the time

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.670
where I'm archiving this and this
is the only time I'm going to talk

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.170
about this, why don't
I answer it now?

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.800
And so when that couple came
in, they just started talking

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.670
about their grandma, the woman
started talking about her grandma

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.030
and by the second or third
question about talking

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.110
about her favorite memories
with her grandma in Ukraine,

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.590
she started crying and talking
about being a Ukrainian woman

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.880
in the United States and
traveling at immigration

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.860
and I couldn't assume all that
stuff just by seeing her ill

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.670
out a participant datasheet
or saying hello.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.860
So there's always those little
boughs of surprises that come

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.610
when you're a facilitator.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.790
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You mentioned
outreach organizations.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.070
Can you talk a little bit
about that, because maybe a lot

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.950
of people don't realize
how much thought goes

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.870
into who you're interviewing?

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.170
&gt;&gt;

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.920
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: Yeah, so
a few months before we,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.810
before I scheduled stuff, we
start in the office doing outreach

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.370
on organizations that are
working with populations

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.670
that are underrepresented in
the media or in our archives.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:55.000
We have different initiatives
for LGBTQ communities,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.850
for Latino voices,
for African-American

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.280
and Black stories for;
am I forgetting any?

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.580
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Military voices.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.880
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: Military voices.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.450
We try to, we try go
special initiatives

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.860
to incorporate voices
that we are noticing.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.380
We notice that we're
represent we're in need of,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.760
but besides that so we'll do
research on the upcoming stop.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.380
We'll look at the demographics
of the stop and we'll reach

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.710
out to nonprofits, you know,
community-based organizations,

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.420 position:56%
just individuals who we think have a
lot of connections in the community

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.060 position:56%
and we'll invite them to a community
partnership meeting which happens

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.130
about a month before the stop
where one of our colleagues

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.060
from the office travels
to the location and meets

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.210
with potential point people
from those organizations

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.210
to tell them what a StoryCorps
partnership looks like.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.110
And then if they decide that
they want to be partners

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.420
with us they'll get access
to a private calendar

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.310
where they can reach out to people
within their networks and sign them

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.230
up for appointments, so about
half of our appointments and more

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.020
than half in Washington, D.C. go to
people who wouldn't have been able

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.770
to sign up, or wouldn't have
known to sign up for appointments

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.970
without this extra element
of outreach which is one

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.330
of the main focuses
in the office one

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.410
of the really cool
things about StoryCorps.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Naomi and Felix
both spend about twenty-five percent

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.530
of their time in the office in
Brooklyn, so we have a team,

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.500
the Mobile Team has
three facilitators,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.590
Vera is not here today, but
she's in the office in Brooklyn

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.320
so they rotate through
and they work mainly

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.360
in the office in Brooklyn
as outreach.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.020
We take it very seriously.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.890
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And how long
are you, I know you're here

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.640
for five weeks I believe.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.080
Is that a standard length
of time to be at a site?

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.380
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.680
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Yes.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.980
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Four to
five weeks in each city.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.280
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And then you
operate eight hours a day,

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.030
you do eight interviews a day?

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.330
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Seven.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Seven interviews
and lunch [multiple speakers].

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.980
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah, exact yeah.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.650
It's a long day especially you
know in D.C. now we're commuting

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:58.330
on the train just like we do in New
York, so we leave about 9 O'clock

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:03.290
in the morning and our last
appointment finishes at 6:30 so we,

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.010
and then we have databasing
to do at the end of the day.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.420
So we don't leave the booth
until about 7 or 7:30.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And it's all
very intense work, right?

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah.When people are

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.180
in there you really
have to pay attention.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.480
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So what do
you do on your time off?

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.710
You're all, you traveling
the country.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.010
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.480
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: As a
group and that must be.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.590
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: It's interesting.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.810
There's some days and each city
also has a different feel to it.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.680
It feels like there's so
much to do in Washington,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.360
D.C. that I don't want to just
like lay around the house.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.010
So I've been going to
museums and going for walks

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.790
and you know the weather's
been be beautiful.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.610
But there are days
when, because it is

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:45.300 position:56%
such an emotionally tiring job some
days, that you just want to like lay

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.760
on the couch and watch Netflix.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.070
So it's a variation of different
things and every city that we're

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.700
in our living situation is
different, so we're in partnership

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.550
with the local public radio station

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.300
and WAMU has found
us a fantastic house.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.600
We feel very fancy.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.280
We have a backyard and a porch and
a front swing on the front porch.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We can come visit.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.880
We can do some.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.180
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: It's
really-really nice,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.840
so but it's not always like that.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.680
Felix and I in Las Cruces,
New Mexico this January lived

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.280
for a month in a pretty like
mediocre hotel and I ate

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.510
so many frozen burritos
in New Mexico,

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.090
so I'm happy that we have a full
kitchen and a beautiful house now.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: I'm getting spoiled.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.960
That's true.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.080
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: And then in San
Antonio we had our own apartment.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.030
So in addition to going
to different cities,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.380
the living situation can be very
different also whether that be

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.950 position:56%
like with the distance to the booth.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.820
For like in San Antonio we walked
five minutes away from the booth.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.780
In Las Cruces we drove for
like fifteen minutes here,

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.670
it's like an hour commute but
it is the metro so it's nice

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.480
because there are some, there is
some pros of being in the metro.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.380
You can, after the booth we're
already in the hills so we can

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.940
like go out or go to dinner.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.270
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: We don't have to
drive here which is fantastic.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.280
Felix and Naomi are both native
New Yorkers and we're a team

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.980
that travels the country
with two vehicles.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.250
So it makes, I'm a Midwesterner
so I, but driving is no big deal

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.940
for me, but these two it
makes me a little nervous,

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.760
so I'm grateful [brief laughter].

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:20.930
I'm grateful when they
don't have to drive.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.290
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: She's right.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.470
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: We,
I should say anymore.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.210
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So now one

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.840
of the ways most people
hear StoryCorps I think is

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.250
on MPR and Friday mornings.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.040
How many people again here listen
to this on a regular basis?

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.680
So a lot of people.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.110
Can you talk to us
about the relationship

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.500
of what you're recording?

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:53.530
How do you select those vignettes
because I assume they're edited?

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.020
And so do you, when you're
sitting there listening

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.300
through all these stories do you,

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.990
when you hear a really great
story do you sort of mark it or,

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.690
how do you filter things?

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:08.550
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Well we have a
production department that goes

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.890
through the archive and
finds what they're looking

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.210
for for that particular day.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.680
Talya, do you want to
talk about this at all?

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.980
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Sure, yeah.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.570
So I think Naomi, I
think we have a total

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:26.360 position:56%
of about six-hundred produced pieces
that have been generated for MPR

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.120
and our archive has sixty-six
thousand interviews in it.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.090
The broadcast pieces are
about two-and-a-half minutes

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.740
on the interviews themselves
or forty minutes.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:42.880
So as you can tell it's a very-very
small percentage of our archive

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.620
that currently is made
available to the public to hear

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.150
which is something
that we in the archive

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.440
at StoryCorps are working very
difficult, working very hard

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.020
to change with the
generous partnership

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.690
of the American Folklife
Center which is the only place

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.990
that you can currently go to and
listen to interviews in full.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.260
So the way, the production
department has a few

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.170
different priorities.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.520
We want to, in producing
pieces we want

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.540
to represent diverse populations
and also diverse kinds of pairings

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.650
of people, so not have every
single broadcast that goes

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:24.180 position:56%
on MPR be a grandfather, you know,
giving sound advice to his grandson,

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.190
like trying to have different
dimensions, different kinds

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:32.620 position:56%
of relationships and different kinds
of stories and we also do some work,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.770
or the production department
rather which is not my area

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:45.590
of expertise try and often find
kind of untold stories or kind

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.910
of lesser known historical
events that might relate

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.440
to something that's in the news.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:57.860
So I remember we did a piece on
Orangeburg where there is a bunch

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.430
of people killed in a Civil
Rights protest in South Carolina.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Orangeburg where?

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.030
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: South Carolina.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: South
Carolina, okay.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.570
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: And that
was something that, you know,

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.560
is not a story that a lot of people
know about that is related to a lot

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.990
of kind of better known
historical events.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.780
So that's something that we do,

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.970
or that our production
department does rather,

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.780
but then when these folks
are listening to interviews

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:30.470
in the booth there is kind
of different standards,

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.460
or not standards but
just different things

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.320
that they're keeping their
ear out for which is kind of,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:42.110
not just interesting content, but
well-told stories you know people

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:46.060
who have particularly
compelling voices or something.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.040
And it, you know, we
never want to say

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.450
that you know a certain story
is better than another story

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:55.300
because especially from an archival
perspective like even a kind

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.910
of dryly told story
has valuable kind

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:03.260
of evidentiary information
things like that.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.350 position:56%
BF that's kind of the, I don't know.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I do have a couple
of our broadcasts that were recorded

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.230
on the Mobile Tour setup
if you want to play one.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.650
And if anybody's interested

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.690
in hearing the story
we'd be happy to do that.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.150
It looks like I see some nods.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:20.450
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.750
Let's get a sample.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.050
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Pardon me.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:29.860
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I should be able
to do it from here, let me see.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.360
Here we go.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.960
So this was recorded in
Jackson, Mississippi.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:40.640
Our Mobile Tour was
there in 2015 I believe.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.510
This is a father and son
pairing, Albert and Ayden Sykes.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.240
This is one of my favorites.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.530
&gt;&gt; Do you remember what was going

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.330
through your head when
you first saw me?

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.510
&gt;&gt; I remember when the
doctor pulled you out.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.270
The first thing I thought was that
he was being too rough with you

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:00.090
and he actually held you
like a little Sprite bottle

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.890
and he was like "Here's your baby."

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.130
That was the most proud
moment of my life.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.740
Don't tell your brothers,
because there's three of you all,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.920
but it was like looking
at a blank canvas

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.730 position:56%
and just imagining what you want
the painting to look like at the end

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.210
but also knowing you can't
control the paint strokes.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.780 position:56%
You know, the fear was just, I got
to bring up Black boy in Mississippi

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.360
which is a tough place
to bring up kids period,

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.470
but there are statistics
that say Black boys born

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:37.240
after the year 2002 have a one in
three chance of going to prison.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.860
And all three of my sons were
born after the year 2002.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.270
&gt;&gt; So dad, why do you take
me to protests so much?

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.790
&gt;&gt; I think I take you
for a bunch of reasons.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.320
One is that I want you
to see what it looks

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.430
like when people come together,
but also that you understand

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.670
that it is not just about
people that are familiar to you,

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.870
but it's about everybody.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.570
Did you know the work that
Martin Luther King was doing was

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.200
for everybody and it wasn't
just for Black people?

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.590
&gt;&gt; Yes, I understand that.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's
how you got to think.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.930
You decide that you
want to be a cab driver,

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.990
then you got to be the
most impactful cab driver

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.140
that you can possibly be.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.540
&gt;&gt; Are you proud of me?

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.840
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.140
You're my man.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.310
I just love everything
about you period.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.750
&gt;&gt; The thing I love the about
you, you never give up on me.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.330
That's one of the things I will
always remember about my dad.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.540
&gt;&gt; Wow, you said it like
I'm on the way out of here

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.600
or like I'm already gone.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.090
&gt;&gt; So dad, what are
your dreams for me?

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.490
&gt;&gt; My dream is for you
to live out your dreams.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.030
There's an old proverb that talks

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.540
about when children are
born the children come

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.070
out with their fists closed because
that's where they keep their gifts

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.250
and as you grow your hands learn
to unfold because you're learning

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.180
to release your gift to the
world and so for the rest

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.510
of your life I want to see you
live with your hands unfolded.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:10.370
[ Music ]

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.760
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I think
that's a good example

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.470
of one that's obviously compelling
but the dynamic between the two

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:20.090 position:56%
of them is really what the story is.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:21.680
The relationship is the story.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And that
was a straight conversation.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.810
You didn't redo, sometimes
take a longer conversation

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.110
and edited it down

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.410
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Oh,
that was highly edited.

00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:30.710
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.010
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I mean, that.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.310
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That
was highly edited?

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:34.610
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: That hours and
hours and hours of editing.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.910
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh.

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:37.210
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah,
that was a four,

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.510
at least a forty minute
conversation to begin with.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.810
I know it sounds like, it sounds

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.090
like they were just talking
naturally, but that's the magic

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.790
of the StoryCorps editing.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.300
The production team, I mean,
endless hours of editing.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.910
Not to say that the conversation,
I'm sure like if you listen

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:56.040
to the full interview it
would probably entertain us

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.550
and like touch us the whole way
through, that's what I imagine,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:04.290
but we couldn't play a forty minute
conversation on morning edition.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So
you distill it down.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.710
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Exactly.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.170
Yeah, I wish there was some,
none of us are directly

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.750
in the production department.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.840
Naomi and Felix when they're in the
office they do first cuts on pieces

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.420
that they are assigned to.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.880
That's another one of their
duties when they're in the office.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.560
So they can speak a bit
more about that possibly,

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.860
but we don't have a representative

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.990
from our production
department here unfortunately.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:33.120 position:56%
Do you want to say anything about
your experience in production Felix?

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.750
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Production
is really fun.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.460
But, yeah, so we basically
get assigned once a week

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.190
to edit a first cut.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.330
So sometimes production
interviews can be forty minutes

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.000
or sometimes it can be longer,
sixty minutes, seventy-five minutes

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.480
and the first cut is basically
listening to the story

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.420
and really seeing like what kind

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.980
of theme do you really hear the
story that's the most compelling

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:04.450
or like whether you, what sparks
at you or kind of; whatever emotion

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.560
that you're feeling from
that first listening.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.010
And then you edit it to a theme
and then with the producer

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.420
that is helping you with the edit

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:18.890
for that shift will
pretty much listen to it

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:24.110
and just have some suggestions and
if it gets green lit then it goes

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.310
into the production meeting where
they talk about it even further

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:32.260
about whether they should keep on
editing it or cutting it, so forth.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Interesting.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.790
Now I want to highlight
the Mobile Booth

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.170
as well as we have you all here.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:42.940
Since Talya is here, I wondered
if you can say a few words

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.780
about StoryCorps Me and the app?

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.080
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Sure.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.910
So that's a big, has been kind of
a see change at the organization.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:59.250
We created a mobile recording
app kind of as the result of TEDs

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:04.340
of Dave rather, Dave the founder
of StoryCorps winning the TED Prize

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:10.550
and it's available for all
manner of mobile device.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.580
You can go to the app
store and download it.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.780 position:56%
And basically it, I think the
original idea was to have it be kind

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.910
of a "additional facilitator" not

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:23.890 position:56%
that anything could ever replace the
work that these magical people do,

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:28.860
but it has a built-in recorder
and question generator.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.430 position:56%
So, if you're somewhere where
you're unavailable to come to record

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.330
with StoryCorps, if you have
a really great conversation

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.110
at StoryCorps and want to
keep talking to other folks

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.500
in your family, all
these other things,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.810
you can just you know use your
mobile phone, record on it

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:50.700
and then it is uploaded kind of
via SoundCloud and sent directly

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.820
to the collection at the AFC.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: To the
archive here right?

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:55.690
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Yeah.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And a lot of
people are using this right?

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.430
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Yeah.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.440 position:56%
A little bird told me that there
were eight-three thousand interviews

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.520
on the site as this morning.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.900
They are very different
from the interviews

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.520
that we record actually
through the booth.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.580
They tend to be quite short often.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.540
One thing that's really
great, you saw like a second

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.480
of the booth in the video.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.440
The sound quality is wonderful.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.740
They're like very, the booths

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.090
that we have are really
nicely soundproofed.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.390
We have really good equipment.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.690
They sound really good.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:32.740
And just the fact that you're not
sitting around in your living room

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.800
or your high school cafeteria
or wherever it is kind

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.260
of gives a gravity to the interview
that doesn't necessarily come

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.280 position:56%
with the interviews on the app, so
there are, I mean which isn't to say

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.970
that they aren't also
important or meaningful

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.330
or any number of other things.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.220
They just tend to be
shorter and a bit different,

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.970
but they're also all accessible to
be listened to at StoryCorps.me.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:05.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay and so people
can visit them through your website?

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.850
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Yeah.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.420
Through the story, which
is through StoryCorps.me.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.720
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.420
And at this point maybe we can take
a few questions from the audience.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.690
What are people curious about?

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.720
&gt;&gt; And we have a mic.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.910
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh yes, I'm
sorry we have a roaming mic.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.740
Oh, we'll start, we'll
get to you in a minute.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.900
Yeah go ahead.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.120
&gt;&gt; I wondered what kind of
guidance you give the interviewers

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.650
at the beginning of their session
with regard to you know kinds

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.170
of questions to ask or ways to sort

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.670
of ask follow-up questions
things like that.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.690
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: A lot of the
preparation takes place weeks

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.870
in advance when our team calls you.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.530
If you have an appointment
you get a phone call

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.110
and we always ask do
you have an idea

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.590
of what you're going talk about,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.280
and then we do have a
list of great questions.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.530
They're called StoryCorps' great
questions, so they're types

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.070
of things like how would
like to be remembered

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.100
or has been the kindest
to you in your life?

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.280
So people aren't required
to use these questions

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.330
but they're really good suggestive
questions as conversation starters.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.340
But once you're in the booth, we
usually tell people to it's great

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.320
to have questions in front of
you as an idea, but you know what

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.870
like toss them out the window
if your partner says something

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:18.590
that interests you and follow-up.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.330
I think the most important
thing is to listen

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:23.540
to what they're saying
and to follow-up.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.650
Sometimes we get, fairly regularly

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.970
on the Mobil Tour we
have young folks coming

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.640
in interviewing their grandparents
so it's like a twelve-year-old

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.530
and a lot of times they get
really stuck on their questions

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.350 position:56%
and they think like, oh grandma just
said something really interesting

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.190
but I have to ask this
question next,

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.680
so it's kind of the same
recommendation for anybody

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.500
like follow-up with
something that interests you.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.230
Don't get too set on asking
the next question on your list.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I think
there's a question right there.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:41:01.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I interviewed when StoryCorps was
on the Madison a number of years ago

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.260
and we were a little bit nervous.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.720
I was telling stories
about the library.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:14.300
And so we wore our oldest clothes
and when we had our pictures taken

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:20.810
and then several years later I
found myself up on the web even

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:25.580
in this disastrous looking
shirt and I didn't know

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:35.480
if you regularly put them up or
if it was because I saw on a blog,

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.710
StoryCorps blog Connie Carter
said she was coming back

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.760
after fifty years at the Library
of Congress, but guess what?

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.420
She was back in fifteen
minutes with chocolate cookies

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.670
because her mother went
to school with the mother

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:56.460
of the chocolate chip cookie and so
I don't know if it was associated

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:01.670
with the blog or do you
naturally have people's pictures

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.970
up on the web.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.760
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I'm not sure
exactly where you saw your photo

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.380
and I apologize if
that was a surprise.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.650
I know it used to be commonplace

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.030
that we were just really
excited about our participants.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.990
We used to post all of
our participant photos

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.750
on the Mobile Tour on
like a Flicker page,

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.850
but we have stopped doing that.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.880
But it's also possible that it
was, there was StoryCorps blog

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.180
and you may have been featured

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.150
on the StoryCorps blog,
so that's possible.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.450
It's not.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's not usual.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:32.580
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: No it's not usual,
but if you do; so the release form

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.280
that you signed if you want to give
a copy to the Library of Congress

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.650
and to StoryCorps it's called
our general release form,

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.720
and if you sign the general
release form it does mean

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.170
that we are able to
post your photo, so.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.420
&gt;&gt; Oh I'm sure I did sign the.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.760
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: But, again,
it would hard for me to say

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.990
if I don't exactly where you
saw your photo, but I'm sorry.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.290
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.590
Yeah.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:57.890
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: We tend
to tell people now,

00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.990
like your photo will be
taken so wear whatever you'd

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.400
like your photo to be taken in.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.000
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: A lot of times
people are like, oh I didn't know

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.790
that you were going
to take my picture.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.090
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.610
&gt;&gt; The question I have
is for the collections.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:16.210
If you wanted to go to the
American Folklife Center and you,

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:20.420 position:56%
do have to remember the name of
that particular child and his father

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.930 position:56%
or can you just say I want something

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:24.590
on family relationships
in the South?

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.690
What, are you using
cross-indexing through the Library

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:28.030
of Congress or what are you doing?

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:29.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yes, yes.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:32.770
We can cross-index them and
some of our archivists are here

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:37.630 position:56%
and I can turn it over to them for
better explanations, but do you want

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:42.550
to talk a little bit about
how things are indexed?

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.850
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Sure, yeah.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:49.700
Every interview has and actually
Naomi and Felix can speak

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.740 position:56%
to this too because they do a lot
of our kind of on the fly archiving,

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:59.780 position:56%
but every interview is archived with
a description, a kind of summary

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.800
of the handwritten
notes that they take

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.330
that are timecoded throughout
the course of the interview

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.510
and we have a set of
key words as well.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:12.760
Those fixed vocabulary are
kind of like optional kind

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:20.210
of whatever terms seem applicable
that these folks can apply and then

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.420 position:56%
when we're searching the collection
we have a lot of kind of versatility

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.980 position:56%
and you know different kinds of ways

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:31.100
that we can cross-index
things or things like that.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.810
The collection as I
mentioned, is very-very large,

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:39.570
so if you were you know to come in
and look for the Sykes interview

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:43.160
and know only that it was about
you know a family in the South,

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.090
it would probably take
a bit of digging.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:48.610
But thankfully like
obviously the staff

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.710
at the AFC is extremely
familiar with what we have.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.260
Do you all want to
say more about that?

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:55.560
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Yeah.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.050
So some of the things that we do
at the end of the interview too is

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.850
if they mentioned someone
often throughout the interview,

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.070 position:56%
we tell them to write the name down
so they can be part of the keywords.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:10.610
Some of our keywords are
also places, famous people

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.350
and then we do also have
like a set of keywords

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:17.070
that are already prefixed
in when we're databasing

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.300
and there are things
like holidays or health,

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.430 position:56%
etcetera so if you have some general
idea you can put that in and then

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:28.930
from there you might have
another idea like, oh maybe I want

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:33.550
to learn a little bit more about
Vietnam and then from Vietnam oh

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.100
but maybe I want to learn
also about Vietnam and home.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.780
And then you can you
write home and just

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:42.410
from there it gets more specific
to what interviews are out there.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Carl had a question.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:49.490
&gt;&gt; One of the appealing things

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:54.740 position:56%
about the Friday morning broadcast
is you do get these little gems each

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.570
one individual, but I
wondered especially now

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:03.830
that I've learned how carefully the
collection as a whole is structured

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:05.850
through these outreach
activities and looking

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:12.000 position:56%
for underrepresented classes as to
whether yet scholars have come along

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.130
to try to get at generalizations
or finding shall we say

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.710
that represent groups or
classes of interviews rather

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.310
than these little individual gems.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.610
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Yeah.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.520
I can, I mean, I can
answer a little bit just

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.460
about what researchers have been
doing with the collection so far.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.510
Actually a lot of their
research interest

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:46.670 position:56%
in the collection is linguistic,
people who are more interested in it

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:53.180
as a just a tremendous kind
of mind of people talking.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.120
So people who want to do kind
of natural language processing

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.500 position:56%
that kind of thing are really-really
interested in working with it.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.530
And there have been, and I
mean people kind of take,

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.220
tend to take cross-sections
of it rather than looking

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:11.630 position:56%
at it overarching so we've had a
lot of people; we have a partnership

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:14.970
with the National September 11th
Memorial Museum and we've had a lot

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.880
of folks to come in to look at
kind of how people talk about 9-11

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.260
and the conventions and story court
interviews versus and other kinds

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.260
of oral histories or
oral narratives.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.900
So that's the kind of stuff
that people have been doing,

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.440 position:56%
but at this point it's so large that
no one has really come in to kind

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.660
of be like this is the
nature of what is being done

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.610
in a story court interview that
isn't represented elsewhere.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.060
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I remember
when I was working

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.070
in the office there was a fantastic
presentation from a researcher

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.740
from Harvard who, she spent,

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:51.070
I think for two years she studied
only twenty-two interviews.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:55.140
They were all from teachers
talking to teachers and she wanted

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.370 position:56%
to know specifically about that
relationship of how do teachers talk

00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:59.880
to each other about teaching.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.750 position:56%
But she spent two years because each

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:05.340
of the twenty-two interviews
was about forty minutes.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.420
She transcribed each of those
conversations word for word

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.720
and if you're talking

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.220
about transcribing a forty minute
interview that's pages and pages.

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.930
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Lots
and lots of work.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:16.600
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: It's a lot of text.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.330
So, yeah that's I mean
I just remember that.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.820
It stuck out in my mind,
just like a tiny bit

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.340
of our archive creates
a ton of data.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.610
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: And also I
think the initiatives sort

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:34.920
of have larger groupings of stories
in that way, so you know the ones

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.260
that are broadcast
through storious [phonetic]

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.660
or different initiatives
might be those little gems

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:45.550
that you're talking about, but we
also checkoff in our archiving work

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:50.170
if an interview qualifies for
one of those initiatives and then

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.570
if it gets, you were
looking for larger groupings

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.100
of stories you can just look
at the entire initiative.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.710
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Oh, and just to
clarify, storiouses are initiative

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.190
where we collect and archive
stories on Latinos or Latinas

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.970
or Hispanics all across
America and in addition,

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:06.820
archiving in the Library
of Congress.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.620
We archive these stories
into the University

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.440
of Texas Benson Collection.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do you want say a
few words about upcoming initiatives

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.470
because you're doing some
very interesting work

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.880
in the future we've been
concentrating on today

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:24.330
and yesterday, but what's
coming up for StoryCorps?

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:25.630
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah,
we have a new project

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:29.620
that just launched called the
StoryCorps Justice Project

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:35.040
and we are, well our next stop
after Washington, D.C. is Baltimore

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.810
and as the Mobile Tour we
are doing our first work

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:42.380
with the Justice Project
in Baltimore

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:47.960
and I'm shouldn't say too
much because I don't know,

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:52.430 position:56%
maybe Talya do you have the language
to describe what we're doing?

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:55.130
We're working, as far as
I understand we're working

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.920
to record the stories of folks
who are previously incarcerated.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.380
Do you have anything
you'd like to add?

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.680
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: Yeah.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.070
It's specifically focused on
jails and kind of jails as opposed

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.560
to prisons and the roles that
those play in communities and kind

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.590
of general and the larger structure

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.540
of mass incarceration
in this country.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.970
It's explicitly an advocacy project

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.460
which is a little bit
different for us.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.020
But it is going to be, we're
really excited about it and I think

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:30.010
that it's going to yield some
really tremendous stories.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:33.460
We have another initiative that
we haven't mentioned so far

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:38.970 position:56%
which is our legacy initiative which
works with folks who are dealing

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:42.480
with life-threatening illnesses
and other kinds of conditions.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.220
It does a lot of work
with hospice organizations

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.370
and those interviews are a little
bit different from the ones

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:50.670
that record in the mobile booth

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:53.490
because what we actually
do is train staff

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:58.650
at those different organizations
to go out and record interviews

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:02.570
like in people's homes because
mostly, because many of the folks

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.280
who are eligible to participate in
Legacy are not necessarily mobile

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.090
or able to come to the booth.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.700
So this kind of empowers the
people who are going to be working

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.570
with them to go out and
record interviews with them

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.810
and it's a really great
project and we've recorded a lot

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:21.680
of really-really fascinating
content through that.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.200
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh yes.

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:29.510
&gt;&gt; So I'm wondering you know
everybody has these life stories

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.310
of people that their family's with
and maybe they don't have a chance

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.710
to get to be in the mobile
booth but they want to be able

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.250
to record those life stories
and do what you guys kind of do.

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:43.230 position:56%
Do you guys have any, other than
the app is there any program to sort

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:47.270
of empower people to make their own
oral history within their family?

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.600
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: This StoryCorps Me?

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.200
&gt;&gt; Oh, other than the app yeah.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.940
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yeah the
app in StoryCorps Me;

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.810
StoryCorps Me is just the
online platform for the app,

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:59.680
but really the bottom line is and
I hope that that's the message

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.680
that StoryCorps has spread
is that it's important

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.780
to record conversations
of those that you love

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.230
and that people who
are closest to you.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:12.660 position:56%
So the bottom line is record the
story, like I besides doing the work

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.980
that we're doing and putting
the app out into the world,

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:20.300
there isn't a push to
spread oral history.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.200
But I do hope that
people are inspired

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.490
when they hear the Friday
morning broadcast to sit down

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.000
and record a conversation.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.690
You don't have to be at one of our
recording booths, you don't have

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:35.550
to use our app to preserve
a story of a loved one.

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:42.980
&gt;&gt; But for years you've been
have you not been situated

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.880
outside prisons?

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:51.050
I mean was it, I thought, you
know sometimes libraries, banks,

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:56.570
prisons I thought that you had done
prisons right from the beginning?

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:59.350
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: We
recorded a few at prisons,

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:02.270
but I think it's really there's a
lot of logistical issues that come

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:05.890
up when we've tried to
partner with prisons and jails.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:07.590
It's not an easy thing to do.

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:10.040
There's a lot of legal
ramifications.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.280
So no, I know of one broadcast
in particular that was recorded

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.500
at a facility outside of Chicago.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:21.280
But from my knowledge, we haven't
done a lot of recording at prisons.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, yes.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.790
&gt;&gt; Just quickly your favorite
story and who would you interview?

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:31.450
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Well
that's easy for me.

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:32.750
I'll go first.

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:36.610
I've already interviewed
both my mother and my father.

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:37.990
I would love to interview
my brother.

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:39.560
That hasn't happened
yet, but it will happen

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.140
within the next year I'm sure.

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.280
My favorite story that
I've recorded?

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.660 position:56%
I mean there's so many to choose
from, but one that will always stick

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:49.280
in my mind and I don't remember
if Felix was with my that day.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.340
In Las Cruces, New Mexico
I recorded a conversation

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:58.040
with two street musicians like
elderly just like amazing people

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.080
in Las Cruces, like very
well-known in the community

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.150
and it was just fantastic to
hear them talk to each other,

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:07.240
but also like the brought in
their guitars and played music.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.290
I, people play music fairly
regularly in the booth.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.510
It's not something that we
necessarily tell them to bring

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:15.820
in their instruments, but before we
came to D.C. we were in Nashville

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.050
and there was a lot
of music in the booth.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:22.710 position:56%
A woman wore a washboard tie one day
to the booth and played and sang.

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.020
That was one of, that was one of
favorite things is when people sing

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.790
in the booth, so those
stick out in my memory.

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:30.290
Felix.

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:33.080
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Since you're like
talking about musical instruments,

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.220
two of my favorite things like
when I interview is like one is

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.050
when it involves children
because they sometimes,

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.540
they surprise me every time
whether they're interviewing

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.280
or whether they be the storyteller.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.840
And there's this one child in
particular, I think this is

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.290
in San Antonio and he
specifically plays the accordion,

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:58.420
he is eight years old
and he plays this type

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.990
of music called [foreign
word spoken].

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:05.440
And it's a very old, it's an
old theme of music usually

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.400
of in the Mexican community and
he's the youngest person who plays

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:14.030
in the band that is learning
[foreign word spoken]

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:15.360
and learning accordion.

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.670
I think the next, the next
youngest is like in their sixties.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:21.400
So like he is like
the, very-very young

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.870
and he just played the whole time.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:26.770
He barely said a word or
two, he's like can I play?

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:28.070
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:29.370
And he's like can I
play another song?

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:31.950 position:56%
Can I play another, so basically the
whole interview was him playing the

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:34.730
accordion and it just showed
he's like one of the things

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:38.020
that he learned was you have

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:40.920
to practice every day
or else I won't be good.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:46.980
And like having that value
already like in his mind and seeing

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.590
like what the potential is for him

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:51.300
in the future was just a
wonderful interview, so.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.200
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Who
would you interview?

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.500
&gt;&gt; Felix Lopez: Who
would I interview?

00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:02.430
I, I think I would interview, I
haven't interviewed my mom yet,

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.300
so that would be interesting.

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.600
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And Naomi?

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.830
&gt;&gt; Naomi Blech: I don't have
a favorite, but one that stuck

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:12.130
out to me from this
trip was this woman

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.980
who is doing genealogy
research on her family and sort

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.740
of was not reunited,
because they'd only heard

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.620
about each other a little
bit through childhood.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:25.450
They never actually met
with her cousin who was one

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:31.690
of the first famous classical
African-American concert pianists

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:34.240
and had like traveled the
world and did all these things

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.350
and she was able to, you
know, meet back up with him

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:41.270 position:56%
and he was a really big influence in
her son's life now and it was just

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:45.390
like a whole full circle type of
interview that was really touching

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:47.750
and then I did a little bit
of research about him after,

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:51.610
it was just really impressive
and I was really excited,

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.910
but I also love when kids come in.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:57.250
And I would interview
a family member,

00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.550
there's so many people
I want to hear about,

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:01.590
my mom, my brother, I guess.

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:03.720
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: I think Talya
you can answer this question too,

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.360
what's your favorite
story in the archives?

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:13.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: There's so-so
many, but there's one that I always,

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.530
that I just always think of
whenever someone asks me what

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:16.830
about my favorite interview is.

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:21.530
So it's just like kind of like
related to people being unexpected,

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:24.880
it came in through
one of our actually

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.010
through Legacy initiative you know
and there's a picture of this kind

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.970
of mild-mannered looking
old lady and she talks

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:34.290
about being a Nascar driver.

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:38.960
Like a stock car racer like
before Nascar was a thing

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.370
when like stock car racing
was still really kind

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:48.930
of like basically criminal and just
like how she would just like champ

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:52.650
and just like beating all these
men and like her husband was like,

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:54.890
you can't drive that fast
and she was like yes I can,

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:57.940
so I really love that one.

00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:01.770
And I don't know who I
would want to interview.

00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:03.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: You've
interviewed a lot of people already.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:06.920
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: I've interviewed
a lot of people already, so.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay
you might be next.

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:09.930
&gt;&gt; Talya Cooper: TBF.

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:11.520
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I've, no I want
to thank all of you for coming.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.820
This has been great.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.730 position:56%
You're here for another three weeks.

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:16.030
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Yes.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.180
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And I know the
booth isn't really open for tours,

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:24.200
but if people want to see the
booth it's just behind the rear

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.730
of the Jefferson Building, we're
in the Jefferson Building now

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:29.390
so if you walk around
they'll be setup.

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.540
You're all, you get Tuesdays and.

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.310
&gt;&gt; Stacey Todd: Tuesdays and
Thursdays are not recording days.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:38.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And other than that
there's someone there, so again,

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:42.510
thank you all for coming and
thanks StoryCorps for being here.

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:45.040
