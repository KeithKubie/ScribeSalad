00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.180
If you take a peek at a list of pilots who
were considered flying aces during WW2, you’ll

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.369
notice that the top of the list is dominated
by Luftwaffe pilots, some of whom scored hundreds

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.710
of aerial victories during the war.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.880
While their skill and prowess in the air is
undeniable, it’s arguable that the finest

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.760
display in aerial combat during WW2 was achieved,
mostly by luck, by an American B-24 co-pilot

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.640
when he scored a single enemy kill with nothing
but a handgun, at about 4,000-5,000 feet (about

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.270
1.3 km) in altitude, and without a plane.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.840
This is the story of Owen Baggett.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.110
Born in 1920 in Texas, after finishing high
school, Baggett moved to the city of Abilene

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.050
to enroll in Hardin–Simmons University.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.690
While we were unable to discern what Baggett
studied from the sparse amount of information

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.790
available about his early life, the fact that
he went to work at Johnson and Company Investment

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.869
Securities in New York after graduating suggests
he studied finance, business, or another similar

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:15.869
subject.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.740
Whatever the case, while still working at
the investment firm in New York in December

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.549
of 1941, Baggett volunteered for the Army
Air Corps and reported for basic pilot training

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.049
at the New Columbus Army Flying School.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.380
After graduating from basic training, Baggett
reported for duty in India, just a stone’s

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.310
throw away from Japanese occupied Burma with
the Tenth Air Force.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.110
Baggett eventually became a co-pilot for a
B-24 bomber in the 7th Bomb Group based in

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.909
Pandaveswar and reached the rank of 2nd Lieutenant.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.719
During his time with the 7th Bomb Group, Baggett’s
duties mainly consisted of flying bombing

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.259
runs into Burma and helping defend allied
supply routes between India and China.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.740
Baggett’s career was mostly uneventful,
or at least as uneventful as it could be given

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.460
the circumstances, for around a year until
he was called upon to take part in a bombing

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.279
run on March 31, 1943.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:11.680
The mission itself was fairly simple- Baggett
and the rest of the 7th Bomb Group were to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.560
fly into Burma and destroy a small, but vital
railroad bridge near the logging town of Pyinmana.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.050
However, shortly after taking off, the (unescorted)
bombers of the 7th Bomb Group were attacked

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.560
by a few dozen Japanese Zero fighters.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.690
During the ensuing dogfight, the plane’s
emergency oxygen tanks were hit, severely

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.170
damaging the craft.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.810
Ultimately, 1st Lt. Lloyd Jensen gave the
order for the crew to bailout.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.370
Baggett relayed the order to the crew using
hand signals (since their intercom had also

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.760
been destroyed) and leapt from the aircraft
with the rest of the surviving crew.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.130
Not long after the crew bailed out, the attacking
Japanese Zeros began training their guns on

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.080
the now-defenceless crewman lazily floating
towards the ground.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.590
Baggett would later recall seeing some of
his crewmates being torn to pieces by gunfire

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.500
(in total 5 of the 9 aboard the downed bomber
were killed).

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.160
As for himself, a bullet grazed his arm, but
he was otherwise fine.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.800
In a desperate bid to stay that way, after
being shot in the arm, Baggett played possum,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.420
hanging limp in his parachute’s harness.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.280
According to a 1996 article published in Air
Force Magazine, this is when Baggett spotted

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.080
an enemy pilot lazily flying along almost
vertically in mid-air to come check out whether

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.120
Baggett was dead or not, including having
his canopy open to get a better look at Baggett.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.390
When the near-stalling plane came within range,
Baggett ceased to play dead and pulled out

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.870
his M1911 from its holster, aimed it at the
pilot, and squeezed the trigger four times.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.340
The plane soon stalled out and Baggett didn’t
notice what happened after, thinking little

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.660
of the incident, being more concerned with
the other fighters taking pot shots at he

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.100
and his crew.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.800
After safely reaching the ground, Baggett
regrouped with Lt Jensen and one of the bomber’s

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.240
surviving gunners.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.400
Shortly thereafter, all three were captured,
at which point Baggett soon found himself

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.180
being interrogated.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.710
After telling the events leading up to his
capture to Major General Arimura, commander

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.000
of the Southeast Asia POW camps, very oddly
(as no one else in his little group was given

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.789
the opportunity), Baggett was given the chance
to die with honour by committing harakiri

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.489
(an offer he refused).

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.699
Later, while still a POW, Baggett had a chance
encounter with one Col. Harry Melton.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.569
Melton informed him that the plane that Baggett
had shot at had crashed directly after stalling

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.340
out near him and (supposedly) the pilot’s
body had been thrown from the wreckage.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.590
When it was recovered, he appeared to have
been killed, or at least seriously injured,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.889
via having been shot, at least according to
Colonel Melton.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.070
Despite the fact that the plane had crashed
after his encounter with it, Baggett was still

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.990
skeptical that one (or more) of his shots
actually landed and figured something else

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.220
must have happened to cause the crash.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.450
Nevertheless, it was speculated by his compatriots
that this must have been the reason Baggett

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.190
alone had been given the chance to die with
honour by committing harakiri after being

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.370
interrogated.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.560
Baggett never really talked about his impressive
feat after the fact, remaining skeptical that

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.600
he’d scored such a lucky shot.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.630
He uneventfully served the rest of his time
in the war as a POW, dropping from a hearty

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.390
180 pounds and change to just over 90 during
the near two years he was kept prisoner.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.560
The camp he was in was finally liberated on
September 7, 1945 by the OSS and he continued

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.389
to serve in the military for several years
after WW2, reaching the rank of colonel.

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.910
The full details of his lucky shot were only
dug up in 1996 by John L Frisbee of Air Force

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.910
Magazine.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.419
After combing the records looking to verify
or disprove the tale, it turned out that while

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.370
Col. Harry Melton’s assertion that the pilot
in question had been found with a .45 caliber

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.310
bullet wound could not be verified by any
documented evidence, it was ultimately determined

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.600
that Baggett must have managed to hit the
pilot.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.770
You see, the plane in question appears to
have stalled at approximately 4,000 to 5,000

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.350
feet (so an amazing amount of time for the
pilot to have recovered from the stall had

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.600
he been physically able) and, based on official
mission reports by survivors, there were no

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.250
Allied fighters in the vicinity to have downed
the fighter and no references of anyone seeing

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.610
any friendly fire at the slow moving plane
before its ultimately demise.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.300
Further, even with some sort of random engine
failure, the pilot should have still had some

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.699
control of the plane, instead of reportedly
more or less heading straight down and crashing

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:45.360
after 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.080
the stall.
