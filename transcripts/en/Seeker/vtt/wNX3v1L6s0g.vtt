00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.290
A super creepy "real-life" Barbie woman monster
thinks she's going to be able to survive on

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:16.279
only sunlight and air

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.160
Howdy folks, Trace here for DNews -- Valeria
Lukyanova has had a lot of alterations to

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.789
become a real-life Barbie.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.329
It's weird and creepy and gross, but that's
beside the point.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.769
She has now come out as a wanna-be Breatharian.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.570
Breatharian isn't a word she made up, ohhhh
no.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.290
It's from Eastern teachings and centers around
a belief that food and water aren't necessary

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.290
to survive...

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.410
She seems to want to survive on sunshine and
rainbows!

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.410
But she can't.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.620
Humans don't have chlorophyll to help us absorb
energy from light, we get energy from food.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.510
Firstly, while there are studies to show intermittent
fasting might have a benefit in mice, to completely

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.940
stop eating is just cray cray. Gandhi fasted
for 21 days, and doctors believe humans can

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.050
go, maybe, eight weeks without food -- as
long as we have water.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.869
Biologically, starvation involves a set of
events that have never in history been conquered.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.060
No one has ever gone without food permanently
and survived.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.200
First, the body burns carbs and sugars then
proteins; eventually it will break down its

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.560
own muscles to stay alive.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.509
Without food, brain runs on proteins and sugars
broken down within the body, it's an evolutionary

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.640
advantage, but the lack of energy causes weakness
and confusion, immune deficiency and irritability.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.490
Once full-on starvation hits, Miss Lukyanova
will have convulsions, hallucinations, muscle

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.159
spasms, and chronic diarrhea.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.420
This might take a few weeks... but it is inevitable.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.420
And that's the easy bit.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.619
We can't survive for more than 3-to-5 days
without water.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.270
H2O lubricates our joints, protects our mucous
membranes, regulates body temperature, helps

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.609
dissolve minerals into our bloodstream and
flush waste, and keeps the cells and fluids

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.170
in our body plump and happy.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.740
A baby in a hot car could die from lack of
fluids in a matter of hours.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.990
Adult humans can survive a bit longer, depending
on their health.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.500
First, they'll experience a lack of saliva
and urine; eventually dry mouth; dry, sunken

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.849
eyes; rapid heartbeats; vomiting; and diarrhea.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.959
Less than a week later, during full-blown
dehydration, the human body goes into shock

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.040
to protect itself and then dies.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.900
Not having enough to eat is bad enough, attempting
to go without eating and living off "sunlight

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.370
and air" is dumb.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.590
Let's say Miss Real-Life Barbie knows all
this, and she's going to sneak the essentials

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.590
of life.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.600
What's the minimum she needs to survive?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.459
Medically supervised very-low calorie diets
exist where patients only consume five to

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.519
eight hundred calories per day, usually of
a high-nutrient shake or bar.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.159
It must be medically supervised because often
patients produce gallstones and experience

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.500
starvation symptoms.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.269
The doctor can monitor and swoop in to save
the person from their lack of diet.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.480
In the 1970s, some obese individuals attempted
a fad diet where they'd only eat 400 calories

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.319
a day; many had unexpected heart attacks.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.720
All these plans include lots of water, and
most were tested for 8-12-week weight-loss

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.049
plans, not full-time survival.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.150
Even at that low 800-calorie level humans
need a variety of nutrients, amino acids and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.640
food types to satisfy our dietary requirements!

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.629
It's not exactly easy to sneak food and still
stay healthy.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.599
There are people who claim to live on a Breatharian
diet, but none have been scrutinized by science.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.359
At least four people who joined the movement
have died.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.459
Long story short, we NEED to eat and drink
to live.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.519
That might be obvious to some humans, but
apparently not all...

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.409
Do you think this Barbie girl is living in
a Barbie world?

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.409
How do you feel about it?
