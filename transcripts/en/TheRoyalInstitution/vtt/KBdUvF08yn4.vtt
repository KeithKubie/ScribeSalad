00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.170
 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.700
"It is not in the stars to hold
our destiny, it is in

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.830
ourselves." Willy Shakespeare
said that, and he didn't know

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.180
quite how right he was.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.090
The human body is made
up of over 200

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.580
different types of cells.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.369
Each one of these is descended
from that first cell, the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.160
zygote, that formed when the
genes of your dad teamed up

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.810
with the genes of your
mum to make you, you.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.630
As you grew, these cells
multiplied and differentiated,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.130
each one going down a different
developmental route.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.810
And there was no
turning back--

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.750
their destiny was fixed.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.610
It's like clay--

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.760
once it's been sculpted into
twee, ridiculous tat, it's

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.580
forever stuck that way.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.560
In 2012, Shinya Yamanaka won
the Nobel Prize for working

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.470
out how you could manipulate our
genes, including the c-Myc

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.940
gene on chromosome 8,
and turn adult cells

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.190
back into stem cells.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:27.970
 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.380
These cells are full of
potential, and we can use them

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.190
to make any kind of
cell that we want.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.320
Made from our own cells, one day
we may be able to regrow

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.500
organs, or repair them,
without any

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.540
fear of tissue rejection.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.580
A great man once said, "You
cannot escape your destiny."

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.445
That one was Darth Vader.

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:52.170
But Luke Skywalker
and geneticists

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.420
have proved him wrong.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:14.744
