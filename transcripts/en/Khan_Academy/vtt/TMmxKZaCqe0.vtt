00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.060
I'm going to show you the last
two logarithm properties now.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.500
So this one-- and I always
found this one to be in some

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.460
ways the most obvious one.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.380
But don't feel bad if
it's not obvious.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.690
Maybe it'll take a little
bit of introspection.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.770
And I encourage you to really
experiment with all these

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.760
logarithm properties, because
that's the only way that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.970
you'll really learn them.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.510
And the point of math isn't
just to pass the next exam, or

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.560
to get an A on the next exam.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.990
The point of math is to
understand math so you can

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.360
actually apply it in life later
on and not have to relearn

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.700
everything every time.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.040
So the next logarithm property
is, if I have A times the

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.060
logarithm base B of C, if I
have A times this whole thing,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:59.170
that that equals logarithm
base B of C to the A power.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.530
Fascinating.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.300
So let's see if this works out.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:17.220
So let's say if I have 3
times logarithm base 2 of 8.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.990
So this property tells us that
this is going to be the same

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:30.250
thing as logarithm base 2
of 8 to the third power.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.200
And that's the same thing.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.150
Well, that's the same thing
as-- we could figure it out.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.500
So let's see what this is.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.480
3 times log base--
what's log base 2 of 8?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.540
The reason why I kind of
hesitated a second ago is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.760
because every time I want to
figure something out, I

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.780
implicitly want to use log and
exponential rules to do it.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.200
So I'm trying to avoid that.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.670
Anyway, going back.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.360
What is this?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.110
2 to the what power is 8?

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.570
2 to the third
power is 8, right?

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.890
So that's 3.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.060
We have this 3 here,
so 3 times 3.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.310
So this thing right
here should equal 9.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.820
If this equals 9, then we know
that this property works

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.970
at least for this example.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.980
You don't know if it works for
all examples, and for that

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.990
maybe you'd want to look at
the proof we have in

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.630
the other videos.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.970
But that's kind of a
more advanced topic.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.890
But the important thing
first is just to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.520
understand how to use it.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.770
Let's see, what is 2
to the ninth power?

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.250
Well it's going to be
some large number.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.740
Actually, I know what
it is-- it's 256.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.900
Because in the last video we
figured out that 2 to the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.110
eighth was equal to 256.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.180
So 2 to the ninth
should be 512.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.890
So 2 to the ninth
should be 512.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.820
So if 8 to the third is also
512 then we are correct, right?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.780
Because log base 2 of 512
is going to be equal to 9.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.690
What's 8 to the third?

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.660
It's 64-- right.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.440
8 squared is 64, so 8
cubed-- let's see.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.740
4 times 2 is 3.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.420
6 times 8-- looks
like it's 512.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.150
Correct.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.660
And there's other ways
you could have done it.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.030
Because you could have said
8 to the third is the same

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.950
thing as 2 to the ninth.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.140
How do we know that?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.440
Well, 8 to the third is
equal to 2 to the third

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.240
to the third, right?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.030
I just rewrote 8.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.510
And we know from our exponent
rules that 2 to the third

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.290
to the third is the same
thing as 2 to the ninth.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.420
And actually it's this exponent
property, where you can

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.130
multiply-- when you take
something to exponent and then

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.460
take that to an exponent, and
you can essentially just

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.460
multiply the exponents-- that's
the exponent property that

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.850
actually leads to this
logarithm property.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.860
But I'm not going to dwell
on that too much in

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.080
this presentation.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.430
There's a whole video on
kind of proving it a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.480
little bit more formally.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.830
The next logarithm property I'm
going to show you-- and then

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.580
I'll review everything and
maybe do some examples.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.020
This is probably the single
most useful logarithm property

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.570
if you are a calculator addict.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.700
And I'll show you why.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:31.950
So let's say I have log base B
of A is equal to log base C of

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:40.480
A divided by log base C of B.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.880
Now why is this a useful
property if you are

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.030
calculator addict?

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.520
Well, let's say you go
class, and there's a quiz.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.660
The teacher says, you can use
your calculator, and using your

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:03.390
calculator I want you to figure
out the log base 17 of 357.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.870
And you will scramble and look
for the log base 17 button on

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.530
your calculator,
and not find it.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.150
Because there is no log base
17 button on your calculator.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.410
You'll probably either have
a log button or you'll

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.050
have an ln button.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.800
And just so you know, the log
button on your calculator

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.520
is probably base 10.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.470
And your ln button on
your calculator is

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.560
going to be base e.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.280
For those you who aren't
familiar with e, don't worry

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.080
about it, but it's 2.71
something something.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.920
It's a number.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.000
It's nothing-- it's an amazing
number, but we'll talk

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.075
more about that in a
future presentation.

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:44.580
But so there's only two bases
you have on your calculator.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.370
So if you want to figure out
another base logarithm,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.020
you use this property.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.170
So if you're given this on an
exam, you can very confidently

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.940
say, oh, well that is just the
same thing as-- you'd have to

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.890
switch to your yellow color in
order to act with confidence--

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.660
log base-- we could
do either e or 10.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.290
We could say that's the same
thing as log base 10 of 357

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.810
divided by log base 10 of 17.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.740
So you literally could just
type in 357 in your calculator

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.060
and press the log button and
you're going to get

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.230
bada bada bam.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.440
Then you can clear it, or if
you know how to use the

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.540
parentheses on your calculator,
you could do that.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.610
But then you type 17 on your
calculator, press the log

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.530
button, go to bada bada bam.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.400
And then you just divide them,
and you get your answer.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.050
So this is a super
useful property for

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.370
calculator addicts.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.930
And once again, I'm not going
to go into a lot of depth.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.280
This one, to me it's the most
useful, but it doesn't

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.375
completely-- it does fall
out of, obviously, the

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.050
exponent properties.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.940
But it's hard for me to
describe the intuition simply,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.930
so you probably want to watch
the proof on it, if you don't

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.330
believe why this happens.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.740
But anyway, with all of those
aside, and this is probably the

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.130
one you're going to be using
the most in everyday life.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.850
I still use this in my job.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.400
Just so you know
logarithms are useful.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.110
Let's do some examples.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.360
Let's just let's just
rewrite a bunch of

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.240
things in simpler forms.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:33.840
So if I wanted to rewrite the
log base 2 of the square root

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.860
of-- let me think of something.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:50.560
Of 32 divided by the cube-- no,
I'll just take the square root.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.120
Divided by the
square root of 8.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.090
How can I rewrite this so
it's reasonably not messy?

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.210
Well let's think about this.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.460
This is the same thing, this
is equal to-- I don't know

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.800
if I'll move vertically
or horizontally.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.320
I'll move vertically.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.430
This is the same thing as
the log base 2 of 32 over

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.750
the square root of 8 to
the 1/2 power, right?

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.350
And we know from our logarithm
properties, the third one we

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:26.560
learned, that that is the same
thing as 1/2 times the

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:33.840
logarithm of 32 divided by the
square root of 8, right?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.830
I just took the exponent and
made that the coefficient

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:36.585
on the entire thing.

00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:39.410
And we learned that in the
beginning of this video.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.650
And now we have a little
quotient here, right?

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.340
Logarithm of 32 divided by
logarithm of square root of 8.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.030
Well, we can use our
other logarithm-- let's

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.480
keep the 1/2 out.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:56.470
That's going to equal,
parentheses, logarithm--

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.580
oh, I forgot my base.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.490
Logarithm base 2 of
32 minus, right?

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.010
Because this is in a quotient.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:11.320
Minus the logarithm base 2
of the square root of 8.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.660
Right?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.410
Let's see.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.070
Well here once again we have a
square root here, so we could

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:22.190
say this is equal to 1/2
times log base 2 of 32.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.200
Minus this 8 to the 1/2,
which is the same thing

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.860
is 1/2 log base 2 of 8.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.390
We learned that property in the
beginning of this presentation.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.750
And then if we want, we can
distribute this original 1/2.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:42.220
This equals 1/2 log base 2 of
32 minus 1/4-- because we have

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.960
to distribute that 1/2--
minus 1/4 log base 2 of 8.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.500
This is 5/2 minus, this is 3.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.120
3 times 1/4 minus 3/4.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.440
Or 10/4 minus 3/4
is equal to 7/4.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.150
I probably made some arithmetic
errors, but you get the point.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.730
See you soon!
