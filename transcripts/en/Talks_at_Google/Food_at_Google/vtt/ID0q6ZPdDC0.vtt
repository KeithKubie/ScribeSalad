ELEANOR CARMELI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.350
My names' Eleanor Carmeli.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.683
And I'd like to welcome you
to the Google Hanukkah party

00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:06.590
here at the Google
New York office,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.090
on behalf of the Zagat
team, team Jewglers New

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.210
York, and TalksAtGoogle.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.860
So welcome.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.590
Happy Hanukkah.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.164
Happy holidays to everyone.

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:14.580
And without further
ado, I'm going

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.120
to bring on Kelly Dobkin who's
a senior editor on the Zagat

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.730
team.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.340
And she's going to
take away the show,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.290
and bring on our famous,
well-known, and fantastically

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.070
inspired chefs.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.740
So, Kelly.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.639
KELLY DOBKIN: Thank you.

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:30.680
Happy Hanukkah, everyone.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.850
We're super excited.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.910
I am particularly excited to
have two of my favorite shops

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.910
in York participating
in this latke cookoff.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.590
So many of you may have
heard of Mile End Deli.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.030
We have Chef Eli Sussman.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.390
And we also have Chef
Einat Admony from Taim,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.610
Balaboosta, and the
recently opened Bar Bolonat.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.260
So without further
ado, we're going

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.970
to have both chefs show you
how to make some awesome latkes

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.420
today, two very
different recipes.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.410
After the demos, you guys
can ask questions during

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.650
and immediately upon finishing.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.340
And then we're also going
to have-- each latke will

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.440
be available on either side.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.990
So you guys can taste them
and vote on the winner.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.420
We're going to tell you more
about that in a few minutes.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.100
But first, let me bring up Eli
Sussman from Mile End Deli.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.180
Hey.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.960
How are you?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.245
ELI SUSSMAN: How's it going?

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:18.530
KELLY DOBKIN: Good.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.947
ELI SUSSMAN: Thanks
for having me.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:20.738
KELLY DOBKIN: Yeah.

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:22.080
So walk us through this recipe.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.540
This is a very creative
twist on-- Mile End

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.040
does some pretty classic
latkes in the restaurant

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.220
and for catering
during Hanukkah.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.230
So this recipe, Eli, is
kind of inspired by a bagel.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.230
Tell me a little about--

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.938
ELI SUSSMAN: Yes.

00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:36.710
So Mile End is a Montreal-style
Jewish delicatessen.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.854
It was started by two
guys from Montreal.

00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:41.770
And there's a restaurant
there called Beautys.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.560
And they do a bagel
sandwich call a Beauty.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.069
And it is.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:46.860
If you've ever been to
Mile End, The Beauty

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.530
is a bagel with lox, and
cream cheese, and capers,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.620
and tomatoes, and onions.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.834
So I'm doing a
Beauty latke today.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:54.750
KELLY DOBKIN: Awesome.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.800
ELI SUSSMAN: It's going to be a
classic latke based on my dad's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.470
recipe, super, super simple.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.220
And then it's going
to be topped with lox,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.110
cream cheese, some very
thinly shaved shallots,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.330
fried capers, cherry tomatoes,
a little bit of chive.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.080
KELLY DOBKIN: Wow.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.020
That sounds amazing.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.830
I'm really excited.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.330
OK.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.280
So let's get started.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.240
What is the very first step
to making these latkes?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.990
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.350
So the very first step is
probably the most boring step

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.850
to watch.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.760
But so I'm just going
to grate the potatoes.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.402
So the reason that you
grate the potatoes-- these

00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:23.110
have been washed.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.545
And the reason that I'm going
to grate them into water

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:26.927
is because potatoes
oxidize super quickly,

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:27.760
and they turn brown.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.350
So at the restaurant, we
do this in huge quantities.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.940
And we don't use
a home box grater.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.712
But here, this is
what I'm going to use.

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:38.586
KELLY DOBKIN: See latkes
were the first thing

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:39.336
I learned to make.

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:41.650
And I was always forced
to hand grate them.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.690
My dad said you had
to hand grate them.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.950
But do you agree?

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.262
Does it make a huge
difference or--

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:48.220
ELI SUSSMAN: I suppose.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.844
We look at this way
at the restaurants.

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:53.240
It's like, sometimes
things that take longer,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.669
you put a little more
love and care into them,

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:56.710
and they come out better.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.210
A lot of things that
we do at the restaurant

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.950
are the fashioned way, which
is kind of we pride ourselves

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.720
on doing things,
reinventing, and re-imagining

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.647
the deli classic.

00:03:04.647 --> 00:03:07.105
So a lot of the stuff that we
do takes a little bit longer.

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:09.599
And often that results
in it being better.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.390
KELLY DOBKIN: Yeah.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.181
ELI SUSSMAN: So no.

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.620
You don't need to
hand grate them.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.020
But I figure that
a lot of people

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.700
don't have Cuisinarts or
whatever at their apartment,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.630
so-- probably most of you don't
even cook in your apartments.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.270
KELLY DOBKIN:
Probably most people

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.050
don't have the counter
space to even get--

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.450
ELI SUSSMAN: Really,
really clean kitchens

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.575
that no one has ever touched
in there entire lives.

00:03:25.575 --> 00:03:26.685
KELLY DOBKIN: Yeah.

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:27.560
ELI SUSSMAN: So yeah.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.830
At the restaurant, we dd--
well, right now for Hanukkah,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.210
we're doing 50-pound batches
of potatoes for latkes.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.020
So we don't do those by hand.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.290
We do them in a [? robaku. ?]

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.720
KELLY DOBKIN: That
would take like a week.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.080
Yeah.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.871
ELI SUSSMAN: They still
get formed by hand.

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.130
So last night-- we had two
really big parties today.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.070
So we made 1,000 latkes last
night for this party as well.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.400
And they're all hand-formed.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.569
So it's still time
consuming no matter what.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.360
KELLY DOBKIN: So tell
me a little bit about

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.300
your-- you're saying this is--

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.982
ELI SUSSMAN: Joel do you want to
come up and grate a little bit?

00:03:55.982 --> 00:03:57.190
KELLY DOBKIN: I can help too.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.020
ELI SUSSMAN: This
is my favorite part.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.250
I get to put my boss to work.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.750
Joe's one of the
owners of Mile End.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.640
And I'm going to give him
the incredibly tedious task

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.035
of creating the potatoes.

00:04:07.762 --> 00:04:09.470
You want to slide over
just a little bit?

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.969
KELLY DOBKIN: So
Joel, have you ever

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.751
had to grate any latkes before?

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.699
JOEL TIETOLMAN: Not
since high school.

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.709
KELLY DOBKIN: And how long can
you grate for is the question.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.680
Like, 5 minutes, 10 minutes?

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.620
What's your--

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.540
ELI SUSSMAN: He's already bored.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.405
JOEL TIETOLMAN: It;s almost
the same motion as slicing

00:04:24.405 --> 00:04:25.197
briskets.

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:27.626
So it's not that far off.

00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:28.970
I'll be good.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.147
ELI SUSSMAN: So
the next step is--

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.980
so you're going to grate
the onions as well.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.130
And what I did was I
just took one end off.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.100
And then I made a slight
slit down the side.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.926
And I"m going to peel
off the outer layer.

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:42.550
And what I want to do is I want
to leave the nub on because you

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.410
want to make sure that
you leave something

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.550
to hold the onion together when
you're going to be grating it.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.890
If you take off both ends, the
onion's going to split apart.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.040
That's ready for Joel to
go grate that in a couple.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.790
JOEL TIETOLMAN: And do
the [INAUDIBLE] also?

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.020
ELI SUSSMAN: No.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.436
When we're done
with the potatoes.

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:55.660
That one, you can hang
on that for a second.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.900
So this recipe is super simple.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.420
It's just really potato,
onion, four, matzo meal, egg,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.920
and a little bit
of salt and pepper.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.500
And we do a lot of
zany, fun latkes.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.810
We do sweet potato latkes.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.290
We do butternut squash latkes.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.750
We do beet latkes.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.130
I like this one because
as like a classic base,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.490
who doesn't like fried potato?

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.480
KELLY DOBKIN: No one I know.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.680
ELI SUSSMAN: As a pretty much
a base for any type of topping,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.440
we go with the classic latke.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.856
KELLY DOBKIN: Is
this pretty close

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:30.390
so like what your father taught
you as a kid growing up or--

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.220
ELI SUSSMAN: So this is
exactly my dad's recipe,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.290
just with a little bit
of matzo meal thrown in.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.047
I like the matzo meal
because texturally,

00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:38.380
I think it's nice on the inside.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.330
And also, even though
we're grating the potatoes

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.310
into water, obviously, when
you're frying something,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.330
moisture is the enemy, right?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.539
So I guess it's slightly
counter intuitive.

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.580
But so we're going to
grate all these into water.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.440
And then we're
going to squeeze out

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.320
all the water, which
is kind of messy,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.550
but also part of
the fun I think.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.510
When you make latkes,
you make them by hand.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.579
It's a little bit sloppy.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:01.620
You're trying to probably
do it with your friends

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.453
or with your family.

00:06:02.453 --> 00:06:05.260
And so when Joel grates
all the potatoes,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.269
I'll hand squeeze all
of the moisture out.

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:08.560
KELLY DOBKIN: He's still going.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.726
JOEL TIETOLMAN: Almost done.

00:06:09.726 --> 00:06:11.601
ELI SUSSMAN: And then
we'll grate the onions,

00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.309
squeeze out the moisture
from the onions,

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:14.890
and then mix in the
dry ingredients,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.950
and then put an egg in,
and form them together.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.450
So I'll get this
started right now.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.480
KELLY DOBKIN: Great.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.960
So would you say--
what would you

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.700
say are the most
common, when you

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.590
experience a bad latke, what
are some of the characteristics?

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.810
Are they overcooked,
undercooked?

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.940
Are people not squeezing
out enough water

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.230
before they fry them?

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.720
What do you think are the--

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.595
ELI SUSSMAN: Hold on.

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:37.520
Is their a pilot on this?

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.710
There it is.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.210
Got it.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.440
Cool.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.940
Sorry.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.290
What was the question?

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.180
KELLY DOBKIN: What
do you think are

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.763
some of the most
common-- I see latkes

00:06:43.763 --> 00:06:46.050
botched all the
time in restaurants.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.270
Sometimes they're soggy.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.530
Sometimes they're overcooked.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.490
What do you think are like--
what's a common mistake when

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.699
making latkes, Do you think?

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.990
ELI SUSSMAN: Well, we par
fry ours and then re-fry them

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.830
to order.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.679
And so that's just
something that we

00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:57.720
do with our french fries.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.553
It's something that a
lot of restaurants do.

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:02.230
And so we fry them
at 250 degrees.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.050
And then we re-fry
them before they

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.730
hit the table at 350 degrees.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.310
And we found that that
makes them super crispy.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.770
I imagine that if
you're at home,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.353
you probably don't
want to double fry.

00:07:11.353 --> 00:07:13.460
It's jut kind of-- it's
an annoying process.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.770
So you could just fry to order.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.360
I also think making
them really skinny

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.660
is good, because the less
interior, the more surface

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.220
area.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.940
You're going to get
a crispier latke.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.742
But also, it's really about just
doing them in a timely manner.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.450
You don't want them
to sit out very long.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.210
So I guess if you do them, you
could hold them in your oven

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.270
at like 200 degrees
for two hours

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.020
or something like that
after you fry them.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.100
But they're obviously the
best when they're made

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.944
and them served right away.

00:07:44.944 --> 00:07:46.860
KELLY DOBKIN: While we're
getting stuff ready,

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.276
does anyone have any latke
questions they want to ask Eli?

00:07:49.276 --> 00:07:50.340
Now's your chance.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.840
ELI SUSSMAN: Or any
other questions?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.785
KELLY DOBKIN: Or any other
questions about Mile End or--

00:07:53.785 --> 00:07:55.160
ELI SUSSMAN: I'll talk
about latkes all day

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.140
if you really want.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.650
So yeah.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.691
So I'm just going to
squeeze out as much moisture

00:07:58.691 --> 00:07:59.710
as I can from this.

00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:04.950
ELEANOR CARMELI: That's
a super important step

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.910
is squeezing out the water,
because if anyone else at home

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.270
is trying to fry a potato
without doing that,

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.370
it just doesn't get brown.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.745
ELI SUSSMAN: There
are other ways

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:14.167
to guard against oxidation.

00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:16.000
But this is just like
the old-fashioned way.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.170
We can do it like this
and it works out fine.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.215
You can, definitely.

00:08:20.215 --> 00:08:21.590
If you're doing
a huge batch, you

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.850
could grate the potatoes
several hours in advance

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.330
and hold them in the water.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.140
They don't really
deteriorate that much.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.350
So if you can't
afford time to do it

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.940
all in one day or whatever,
you can do them the day before,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.165
for all the people that are
having huge latke parties

00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:38.929
at your apartment later today.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.859
KELLY DOBKIN: Oh.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.940
AUDIENCE: So you cooked
1,000 latkes last night?

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.690
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.773
AUDIENCE: How many people
does it take to do that?

00:08:50.773 --> 00:08:52.024
How do you stage the potatoes?

00:08:52.024 --> 00:08:53.189
ELI SUSSMAN: How do we what?

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:54.948
AUDIENCE: How do you
stage the potatoes?

00:08:54.948 --> 00:08:56.781
Do you put them in a
gigantic pool of water?

00:08:56.781 --> 00:09:01.750
ELI SUSSMAN: So we do them
in like 30-pound batches.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.346
So you sanitize the drop
sink in the kitchen,

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:08.970
you fill it with water, you have
the potatoes sitting in there.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.790
And then those, because we
actually do them so quickly,

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.440
we don't grate those into water.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.430
We just alternate
between onion and potato.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.971
And it goes through
the [? robaku ?],

00:09:16.971 --> 00:09:19.830
which is like an
industrial cooking device.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.390
And it has a grater that spins.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.530
So we grate it into
a huge, basically

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.367
like a plastic bus tub.

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.200
And then we mix all the
ingredients into it.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.780
And then three guys
stand In a row.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.300
And we just form them by hand.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.730
And we just throw them into the
fryer and do them in batches.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.314
It's not super difficult
from a labor standpoint.

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:43.230
It's just time consuming,
because you can only

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.130
fry 30 at a time.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.700
And they take a couple minutes
to fry every single time.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.170
Yeah.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.090
You can turn it
down a little bit.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.360
KELLY DOBKIN: It's
getting a little smokey.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.150
ELI SUSSMAN: You can turn it
all the way off, actually.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.599
KELLY DOBKIN: One more question?

00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:00.745
AUDIENCE: How long does it
take to eat 1,000 latkes?

00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:02.870
ELI SUSSMAN: You guys are
going to figure that out.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.410
How long does it take--

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.216
KELLY DOBKIN: I think I
could eat 1,000 myself.

00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:05.950
So that's very relative.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.074
ELI SUSSMAN: It went to a
bunch of different events

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:11.070
today, because we're well
known as a Jewish restaurant.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.830
So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] all
Jewish holidays we kind of get

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.490
hammered by everybody looking
for us to cater because in New

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.900
York, most people don't really
cook themselves, unfortunately.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.340
So we end up doing-- yeah.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.667
We do a lot of latkes on--

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.000
JOEL TIETOLMAN: A lot of latkes.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.300
Or like--

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.140
ELI SUSSMAN: A lot of doughnuts.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.640
JOEL TIETOLMAN: A
lot of sufganiyah.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.886
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:34.010
And then we do a lot of
braised brisket, obviously,

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:39.380
and the classics,
a lot of poutine.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.774
KELLY DOBKIN: So
the next step is

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.690
we're going to mix the
dry ingredients, right?

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.070
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.695
We're going to mix
the dry ingredients.

00:10:44.695 --> 00:10:47.480
And then here is
my pitcher of veg--

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.447
that should be enough oil.

00:10:49.447 --> 00:10:51.030
KELLY DOBKIN: Enough
for eight nights.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.570
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.420
Yeah.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.200
So it was great.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.510
It was like very ironic.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.650
Our fryer died yesterday
at our Brooklyn location.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.580
So on the first day of Hanukkah
we had nowhere to fry anything.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.230
So we were doing latkes
in this little baby fryer

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.050
off to the side.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.160
So luckily we were able to
get another fryer in there.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.740
But it was--

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.720
JOEL TIETOLMAN: It was
a Hanukkah miracle.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.470
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.072
Exactly.

00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:15.925
JOEL TIETOLMAN: In
the middle of lunch

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.020
it took us about 45
minuets, which is actually

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.524
no time at all to
put out the old fryer

00:11:20.524 --> 00:11:21.580
and put in the new one.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.413
It was an adventure.

00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:24.622
ELI SUSSMAN: Pretty much
the worst possible timing.

00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:26.580
KELLY DOBKIN: So how do
you know like how much?

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:26.860
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.276
I knew you were
going to ask that.

00:11:28.276 --> 00:11:30.310
You were like, how did
you know what to put in?

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.740
I'm just going to do it by
feel, honestly, which is--

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.710
KELLY DOBKIN: You don't it too
wet, don't want it too dry.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.400
ELI SUSSMAN: I
printed out recipes.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.191
And you guys should
definitely follow that.

00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:41.750
But so what I'm looking
for is like a sort

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.202
of a tacky consistency.

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.660
What I like to say
is like, you can

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.440
put an imprint in the latkes and
it doesn't come back upright.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.780
So if the latkes were wet,
if you pushed into it,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.150
they would just kind of spread.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.350
What I'm looking
for is the latke

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.750
to be able to hold into a shape.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.690
So if I form it into a ball
like a size of a golf ball,

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.685
and I press it all
together, I want

00:12:00.685 --> 00:12:03.540
it to have a sort of tackiness
so that it holds, right?

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.650
So it's like almost there.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.020
I can feel that it's
pretty much there.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.920
I'm just going to mix
it up a little bit more.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.336
Joel, can you hit me with a
little bit of salt and pepper,

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:10.930
please?

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.153
KELLY DOBKIN: I love how
Joel's the sous chef, today.

00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:15.468
ELI SUSSMAN: I know, right?

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:16.162
Cool.

00:12:16.162 --> 00:12:18.120
KELLY DOBKIN: Do you need
me to put any oil in?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.870
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.590
Can you get a little
oil going for me?

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.579
KELLY DOBKIN: This is
a team effort, guys.

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:24.120
ELI SUSSMAN: And as
you can see, it's

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.580
like there's no real clean way
to make latkes with your hands.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.160
So you got it?

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.951
KELLY DOBKIN: Yeah.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.570
ELI SUSSMAN: So when my dad
makes latkes at the house--

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.880
so they have just like
a normal home kitchen.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.380
Yeah.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.700
Give me about an
inch and a half.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.410
KELLY DOBKIN: OK.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.160
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.701
That's great.

00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:47.220
So you don't want
the lat-- I don't

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.710
like to totally submerge
the latkes when I took them

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.470
at home.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.960
So just a good rule
of thumb with anything

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.230
is like, if you're frying,
it's obviously super dangerous

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.130
to be frying at your house.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.010
So you want to be really
careful that you're paying

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.200
close attention to the oil.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.004
And also, my dad likes to
line the floor with newspaper

00:13:07.004 --> 00:13:08.420
because there's a
lot splattering,

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.961
and it gets super
slippery and stuff.

00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:11.940
And you want to
use a fish spatula,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.186
because when you're transferring
with all the oil and stuff,

00:13:15.186 --> 00:13:16.560
you don't want to
be spilling it.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.285
So don't use a regular
spatula or spoon or something.

00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:19.993
KELLY DOBKIN: OK.

00:13:19.993 --> 00:13:20.700
Cool.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.747
So while we're starting
to fry up over here,

00:13:22.747 --> 00:13:24.580
I'm going to get started
with Einat as well.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.417
So Einat.

00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:26.125
EINAT ADMONY: Hi.

00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:27.310
KELLY DOBKIN: Hi.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.100
Einat is the chef and owner
of Tain Balaboosta and Bar

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.710
Bolonat.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.950
So Einat, we're going to
do a little bit of a twist

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.670
on a traditional latke using a
bunch of different vegetables.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.720
Tell me a little
about your recipe.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.719
EINAT ADMONY: All right.

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:48.300
So basically this latke is
made out of potatoes, opah,

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.870
sweet potato, carrot, onion.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:57.550
And then I put some Granny Smith
apples inside, again, mostly

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.170
because I personally don't like
the apple sauce with latke.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.160
I never got the point of it.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.770
So I said, you know what?

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.750
This is going to go in.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.390
And it's actually
make it really nice.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.910
It gives some tiny
tanginess inside.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:17.460
Very similar to Eli,
we squeeze everything.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.189
The carrot don't have enough--

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:21.230
KELLY DOBKIN: --moisture.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.271
EINAT ADMONY: --moisture.

00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:27.050
So we don't need to do that,
but the potato and the onion.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.610
I also add thyme and
rosemary a little bit.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.930
And we're going
to serve it today

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.050
with preserved lemon
yogurt and micro-cilantro.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.934
KELLY DOBKIN: Wow.

00:14:38.934 --> 00:14:39.820
That sounds great.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.405
ELEANOR CARMELI: Huh?

00:14:40.405 --> 00:14:41.070
You got lost?

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.620
KELLY DOBKIN: It's not over yet.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.950
So chef, so you
grew up in Israel.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.490
And I'm always curious.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.900
Were latkes different there?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.441
Were they the same?

00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:52.690
EINAT ADMONY: To be honest,
I didn't grow up on latke.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.315
KELLY DOBKIN: OK.

00:14:53.315 --> 00:14:53.720
EINAT ADMONY: I know.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.970
KELLY DOBKIN: So for Hanukkah,
did you guys have them,

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.810
or not at all?

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.060
EINAT ADMONY: A different one.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.210
Latke is a very
Ashkenazi dish that I

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.740
used to eat at my
next door neighbor.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.590
My mom do different things.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.800
She do like mostly sweet stuff.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.990
Like we do sufganiyot
from scratch,

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.190
which is the Israeli
donuts, if you don't know.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.880
And she do other stuff.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.995
She do funnel cake.

00:15:17.995 --> 00:15:21.070
Latke, I started doing
when I came to New York

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.236
like 16 years ago,
and I love it.

00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:26.860
It's like [? rashty ?], which I
used to work a venue back then.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.985
And they have [? rashty ?].

00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:29.250
And I'm like ah.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.710
So it's very similar for me.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.060
KELLY DOBKIN: I've never
had a latke I don't like.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.076
EINAT ADMONY: Really?

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:39.950
KELLY DOBKIN: Well, I've
had some bad latkes.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.252
I know everyone else
probably has too.

00:15:42.252 --> 00:15:42.960
EINAT ADMONY: No.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.080
KELLY DOBKIN: But the
general idea of a latke I'm

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.663
on board with.

00:15:45.663 --> 00:15:49.060
EINAT ADMONY: The only
problem that-- the latke-- I

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.190
have a falafel show.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.040
I always upset when
people order to go.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.330
And they always do.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.817
But it's not as--

00:15:55.817 --> 00:15:57.025
KELLY DOBKIN: It's not meant.

00:15:57.025 --> 00:15:57.440
EINAT ADMONY: I'ts not.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.130
It's you have to
eat it the minute

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.390
it's come out of the fryer.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.350
Latke, the same thing.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.990
All the crispiness,
all the texture,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.280
it needs to be
eaten on the spot.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.072
KELLY DOBKIN: Yeah.

00:16:09.072 --> 00:16:10.696
So we're just getting
the burner going.

00:16:10.696 --> 00:16:12.450
We're mixing all of
the grated ingredients

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.200
together, once we
squeeze the water out.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.990
Does anyone have any questions
for Einat while we're here?

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:20.890
No?

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.806
EINAT ADMONY: Nothing?

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.870
All right.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.758
AUDIENCE: What goes
in your falafel?

00:16:26.758 --> 00:16:30.050
It's so good.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:35.270
EINAT ADMONY: Chick pea, onion,
garlic, cumin, coriander,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.410
black pepper, and salt.
Did that cover it all?

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.561
KELLY DOBKIN: There's got to be
a secret ingredient that you're

00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:39.650
not--

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.620
EINAT ADMONY: And there
is recipe in my cookbook.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.554
So yeah.

00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:44.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.959
KELLY DOBKIN: Einat was actually
on "Bobby Flay Throwdown,"

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:48.375
I don't know if
you guys saw that.

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:50.350
It was a couple of years
ago, making falafel.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.890
EINAT ADMONY: 10 years ago.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.180
KELLY DOBKIN: 10 years ago.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.462
Feels like yesterday.

00:16:53.462 --> 00:16:55.190
Yeah.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.850
EINAT ADMONY: Actually he won.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.829
But then he reversed
the judges--

00:16:59.829 --> 00:17:00.870
KELLY DOBKIN: --decision.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.760
EINAT ADMONY: Exactly He came
after the match and said,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.343
you know what?

00:17:03.343 --> 00:17:05.410
They don't know what
they're talking about,

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.780
which I totally agree.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.829
All right.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.950
ELEANOR CARMELI: Hey,
just wanted to announce.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.490
If anybody has any
questions, we're

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.579
going to finish up the cooking
demo in just a few minutes

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.870
and let all of you eat the
delicious things that you're

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:19.790
watching them make.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.736
And so if you have any
questions at this point--

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:25.819
FEMALE SPEAKER: Over here.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:26.750
ELEANOR CARMELI:
They are all fresh.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.329
I promise.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.700
If you have any questions,
just raise your hand

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.033
and I'll walk around with a mic.

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:31.273
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right there.

00:17:31.273 --> 00:17:33.638
AUDIENCE: Where can we
get a free [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:33.638 --> 00:17:35.489
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:36.280
KELLY DOBKIN: Guys?

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.150
EINAT ADMONY: Wow.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.900
Good question.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.230
ELI SUSSMAN: Free?

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.437
EINAT ADMONY: Yeah.

00:17:41.437 --> 00:17:43.270
ELEANOR CARMELI: Back
here, just one moment.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.269
KELLY DOBKIN: Maybe you'll
get one for Hanukkah.

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:46.250
You never know.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.710
ELI SUSSMAN: Talk to Google.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.910
Maybe they'll--

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.430
EINAT ADMONY: Exactly.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.000
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.110
Of each of the chefs, what
are your favorite condiments

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.720
for latkes?

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.260
Or, what do you consider
acceptable condiments

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:53.650
for latke?

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.858
EINAT ADMONY: Not applesauce.

00:17:57.207 --> 00:17:59.040
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah, I
honestly, I didn't like

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.490
apple sauce growing up either.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.280
And I don't really
like sour cream.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.060
I am the most sacrilegious.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.120
I like to eat them like
they're hash browns.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.364
I like to dip them in ketchup.

00:18:08.364 --> 00:18:09.280
EINAT ADMONY: Ketchup?

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.134
ELI SUSSMAN: Sorry.

00:18:10.134 --> 00:18:11.634
KELLY DOBKIN: Sounds
good, actually.

00:18:11.634 --> 00:18:13.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.529
ELI SUSSMAN: I'm
from the suburbs.

00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:16.320
I'm from the train.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.690
Like, they're basically
Jewish hashbrowns.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:24.100
So for when it comes to
actual true toppings,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.069
I'm not really a sweet guy ever.

00:18:26.069 --> 00:18:27.110
EINAT ADMONY: You're not?

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.330
ELI SUSSMAN: I
like savory stuff.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.200
EINAT ADMONY: You
look very sweet.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.605
ELI SUSSMAN: Oh, thank you.

00:18:29.605 --> 00:18:30.730
ELEANOR CARMELI: All right.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.410
We have a question over here.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.780
AUDIENCE: Neither one of you
mentioned what kind of oil

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.924
you like to use and what kind
of oil you don't like to use.

00:18:37.924 --> 00:18:39.090
EINAT ADMONY: Not olive oil.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.090
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.710
EINAT ADMONY: Not blend oil.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.250
Canola will be the best for me.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.000
ELI SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.950
Same.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.742
KELLY DOBKIN: So in
the frying process,

00:18:49.742 --> 00:18:51.200
I've never really
figured this out.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.310
How do you know when
a latke is done?

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.227
Just by looking at it?

00:18:54.227 --> 00:18:56.226
ELI SUSSMAN: Well, the
great thing about a latke

00:18:56.226 --> 00:18:57.830
is there's a lot of
margin for error,

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.914
because it's fried potato.

00:18:58.914 --> 00:19:01.454
And pretty much, it's going to
be good no matter what as long

00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:02.400
as you put salt on it.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.120
So I'm looking for
a deep golden brown.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.490
So you could say the
thinnest that I made them,

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.610
it's like maybe three
minutes each side

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.410
depending on how
hot your oil is.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.330
But I'll just hold
one up right now.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.200
So you guys can see.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.530
KELLY DOBKIN: That
looked very pretty.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.030
ELI SUSSMAN: So that's
what I'm looking

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.680
for in terms of brownness.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.950
And then I'm just going
to do the other side

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:21.890
to the same level.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.116
And then I'm going
to put salt on them.

00:19:24.116 --> 00:19:25.990
ELEANOR CARMELI: We're
going to take two more

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.156
questions from the audience.

00:19:27.156 --> 00:19:29.600
And then we'll ask our chefs
to stand by their latkes

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.950
and start serving.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.340
So one more question over here.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.310
ELI SUSSMAN: The latkes
are all the way over there.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.520
AUDIENCE: Do your recipes
change from year to year,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.350
or are they constant over time?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.870
ELI SUSSMAN: Do
the recipes change?

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.328
AUDIENCE: Change
from year to year,

00:19:40.328 --> 00:19:41.640
or do you use the same one?

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.997
ELI SUSSMAN: The latke
recipe hasn't really changed.

00:19:45.997 --> 00:19:46.496
Yeah.

00:19:52.712 --> 00:19:53.951
KELLY DOBKIN: Right.

00:19:53.951 --> 00:19:54.450
OK.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.836
And we have our final
audience question over here.

00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:00.460
AUDIENCE: Hey, I was
actually wondering

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.010
who won when you went
up against Bobby Flay.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.330
EINAT ADMONY: Where was that?

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.840
Hi.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.340
Yeah.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.600
What's the question?

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.160
AUDIENCE: When you were on
"Throwndown with Bobby Flay,"

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.434
who won the competition?

00:20:14.434 --> 00:20:15.600
EINAT ADMONY: So I just say.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.380
Somebody asked that.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:16.610
AUDIENCE: Oops.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.318
Sorry about that.

00:20:17.318 --> 00:20:19.170
EINAT ADMONY: But
Bobby Flay won.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:24.800
But-- it was a very
upsetting moment.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.300
No.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.010
We changed it.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.080
AUDIENCE: He cheated.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.450
EINAT ADMONY: No.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:27.620
No.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:27.635
No.

00:20:27.635 --> 00:20:28.134
No.

00:20:28.134 --> 00:20:30.440
His falafel wasn't as good.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.230
But the judges wasn't
as good as well.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.640
They really didn't know anything
about middle eastern food.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.020
They said that my
food was SoHo-chic

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.240
and his looking
like traditional,

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.670
which was very funny.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.870
But months after,
Bobby Flay came

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.260
to Taim, the small Taim in the
Village, with all his crew.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.960
And he changed the
decision of the judges.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.960
So that was a really nice
and genuine thing to do.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.920
AUDIENCE: So you won.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.935
EINAT ADMONY: Huh

00:21:00.935 --> 00:21:01.810
ELI SUSSMAN: She won.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.820
EINAT ADMONY:
Everybody thinks I won.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.690
But it's not true.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.950
And I'm an honest person.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:05.450
No.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.300
I didn't.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.986
AUDIENCE: Well,
she's here today.

00:21:07.986 --> 00:21:08.860
And Bobby Flay's not.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.096
So thank you.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.620
ELI SUSSMAN: My latkes are done.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:14.940
ELEANOR CARMELI: All right.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.562
All right.

00:21:15.562 --> 00:21:16.270
KELLY DOBKIN: OK.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.440
Do we want any final
comments from the chefs,

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.900
anymore advice for the audience,
thoughts for the holiday,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.450
dos and don'ts in
your kitchen at home?

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.600
ELI SUSSMAN: Dos and don'ts
for the entire kitchen?

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.250
No.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.330
I hope everyone has a
really nice Hanukkah.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.360
I hope you enjoy the latkes.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.521
The latkes that you're
having are just like these,

00:21:34.521 --> 00:21:36.520
but obviously, they were
fried a little bit ago.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.330
So you won't be getting the
exact same fresh out-of-the-oil

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:40.896
crispiness.

00:21:40.896 --> 00:21:42.270
But I really hope
you enjoy them.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.370
And we're over here.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.395
And she's over there.

00:21:45.395 --> 00:21:46.265
So please come.

00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:48.120
And we'd love to start
feeding you guys now.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.870
KELLY DOBKIN: Yes.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.991
And once you guys
taste the latkes,

00:21:50.991 --> 00:21:52.490
there's going to
be a voting system.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.640
Eleanor's going to explain.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.680
But it's pretty simple.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.541
It just goes on back there.

00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:57.040
Yeah.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.450
So we're going to get
the latkes rolling out.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:58.930
Thanks, guys.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:21:59.320
Thank you so much--

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.778
ELEANOR CARMELI:
Round of applause.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:02.730
[APPLAUSE]
