00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:08.380
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Thank
you so much for joining us,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.890
Luke as we were
getting introduced,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.470
we'll definitely talk a
bunch about Lee Hood based

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.940
on the work that you guys--

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.570
that you put together.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.490
But I really wanted to
start by talking about you.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.820
And I was just asking you a
moment ago, how often it is--

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
I've seen any number of times
you've moderated an interview,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.750
or moderated group of
panelists, but how often are you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.222
on this end of the interview?

00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:37.680
LUKE TIMMERMAN:
Well increasingly I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.060
am on the receiving
end of these.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.360
I'm speaking on Public Radio
from time to time, at panels,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.780
sometimes people want to know
at industry events, what's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.960
hot an interesting
for the journalists.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.460
So--

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.990
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Interesting.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.800
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Now and then.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.210
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Perfect.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.850
Well great.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.510
I have a whole bunch of
awkward questions here for you.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.050
So let's get started
with a couple good ones.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.300
Maybe just so folks know a
little bit more about you,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.440
can you tell us a little
bit about your background?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.930
How you made the path from--

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.060
I think you grew up in
Wisconsin if I remember,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.580
all the way to being
a biotech journalist,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.316
and doing amazing
work you're doing now?

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:17.440
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah, sure.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.270
So I studied journalism at
the University of Wisconsin.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.970
Wasn't sure what I
would specialize in

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.870
or even if I would specialize.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.400
That wasn't really a thing of
the 90s when I was coming up.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.580
But I ended up getting a
job at the Seattle Times

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.440
as a general business reporter.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.060
And about a year
into that stint,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.670
I had shown some
ability to explain

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.930
jargony, boring kind of
subjects to the editors

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.162
in plain English.

00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:48.620
I could bring those
things to life.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.750
And at the time,
the newspaper still

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.340
had a biotechnology beat
and a dedicated reporter

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.400
on the business staff.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.680
And I-- there were two openings.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.740
It's interesting, at
the time I was about

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.145
ready to get promoted,
and one was for biotech,

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:05.645
and one was for retail.

00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:07.020
So I could have
covered Starbucks

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.620
and Costco and Amazon,
and my whole path

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.870
would have been different.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.350
But I looked at biotech and
I thought, there's science,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.860
there's human health,
there's business,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.720
there are ethical
issues, there are

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.880
all these interesting
characters,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.800
like charismatic entrepreneurs,
it all changes really fast,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.970
there's no one dominant company.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.319
So in Seattle at the
time, on business desk,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.860
if you wanted to
get ahead, you would

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.660
cover Boeing or Microsoft.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.967
One of the big companies.

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:39.967
But I kind of looked at
some of the stories that

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:41.508
were coming out of
there and thought,

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:43.440
oh gee, another jet
order for Singapore,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.310
or the latest
version of Windows.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.280
I thought biotech had rich
ingredients for storytelling.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.130
And so I kind of dived in.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.710
That would have been 2001.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.390
It was just in the wake of
the Human Genome Project.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.540
And I thought, this is
getting interesting.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.135
I can imagine doing this a long
time and not getting bored.

00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:06.510
KRISHNA YESHWANT: We'll come
back to Seattle in a moment,

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.280
because I'd love to hear kind of
what you've seen in the Seattle

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.250
and Northwest geography,
because there's obviously

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.210
been a lot of change there.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.260
But you then ended
up at Xconomy,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.950
and then more recently you've
started the Timmerman Report.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.970
You've done the book.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.290
You've done-- there's a
podcast that you've started.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.510
You had a brief bit
where you're doing

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.480
some stuff with STAT News.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.070
So just can you give us a
sense of how you ended up

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.430
at Xconomy and then really kind
of your own entrepreneurial

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.382
journey from going from a
larger publication to going

00:03:42.382 --> 00:03:43.590
off and doing your own thing?

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.940
How did you decide to do that?

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.340
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah, well,
this being Google I mean,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.700
you understand the
disruption that's

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.370
occurred in the media business.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.130
And so I was coming up
at a traditional media

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.400
company, The Seattle
Times, and realized

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.120
that there wasn't much of
a web strategy in about

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.410
the mid 2000s.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.840
They were still very much
wedded to traditional print

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.980
advertising.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.730
And there were all kinds of
painful cuts and things going

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.270
on.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.240
So I thought, I don't think
this is for me long term.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.790
I was beginning to really
sink my teeth into biotech

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.110
and specialize.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.620
I had done a fellowship at
MIT for science journalists

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.820
for about a year.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.060
And that was sort of the
moment where it was--

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.590
it dawned on me that
I could do this.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.120
I might need to figure out the
right structure online to do

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.750
that, an Xconomy was that.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.210
I joined a startup, 2008,
and it was really focused

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.670
on all things innovative.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.720
So the two guy and a dog start
up all the way up through

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.640
the more interesting
projects , that, say,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.490
a big company might be
working on Alzheimer's.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.350
And it was a great window
into the world of biotech.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.481
I didn't have to worry about
the daily stock fluctuations

00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:04.980
so much.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.860
I could focus the science
and how it was being applied.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.380
And so I developed a following
as social media came on board.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.550
It became clear that I
had sort of what you might

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.500
call a high affinity audience.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.350
I wasn't going to reach the
largest number of people

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.210
in the world with writing
about genomics or cancer

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.500
immunotherapy.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.810
But there was a
small core of people

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.960
who were very intently
interested in my subject

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.830
material.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.480
So that-- by the time
I was about to move on

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.950
from Xconomy, 2014, I
was thinking that yes, I

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.010
could potentially hang
out my own shingle

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.920
as an independent media
entrepreneur focused

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.010
on my biotech niche
and then I could

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.180
layer in some of these
other things, like podcasts.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.550
Eventually, when I finally
got my book published,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.110
I could get that kind of in
the portfolio as different ways

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.609
to reach people in the
information comments.

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:09.900
KRISHNA YESHWANT: That's great.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.220
So you started with the website
and then in the background

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.424
were building the book--
or writing the book.

00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:16.340
Is that how it worked?

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.981
Or how did you
actually start that?

00:06:17.981 --> 00:06:19.730
LUKE TIMMERMAN: I
started the Hood project

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.860
while I was still at Xconomy.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.000
But I like a lot of
authors, I got to this point

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
where I realized I've
done all these interviews,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.880
I've got all these documents,
it's a mountain of material.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.710
I've got all my daily deadlines.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.780
When am I actually going
to write this thing?

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.690
So I actually had to swallow
hard and say, you know what?

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.160
I think I need to leave
my job if I'm actually

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.930
going to write this book.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.860
Basically give myself a leave
of absence, which was almost

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.000
a year to actually write the
book, finish it, get it edited,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.679
and then I started
the Timmerman Report.

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.470
KRISHNA YESHWANT: I
see, so it was actually

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.805
the book that prompted
you to take the next step.

00:06:57.805 --> 00:06:58.680
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.530
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
Great, OK, that's

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.970
real interesting, different
than what I thought.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.900
So let's turn our
attention to the book.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.420
So as I read through it, one
thing that was striking--

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.720
and as you know I actually
listened to it on audiobook,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.580
so I'm going ask you some
questions on that as well.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.720
But how did you come to
the idea of writing a book

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.430
to begin with?

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.290
Is that just the dream
of every journalist?

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.970
Or is it-- because I can't say
that many of the folks that we

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.200
interact with have actually
written such a long form

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.970
piece of writing.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.770
And how did you
come to choose Lee,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.800
and how did the initial
interaction with Lee go?

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.200
Because I can imagine it
being easy or challenging,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.630
because he's such a
unique figure in this.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.850
How did it start?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.380
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah,
so I was starting

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.740
to get the urge to write a book
in the last couple of years

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.330
of Xconomy.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.050
I had some experience writing
magazine type profiles

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.770
of people.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.310
I thought-- I enjoyed getting
to know people and their life

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.670
story as a way of shining
light on the history of how

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.030
technologies develop, really.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:07.400
And along in 2011 comes
the Steve Jobs book

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.746
by Walter Isaacson.

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:10.370
And I read this and
I thought, now this

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.300
is a great example of what you
might call a living biography,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.940
because he was able to do a
whole series of interviews

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.580
with Jobs for the last couple of
years when he was still alive.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.840
And so you could get
a lot of rich detail

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.760
that you could never
get just from reading

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.350
the documentary record.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.780
You supplement the record
with the interviews.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.900
And so this is a
big bestseller, too.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.480
So it was kind of inspiring.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.299
And I looked around and
thought, OK, I'm in biotech.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.799
Who do I know who has had
some kind of catalytic effect

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.780
on this industry?

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.970
And maybe not as
many aspects of tech

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.360
that Jobs did, but
immediately thought of Hood.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.050
Now as you remember, I got
started at the Seattle Times

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.250
and based there.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.610
And Hood had--

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.530
I got to know him very early
on as a newspaper reporter.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.240
So I had a reporter source
relationship with him.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.940
I covered his Institute
for Systems Biology, which

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.070
was sort of his next big idea in
the wake of the Genome Project,

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.890
and various startup companies
he had been involved in.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.730
And I knew that there was this
tremendous force of personality

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.580
and that he had a
signature achievement

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.190
that I can explain to
anybody on the street,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.810
and that was that
he led the team that

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.960
developed the first
automated DNA sequencer.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.380
So this was a tool that
revolutionized biology,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.720
we could say, with the
benefit of hindsight.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.710
And it was akin
to the development

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.380
of the better, faster,
cheaper semiconductors

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.420
that Intel developed.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.430
Gordon Moore and Bob
Noyce had that kind

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.110
of catalytic and enabling
effect on technology.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.994
So I thought Hood
was a great subject.

00:09:52.994 --> 00:09:54.160
KRISHNA YESHWANT: When you--

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.040
say you'd known him from
your time on the reporting

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.870
side of it.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.880
How did you broach
that subject with him?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.755
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:06.250
Because so those
of you who've read

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.370
the Isaacson book know
that it pulls no punches.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.190
There's the good Steve and the
not so good Steve in there.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.890
And as an independent
journalist, that's

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.930
the kind of book I want write.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.490
That's what I'll
spend my time on.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.824
So I propose something
like this to Lee.

00:10:20.824 --> 00:10:22.240
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
Did you tell him

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.550
there's going to be a good Lee
and a bad Lee in this book?

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.925
LUKE TIMMERMAN:
I told him that I

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:29.260
would talk to your friends
and your enemies, your family.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.600
I want to tell the good,
the bad, and the ugly.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.250
I don't know exactly what I'm
going to find at the outset,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.580
but basically you need to
put your confidence in me

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.020
that I'm going to
be fair to you,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.060
that I'm going to do my
best to get it right.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.140
We aren't always going
to see eye to eye.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.790
And it turned out
that at the time

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.460
he had been thinking about
writing his own memoir.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.320
And it was kind of
a difficult thing,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.480
like was he going to
hire somebody to do it?

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.270
And he didn't really have time.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.860
And he sort of looked
and thought, OK,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.360
if you do this independent,
number one, more

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.370
people are likely to
read it, because it

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.650
won't be sort of
the world according

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.620
to Lee, a whitewashed version.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.870
And number two, I mean,
I think he had confidence

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.180
in me that I knew the science
and could put it in context.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.430
So he agreed.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.430
Let the chips fall.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.430
I'll agree to all the
interviews you want to do.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.970
I'll open up my papers.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.260
So he was really good
at being cooperative.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.160
KRISHNA YESHWANT: So often
you hear about biographies

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.905
in that format--

00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:33.280
and I think that was even the
case with Isaacson and Jobs

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.760
where there was kind of a
tension or debate in it,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.891
but it sounds like he
was overall open to it

00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:40.390
and actually relieved
that he didn't

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.730
have to write the book himself.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.021
LUKE TIMMERMAN: There was that.

00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:45.280
I mean, but certainly
there were tensions.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.980
Especially getting
closer to the end,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.710
when you're fact checking
some parts of the story

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.890
that don't jibe with
his version of events.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.444
And--

00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:57.610
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Can you
give us a couple examples?

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.817
LUKE TIMMERMAN:
Well, so it might

00:11:59.817 --> 00:12:01.650
be hard for those who
haven't read the book.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.700
But there's a passage
in here in which

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.690
I report on how he was ousted
as the Chairman of Biology

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.740
at Caltech.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.170
And that was not
reported at the time.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.610
So when Hood left
Caltech in 1991,

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.970
he was recruited by Bill
Gates to the University

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.110
of Washington.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.830
And this was sort of like
the dawn of technology

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.850
driven biology, biology
becoming more data driven, more

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.590
of an information science.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.770
He and Gates shared this vision.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.920
And it was a big story when this
great scientist from Caltech

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.090
came to Seattle.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.780
It was in the Wall
Street Journal.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.430
And none of the
underlying tensions

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.000
of what really led to his
departure from Caltech

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.930
were reported.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.450
Now, as a biographer
looking at these things

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.610
in the documentary record
and interviewing people

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.049
20 years later,
you can dig deeper

00:12:54.049 --> 00:12:55.340
and get into more of the story.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.530
And that was
embarrassing and hurtful

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.960
and there were times during
the fact checking process

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.450
when Lee would
try to revert back

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.960
to the so-called-- the
cover story that Caltech

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.690
was telling that enabled him
to save face at the time.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.000
So we had some tensions.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.902
We had some battles
over those things.

00:13:14.902 --> 00:13:16.360
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
One of the things

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.150
I took away as I was reading
through the book is that there

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.640
is this element to Lee that
I think is similar to some

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.840
of the other great
innovators of our time,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.380
whether you think of
Steve Jobs you know

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.480
or an Eric Lander, kind of
the variety of other folks

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.930
that we all kind
of see in the media

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.720
or in our companies and
whatnot, where there's a bigger

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.220
than life sort of quality.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.410
There's a-- this is the
grand vision of what we're

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.020
going to do, even
though it may not

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.580
be clear how we're going
to do it at the outset.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.530
As you spent time with Lee
and wrote the book and thought

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.030
through--

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.155
that came through in the
book, that there's clearly

00:13:54.155 --> 00:13:56.602
that part to his persona.

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.060
Did you find that
that was balanced

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.934
by some other part where
it's like, you know,

00:13:59.934 --> 00:14:03.010
he also did produce the
first automated sequencer.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.930
That's a technical achievement.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.210
You know how much
of-- to the extent

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.780
that achieving great things
takes breaking through barriers

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.840
and looking at the
world in different ways,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.860
in somebody like Lee, how much
of him is grander than grand,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.260
and how much of
it is, look we've

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.426
got to make this stuff work.

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:23.956
Is it 50/50, or just as
you dug into his persona,

00:14:23.956 --> 00:14:25.080
how much of it did you see?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.902
Or maybe there's a
different framing to it,

00:14:26.902 --> 00:14:28.360
especially as you've
talked to some

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.180
of these other entrepreneurs
who have those parts

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.812
to their personas as well.

00:14:32.812 --> 00:14:34.270
LUKE TIMMERMAN:
It's a great point.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.090
There really are so
common personality traits

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.140
that you see in the people
that really shake up a field,

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.950
and lead us to a new path.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:50.380
And it really is this single
minded intensity that--

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.870
so first it is the vision.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.750
And he is a biologist,
first and foremost.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.130
This is where he came
from, his training,

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.920
and he really wanted to answer
big questions about biology

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.920
that you could not answer.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.140
Things like, how
is it that we are

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.950
able to mount an infinite
number of antibodies

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.720
in our immune
system to protect us

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.870
from all these pathogens in
the environment-- the viruses,

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.000
the bacteria-- when
we only have-- we

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.480
don't have a gene for
every single one of those.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.860
Does that happen?

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.900
They didn't have
the tools for that.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.320
So he wanted the
answer, really bad.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.610
And he was dedicated to using--

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:38.940
developing technology to run
bigger, broader experiments

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.380
to gather the kinds of data
that you would need to answer

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.750
a question of that magnitude.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.800
And he just-- once he
developed the vision,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.470
he just had this single
minded intensity.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.740
And you can even see on the
cover photo of the book,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.510
that photo captures it.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.860
It's like this guy
is in the zone.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:08.280
He's like Tiger Woods lining up
for a putt, or Lance Armstrong

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.220
in the Tour de France.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.050
There's a focus, a purpose,
and nobody's rules,

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.970
nobody's bureaucracy,
nobody's sensitivities

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.700
are going to get in
the way of that goal.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.680
That's who he was.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.270
And so it was both his
great strength and at times

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.387
a weakness.

00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:32.970
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
Yeah, I feel like we

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.300
see so often that those two
things both change the world,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.920
but also can be painful
for the people around them.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.780
That must have come
out as you were talking

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.363
to the people
surrounding Lee as well,

00:16:44.363 --> 00:16:46.690
just kind of the
inspiration that they draw,

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.410
and perhaps some of the
challenges of working

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.180
in the environment
that's created in that.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.810
LUKE TIMMERMAN: That's right.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.760
Yeah.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.070
He threw off a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.100
Roger Perlmutter, who is now
the president of Merck research

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.940
labs, had this great quote.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.220
And he said that,
Lee is like the sun.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.369
That throws off all of this
heat and energy, and he draws--

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.619
he's got this great
gravitational pull,

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:14.030
he draws people into his
orbit, they're stimulated,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.260
they do a lot of their best
work, graduate students

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:23.950
and post-docs, but it can be a
little overpowering at times,

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.609
and suffocating in some cases.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.570
KRISHNA YESHWANT: You invoked
the context of Gordon Moore

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.560
and Intel and the
amazing work that

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.500
was done to develop
infrastructure,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.940
these fundamental tools that--

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.590
components that raised
the whole field.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:49.020
And I think that that
analogy runs true to the work

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.640
that Hood did.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:57.840
As you think through the way
that the various instruments

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.210
that Hood developed
unlocked biology,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:06.690
do you feel like we're seeing
the full vision of what Lee had

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.376
envisioned all the
way back then today,

00:18:08.376 --> 00:18:09.750
or do you still
feel like there's

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.340
a lot more to be unlocked?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.840
Clearly we're seeing sequencing,
and all that sort of stuff,

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.673
but there are other
components of the vision

00:18:15.673 --> 00:18:19.037
that you heard from him that
we're still waiting to see?

00:18:19.037 --> 00:18:20.370
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Absolutely, yes.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.229
We're still in the early days.

00:18:22.229 --> 00:18:24.270
And just for a little bit
of historical context--

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.353
I mean, you know this since
you've read the book--

00:18:26.353 --> 00:18:28.920
but when Hood was
really emerging

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.900
on the faculty at Caltech in
the 70s, the first manual DNA

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.520
sequencing techniques
were being developed.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.440
And these were slow,
tedious processes.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.620
A graduate student would spend
his or her entire graduate

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.740
school career and get a
PhD based on determining

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.330
the sequence of just one gene.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.290
So five years-- you
determine the sequence

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.930
for making something
like insulin.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.780
Now today, you can
scrape up a skin cell

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.580
and sequenced the
entire genome--

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.720
the entire three billion
bases that are you and me--

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.670
in seconds.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.010
Well, an entire
genome in, say, a day.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.950
But that gene would
happen in a split second.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:18.270
So he envisioned automation
coming to biology

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:23.640
at a time when the tools were
very rudimentary and manual.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.670
And furthermore, there was
a technophobic attitude

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.470
within biology.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.190
People in biology saw themselves
as kind of like high priests,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.740
and we don't really
do the sort of thing

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.020
that-- we don't make
widgets or tools.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.940
That's the work of industry.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:45.370
And so Hood came in and
said, no, we need to do both.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.600
We need to develop
better tools to ask

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.640
bigger and deeper questions.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.920
We need to gather
new kinds of data

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.970
and turn it into a bigger
kind of information science.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:02.520
And he saw not just DNA
sequencing but other layers

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.920
of information being crucially
important to thoroughly

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.030
understanding the
whole organism.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.070
So he developed what they
called a microchemical facility

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.840
at Caltech, where they
sequenced proteins,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.920
they synthesized
proteins, sequenced DNA,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.330
and synthesized DNA.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.510
Four instruments
working in harmony

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:31.980
that would read and write in the
language of life, so to speak.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.220
And by looking at the different
layers of information,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.100
you could see how things
go awry and become

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:46.870
diseased in a much more granular
fashion than you could before.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.620
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
Certainly sitting inside

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.630
of Google, those four
components, you see--

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.760
some of which have totally
transformed the industry,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.630
it feels like there's still
more to come in it, certainly

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.730
from a Google perspective, the
role that the amount of data

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.930
that's produced from
that set of instruments

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.540
is clearly profound and
would suggest that there's

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.630
other infrastructure or other
tool sets that need to be built

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.910
to manage it and help
get to that underlying

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.660
ability or that ultimate
goal of reading and writing

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.580
in the language of biology.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.700
How much of that part of it have
you seen Lee Hodd kind of focus

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.460
on, having done all the
instruments, thinking about,

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.820
OK, there's all this data that's
coming off these instruments--

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.640
I think you referenced a couple
of things that he was doing--

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.240
but where did that
that research take you

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.720
as you were thinking
through, now

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.450
that these instruments exist
or parts of them exist,

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.650
what's next?

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.410
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Well it's a
great question, because you

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.080
can argue that we
haven't yet reaped

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.990
the dividends of the Human
Genome Project, and genomics,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.410
or information rich biology,
whatever you'd like to call it.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.170
I think we're still very
much in the early days.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:04.010
We're learning that
biology is even--

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.290
as you peel back more and
more layers of the onion,

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.410
it gets more and
more complicated.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.790
So the gene sequence
as you know,

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.160
it's not absolutely
deterministic.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.590
Just because you have
a genetic abnormality,

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.870
doesn't necessarily
lead directly

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.550
to the path of disease.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:24.890
There are other points at
which proteins, cells, you

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.810
need to get a more full picture.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.490
And we're not there yet.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.760
And so there are efforts--

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.100
in fact, Google's
baseline project is one--

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:40.250
to try to better integrate these
multiple layers of information

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.310
from genes to proteins
cells, but also

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.190
your observable phenotype
that's in your electronic health

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.014
records.

00:22:47.014 --> 00:22:49.430
And we have some challenges
with electronic health records

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.650
in this country and
interoperability,

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.340
getting different data sets to
line up and talk to each other.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.842
So that's going to take
years to work through.

00:22:59.842 --> 00:23:01.550
KRISHNA YESHWANT: I
remember in the book,

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:07.940
you described Arivale which is
a company that Hood had just,

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.610
I think, got launched
maybe just as the book was

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.110
coming to press.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.980
Any news about that?

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.510
Anything that you've heard--

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.176
because it seemed
like that was starting

00:23:16.176 --> 00:23:18.927
to get to some of these
questions around phenotype

00:23:18.927 --> 00:23:20.510
and how to tie all
this stuff together

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.924
with the genetic underpinnings?

00:23:21.924 --> 00:23:23.840
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah,
so for those unfamiliar,

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.700
Arivale is a company--

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.712
another startup company that
Hood has gotten involved with.

00:23:28.712 --> 00:23:30.170
And it's trying to
bring about what

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.820
he calls scientific wellness.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.210
So this is a big data
approach to your health.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.460
So they start with people
having their genome--

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.774
their full genome--
sequenced, but once.

00:23:43.774 --> 00:23:44.940
Because that's all you need.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.010
That's a static
set of information.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.250
But then periodically,
say, once a quarter,

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.750
you'll get you'll give
a blood sample or spit,

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.600
and that will be analyzed
for the metabolites.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.480
So not all-- what are the key
metabolites that are showing up

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.060
in greater concentration
or another in your blood

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.270
that might be sending
something awry?

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.590
A signal of disease, perhaps.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.560
They also sequence
your microbile.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.990
We're learning a lot
because of the tool

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.780
that enables us to
sequence all the microbes

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.610
in, say, a stool sample.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.280
You can get a sense of
one's health-- a snapshot.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.810
It's constantly changing,
because the composition

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.260
of your microbes is influenced
by your environment.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:37.580
So by gathering what he calls
a dense dynamic data cloud--

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.150
so it starts with your genome,
the metabolome, the proteins,

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:45.620
the proteome, the microbiome,
all these omic levels

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.120
of information get combined.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.190
And hopefully by
gathering all of this

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.900
they can see, say, a sign of--

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.850
an early warning
sign of disease.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.270
So do you have something that
kind of looks like it might be

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:07.570
pre-diabetes heading on the
road toward a more classic

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.320
measurement of disease, like
your hemoglobin A1C being too

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:11.860
high--

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.560
you're unable to control
your blood sugar.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.480
Can we see it?

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.160
By gathering all of
this information,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.770
there's going to
be a lot of noise.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.570
Can we find that signal?

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:27.880
Can we apply computers
to identify disease

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.790
at a point at which we can
intervene and potentially

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.320
correct before it's too late.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.840
And so they've layered in what
they call a wellness coach.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.540
So someone who works with--

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.790
a computational a
biologist looks at the data

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.480
and says, I think there
might be a signal here,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.890
tells that to a coach,
who is not exactly--

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.290
sort of like a nurse
practitioner, who says,

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.470
Krishna, I'm seeing
something kind

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.330
of worrisome with
your blood sugar.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.610
You know you might want to lay
off the ice cream before bed.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.210
And if so, can we--

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.580
when we check a
quarter after, can we

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:11.564
see that that molecular
perturbation has disappeared

00:26:11.564 --> 00:26:12.980
and you no longer
look like you're

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.130
on the path to pre-diabetes?

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.710
Now, this is really
pretty exciting stuff.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.780
But it's not
exactly being done--

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.140
it's not done in the
traditional context

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.670
of randomized controlled trials
that are the way at which we

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.300
try to control for all
the variables that might

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.180
be influencing our health.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.660
So there's plenty of
skeptics out there

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.420
who say, this is
kind of interesting,

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.590
but it's not giving
us definitive proof

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.750
that what you're doing
is really working.

00:26:46.524 --> 00:26:48.190
KRISHNA YESHWANT: I
did want to get back

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.580
a little bit to the Seattle
and kind of the various sorts

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.292
of geographies you see.

00:26:53.292 --> 00:26:55.000
I'll turn to the
audience in a little bit

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
and ask a couple of questions,
so queue some thoughts up here

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.440
in a moment.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.420
But on your web
site, you mentioned

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.570
that you've been through two
busts and 1 and 1/2 booms,

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.099
I think, in the biotech sector.

00:27:07.099 --> 00:27:08.890
And I would assume that
we're kind of still

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.280
in the middle of a boom,
from your perspective.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.810
So maybe-- I'd be curious to
hear your perspective on where

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.147
we are in a cycle here, having
lived through a few yourself?

00:27:17.147 --> 00:27:18.480
But I'd also be really curious--

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.490
I know you mentioned there
was a world when you started

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.010
your career where
Microsoft and Boeing were

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.270
the big industries in Seattle.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.354
Where Were things
today in Seattle?

00:27:29.354 --> 00:27:31.270
And how are you seeing
the various geographies

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.478
that you spend time in--
the big ones that I think of

00:27:33.478 --> 00:27:37.330
are of course Seattle, the
Bay Area, San Diego, New

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.244
York, Boston, do you
spend time in all

00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:41.410
these different geographies
and what are you seeing?

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.710
Since you kind of,
perhaps more than most,

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.560
have a spectrum of insight
across what various companies

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.805
are up to in academics?

00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:49.930
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.390
So first question,
about the boom,

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.920
yeah, I mean, we reached a peak
there in the summer of 2015,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.210
where there was kind of a
record number of FDA approvals,

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.370
there was a record amount
of venture funding.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:07.810
The stock markets
were all riding high.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.080
And then came Martin
Shkreli, and some drug

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.240
pricing controversies,
which scared

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.430
some investors-- thought, maybe
the presidential election will

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.790
go some direction that might
clamp down on drug prices.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:25.000
So it fell down for a while.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.160
Now, in the last--

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.650
this year, things have
rebounded to some extent.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.930
And we're now back
on a track again

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.410
toward pretty close to a
record number of FDA approvals.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.880
There are some
very exciting drugs

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.370
which you know of, so I'm pretty
optimistic that things are--

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.820
exciting things are
happening with regularity.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.890
A lot of it here
in the Boston area.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.920
Now, to the geography question.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.700
I mean, Seattle has been
utterly changed in the 16 years

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.290
that I've been there,
the biggest one

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.810
being the emergence of Amazon.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.020
They now have about
40,000 employees

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.000
in the city of Seattle
and they plop them

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.220
all just north of downtown.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.280
So there's a tremendous
amount of bars and restaurants

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.990
you know condos and street
activity that that wasn't there

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.230
in kind of a previously
rundown part of town.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.760
It's brought a lot of growth.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.440
A lot of good economic growth,
but also some growing pains--

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.350
traffic and housing prices.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:30.970
A familiar story to
many tech clusters.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.190
But as for biotech, I mean--

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.310
I remain based in
Seattle, and there's

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.830
a terrific base of research
there at the Fred Hutchinson

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.800
Cancer Research Center and
the University of Washington

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.320
and a few other
nonprofits-- the Gates

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.800
Foundation is there
and leading the charge

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.750
on infectious disease.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:54.860
But I get to Boston, and
San Francisco the most,

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.140
because these are the
top two biotech clusters.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.840
So I'm meeting with companies
and scientists and investors

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.480
in those two places quite a bit.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.920
San Diego as well, New
York once in a while.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.200
The way biotech has
grown as an industry,

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.930
it does tend to
concentrate by geography

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:22.980
around great academic research
centers, great hospitals,

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.300
and then the money and the
entrepreneurs, and then

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.910
all the service providers,
all of the consultants,

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:32.320
the law firms, the regulatory
affairs specialists,

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.860
everything that you need kind
of needs to be in one place.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.442
So that's the way
it has evolved.

00:30:39.442 --> 00:30:41.650
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Let me
see if there's any questions

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.608
from the audience here.

00:30:42.608 --> 00:30:44.924
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you've looking at the new

00:30:44.924 --> 00:30:46.967
t-cell therapies
that are coming out--

00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:48.800
I'd heard one of them
got approved recently.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.530
I don't know if you've
followed any of that.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.070
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yes.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.570
Yes.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.690
So for those unfamiliar,
Novartis won FDA approval

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.640
just a couple of weeks ago for
the first CAR-T immunotherapy,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.870
and this is a therapy in
which a patient with cancer,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.380
blood cancer, has white
blood cells withdrawn.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.060
They go off to a company lab.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.310
They use some gene
therapy to reprogram

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:16.930
the receptors to recognize the
specific marker on cancer cells

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.080
and then they
reinfuse those t-cells

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.770
to go in and kill the cancer.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.360
And they have seen
extraordinary results

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.960
in small groups of patients
with blood cancers.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.190
Something like 80%
complete remission rates

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:36.620
in kids with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.280
So this is a very
exciting development.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.500
I mean, we just don't see
80% complete response rates

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.000
in serious cancers with
traditional small molecule

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.580
or targeted antibody therapies.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.850
So and furthermore,
we're starting

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.520
to gather a long
term follow up data.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.000
You need to say, yes
this is actually lasting.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.430
So very exciting moment.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.087
And there are lots of--

00:32:06.087 --> 00:32:07.420
there's been an incredible boom.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.461
This is part of the story
of the last five years,

00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:14.200
is that immunotherapy has really
come to the fore in cancer.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.420
This is no longer like
a fringe science idea.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.670
It's the main stage of cancer.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.360
Every company that's in
cancer, every cancer center,

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.420
is focused on how
can we redirect

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.902
that power of the immune system
to go after the cancer cells.

00:32:32.902 --> 00:32:34.360
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
You actually have

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.460
a feature on your web site,
Timmerman Report, if I recall,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.800
that was a review of every
company in the immuno space

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.100
done alphabetically.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.160
And it was like, it was
pages and pages of companies,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.060
and I was like, this is amazing.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.310
How did you put that together?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.710
That seemed like just a
superhuman level of effort

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.931
to put that amount
of data together.

00:32:55.931 --> 00:32:57.680
And I was looking
through it and thinking,

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.490
oh my gosh, like the
only way to organize

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.430
this is alphabetically, just
because every day there's

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.690
a new company in this space.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.300
LUKE TIMMERMAN: It
really is hard to keep up

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.510
with all of the
scientific approaches, all

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:13.030
the companies getting money.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.580
So yeah, I found myself
scratching my head and saying,

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.670
how can I get a handle on this?

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.590
So why don't I just
go A to Z and try

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.360
to find as many
companies as I could.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.790
And there were something
like 180 companies.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.370
And I just wrote short
profiles of each one of them

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.090
back to back, along with
some links to primary sources

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.620
where you might
be able to gather

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.952
more specific
information on each one.

00:33:34.952 --> 00:33:37.285
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Almost as
many immunotherapy companies

00:33:37.285 --> 00:33:40.738
as there are video sharing
companies, I think, out there.

00:33:40.738 --> 00:33:41.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:41.706 --> 00:33:43.158
Are there any
questions out there?

00:33:46.546 --> 00:33:49.090
AUDIENCE: Sure, maybe just
two quick ones, one just

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.380
about Lee Hood.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.280
I'm just curious that the
difficulties at Caltech

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.282
back in the day, do
you think any part

00:33:56.282 --> 00:33:59.540
of that is the conflict between
sort of the new big science

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:05.600
and what was sort of the
traditional RO1 science?

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.090
LUKE TIMMERMAN: That's a great
question, and absolutely yes.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:16.489
So Hood, because of the scope of
this vision, as it was really--

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:20.540
as he was bringing in the
resources and the people

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.389
to make it happen, his lab grew.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:27.900
He started colonizing more
and more space on campus.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.199
He was the chairman, and
he saw like all of this

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:34.159
as being part of
his grand quest.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.929
Didn't necessarily
pay a lot of attention

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:41.000
to what the small science
people and the faculty--

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.620
what their priorities were.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.049
And so he ended up--

00:34:47.049 --> 00:34:48.590
it evolved.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.230
When you have 60 or
80 people in a lab,

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.230
and the guy down the hall has
five or six graduate students

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.020
working on some very
narrow esoteric problem,

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.120
it challenged the whole
culture of the way Caltech

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.360
operated, or really any
university for that matter.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.880
The principal investigator
led model with five or six

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.550
graduate students has been
around for a long time,

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.470
and it's given us a
lot of good science.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.260
So people in the small
science world looked at this

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.760
and thought, what is this?

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.010
I mean, how can you even
adequately supervise

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.690
these people?

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:21.770
Who are they?

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.360
Are they tenure track faculty?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.692
Or are they like employees
of like a little company?

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:29.400
Do we actually have
like a little company

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.390
you know it's kind of Caltech?

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.040
It was strange.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.520
And it clashed with a lot
of the identity and the way

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.200
Caltech really saw itself, as
this elite institution doing

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.716
these rarified things.

00:35:43.716 --> 00:35:45.090
AUDIENCE: So just
as a follow-up,

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.590
so now being across the street
from a place like Broad,

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.300
that's so amazingly
successful, do you see now,

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.900
this many years later, after
Lee Hood's lab at Caltech--

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.092
you talked before about
how journalism has been

00:35:58.092 --> 00:35:59.300
disrupted by various changes.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.930
Do you see academia any
sense being disrupted?

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.240
I mean, obviously it adapts,
it's very smart people.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.426
But can you point
to like, oh, this

00:36:06.426 --> 00:36:08.456
is the trend that
I would like to see

00:36:08.456 --> 00:36:11.694
in terms of academic
straddling that line in biology

00:36:11.694 --> 00:36:15.702
between the large invention-type
laboratories of a Lee Hood,

00:36:15.702 --> 00:36:19.460
or this sort of thing you have
here in Cambridge versus what

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.390
was more classic RO1
lead investigators?

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.720
LUKE TIMMERMAN: I would say
that these two forms can now

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.610
co-exist more easily.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.560
So small science is
still alive and well.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.190
Well, I mean, it has its
the model is still intact.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:43.920
I mean, there are challenges
to it, with the NIH budget

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.350
constantly under pressure.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.590
But big science has
carved out more of a place

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.620
for itself, big project driven,
that's a little more industry

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.500
like, occurs at a
place like the Broad,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.650
that's fortunate enough
to attract philanthropy,

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.370
that that can look a little
further out at a long term

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:06.480
goal than, say, your classic
RO1 NIH age grant, which

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.000
is more on a three to
five year time frame

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.090
to show some results.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.240
I mean, but there's a lot of
tension still between the two.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.239
I mean, = the whole
data sharing question.

00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:21.030
You know, a lot of
principle investigators,

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.480
I mean, they make their
name in their field

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.490
by getting published
in science and nature

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:31.320
and not by dumping
all their raw data out

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.750
in public databases
for other scientists

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.610
to gather and learn
from in real time.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:41.140
So we have a serious time lag
problem in academic science.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.230
Now, big science still
has that cultural issue,

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.680
but I think to a lesser degree.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.930
I'd be curious to hear your
thoughts on that, Krishna,

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:56.100
but you know, you see some
cases of bigger institutions--

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.950
I think they might be more
inclined to lead on this

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.730
and say, like Daniel MacArthur
over at the Broad Institute,

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.630
some of you may know.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.900
He's got this
database for exomes--

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:11.310
60,000 or even more
collections of big data

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:15.180
sets from 60,000
individuals who have

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.660
had scans done on the
2% of their genome

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.580
that makes code for proteins.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.950
That's pretty useful and.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:27.630
He is actually able to advance
his career by putting this out

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:29.910
in the open and then
letting other people

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.860
share in that resource.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.170
So I think we're
beginning to see

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:39.660
some cultural changes between
small and big science,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.320
but change is hard.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.210
It takes a long time.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.019
Yeah.

00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:47.310
AUDIENCE: So to piggyback on
that last question, if you

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:51.700
could look in your
crystal ball, looking

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.575
into the future of biotech
based on what you know

00:38:55.575 --> 00:38:58.090
about Seattle now,
and how you said

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.527
the landscape has fundamentally
changed because of Amazon?

00:39:01.527 --> 00:39:05.770
Do you think biotech could
or is moving to Seattle?

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:08.980
I mean, San Francisco, Boston,
Cambridge are definitely hubs,

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.520
but we're becoming
crowded, very expensive.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.930
Is there room there?

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.140
Is there a willingness
there to sort of expand

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.780
beyond Amazon into
biotech, or do

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.100
you think it's going to stay--

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.120
the hubs are going to stay
San Francisco, Cambridge?

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.210
LUKE TIMMERMAN: I think
Boston and San Francisco

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:31.020
are head and shoulders
above the other clusters,

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:36.930
and will likely remain that way
as the rest of our lifetimes.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:40.500
There's so much
historical momentum

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.440
behind the basic research,
the clinical care, the venture

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.000
capital, the history
of entrepreneurship,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.780
the human capital
pool that's here.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.610
In a place like
Seattle, you have

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.060
a few pieces of the puzzle,
but not all of them.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.470
You have the basic research
that's world class.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.350
But-- I didn't mention this,
but when I started covering

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.940
the industry, there was a
company called Immunex which

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.810
developed the drug called
Enbrel, which was--

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.700
still to this day,
20 years later,

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.280
is one of the top five best
selling drugs in the world.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.360
It's really a major step forward
for rheumatoid arthritis.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.550
Other drugs have come
forward since then,

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.230
biologically enabled.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:26.430
And the company wasn't
able to hold on to that.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.770
It ended up getting
acquired by Amgen,

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.250
a lot of the assets and
people moved elsewhere.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:36.330
And so Seattle is like a lot
of these other hubs of biotech

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.500
that doesn't--

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.920
it has some aspects of what
you need, but in this case,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.030
it doesn't have the pool
of sales and marketing

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.210
people, or executive talent,
that venture capitalists

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:52.920
typically want to see
before they seed new things.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.690
And you have that in a place
like Boston, Cambridge.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.670
So you know--

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.530
I'm sure Krishna has
no shortage of people

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:04.790
that you can imagine running
startup companies here.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:07.290
KRISHNA YESHWANT: In Boston,
yeah, we're surrounded by them.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.400
I'm curious, I mean, if you
were to zoom out a level

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.620
and look at the biotech
industry over the time you've

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:19.379
been covering it, there's
the gigantic pharma entities

00:41:19.379 --> 00:41:20.670
you know that we all know the--

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:24.200
Pfizers, the Roche the Mercks.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.460
There's the small
companies that we finance

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.861
and that are doing
exciting new science.

00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:31.110
Maybe some of them are public.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.980
Usually call it five billion
or under sort of market caps.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.730
And then we have kind of this
interesting array of companies

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.970
like Vertex, Celgene,--

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.720
I mean, Gilead, I mean
these have become--

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.410
these are companies I think
we've seen go from startups

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:50.490
to more mid-sized companies
to they're becoming

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.640
pretty large companies.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.170
And some of them have done
deals that are billion dollar

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.640
acquisitions,
billion dollar deals,

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.431
and they can kind of
do it without breaking

00:41:58.431 --> 00:41:59.969
too much of a sweat.

00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:02.010
If you were to dial the
clock forward, just given

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:04.100
the context you've had
over all these years,

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.433
you know what do you think
happens with those companies?

00:42:06.433 --> 00:42:08.760
Do you think they get
acquired by the big entities,

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.140
do you think that they grow
up-- a lot of them kind of,

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.940
and I'm sure you've been
on the receiving end of all

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.574
of their pitches
as they talk to you

00:42:17.574 --> 00:42:19.740
about various announcements,
they all have kind of I

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.150
think the framework
of, look, we're

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.525
going to be the
next Merck, we're

00:42:22.525 --> 00:42:26.035
going to be the next Genentech,
Roche, do you believe it?

00:42:26.035 --> 00:42:27.660
Do you believe that
those companies are

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.720
going to grow into the
next big behemoths,

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.231
or what do you think
happens with those folks?

00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:35.230
LUKE TIMMERMAN: You know,
it's a great question.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:38.740
I think maybe it's a
minority of the time--

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.770
maybe 1/4 fourth of
the time those visions

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:45.360
are realized by a company
that gets over the hump

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.710
and develops a new drug.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:51.240
I mean, just getting one
drug over the finish line

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.170
as an FDA approved product
and you know it really helping

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.630
patients and getting
adequately reimbursed

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.750
and making good money--

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:03.600
I mean, very, very few companies
ever get through that funnel.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.822
And even fewer can do it twice.

00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:11.760
So this is a company
down the street,

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.770
Alnylum Pharmaceuticals,
is a good example.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:17.400
So they've got RNA interference,
gene silencing technology.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.460
They did-- they locked
up a lot of IP early on.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.230
They raised a lot of money.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.640
Brought in smart people.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.100
And 15 years later,
they just now

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.070
have the phase 3
validating data necessary

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.820
for treating one rare
disease which looks

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.530
like that's going to be a drug.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.020
Now they can start making money.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.240
But that really is
not enough for them

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.180
to become an enduring entity.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.660
They need to do it at
least one or two more times

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.900
to get diversified, like
a Celgene or a Gilead.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.600
Even Gilead and Celgene
have their diversification

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.750
challenges.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.660
you look at how they
make their money,

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.936
and often it's one big
thing that does it.

00:43:57.936 --> 00:44:00.060
KRISHNA YESHWANT: I mean,
just to just call it out,

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.200
I mean, even for the Celgenes,
the Gileads, the Vertexes, I

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.960
mean, these are companies
that are actually pretty big,

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.760
but to your point
like they still--

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.880
they're not fully diversified.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.560
And I guess that's-- maybe
that' one of the questions,

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.487
there's the Alnylums, can they
make the leap into becoming

00:44:17.487 --> 00:44:18.570
a commercial organization?

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.310
That's something that--
I mean, obviously

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.520
John's a phenomenal,
phenomenal leader,

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.289
you know you have
Agios, similar.

00:44:24.289 --> 00:44:26.080
And I think you were
an article about this,

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.470
like this shift in culture
from being an early stage R&amp;D

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.900
company to becoming a
commercial organization-- that's

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.820
its own challenge,
even after you

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.200
have the successful drug
that's been approved,

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.660
can you kind of
convert the company

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.580
into a commercial organization?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.010
When you look at these
next level of companies,

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.800
the Vertexes, Celgenes,
the Gileads, which

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.800
have maybe a small number
of assets that are producing

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.212
huge revenues, do
you think that they

00:44:50.212 --> 00:44:52.045
will be able to get to
that diversification?

00:44:52.045 --> 00:44:54.790
Do you think there's
just as much risk there

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.460
as you see on the early
stage side of this?

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.050
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yes.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.510
I mean, it's sort of
like the old saying,

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.300
getting to the
mountaintop is hard,

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.650
but staying there
is even harder.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:08.142
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Right, right.

00:45:08.142 --> 00:45:09.850
LUKE TIMMERMAN:
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.460
is one good example of a
company that's now got, I think,

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.070
six approved drugs,
and they're laying

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:19.687
the foundation for a genomics
based drug discovery,

00:45:19.687 --> 00:45:22.270
like really trying to link some
of these layers of information

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:26.260
that I was talking about earlier
to try to create something

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.190
sustainable, something
that can with some degree

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.590
of predictability
and reliability

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:37.300
roll off a new FDA approved
drug once every couple years.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:42.040
I mean, it's still monumentally
difficult and expensive,

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.640
and things are going to fail
for reasons that you can't fully

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.350
understand, even
after you've spent

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.960
years and millions of dollars.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.500
But the companies
that I think are

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.420
able to invest in enough
pieces of the R&amp;D puzzle

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.650
are the ones likely to endure.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:04.450
I think in Alnylum
and Regeneron,

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:08.560
these are companies that have a
shot because of the investment

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.730
in basic science.

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.860
But often you see companies
where that's not even

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.540
the intention at all.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.600
They just-- they take an asset
out of Pfizer that looks like

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.540
it has some promise, and it
needs some focus development

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.375
for maybe 10 years, and
that's all the goal is,

00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:25.060
is to get that
one drug approved,

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.980
sell it to a big
pharma company--

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.000
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
Billions of dollars.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.830
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Reward
the shareholders, and then

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.390
the management,
who is exhausted,

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.790
will go sit on an
island somewhere.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.290
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Let me see
if there's any other questions.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.080
I've got a couple of
others lined up here,

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.849
but anybody else want to?

00:46:39.849 --> 00:46:42.140
AUDIENCE: You were talking
about the Seattle and Boston

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.327
clusters in the US.

00:46:43.327 --> 00:46:45.160
What do you see around
the rest of the world

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.749
as far as centers for biotech?

00:46:47.749 --> 00:46:49.540
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:54.670
So the UK has some
biotech infrastructure.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:57.210
Germany is another.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.720
Some in Japan.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:04.270
But the vast majority of new
drug discovery and development

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.120
occurs in the US.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.230
There-- of it I
think it comes back

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.480
to the decades of investment
from the federal government,

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.900
the NIH, in creating
centers of excellence.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.460
But also you have an
entrepreneurial culture,

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:27.410
where it's OK to gamble your
career on one of these projects

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:31.780
and maybe fail, and as long
as you don't defraud somebody

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.210
along the way, maybe
you can try again.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:36.610
That's part of our culture.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.680
We also have a
stock market that is

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:43.810
very receptive and open to these
very high risk, high reward

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.770
propositions.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:49.270
That's not true
in other countries

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.640
where there's a
little more reticence

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:57.920
around losing all of your
money, which does happen.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.890
So we could have a longer
conversation about this,

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:04.420
but there are special
ingredients in the United

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.540
States that have enabled
this to be the place where

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.190
a lot of this activity occurs.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.730
And now, that's not
guaranteed to last forever.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:16.390
I mean, we're doing some
things like with immigration,

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.740
for instance, that
could threaten our lead.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.580
It could for some of this
activity to go elsewhere.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.720
And it very well--

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.300
some of the ingredients are
in place in other countries.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.805
They could-- they'd
be happy to take it.

00:48:30.805 --> 00:48:32.430
KRISHNA YESHWANT: I
know you're in town

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:35.680
to do a bunch of things,
but as a venture capitalist,

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.640
I'm obligated to ask you
about the panel you're

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.100
running later today about
how to avoid VCs and get

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.202
the money you need.

00:48:44.202 --> 00:48:45.910
I actually think it's
a phenomenal topic.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:47.993
LUKE TIMMERMAN: I thought
you were going to ask me

00:48:47.993 --> 00:48:49.360
about your portfolio companies.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.901
KRISHNA YESHWANT:
That's coming next.

00:48:50.901 --> 00:48:52.790
We do that offline.

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:56.620
But there is kind of this
interesting dynamic developing

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.230
where there are new sources of
capital coming into biotech.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.860
And maybe it's because we're
in this boom cycle of it.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.530
But I think you've done
that panel in other settings

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:07.410
or maybe--

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.670
what are you seeing
out there aside

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.260
from the traditional
venture approach

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:16.180
to financing these risky,
crazy sort of companies?

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:16.900
what.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.484
other sources of
capital or are there?

00:49:18.484 --> 00:49:20.441
LUKE TIMMERMAN: I think
you hit it on the head.

00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:23.039
The reason for this is that
biotech has had a good run.

00:49:23.039 --> 00:49:24.580
There were about
three years in a row

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.120
where it outperformed the
S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.410
composite index.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.920
So any time that happens,
you get more money

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.420
flowing in and
saying, gee, I'd like

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.280
to outperform the market too.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.140
And so traditional VC
has been around forever,

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:45.140
and these are the folks who--
they raise money from pensions,

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.019
endowments, limited partners--

00:49:47.019 --> 00:49:48.310
KRISHNA YESHWANT: Corporations.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:52.060
LUKE TIMMERMAN: Corporations,
and so they're out there

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.070
raising new funds
every few years.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:57.700
That's one form-- really the
dominant long lasting form--

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.780
of venture capital.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.910
But there are all these
other types out there,

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.500
like corporate venture capital.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.540
So GV is an example,
where you're

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.330
not out there raising money
from endowments or pensions.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.396
You've got some money
set aside, generally.

00:50:09.396 --> 00:50:11.020
I mean, they come in
different flavors,

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.560
but some money set aside from
the parent company that says,

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.120
we will gamble some of this
money on biotech startups.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.667
That's just part of our mission.

00:50:20.667 --> 00:50:22.750
And some of them will pay
off and some won't, just

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:26.020
like any venture capital firm.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.720
But we have our
reasons for doing this.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.670
Then there's also this emergence
of disease related foundations.

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:38.560
So these are nonprofit
groups that in many cases

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.700
have an interest in a
specific disease area,

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.440
and they fund basic research.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.820
But I think in the last, say,
five to 10 years, a lot of them

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.716
have recognized, well,
that's not good enough.

00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:54.340
So if you're, say, the Michael
J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:58.780
Research, you can invest in
the bright researcher down

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.540
the street at Dana-Farber
or Harvard Medical School,

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.440
and that's great.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.180
But their work is
ultimately going

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.340
to lead to a published
paper in the New England

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.510
Journal of Medicine.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:09.160
And again, that's great.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:14.710
But it doesn't go all the way
to a new Parkinson's treatment.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:15.980
So how do you get there?

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.854
Well, maybe you could
take some of your money

00:51:17.854 --> 00:51:21.640
and make equity investments in
a spinoff company that takes

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.470
that asset out of that lab.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:25.510
And so many of
them have realized,

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:28.750
can we set up this sort of
equity investment component

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.400
within our charter?

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.600
The Gates Foundation does this
for all kinds of immunology

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.920
related companies that may have
an application for vaccines

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.710
in the developing world that
the foundation cares about,

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:45.500
but it also may be
useful for cancer.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.860
And that would be like
something that traditional VCs

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.650
and corporate VCs can
all get together on.

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:54.620
And you know so you're
seeing disease foundations,

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:58.270
corporate venture funds,
but also now family offices.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.090
So this is sort of the wealthy--
the billionaire phenomenon.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:05.270
Somebody like a Peter
Thiel, who says, gee,

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:09.000
I'd like to start a company, a
biotech company, and that's--

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.560
all I need is a bright scientist
and a team of advisers.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.920
And what do you need?
$10, $20 million

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.130
to run the next
set of experiments.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.580
Go give it a shot.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:26.920
So you've got a lot of
different kinds of new investing

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.820
entities.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.910
KRISHNA YESHWANT: I've got so
many more questions for you.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:35.240
But I'll ask you them probably
in another setting like this.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.080
Well thank you Luke
for taking the time

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.750
to talk to us both in the
room and all the folks

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:42.550
virtually here.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:45.097
You started things
off by saying that you

00:52:45.097 --> 00:52:47.680
could have gone to a variety of
different areas of journalism,

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.200
and you picked this area
because all the exciting stuff

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.980
and people in it.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.740
I think your book
does a phenomenal job

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.760
of describing that.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.790
So many books in this space are
kind of a slog to get through.

00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:59.140
Yours was just a joy.

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.330
So hopefully everybody
out there and in here

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:02.770
gets a chance to
experience that.

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.100
I thought the audio book
was phenomenal as well,

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.050
but thank you for
coming and hopefully we

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:10.690
get to do this more often
as you write more books.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:12.227
LUKE TIMMERMAN:
Thank you very much.

00:53:12.227 --> 00:53:13.060
Pleasure to be here.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:16.410
[APPLAUSE]
