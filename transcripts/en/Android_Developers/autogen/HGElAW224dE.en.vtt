00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:02.726
 Ian Lick: If you are building an application, press the camera button 

00:00:02.726 --> 00:00:03.840
 The application crashes. 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.900
 Joanna Smith: Any application? 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.206
 Ian Lick: It does not matter which application. 

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.310
 It's a completely hypothetical position. 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.478
 Joanna Smith: But by default, my apps do not collapse. 

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:10.562
 Ian Lake: Built Application. 

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.700
 Press the camera button and .. collapse. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.580
 He tries to have a better application, but he 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.670
 He can not without your help. 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.910
 Why do not you help, Joanna? 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.820
 Joanna Smith: Wait, 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.020
 What do you mean that I do not help? 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.740
 I'm a very helpful person. 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.240
 Ian Lake: If I were very helpful, 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.870
 We've already talked about adding runtime checks 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.110
 "Forbidden purposes". 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.540
 (Music) 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.904
 JOHANNA SMITH: Interesting, interesting fact, implicit purposes. 

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:34.470
 Ian: Like opening the camera application. 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.303
 Joanna: Right. 

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:37.160
 It may not work on every device. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.686
 Ian: Well, it's not that they're not working on every device. 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.760
 But in some devices the applications you need may not exist. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.007
 To respond to your need. 

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:47.840
 Joanna: Right. 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.120
 This activates the "Exception of Lack of Activity" 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.610
 And of course this is not happy news for your application. 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.080
 Ian: This looks very serious, I mean 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.310
 Serious to kill application. 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.150
 Joanna: That's right. May lead to the collapse of your application. 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.240
 This generally happens when 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.580
 The application is missing, because the user 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.060
 Scan or disable application. 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.000
 Ian: What? 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.709
 Survey? 

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.430
 Damage? 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.740
 I mean, my favorite apps? 

00:01:07.422 --> 00:01:09.320
 Joanna: Or it could be the user 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.880
 What we call a "limited account" and do not enjoy using 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.021
 All the features. 

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.270
 Ian: "Limited Accounts"? 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.150
 Is this dangerous? 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.634
 I mean, do we need someone to check it out? 

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.050
 Joanna: Or it could be a basic user 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.980
 Minimize the applications and features available 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.420
 For other users. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.020
 Ian: If the user is the primary device 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.730
 Can i take my camera application? 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.904
 Joanna: Well, I mean, yes, 

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:31.130
 But remember that the machines are assigned to the working environment 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.600
 Or devices under parental control 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.966
 You may not need a camera function. 

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.140
 Ian: But we can take Sylvie, right? 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.317
 Ian: Oh, it's collapsed. 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.820
 Joanna: Yes. To prevent run-time exceptions and landslides at an inappropriate time 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.850
 It is very easy if you are only 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.590
 You call "ResloveActivity" before launching your implicit purpose. 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.820
 Ian: ResolveActivity, the problem has been resolved. 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.360
 We are done. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.740
 Joanna: Yeah, it's really that simple. 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.180
 Because just check to make sure 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.821
 From having something to use before using it 

00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:58.820
 Will make the entire application more stable. 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.570
 Ian: Wow. 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.807
 that's cool. 

00:02:00.807 --> 00:02:02.390
 Does this mean we can take Sylvie? 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.337
 Ian: Sylvie. 

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.240
 Ian: It's good. 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.440
 Joanna: Yes. So use run-time tests to 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.833
 Ian: Adopt better applications. Joanna: My son has better applications. 

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:12.920
 Thanks Ian. 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.470
