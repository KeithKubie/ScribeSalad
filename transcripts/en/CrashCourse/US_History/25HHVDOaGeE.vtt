00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.329
CCUS19 - Battles of the Civil War

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.139
Hi, I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
US History.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:04.950
Starting next week, we’re going to be talking
about the Civil War.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.900
As you may have noticed, Crash Course doesn’t
usually focus on military history, because

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.309
we’re more interested in causes and effects
and that kind of stuff, but because some in

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.051
our audience are likely to insist that a series
on American History has to include the battles

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:22.619
of the Civil War, I am now going to tell you
about EVERY SINGLE fight of the war.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.619
Oh.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.921
Stan, this says there were 8,000 instances
of violence between the Union and the Confederate

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.510
States of America between 1861 and 1865.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.510
Can that be right?

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.750
Slight change of plan.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:44.440
I’m going to tell you about the MAJOR battles
of the Civil War.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.210
The shooting started in 1861.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.370
In April the first shots of the war were fired
at the Battle of Fort Sumter, South Carolina,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.550
which the South won.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.690
Next the Battle of Rich Mountain went to the
North.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.460
First Bull Run happened in Manassas, VA in
July.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.060
The South won, General Jackson got the nickname
Stonewall, and the North realized this war

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.350
was going to be serious business.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.640
The South had another victory at Wilson’s
Creek in August, but lost to the Union at

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.580
Carnifex Ferry in September.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
The North got another win at the Battle of
Cheat Mountain, but the South finished the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.530
year strong with wins at Ball’s Bluff and
Chustenahlah.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.290
The North came roaring back in 1862 with wins
at the battles of Mill Springs, Fort Henry,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.640
Roanoke Island, and Fort Donelson, where the
Confederate general was named Simon Bolivar

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.640
Buckner.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640
What!?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.650
There was fighting in the west, with the South
winning at Valverder, NM, and Pea Ridge, AR.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.470
The Union won at New Madrid, MO.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.480
The Battle of Hampton Roads, VA in March was
a draw, and featured the first fight between

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.830
two ironclad warships, the USS Monitor and
the CSS Virginia.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.410
The Union won the Battle of Bern, and the
first battle of Kernstown, and then draws

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.230
at Glorieta Pass, NM, and Yorktown.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.970
The Union won the Battle of Shiloh, where
future Ben Hur author Lew Wallace was accused

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.580
of incompetence and cowardice.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.560
The Union won the Battle of Fort Pulaski and
the Battle of Forts Jackson and St Philip,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.642
which gave the North control of New Orleans.

00:01:56.642 --> 00:02:01.570
The North won the siege of Corinth, and McClellan
fought one of the many indecisive battles

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.630
he would be involved in at Williamsburg, VA.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.440
Then Stonewall Jackson had a great run, winning
battles at McDowell, Front Royal, and Winchester.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.090
Union forces captured Memphis, TN in May,
but then lost a couple more to Jackson at

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.780
Cross Keys and Port Republic.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.950
In Virginia that June, Robert E Lee and Goerge
McClellan fought a series of six battles in

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.450
seven days, which were called the seven days
battles.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.110
There was a draw at Oak Grove, Union victory
at Beaver Dam Creek, a win for Lee at Gaines’

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.760
Mill, ties at Garnett’s and Golding’s
Farm, the Battle of Savage’s Station, and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.850
the battle of Glendale.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.480
The Union finally won the Seven Days at Malvern
Hill, but McClellan withdrew after the battle,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.290
allowing Lee and the remaining confederates
to escape.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.900
In July 1862, one of the least consequential
battles of the war took place in Stan’s

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.569
hometown, Newburgh, IN.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.380
A force of 35 Confederate irregulars built
some fake cannons out of stovepipes that they

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.800
called Quaker guns, crossed the Ohio River,
captured some weapons and a hospital full

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.381
of wounded Union soldiers, and then abandoned
the town later the same day.

00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:04.381
This was the first town in the North to be
captured by Confederates.

00:03:04.381 --> 00:03:07.520
Later that summer came the Battles of Baton
Rouge, Cedar Mountain, Mannassas Station,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.340
the Second Battle of Bull Run, Richmond, KY,
Chantilly, and Harper’s Ferry, all of which

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.420
the Confederates won.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.910
The Union won at South Mountain, but lost
at Munfordville.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.610
On September 17 McClellan ended Lee’s invasion
of the north at Anteitam, MD.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.510
This was the bloodiest single day of the war
with 22,717 dead, wounded, or missing.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.350
The rest of 1862 saw the battles of Perryville,
Prairie Grove, Fredericksburg, and Chickasaw

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.940
Bayou.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.129
1863 started in Tennessee with a Union victory
at the Battle of Stones River, but also with

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.910
a simultaneous Confederate victory at Galveston,
TX.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.931
There were lots of smallish skirmishes during
the winter and early Spring, until the Battle

00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.569
of Chancellorsville in May, where Lee defeated
Hooker, but Stonewall Jackson was mortally

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.569
wounded.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:04.030
He lost his arm, and then died 8 days later
of pneumonia.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.980
His arm buried with its own headstone near
Chancellorsville.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.380
The North won a bunch of battles in Mississippi
at Port Gibson, Raymond, Jackson, Champion

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.680
Hill, Big Black River Ridge, and finally,
Vicksburg.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.060
This victory, along with the victory at Port
Hudson effectively ended the Confederacy’s

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.049
ability to use the Mississippi River.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.189
June, 1863 in Virginia was inconclusive, with
draws at Brandy Station, Winchester, Aldie,

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:24.189
Middleburg, and Upperville.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.460
July brought the Battle of Gettysburg, a major
Union victory.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.909
This battle featured Pickett’s famous charge,
was the end of Lee’s second invasion of

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:35.639
the north, was the costliest of the war in
terms of caualties, and led to, believe it

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.870
or not, The Gettysburg Address.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.720
The rest of that summer brought split results
with Union wins at Helena, AR, Honey Springs,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.720
OK and Chattanooga, TN.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720
The Confederates answered with two victories
at Ft Wagner, SC.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.240
They also won at Ft Sumter AGAIN, holding
the fort against heavy Union bombardment,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.039
and they perpetrated a massacre of civilians
in Lawrence, KS.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.889
The rest of 1863 saw battles at Sabine Pass,
TX, Bayou Fourche, AR, a major confederate

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.469
win at Chickamauga, the battles of Bristow
Station, Wauhatchie, Rappahannock Station,

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.639
Chattanooga again, Ringgold Gap, Fort Sanders,
and Mossy Creek.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.919
Oh man, we’re only to 1864.

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:06.919
Gotta keep it moving.

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.080
Stan, can you just indicate who won these
on screen?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.080
Great

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080
The first major battles of 1864 were in February
at Olustee, FL and Okolona, MS.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.059
The spring saw battles at Fort De Russy, Mansfield,
Prairie D’Ane, AR, Pleasant Hill, LA, and

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:13.059
Fort Pillow, TN.

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:16.410
There were The Battles of the Wilderness,
Spottsylvania Courthouse, Procter’s Creek,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.819
New Market, North Anna, Old Church, Cold Harbor,
and the Battle of the Piedmont all in Virginia.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:21.819
Summer brought the battles of Marietta, GA,
and Brice’s Crossroads, MS.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.539
The battles of Trevillian Station, Petersburg,
Lynchburg, and Jerusalem Plank Road were all

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:24.539
fought in Virginia.

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.339
Also Kennesaw Mountain, GA, Monocacy, Maryland,
and Fort Stevens, in the District of Columbia.

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.659
Abraham Lincoln himself went to observe this
battle, and the guy standing next to him got

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:33.659
shot.

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.809
Next were the battles of Tupelo, MS, Peachtree
Creek, GA, and Atlanta, GA, a major Union

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.190
victory won by General Sherman.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.719
Also fought were the battles of Kernstown,
VA, Ezra Church, GA, the Battle of the Crater

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.830
in Virginia, the battles of Mobile Bay, AL,
Deep Bottom, Globe Tavern, and Reams station

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.159
in VA, and the battle of Jonesborough, GA
which solidified Union control of Atlanta.

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.159
Ok.

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.430
Autumn of 1864, we’re in the home stretch
here.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.369
The battles of Opequon, Fisher’s Hill, Chaffin’s
Farm, Peebles’ Farm, and Cedar Creek were

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:57.369
all fought in Virginia.

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:59.020
The battles of Byram’s Ford, Newtonia, and
Westpory all happened in Missouri.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.514
Johnsonville, TN, Griswoldville, GA, Spring
Hill, TN, The Sand Creek Massacre, The Battle

00:06:00.514 --> 00:06:04.999
of Franklin, TN, Fort McAllister, GA, and
Nashville, TN finished out the year.

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.999
Whew.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.999
1865, here we go.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:09.089
The Battles of Fort Fisher, NC, Hatcher’s
Run, VA, Waynesboro, Virginia, Bentonville,

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:13.119

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:18.150
THIRD battle of Petersburg, VA, Fort Blakely,
AL, Saylor’s Creek, VA, Appomattox Station,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:25.529
VA, and finally, the decisive battle at Appomattox
Courthouse, VA, on April 8, 1865 which resulted

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.639
in Lee’s surrender to Grant.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:34.740
There were a few more minor skirmishes, but
the war was OVER.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:42.310
So there you have it, an episode of Crash
Course ENTIRELY about battles.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.229
I know that we missed many, many battles of
the war, but these are most of the big ones.

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.860
There’s not even a big finish this week,
because I’m just exhausted from all the

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.789
fighting.

00:06:50.789 --> 00:07:13.860
Thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next
week.
