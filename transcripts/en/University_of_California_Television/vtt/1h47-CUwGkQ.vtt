00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.650
(techno music)

00:00:11.307 --> 00:00:13.890
(techno music)

00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:20.365
(techno music)

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:24.656
- I'd like to tell you about
some of the processes that

00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:28.506
unfold as the baby brain
grows and develops.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.978
In particular, I'm gonna
focus on the underpinnings of

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:35.230
language, since language
learning impairment is a feature

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.455
of so many developmental disorders,

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.422
which we're gonna get into later.

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:42.196
So why look at baby brain function?

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:45.542
Because while we watch this
magical unfolding of early

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.281
abilities across development
we can begin to answer

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.941
some very big questions
including how do early

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.829
events of development
influence later cognition

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.424
and later competence.

00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:58.311
What risk factors during
early development have

00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:02.000
consequences for adult
behavior or disorder and how

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.216
might that be altered,

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:05.991
and how can very early abnormalities

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:10.062
in the functional organization
of brain networks be causal

00:01:10.062 --> 00:01:13.814
in developmental disorders
such as language learning

00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:16.404
disorder, autism, or ADHD.

00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:20.482
And importantly, how early
might biomarkers be detected,

00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:23.331
measured, and perhaps remediated

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:25.914
with non-invasive technologies.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.852
So as newborns, babies can
discriminate the sounds

00:01:30.852 --> 00:01:35.019
of every language acoustically,
but not linguistically.

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:38.848
So starting at birth, the
baby's developing brain

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.544
is constructing an
acoustic map of the sounds

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:43.272
of his or her native language.

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:46.297
And this gradual process,
perceptual narrowing,

00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:49.847
is thought to be completed
by the end of the first year.

00:01:49.847 --> 00:01:52.265
Mapping of these acoustic
contrasts is important

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:54.965
because they're salient to
the surrounding language

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:58.570
ultimately allows the child
to respond in a fast automatic

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.959
way to the incoming language stream.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.507
And it's problematic
if this doesn't go well

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:07.990
because it impacts mounting
of fluent native language,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.178
as well as cognition and later
reading due to difficulties

00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:15.564
in what's called
phoneme-to-grapheme mapping,

00:02:15.564 --> 00:02:17.683
that is matching speech sounds to letters,

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:20.709
which you need to do to read.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.499
Efficient processing of basic
auditory events in the tens

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.999
of milliseconds domain called,
rapid auditory processing,

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.093
is critical to mounting language
in normative development

00:02:30.093 --> 00:02:33.792
and allows the most optimal
acoustic maps to be constructed.

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:37.718
And this is because many speech
sounds, phonemes like da or

00:02:37.718 --> 00:02:42.320
ta, only differ by brief
spectral and/or temporal changes

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.647
specifically within the
tens of milliseconds.

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:48.670
And differences in these basic
acoustic processing abilities

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.936
have been shown to be
related to both concurrent

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:54.419
and later language learning difficulties.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.405
Research from my lab strongly
suggests that the ability

00:02:57.405 --> 00:03:00.962
to perform these very fine
acoustic discriminations

00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:03.768
within speech or non-speech,
because we mainly look

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:06.577
at prelinguistic non-speech,
is critically important

00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:10.370
in normative language and
it may go awry in a subset

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.282
of developmental disorders.

00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:15.068
Moreover, these skills predict
language outcomes through

00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:18.698
early pre-reading and have
an impact on later learning.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.927
So many of our studies,
we examine populations

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:25.396
at higher risk for various
disorders as a consequence

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:29.655
of a child being born into a
family with such disorders.

00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:32.543
And heritability studies suggest the risk

00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:35.956
can be 30 to 60 percent higher
depending on which disorder

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:37.976
and which study.

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:41.070
So how do you measure
brain responses in infants?

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.862
You can use electroencephalography,
EEG, which reflects

00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:50.029
the summation of the
synchronous activity of millions

00:03:50.913 --> 00:03:54.273
of neurons that have
similar spacial orientation.

00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:57.676
You can also use brain
evoked related potentials.

00:03:57.676 --> 00:04:00.254
And this is an average across many trials

00:04:00.254 --> 00:04:02.241
to generate an averaged waveform

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:05.419
that is time-locked to
external stimulation.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.303
This permits examination
of the time course

00:04:08.303 --> 00:04:11.676
in the brain areas related
to sensory processing.

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:15.877
And you can compare and contrast
group response as well as

00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:19.370
compare individual
responses to group norms.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.991
Research suggests that brain
oscillations, which are cyclic

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.002
fluctuations of the membrane
potential in brain cells,

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:29.211
control neuronal excitability,
integrate sensory inputs,

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:31.723
and may coordinate higher level functions,

00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:34.422
such as language memory and learning.

00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:36.464
However, neurodynamics was just beginning

00:04:36.464 --> 00:04:39.100
to be studied in the human infant.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.761
Our previous studies and
pilot data strongly suggest

00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:44.421
that oscillatory dynamics
and their hierarchical

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:47.685
organization have a developmental timeline

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:52.545
and may capture disruption
in normative development.

00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:53.912
So how can you look at that?

00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:57.405
You can look at the EEG
and you can do something

00:04:57.405 --> 00:04:59.474
called a fast Fourier analysis.

00:04:59.474 --> 00:05:04.252
This is one way of doing it,
which breaks the EEG pattern

00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:07.252
down into its component frequencies.

00:05:08.327 --> 00:05:11.139
Synchronized neural oscillations
in these low frequencies,

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.956
delta, theta, and alpha
are thought to provide

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:17.481
key mechanisms that orchestrate
network coordination

00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:19.236
during development and may be involved

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:22.513
in information transfer among brain areas.

00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:25.727
Theta oscillations in
particular are important

00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:27.876
for perceptual and
cognitive functions such as

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:30.379
declarative and episodic memory,

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.550
and have been proposed
as a neural mechanism

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.884
subserving phonemic discrimination

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:37.358
which is one of the reasons
we're very interested in it.

00:05:37.358 --> 00:05:40.677
Gamma oscillations from
30 to 80 or 90 hertz

00:05:40.677 --> 00:05:44.690
may represent synchronized
activity of local neuronal

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.467
populations during sensory
and cognitive processes,

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:51.731
but may also, particularly
high gamma, play a role

00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:54.610
in coupling of remote cortical areas.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.812
So given that activity in
this gamma frequency has been

00:05:57.812 --> 00:06:00.876
linked in humans and animals
to a wide variety of higher

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:04.548
cognitive processes including
attention memory and language,

00:06:04.548 --> 00:06:07.864
we first examine power
density in frontal cortex

00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:11.382
across the language bursts
in two groups of children.

00:06:11.382 --> 00:06:13.337
And I'm going to give
you a few little snippets

00:06:13.337 --> 00:06:15.429
of some studies.

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:19.596
We studied the power of spectra
in two groups of children,

00:06:20.656 --> 00:06:22.573
with and without a family
history of language learning

00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:26.138
impairment, at 16, 24,
and 36 months of age

00:06:26.138 --> 00:06:29.473
when this huge burst in language occurs.

00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:32.507
We found that individual
differences in frontal gamma power

00:06:32.507 --> 00:06:36.165
during rest highly correlated
with concurrent language

00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:39.257
and cognitive skills at all ages.

00:06:39.257 --> 00:06:40.804
Children with a family history

00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:42.101
of language learning impairment

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:45.651
had lower frontal gamma at all ages.

00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:48.717
Power was also associated
with the attentional measures.

00:06:48.717 --> 00:06:52.469
Children who were observed
as having better inhibitory

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.561
control and more mature
attention shifting abilities

00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:57.302
had higher power.

00:06:57.302 --> 00:06:59.817
We continued to follow this group

00:06:59.817 --> 00:07:03.246
and we found that examining
gamma across the language burst

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:05.154
strongly predicted to both cognition

00:07:05.154 --> 00:07:09.174
and language at ages four and five years.

00:07:09.174 --> 00:07:13.341
We saw that at 16, 24, and
36 months resting gamma

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.958
was associated with four-year
language comprehension scores

00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:24.096
and word structure and
sentence structure scores.

00:07:24.096 --> 00:07:27.504
And at 24 and 36 months
gamma power was significantly

00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:30.296
associated with five-year
sentence imitation

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:32.917
which is really important for pre-readers.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:36.327
36-month gamma power was
also significantly associated

00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:39.126
with five-year syntactical skills.

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:40.933
So what's the take home message here?

00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:45.075
We believe that the capacity
to generate higher power

00:07:45.075 --> 00:07:48.610
in the gamma range at these
crucial developmental periods

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.528
may index better modulation of attention,

00:07:51.528 --> 00:07:55.217
and allow easier access to working memory,

00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:58.403
providing an advantage
for overall development

00:07:58.403 --> 00:08:01.035
particularly in the linguistic domain.

00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:03.658
We were then interested in
examining oscillatory support

00:08:03.658 --> 00:08:05.059
in younger infants.

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:08.391
So using event-related
potential source localization

00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:11.822
and a time-frequency analysis
of event-related oscillation.

00:08:11.822 --> 00:08:15.895
So from the source we
examine the neural substrates

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:19.417
of rapid auditory processing
in four month olds.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:23.318
Animal models and adult experiments
suggest that oscillatory

00:08:23.318 --> 00:08:26.719
synchrony, and in particular
low frequency oscillations

00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:29.782
in the delta and theta
range play key roles

00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:33.402
in rapid auditory processing
and auditory change detection.

00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:36.172
So we hypothesized that
synchronized activity

00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:39.844
of brain oscillations in left
and right auditory cortices

00:08:39.844 --> 00:08:43.609
would support rapid frequency
discrimination in infants.

00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:47.373
Moreover, we thought that
infant perception of rapid pitch

00:08:47.373 --> 00:08:49.753
and timing changes, which is so critical,

00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:53.100
should be mediated in part at least

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.274
by oscillatory mechanisms.

00:08:55.274 --> 00:08:57.786
These issues had not been
looked at in infants at all,

00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.252
in human infants.

00:08:59.252 --> 00:09:03.185
We used two test sets of
stimuli: Speech-like tones,

00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:05.852
(beeping tones)

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.727
and a control condition that was

00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:13.775
out of the speech-like range.

00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:15.762
So we found, and this
is a very busy slide,

00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:17.435
but I'll walk you through it.

00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:20.366
You're gonna see some of
these figures that show pulled

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:24.429
oscillatory power over time,
with frequency on the X-axis,

00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:28.344
time on the Y-axis for these
complex tone pairs in the

00:09:28.344 --> 00:09:32.493
control rate and in the rapid
rate, the speech-like rate.

00:09:32.493 --> 00:09:34.969
And these are for standards,
the background sounds,

00:09:34.969 --> 00:09:37.453
these are for deviants,
the ones that change,

00:09:37.453 --> 00:09:39.785
and this is the difference
between the two.

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:41.748
Face synchronization is in red,

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.935
desynchronization is in blue.

00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:48.498
And what we saw was that there
was enhanced phase-locking

00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:52.831
to variant tones in both
rate conditions, larger

00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:56.748
and faster activation in the
right hemisphere at both rates.

00:09:56.748 --> 00:09:59.693
However, left auditory
activity was enhanced

00:09:59.693 --> 00:10:02.954
only during rapid rate presentation.

00:10:02.954 --> 00:10:07.039
We also gave these babies
a go/no-go behavioral task

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.019
at their second visit.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:11.843
Auditory perception was measured
by the infant's ability to

00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:15.771
learn a reward contingency
for a deviant tone in a pair.

00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:17.635
And the number of trials it took the baby

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:21.738
to get four out of five
correct was their criterion.

00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:25.452
And we did a median split with
faster and slower learners

00:10:25.452 --> 00:10:27.948
and what you see is
that tone discrimination

00:10:27.948 --> 00:10:31.154
is strongest for the
children who learn faster.

00:10:31.154 --> 00:10:34.890
We also saw that slower
learners had smaller power

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.804
differences between their
standard and deviant responses.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:42.679
And this suggests that they
had a lot of difficulty

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:45.759
discriminating one signal from another.

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:48.981
So the takeaway message here
is that local low frequency

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.844
oscillatory synchrony
underlies rapid processing

00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:56.270
and can robustly index auditory
abilities in young infants.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.038
And recruitment of the left
hemisphere during rapid

00:10:59.038 --> 00:11:02.199
frequency change suggests a
difference in the spectral

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.155
and temporal resolution of the right

00:11:04.155 --> 00:11:07.329
and left hemispheres even
at this very early age.

00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:10.001
Moreover, we were able to predict behavior

00:11:10.001 --> 00:11:14.793
in a go/no-go task by looking
at oscillatory brainpower.

00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:17.441
So the question is, if we
can find deficits so early

00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:21.086
in life, can we alter them
using the exquisite plasticity

00:11:21.086 --> 00:11:23.769
typical of this early
developmental time period

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:27.550
while infants are setting
up their acoustic mapping?

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.439
Can we make the baby a better processor?

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.773
And can we see
intervention-specific changes

00:11:32.773 --> 00:11:35.351
in the brain waves and
oscillatory patterns

00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:37.930
that reflect enhanced processing?

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.618
So can we look for some causal mechanisms?

00:11:40.618 --> 00:11:42.140
And so we did a study.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.477
We did a couple of studies.

00:11:43.477 --> 00:11:45.680
And looking at plasticity
in developing brain

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.285
and seeing if active auditory
exposure would impact

00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:52.292
pre-linguistic acoustic mapping.

00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:54.497
And I'm gonna go through
this pretty quickly,

00:11:54.497 --> 00:11:57.059
but the paper's published if you need it.

00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:00.476
So we looked at the neural
correlates of acoustic mapping

00:12:00.476 --> 00:12:03.461
with dense array EEG/ERP
before and after a six week

00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:07.846
interactive progressive
acoustic experience.

00:12:07.846 --> 00:12:10.568
We used an operantly-conditioned
go/no-go active paradigm

00:12:10.568 --> 00:12:12.327
with an eye-tracking control

00:12:12.327 --> 00:12:16.494
so the baby could actually
manipulate the experiment.

00:12:18.145 --> 00:12:20.077
And we used a passive control

00:12:20.077 --> 00:12:22.927
and a naive maturation control.

00:12:22.927 --> 00:12:26.001
And here's the study designed
two longitudinal arms,

00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:28.918
one with active training,
one with passive training,

00:12:28.918 --> 00:12:32.656
And two, a cross-sectional
sample of children

00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:34.690
who were not trained.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.111
So what did they get
when they were trained?

00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:40.434
Once a week for six weeks
for six to eight minutes,

00:12:40.434 --> 00:12:43.024
the babies were trained on
three different types of paired

00:12:43.024 --> 00:12:47.467
stimuli, complex tones,
band-pass noise frequency sweeps

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:50.763
presented at varying ISIs
and varying complexities

00:12:50.763 --> 00:12:53.423
using an up-down staircase procedure.

00:12:53.423 --> 00:12:55.151
So if the baby got it
right, it got harder.

00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:57.496
If they got it wrong, it got easier.

00:12:57.496 --> 00:13:00.280
And so they went up and down
until they reached criterion.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.332
The passive group got the same stimuli,

00:13:02.332 --> 00:13:06.166
and the same time exposure,
but passive with no feedback

00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:08.715
and we didn't train the naive children.

00:13:08.715 --> 00:13:12.882
After they were trained, we
collected data on ERPs, EEG

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.019
that they had been trained
on, as well as different

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:20.950
types of generalization stimuli.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.117
So we looked at deviance with
spectral temporal parameters

00:13:27.087 --> 00:13:29.357
that significantly differed
from the training stimuli,

00:13:29.357 --> 00:13:31.572
one with a gap, one with
a differing duration,

00:13:31.572 --> 00:13:33.489
and one with frequency.

00:13:34.327 --> 00:13:35.205
So what did we see?

00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:36.999
Yes, this is a monster figure.

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:40.845
So we're not gonna talk about
the grand average waveforms.

00:13:40.845 --> 00:13:44.127
I'm going to just pull out
the information about these

00:13:44.127 --> 00:13:48.029
time-locked age-appropriate topograms to,

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:50.757
first of all this P2 peak.

00:13:50.757 --> 00:13:54.924
And this is a peak that happens
that's an attentional peak.

00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:59.236
And what we see here is around
each topogram if it has a red

00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:02.540
box, it means there was
significantly faster latencies.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.226
So the active group was
significantly faster than both

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:10.059
the passive and the naive
groups on this peak.

00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:14.314
And then we also were
interested in looking at

00:14:14.314 --> 00:14:16.943
what's called the N2 star,
and this is the change

00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:19.322
discrimination peak that
happens right before

00:14:19.322 --> 00:14:22.155
the baby discriminates the signal.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.113
And it's important because
it's been shown to be

00:14:28.113 --> 00:14:31.232
a robust infant predictor
of later language,

00:14:31.232 --> 00:14:35.483
So both of the auditory
groups, experience groups,

00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:38.089
were significantly faster
than the naive controls,

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:41.396
but the actives had a larger
amplitude compared to both

00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:45.563
other groups and showed a left
hemisphere lateralization.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.607
We then looked at the signals
that were a generalization

00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:57.594
stimuli, and what you can see
in these bar graphs is the

00:14:57.594 --> 00:14:59.366
mean latency of each deviant at each

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.591
of the nine electrode sites.

00:15:01.591 --> 00:15:04.641
For P1 that's the first
sensory peak that signals

00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:07.205
that a stimulus has been perceived.

00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:10.623
And what you can see here for
the gap, for the duration,

00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:14.413
and frequency, is the active
group was significantly

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:17.330
faster at all nine electrode sites.

00:15:18.777 --> 00:15:21.692
So we demonstrated that
while both active and passive

00:15:21.692 --> 00:15:26.551
acoustic experience from four
to seven months modulated

00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:29.498
non-speech stimuli, active
experience conferred

00:15:29.498 --> 00:15:33.412
a significant advantage, that
active experience increased

00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:37.217
attention to environmental
acoustic stimuli,

00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:40.230
and that faster latencies
were seen for the change

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.535
discrimination peak that
has been shown to be

00:15:42.535 --> 00:15:45.575
a robust infant predictor
of later language.

00:15:45.575 --> 00:15:48.059
Moreover, we saw
generalization to both trained

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:50.516
and untrained stimuli over and above

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:53.099
that seen for maturation alone.

00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:56.954
And do these intervention
effects generalize to language?

00:15:56.954 --> 00:16:00.203
I can just say yes, because I think we're

00:16:00.203 --> 00:16:01.556
just about at the end.

00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.827
But just let me show you this high gamma.

00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:07.051
At nine months we continued to
look at them longitudinally.

00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:10.088
And you can see that for the
actives you have this very high

00:16:10.088 --> 00:16:14.328
gamma input here which is a
prominent characteristic of

00:16:14.328 --> 00:16:18.119
early sensory processing and
may index cortical activation

00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:22.035
given larger high, but not
low gamma responses are

00:16:22.035 --> 00:16:25.476
correlated with increases
in overall firing rates

00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:29.059
particularly during
attentional modulation.

00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:32.215
And with that I'll show you our prototype

00:16:32.215 --> 00:16:36.382
that does the same intervention
in the baby's home.

00:16:38.644 --> 00:16:39.748
(applause)

00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:42.042
And that's the end, thank you.

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:44.292
(applause)

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:51.458
(techno music)

00:16:56.237 --> 00:16:58.820
(techno music)

00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:11.337
(techno music)

00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:19.853
