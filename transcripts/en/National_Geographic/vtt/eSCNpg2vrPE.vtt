00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.266
PRESENTER: Visiting
Jordan's Wadi Rum

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.467
desert, with a Bedouin guide.

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.834
Two hours off the
Great Desert Highway,

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:11.600
leave the last signs of life
back at the village of Rum.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:18.433
Say "No, thank you" to the
hotel and the luxury tent,

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.300
with its beds,
cushions, and plumbing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.467
Your Bedouin make camp at the
base of a layered desert bluff.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.600
Dress for the cool air.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.166
Wrap your head in a checkered,
red-and-white keffiyeh.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.834
Help with dinner,
grilling chicken

00:00:57.834 --> 00:00:58.633
and eating with your hands.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:13.667
Have a glass of tea as sweet
as candy, sitting on rugs

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.800
and conversing until
the fire is gone.

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:27.033
The Bedouin have
lived and wandered

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:30.667
this desert with their animal
herds for thousands of years.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.400
For the true
wilderness of Wadi Rum,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.467
sleep outside in the vast
vacancy of the world.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
Let your eyes take
in the midnight sky,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.567
as the colossal cosmos
comes into focus.
