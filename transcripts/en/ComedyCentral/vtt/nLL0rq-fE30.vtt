- Guys, before we
start not working,

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.508
I've been ordered by
Human Resources to give

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.944
an orientation on
sexual harassment.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.278
(Christine groans)

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.180
- Damn it, Lyle, did
you tell the day shift

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.281
you got molested again?

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.550
- I felt a tingling in my sleep.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.652
- You just have
poor circulation.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.554
- Wish my ass got molested.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.657
Last time a man touched me
it involved a Greyhound bus

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.093
breaking down and a shoehorn.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.862
Use your imagination.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:34.334
He put the shoehorn in my pussy.

- It could be good, guys.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.655 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe I can finally find out
what Fallopian tubes are.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.091
I think it's british for trains.

- There's a way to be
friendly and professional.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.129 align:start size:88% position:13%
HR wants me to
demonstrate appropriate

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.764
workplace conversation.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.332
Here we go.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hey, Christine,
how's your day going?

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.237 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Oh, you know,
here so, not good.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.273
(chuckles)

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.941
- Sounds zany.

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:18.812 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, ez equals, do you
still not wanna come over

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.214
and watch Showgirls with me?

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.549
I got dip.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.783
- No.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:24.851
- Is it 'cause you're
afraid to get hurt?

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.052
- No.

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.287 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you anxious
'cause you have a kid

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.755 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you're nervous I'd
think that's gross?

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.589
- No.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:30.523
- Is it you not me?

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.058
- It's you.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.861
- I was joking when I asked
if you had an OxyContin guy.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.796
- You ain't got game for shit!

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.032 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Hey, can't you just be one
of those fun black ladies

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.034
that helps me get
my groove back?

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.636 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Girl from Tuesday not
returning your phone calls?

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.171
- Yeah.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.307 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Same one who gave you
an over-the-pants hand job

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.808
at Dave and Buster's?

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.144
- Had a grip like a worker elf

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
and her hair
smelled like autumn.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.083
- Uh, Richie?

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.586 align:start position:0%
- Hey, when I stare
dramatically into the distance,

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.188 align:start size:97% position:3%
you let me stare dramatically
into the distance!

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.423
That's Richie's time!

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.391
(upbeat tune)

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.227
Now we're gonna find
out what's a good touch

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.928
and what's a bad touch.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.830
Elmer, get up here.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.198
Touch him.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:13.066
- [Lyle] Bad touch.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.501
- How Lyle?

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.437 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Some people erogenous zones
are in their upper body.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.406
- Thank you, Lyle, for another
terrible episode of Real Sex.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.241
Anita?

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.643
- Bad touch.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.145
- Good touch.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.913 align:start size:97% position:3%
If it's a girl doing it it's
not wrong, it's just hot.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:30.150 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Anybody got any melted
butter and semitones?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.553 align:start size:97% position:3%
Last motherfucker who hit
this shit was J. D. Salinger.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:34.587
- For once,

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:37.824
for once can we be appropriate?

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.326
You're all unprofessional, rude,

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.729
and honestly you smell awful.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.598
I know that doesn't have
to do with the other two,

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.368
but I felt I really
needed to say it.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.202
- She's right.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.436
- Thank you.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.938 align:start size:88% position:13%
- If you guys wanna
sexually harass someone,

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:54.574
you do it on the subway
like a normal person.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.542
- Mhm.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.344
- I guess that's progress.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.280
(fan clunks on)

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.848
- Oh, I just got molested again.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.349
- It was the fan, Lyle.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.651
- That's what that was?

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.352
(laughing)

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.187
Oh, man.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.657
And those rides my
next door neighbor

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.326 align:start size:97% position:3%
Terry gave me in fifth grade
where he hid the Tic Tac

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.595 align:start size:94% position:6%
somewhere in his pocket
but I could never find it,

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.931
that was the fan too, right?

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.267
- Uh, yeah.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:25.572
- Won't be needing
this whistle no more.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:28.241
(whistle blows)

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:36.416
- I know that this whistle is
primarily used to stop rape,

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.851
but that was pretty
close to chumbawamba.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.287
♪ We got it made

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:45.458
♪ Yeah, nothing's
gonna get us down

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:50.430
♪ Everything's perfect
