Tomas you asked a very controversial

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:05.900
Tomas you asked a very controversial
 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.750
Tomas you asked a very controversial
question the question is can we download

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760
question the question is can we download
 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.780
question the question is can we download
our consciousness into a chip and have

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790
our consciousness into a chip and have
 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.760
our consciousness into a chip and have
that chip being stored into a computer

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770
that chip being stored into a computer
 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.100
that chip being stored into a computer
and basically have our personalities

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110
and basically have our personalities
 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.220
and basically have our personalities
lasts forever we would be immortal well

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230
lasts forever we would be immortal well
 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.019
lasts forever we would be immortal well
first of all that raises a question who

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029
first of all that raises a question who
 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.040
first of all that raises a question who
are we anyway if I have a tape recorder

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050
are we anyway if I have a tape recorder
 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.359
are we anyway if I have a tape recorder
that has a little bit of intelligence

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369
that has a little bit of intelligence
 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.210
that has a little bit of intelligence
and it begins to answer questions the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220
and it begins to answer questions the
 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.579
and it begins to answer questions the
way I would answer questions and i'm

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589
way I would answer questions and i'm
 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.260
way I would answer questions and i'm
sitting here with that tape recorder is

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270
sitting here with that tape recorder is
 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.930
sitting here with that tape recorder is
that really me what happens if that tape

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940
that really me what happens if that tape
 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.490
that really me what happens if that tape
recorder becomes increasingly more

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500
recorder becomes increasingly more
 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.040
recorder becomes increasingly more
sophisticated and can begin to pick up

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050
sophisticated and can begin to pick up
 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.220
sophisticated and can begin to pick up
nuances of my personality here i am i am

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230
nuances of my personality here i am i am
 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.680
nuances of my personality here i am i am
me but here i am sitting next to this

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690
me but here i am sitting next to this
 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.529
me but here i am sitting next to this
tape recorder which sounds like me has

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539
tape recorder which sounds like me has
 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.720
tape recorder which sounds like me has
all the interpretations and nuances of

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730
all the interpretations and nuances of
 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.439
all the interpretations and nuances of
me but it's not really me at all or is

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449
me but it's not really me at all or is
 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.709
me but it's not really me at all or is
it are we nothing but a bunch of neurons

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719
it are we nothing but a bunch of neurons
 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.660
it are we nothing but a bunch of neurons
with a certain programming in a certain

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670
with a certain programming in a certain
 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.910
with a certain programming in a certain
code well first of all you asked for a

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920
code well first of all you asked for a
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.220
code well first of all you asked for a
timeline I personally think that this is

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230
timeline I personally think that this is
 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.990
timeline I personally think that this is
going to take a lot longer than we

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000
going to take a lot longer than we
 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.649
going to take a lot longer than we
expect simply because our brain

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659
expect simply because our brain
 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.240
expect simply because our brain
architecture and the way we deal with

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250
architecture and the way we deal with
 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.039
architecture and the way we deal with
situations is different from a digital

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049
situations is different from a digital
 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.679
situations is different from a digital
computer computers we have today are

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689
computer computers we have today are
 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.950
computer computers we have today are
digital they compute in zeros in one

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960
digital they compute in zeros in one
 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.560
digital they compute in zeros in one
they have subroutines they have

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570
they have subroutines they have
 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.660
they have subroutines they have
programming they have software they have

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670
programming they have software they have
 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.690
programming they have software they have
an operating system they have a CPU our

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700
an operating system they have a CPU our
 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.350
an operating system they have a CPU our
brain has none of these things our brain

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360
brain has none of these things our brain
 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.050
brain has none of these things our brain
has no cpu there's no programming

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060
has no cpu there's no programming
 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.630
has no cpu there's no programming
there's no windows software there are no

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640
there's no windows software there are no
 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.359
there's no windows software there are no
subroutines there's no programming at

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369
subroutines there's no programming at
 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.060
subroutines there's no programming at
all in our brain our brain is a learning

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070
all in our brain our brain is a learning
 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.539
all in our brain our brain is a learning
machine it encounters tasks and then

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549
machine it encounters tasks and then
 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.660
machine it encounters tasks and then
learns how to overcome these tasks one

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670
learns how to overcome these tasks one
 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.910
learns how to overcome these tasks one
by one so that's going to be the basic

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920
by one so that's going to be the basic
 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.029
by one so that's going to be the basic
problem simply digitalizing information

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039
problem simply digitalizing information
 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.240
problem simply digitalizing information
that's easy we can simply scan

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250
that's easy we can simply scan
 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.980
that's easy we can simply scan
information into a computer but you see

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
information into a computer but you see
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.459
information into a computer but you see
our brains learn we learn to adapt new

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469
our brains learn we learn to adapt new
 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.370
our brains learn we learn to adapt new
ideas we begin to learn new tasks and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380
ideas we begin to learn new tasks and
 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.800
ideas we begin to learn new tasks and
new and new things and that's going to

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810
new and new things and that's going to
 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.749
new and new things and that's going to
be a lot more difficult to replicate by

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759
be a lot more difficult to replicate by
 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.850
be a lot more difficult to replicate by
computer so I personally don't think

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860
computer so I personally don't think
 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.180
computer so I personally don't think
we're going to see that in our lifetime

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
we're going to see that in our lifetime
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.250
we're going to see that in our lifetime
