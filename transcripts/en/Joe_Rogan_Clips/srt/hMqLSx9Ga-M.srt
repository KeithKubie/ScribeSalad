1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,070
What do you think you're
going to do when you retire?

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,100
I don't know yet. You don't think about
at all? I do think about it. Um, the,

3
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:16,880
the main thing is make sure that before
I'm retired and my kids are set for life,

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,600
went through universities or at
their houses, all that stuff.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,140
That's number one goal. Then
when I retire, I don't know,

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,310
I got a lot of options I could do,
you know,

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,050
I'm going to see which one
I'm going to like the most,

8
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:30,920
cause whatever I'm going to do. Obviously
nothing I love as much as fighting.

9
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:34,300
Nothing will make me wake up at six
in the morning to go fucking run.

10
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,910
No nothing I'll have that love me.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,630
When you asked about the longevity's
just cause I love it so much,

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,290
I don't have to work for it. I
just, I love it. I love what I do.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,600
Even hitting the bag for 35,

14
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:47,210
40 minutes sometimes it's so
fucking boring and monotonous.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
If I've got the right music going on, I
mean a little bit of water. Let's do it.

16
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:53,870
You know, I'm gonna have fun
doing it. You know? So, uh,

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,900
I got to just find something that my
heart is solely in and I'm having fun.

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,220
I still haven't figured out what that
is. You know, maybe skiing, you know,

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,930
every time I go skiing, the skews are
trying to recruit me. They're like, Oh,

20
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:06,764
who is this guy?

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,180
We need this guy over here and our team
to maybe scheme and that she gets my

22
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:14,210
blood pumping. You know? Really. You
like skiing? I love it man. I hate it.

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,690
I love that she was worried about
falling to, that's your problem.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,850
That is my problem.
Fucking snowmen and is going to happen.

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,480
You've been kicked in the head.
You've been [inaudible] forever.

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,350
Had their fucking ACL torn apart.
I've already had two knee reconstructions.

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,350
So when I go down the hill, I'm
like, don't get hurt. Don't get hurt,

28
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:33,590
don't get hurt. Didn't get hurt. That's,
that's so crazy how I'm bringing thing,

29
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,980
cause I'm thinking there's no way I
can get hurt when I'm on those things.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,070
I'm just fucking going as fast as I
can. Oh, you're one of those guys. Yeah.

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,690
There's no way I could get
hurt. It's fucking snow. You
could definitely get hurt.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,553
Yeah,
definitely.

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I've had fucking now while I was
standing still like pass my fridge.

34
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:51,630
Hey,

35
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,240
slow down to to say what's up and just
like some seven year old man Dean and see

36
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,230
that I'm starting up moving here and just
fucking loud plow mean to the kneecaps.

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,570
Good thing. There's somewhat
flexible, nothing torn, nothing.

38
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,500
It was like a good hit. Do you know, like
a good little low kick outta nowhere.

39
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,380
You know, I worry about that
with my kids some clodhopper oh,

40
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,900
but if they start young though to
forget about. Oh yeah, no, they're good.

41
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,010
They're already doing black diamonds.
Oh, fuckers. Yeah. Yeah. But they, they,

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,980
they're so low to the ground.
They're tiny.

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,220
The little skis and shit had no fear
that age easier once they are already

44
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,500
funding in once or twice.
Like, Oh dad, it's just snow.

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,150
I watch some of those fucking men going
down those hills though. Oh, just shush.

46
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,860
Shush. When they like, when they drop
them off in the helicopter. Oh my God. Oh,

47
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:39,070
that's ridiculous. I watched a
video the other night of, uh,

48
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,920
a guy went down this mountain that
no one's ever skied down before.

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,360
They dropped him off at the top and he
had to climb the first couple of feet

50
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:50,570
down with the skis on before he
got to this open shoot. I was like,

51
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,900
what in the fuck are you doing? He's
climbing. Like you can't just ski.

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,670
There's rocks everywhere and shit. That's
great. Fuck you. I blows my mind. Yeah,

53
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:02,880
go get better. Hobby is ridiculous.
Sliding down a mountain.

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,650
I might end up in there one day.
Nothing in no time soon.

55
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:10,590
Cause those guys are a lifetime of
skill. But I wouldn't, I wouldn't, uh,

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,681
take it off.
You know,

57
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:15,640
like I'd love to ski one of those crazy
mountains that are just fucking super

58
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,410
duper steep and just rebut.
You know,

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,470
one thing about skiing is you
could do it when you're old. Yeah.

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,110
Cause this lady who was
teaching my daughter,

61
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,410
she was giving my daughter
lessons at the ski play.

62
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:29,290
She was like deep into her sixties
and she's skiing great. Wasn't it?

63
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,570
Got Technique technique. You know,
they probably grew up in the snow.

64
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,400
I started skiing when I was like 30,
you know,

65
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:37,060
so I got a lot of catching up
to do. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh,

66
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,840
I just know to my Ari,
my friend Ari,

67
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:44,350
he broke his wrist last year and
he broke his ankle two years ago.

68
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,270
He's always fucking himself up. He's that
guy. Balls to the wall. I don't know.

69
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,530
He probably has done mushrooms. The
that's a good time to ski, man. Fucking,

70
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:57,190
that's the best sentence. I know a couple
people that have done it on mushrooms.

71
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,510
They say ski. Really?
Yeah. You like it. Oh,

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,530
what's the best thing about
skiing on mushrooms? Well,

73
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:06,320
it could go both ways because it fucks
up your depth perception. You know,

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,240
they don't know where the trees are.
So the first time I did it,

75
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,780
I was like super grandma. You know, like
everybody's like, what's wrong with him?

76
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,251
Like, no, no, no, no.

77
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:19,180
Just leave me the fuck alone because
the snow is all the same too. Right.

78
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,090
So now it just fucks.
Are you depth perception so bad?

79
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:25,480
You could see the divots
in the snow books.

80
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,380
Everything gets pixelated, right? Yeah.
And you are really tripping hard then.

81
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,280
Oh man,

82
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,670
everything is like the same and I can't
really see the bumps and then I don't

83
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,630
see the bumps. I just feed him and
not whoa, Whoa, whoa. All right,

84
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,710
I'm going to need a tough this
one out and let's do it. You know?

85
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,830
And then the next time
I did at the letter,

86
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,950
literally less of a dosage had a
blast, you know? Yeah. They say it's a,

87
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,120
it's a micro dose thing. Yes. Just
like don't take like three grams,

88
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:53,050
take like a half a gram. Yeah. Something
like that. But the first time I was,

89
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,940
I was doing the Bro Science
and it was like, oh yeah.

90
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,590
I think it's like for grabs is cool man,

91
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,310
let's go on a fat and
I'm like a slight fast,

92
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,460
you know the problem with it that
the vision thing when things,

93
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,970
when you do the mushrooms and things
get pixelated where you see like almost

94
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:09,790
like a matrix around you.
Yeah.

95
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,830
I would imagine that that
would fuck you up skiing.

96
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,440
You wouldn't be able to see all
the creases in the snow and shit.

97
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,420
And then you just feel it.
All of a sudden you're like,

98
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,870
what the fuck have you ever snowboard?
I did it for like half a day.

99
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:24,220
That was pretty cool. But I, uh, I used to
ski like inline, like in a park, you know,

100
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,680
like on ramps, on half
pipes. Rollerblade yeah.

101
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,850
So I could like jump on
rails and halfpipes and uh,

102
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,050
I could even do like a front flip on my
skates. But this one, I was like 13, 14.

103
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,410
Yeah. So skiing came very easy to
meet and snowboarding that so much.

104
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:41,800
Cause I didn't skateboard when I
was a kid. I skateboarded as a kid,

105
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,310
but I've never snowboarded but uh,
the people that do it,

106
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,640
they say it's easier to get better at
snowboarding than it is to get better at

107
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:52,780
skiing. I said it's like, it's hard
in the beginning, but once you get it,

108
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:56,620
it's easier to get better at. Oh,
okay. But when you fall a lot,

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,780
a latitudes fall, this, the
snowboard goes up in the air,

110
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,030
you're feet are stuck on it and
land right in your fucking head.

111
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,570
A lot of people get knocked the fuck
out because you can't move your legs

112
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:09,230
individually like you can if your skin
and you land on the tailbone a lot to a

113
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:12,800
lot of people tell me. Yeah, and if
you're skiing and you land funky,

114
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:16,010
the ski snapped loose and you
can move your legs around.

115
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,120
Board is shoved in there. Yeah,
he's trapped in the snowboard.

116
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,060
Is this shit too that people go to the
trees like fucking silver surfer. Ah,

117
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,820
that's fun man. Yeah, but that's not rush.

118
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,910
This low and down part
with those seems different,

119
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,540
like less options to slow down.
I love all that shit.

120
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,170
Anything he gets my heart pumping,
do a skydive or anything crazy like that.

121
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,840
I haven't done the sky diving
because I'm afraid of the law.

122
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,610
I've heard bad stories about the landing,

123
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:42,960
how you are with the scheme that you
got a couple buddies. He got hurt.

124
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,230
I got a couple of buddies that got in her
on the landing of skydiving. I'm like,

125
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,420
I can't do that. I'm fighting. So
she loved them fighting. Whew. Yeah.
