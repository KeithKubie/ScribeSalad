00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.670
Build your own alternative
to Twitter Bootstrap,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.790
and David DeSandro teaches
you physics in five minutes.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.750
I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.920
This is LazyWeb.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.700
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.480
What are the benefits of
designing your own component

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.180
sets?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.300
Alex Sexton covers the virtues
of building your own UI library

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.100
instead of using the de
facto, Twitter Bootstrap.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.140
The talk explores tools like
rework and suit for CSS,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.620
and clever techniques
for unit testing UIs

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.130
without requiring
Selenium's WebDriver.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.380
If you're a UI developer,
you're guaranteed

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.460
to learn something new.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.220
David DeSandro demystifies
the power of physics

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.240
by building a simple carousel.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.690
Using basic functions
for velocity, friction,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.080
and acceleration,
DeSandro demonstrates

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.030
how we can make simple
objects on screen emulate what

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.840
our crazy monkey paws are
used to from the real world.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.450
At a little over
five minutes, it's

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.000
an easy primer for anyone
interested in building

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.650
lifelike animations.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.670
David East gives an
early look and crash

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.820
course in Angular 2 Forms.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.129
The talk covers the basics
of working with Angular 2,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.520
and explains how to the
write controls and validators

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.430
as building blocks for Forms.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.980
It also delves into the
topic of writing quick DOM

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.420
independent tests.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.410
There's a live coding
tutorial at the end

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.000
if you want to bust out your
Text Editor and follow along.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.230
Notifying you of changes
to Notifications.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.320
Push notifications are getting
more powerful with the ability

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.490
to associate a data object
with a notification,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.500
and the new Get Notifications
method which allows developers

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.570
to collapse a list
of notifications

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.941
into a single unread
messages item.

00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:36.940
To find out more about
changes to Notifications,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.590
you can check out this
article by Matt Gaunt

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.170
over on HTML5 Rocks.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.020
Umaar Hansa demonstrates a cool
new feature of the Chrome Dev

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.280
Tools that lets you preview the
value of JavaScript variables

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.770
in line as you debug.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.605
The feature works
with minified scripts,

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:56.250
if you pretty print them, and
is available in Chrome Stable.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.450

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.710
That's it for this week, folks.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.540
Take a deep breath,
enjoy the visuals.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.040
And to all you lazy webbers
out there, thanks for watching.
