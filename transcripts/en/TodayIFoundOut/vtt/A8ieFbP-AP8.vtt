00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.720
According to an 1894 researched report, the
earliest effort to create any sort of post

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.281
office in the colonies was in 1639 by the
Massachusetts General Court when a tavern

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.650
in Boston owned by Richard Fairbanks was designated
to be the first post office.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.320
This was in keeping with the European tradition
of coffee houses and taverns being mailing

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320
centers.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.880
The first post messenger may have started
in 1672 or 1673 with instructions to “behave

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.120
civilly” and to mark trees so other travelers
would know where they are going.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.360
Around that same time, a monthly mail route
was set up between New York and Boston.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.390
It became known as the Old Boston Post Road,
which is still part of today’s US Route

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.390
1.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.200
It was two decades later when the King and
Queen of England granted Thomas Neal – a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.490
man who lived in England and had never been
to the colonies – a 21-year grant to establish

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.880
offices that received and dispatched letters
and to set postal rates.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.110
This created a centralized postal organization
that helped foster a more efficient means

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.650
of correspondence between colonies and to
encourage trade and commerce.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.200
In 1707, the British crown bought out the
grant and brought the system under their control.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.030
By the 1730s, the colonies’ postal system
was pretty well-established.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.010
Mail carriers from Maine to Georgia (in the
South, often slaves) trudge across the rapidly

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.140
expanding American land to deliver letters,
correspondence and contracts.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.350
The position of postmaster had become a posh,
but important one.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.369
They were in charge of the postal rates, the
exact routes taken by carriers and the locations

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.369
of post offices.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.670
In addition, each city had its own postmaster,
which carried out many of the same responsibilities

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.710
as the postmaster general but on a regional
basis.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.439
In 1737, a young 31-year old publisher, printer
and well-known civic leader was appointed

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.530
to be the postmaster of Philadelphia, then
one of the most populous cities in the colonies.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.770
His name was Benjamin Franklin.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.659
For 16 years, Franklin used his influence
and power as the city’s postmaster general

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.920
to increase the circulation of his Pennsylvania
Gazette by decreasing newspaper mailing rates.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.189
While this certainly does seem like a conflict
of interest, this practice was actually encouraged.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.250
In 1753, when the postmaster died from a long-standing
illness, Franklin was promoted to be the joint

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.989
postmaster general – along with William
Hunter from Williamsburg – for all the colonies.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.780
In that position, Franklin helped modernized
the post office.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.629
His first order of business was to set out
on a long tour in order to inspect the post

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.950
offices and survey the routes used.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.530
He concluded that more efficient routes needed
to be taken, so he oversaw the marking and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.980
laying out of these new roads.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.150
Next, he put in place night service between
Philadelphia and New York to improve the speed

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.150
of mail delivery.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.819
Then, he installed a standardized system of
postal rates based on weight and distance

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.819
of delivery.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.989
He also created a regular schedule for mail
by boat from the colonies to the homeland

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:45.989
of England.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.269
By 1760, and for the first time in over a
century of operating, the colonies’ post

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.050
office turned a profit for the British crown.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.490
However, as the clouds of revolution approached,
it became clear where Franklin’s allegiances

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.180
laid – with the colonies.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.379
Despite Franklin’s considerable and notable
work for England, he was dismissed in 1774

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.780
as postmaster general for being a colonial
sympathizer.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.240
Franklin’s career being in charge of mail
wasn’t over, however.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.300
Within weeks of the Battles of Lexington and
Concord setting off the American Revolution,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.720
the Second Continental Congress met and Pennsylvania’s
representative was Franklin.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.370
At the time, William Goddard was running the
Constitutional Post, a mail service financed

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.970
by newspaper subscribers.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.700
The main purpose was to disseminate information
about the rebellion and to connect Congress

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.700
to the armies.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.379
Because of this, mail carriers had to swear
to secure their missives under lock and key

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.590
in case the British attempted to take them.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.650
In July 1775, citing his experience, Franklin
was named the Postmaster General of the Constitutional

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.650
Post.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.269
Since he was in that position when the Declaration
of Independence was written, he earns the

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.930
distinction of being the first Postmaster
General in US history.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.620
However, he would resign in November of that
year in order to become a delegate to Paris

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.730
to gain their support for the war.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.520
Six years later, the Articles of Confederation
gave the federal government the right to establish

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.310
and regulate post offices.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.909
Revisions and ordinances continued to add
shape to the post office’s duties, restrictions

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.060
and rules, including one that said the federal
government had a monopoly on delivering the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.060
mail.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.020
The Constitution – officially ratified in
June 1788 – gave many of the same powers

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.520
to the post office that the AOC did.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.870
By 1790, a United States population of almost
four million was served by 75 Post Offices

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.390
and approximately 2,400 miles of post roads.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.120
Two years later, in 1792, America’s first
president signed the Postal Service Act, creating

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.710
the modern United States Postal Service.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:55.249
And the rest, as they say, is history.
