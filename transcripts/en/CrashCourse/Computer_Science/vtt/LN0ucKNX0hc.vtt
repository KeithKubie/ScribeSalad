00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.040
Our last episode brought us to the start of
the 20th century, where early, special purpose

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.760
computing devices, like tabulating machines,
were a huge boon to governments and business

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.509
- aiding, and sometimes replacing, rote manual
tasks. But the scale of human systems continued

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.910
to increase at an unprecedented rate.
The first half of the 20th century saw the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.030
world’s population almost double. World
War 1 mobilized 70 million people, and World

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.770
War 2 involved more than 100 million.
Global trade and transit networks became interconnected

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.360
like never before, and the sophistication
of our engineering and scientific endeavors

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.090
reached new heights – we even started to
seriously consider visiting other planets.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.900
And it was this explosion of complexity, bureaucracy,
and ultimately data, that drove an increasing

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.940
need for automation and computation. Soon those cabinet-sized electro-mechanical

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.120
computers grew into room-sized behemoths that
were expensive to maintain and prone to errors.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.520
And it was these machines that would set the
stage for future innovation.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:04.600
INTRO

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.700
One of the largest electro-mechanical computers

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.360
built was the Harvard Mark I, completed in
1944 by IBM for the Allies during World War 2.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.240
It contained 765,000 components, three
million connections, and five hundred miles of wire.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.640
To keep its internal mechanics synchronized,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.360
it used a 50-foot shaft running right through
the machine driven by a five horsepower motor.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.640
One of the earliest uses for this technology
was running simulations for the Manhattan Project.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.320
The brains of these huge electro-mechanical

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.500
beasts were relays: electrically-controlled
mechanical switches. In a relay, there is

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.330
a control wire that determines whether a circuit
is opened or closed. The control wire connects

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.390
to a coil of wire inside the relay. When current
flows through the coil, an electromagnetic

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.760
field is created, which in turn, attracts
a metal arm inside the relay, snapping it

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.130
shut and completing the circuit. You can think
of a relay like a water faucet. The control

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.760
wire is like the faucet handle. Open the faucet,
and water flows through the pipe. Close the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480
faucet, and the flow of water stops.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.520
Relays are doing the same thing, just with

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.850
electrons instead of water. The controlled
circuit can then connect to other circuits,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.020
or to something like a motor, which might
increment a count on a gear, like in Hollerith's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.450
tabulating machine we talked about last episode.
Unfortunately, the mechanical arm inside of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.950
a relay *has mass*, and therefore can’t
move instantly between opened and closed states.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.700
A good relay in the 1940’s might be able
to flick back and forth fifty times in a second.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.300
That might seem pretty fast, but it’s not
fast enough to be useful at solving large,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.160
complex problems.
The Harvard Mark I could do 3 additions or

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.600
subtractions per second; multiplications took
6 seconds, and divisions took 15.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.180
And more complex operations, like a trigonometric function, could take over a minute.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.750
In addition to slow switching speed, another
limitation was wear and tear. Anything mechanical

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.820
that moves will wear over time. Some things
break entirely, and other things start getting

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.660
sticky, slow, and just plain unreliable.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.320
And as the number of relays increases, the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.940
probability of a failure increases too. The
Harvard Mark I had roughly 3500 relays. Even

00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:06.959
if you assume a relay has an operational life
of 10 years, this would mean you’d have

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.810
to replace, on average, one faulty relay every
day! That’s a big problem when you are in

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.400
the middle of running some important, multi-day
calculation.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.030
And that’s not all engineers had to contend
with. These huge, dark, and warm machines

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.200
also attracted insects. In September 1947,
operators on the Harvard Mark II pulled a

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.280
dead moth from a malfunctioning relay. Grace Hopper who we’ll talk more about in a later episode noted,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.020
“From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.700
we said it had bugs in it.”

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.510
And that’s where
we get the term computer bug.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.180
It was clear that a faster, more reliable
alternative to electro-mechanical relays was

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.810
needed if computing was going to advance further,
and fortunately that alternative already existed!

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.070
In 1904, English physicist John Ambrose Fleming
developed a new electrical component called

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.230
a thermionic valve, which housed two electrodes
inside an airtight glass bulb - this was the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.920
first vacuum tube. One of the electrodes could
be heated, which would cause it to emit electrons

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.159
– a process called thermionic emission.
The other electrode could then attract these

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.069
electrons to create the flow of our electric
faucet, but only if it was positively charged

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.099
- if it had a negative or neutral charge,
the electrons would no longer be attracted

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.560
across the vacuum so no current would flow.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.700
An electronic component that permits the one-way

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.560
flow of current is called a diode, but what
was really needed was a switch to help turn

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.110
this flow on and off. Luckily, shortly after,
in 1906, American inventor Lee de Forest added

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.560
a third “control” electrode that sits
between the two electrodes in Fleming’s design.

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.960
By applying a positive charge to the
control electrode, it would permit the flow

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.580
of electrons as before. But if the control
electrode was given a negative charge, it

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.680
would prevent the flow of electrons.
So by manipulating the control wire, one could

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.819
open or close the circuit. It’s pretty much
the same thing as a relay - but importantly,

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.830
vacuum tubes have no moving parts. This meant
there was less wear, and more importantly,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.319
they could switch thousands of times per second.
These triode vacuum tubes would become the

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.740
basis of radio, long distance telephone, and
many other electronic devices for nearly a

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.220
half century. I should note here that vacuum
tubes weren’t perfect - they’re kind of

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.440
fragile, and can burn out like light bulbs,
they were a big improvement over mechanical relays.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.220
Also, initially vacuum tubes were expensive

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.440
– a radio set often used just one, but a
computer might require hundreds or thousands of electrical switches.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.980
But by the 1940s,
their cost and reliability had improved to

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.449
the point where they became feasible for use
in computers…. at least by people with deep

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.990
pockets, like governments.
This marked the shift from electro-mechanical

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.849
computing to electronic computing. Let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.700
The first large-scale use of vacuum tubes
for computing was the Colossus Mk 1 designed

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.349
by engineer Tommy Flowers and completed in
December of 1943. The Colossus was installed

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.370
at Bletchley Park, in the UK, and helped to
decrypt Nazi communications.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.210
This may sound familiar because two years
prior Alan Turing, often called the father

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.629
of computer science, had created an electromechanical
device, also at Bletchley Park, called the

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:04.219
Bombe. It was an electromechanical machine
designed to break Nazi Enigma codes, but the

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.199
Bombe wasn’t technically a computer, and
we’ll get to Alan Turing’s contributions

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.960
later.
Anyway, the first version of Colossus contained

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.240
1,600 vacuum tubes, and in total, ten Colossi
were built to help with code-breaking.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.740
Colossus is regarded as the first programmable, electronic computer.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.179
Programming was done by plugging hundreds
of wires into plugboards, sort of like old

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:29.879
school telephone switchboards, in order to
set up the computer to perform the right operations.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.349
So while “programmable”, it still had
to be configured to perform a specific computation.

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.340
Enter the The Electronic Numerical Integrator
and Calculator – or ENIAC – completed

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.320
a few years later in 1946 at the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.520
Designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, this was the world's first truly general purpose,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.620
programmable, electronic computer.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.080
ENIAC could perform 5000 ten-digit additions
or subtractions per second, many, many times

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.080
faster than any machine that came before it.
It was operational for ten years, and is estimated

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.139
to have done more arithmetic than the entire
human race up to that point.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.669
But with that many vacuum tubes failures were
common, and ENIAC was generally only operational

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.360
for about half a day at a time before breaking
down.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.800
Thanks Thought Bubble. By the 1950’s, even
vacuum-tube-based computing was reaching its limits.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.520
The US Air Force’s AN/FSQ-7 computer,
which was completed in 1955, was part of the

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.360
“SAGE” air defense computer system we’ll
talk more about in a later episode.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.270
To reduce cost and size, as well as improve
reliability and speed, a radical new electronic

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.560
switch would be needed. In 1947, Bell Laboratory
scientists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.120
and William Shockley invented the transistor,
and with it, a whole new era of computing was born!

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.380
The physics behind transistors is
pretty complex, relying on quantum mechanics,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.740
so we’re going to stick to the basics.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.000
A transistor is just like a relay or vacuum
tube - it’s a switch that can be opened

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:00.520
or closed by applying electrical power via
a control wire. Typically, transistors have

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.569
two electrodes separated by a material that
sometimes can conduct electricity, and other

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:10.280
times resist it – a semiconductor.
In this case, the control wire attaches to

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.220
a “gate” electrode. By changing the electrical
charge of the gate, the conductivity of the

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.260
semiconducting material can be manipulated,
allowing current to flow or be stopped – like

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.500
the water faucet analogy we discussed earlier.
Even the very first transistor at Bell Labs

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.160
showed tremendous promise – it could switch
between on and off states 10,000 times per second.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.500
Further, unlike vacuum tubes made
of glass and with carefully suspended, fragile

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.260
components, transistors were solid material known as a solid state component.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.820
Almost immediately, transistors could be made smaller than the smallest possible relays or vacuum tubes.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.040
This led to dramatically smaller and cheaper computers, like the IBM 608, released in 1957

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.380
– the first fully transistor-powered, commercially-available computer.

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:59.300
It contained 3000 transistors and
could perform 4,500 additions, or roughly

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.420
80 multiplications or divisions, every second.
IBM soon transitioned all of its computing

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.240
products to transistors, bringing transistor-based
computers into offices, and eventually, homes.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.900
Today, computers use transistors that are
smaller than 50 nanometers in size – for

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.140
reference, a sheet of paper is roughly 100,000
nanometers thick. And they’re not only incredibly

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:27.000
small, they’re super fast – they can switch
states millions of times per second, and can run for decades.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.620
A lot of this transistor and semiconductor development happened in the Santa Clara  Valley,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.380
between San Francisco and San Jose, California.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.511
As the most common material used
to create semiconductors is silicon, this

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:43.150
region soon became known as Silicon Valley.
Even William Shockley moved there, founding

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.200
Shockley Semiconductor, whose employees later
founded

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.509
Fairchild Semiconductors, whose employees
later founded

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:52.660
Intel - the world’s largest computer chip
maker today.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.680
Ok, so we’ve gone from relays to vacuum
tubes to transistors. We can turn electricity

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.440
on and off really, really, really fast. But
how do we get from transistors to actually

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.400
computing something, especially if we don’t
have motors and gears?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.140
That’s what we’re going to cover over
the next few episodes.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.760
Thanks for watching. See you next week.
