00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.570
To display a map in D3 you do not theoretically have to

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.380
do anything much different from when we displayed points in a scatterplot.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.000
We simply need to convert from some data representation to a screen

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.250
representation, or rather go from the domain of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.000
our data to some range of pixels to draw on the web page.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.230
In the scatter plot we went from years, represented as a date, and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.480
attendance, represented as floats, to pixel values.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.490
Or rather, x coordinate and y coordinate on our chart.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.420
And for our map, we do exactly the same thing except this time we're

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
going from geographic coordinates to an associated pixel range.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.200
Or more specifically, we're going from a latitude and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.530
a longitude coordinate to pixel values.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.100
The latitude actually corresponds to the Y coordinate, and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.980
the longitude corresponds to the X coordinate.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.720
In the scatterplot we used D3's scale to go

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.959
from our data domain to our pixel range.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.110
And in a very analogous way.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.320
To convert our geographic coordinates to a pixel range we have

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.800
to use a projection, or more specifically in our case,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.680
we'll be using the Mercator projection.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.845
But let's take a second now and really understand what a projection is.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:27.490
Coordinate data that represents points on a sphere, or our case the globe,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.480
actually encodes information in three dimensions, and since the Earth,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.220
being a three dimensional object or a sphere, there is no perfect way to display

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.320
it on two-dimensional surface, such as a computer screen or a piece of paper.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.540
One approach that you could take, and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.760
is often used out there, is to simply render a globe or

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.780
a three-dimensional object in a webpage using three-dimensional graphics,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.810
but this has its own set of complexities in addition to the fact.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.150
You can usually only see one face of the globe at a time.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.840
The other, much more common approach is to use a projection,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.000
which actually has been done for centuries to draw maps on parchment or canvas.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.468
The act of projection can be thought of as cutting the surface off of a three

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:24.730
dimensional object, or globe, and trying to flatten it out into two dimensions.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.540
And there's never a perfect way to present something in greater dimensions in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.060
a lower dimension without some loss of information or distortion.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.530
So when you're going from a three dimensional globe to a two dimensional map

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.160
the question then becomes, where do we distort our map?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.410
And what's often done depends on the region of geographic interest.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.810
If you're only looking at countries on the equator,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.030
you want to try to best preserve the spatial representation around the equator.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.990
And you might be willing to distort near the poles.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.300
And the Mercator projection does just that.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.870
It decides to distort the least populated regions.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.520
More simply, regions near the poles.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.780
To imagine this projection, think of trying to flatten this globe out.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.520
And in order to get a square you stretch the areas near the poles so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.420
that the Earth can be represented by a rectangle.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.540
Which also has the effect of straightening out the latitude and longitude lines.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.370
So the Mercator projection sacrifices the poles to preserve countries and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.590
areas closer to the equator which have a much more

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.150
accurate representation in two dimensions.
