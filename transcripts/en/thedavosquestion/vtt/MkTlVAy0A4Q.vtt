Hi, Mark Turrell, CEO of Imaginatik and I'm
speaking to you here live from the World Economic

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.240
Summit Davos in China. I'm delighted to be
here. The question I've been asked for comments

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.359
is will China pull us out of the economic
crisis? I think that there's such a global

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.060
economy and we're so interconnected that there's
no one country that can actually pull us out

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.890
of any form of crisis. I think this is something
that we can join together sort of pull ourselves

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
down and we can join together sort of pull
ourselves up. But I think if one just looks

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.670
at getting out of the crisis in general, what
I'd really like to highlight and enforce is

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.390
that the real thing that helps to get out
of crisis and helps growing is innovation.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.859
So the need to systematically do things from
business processes, business models, new products,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.719
new technologies, just the creation of innovation
is that focus on innovation and I think that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.640
what is very important is that countries and
companies do not lose the focus in innovation

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.110
and continue to invest in innovation. I think
China is a good example of a country that

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.200
is really trying to be more and more innovative
and make more investments but at the same

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.659
time really, Europe and the United States
put a huge track record with innovation. So

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.430
I think then while trying to pull us out of
the economic crisis no not by itself, we all

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.439
have to pull ourselves out but the thing [inaudible].
Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:24.579
Thanks.
