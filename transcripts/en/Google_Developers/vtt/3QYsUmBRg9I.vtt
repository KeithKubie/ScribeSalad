00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
&gt;&gt; I’m here with Eye.fi. Could you please
introduce yourself?

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.180
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Hi, I’m Praj, I’m with Eye.fi.
We’re a small startup based in Mountain

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.010
View, California.
&gt;&gt; So, what do you guys do? What kind of parts

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.660
you guys make?
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: So, what we do at Eye.fi is amazing.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:29.610
We make this Eye.fi card and it automatically
transfers pictures from your camera to your

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.209
computer or web--web- sharing sites such as
Picasa or YouTube.

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:40.469
&gt;&gt; Well, have you implemented any of the Google
APIs?

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.699
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Yes, yes. We’ve been integrated
with Picasa Web. We’ve used the authentication

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:55.789
of APIs extensively and, at the same time,
creating albums and uploading pictures. And

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.739
I should say, the same with YouTube. We’ve
accomplished a great deal with YouTube as

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.000
well transferring movies from your camera
directly to your YouTube accounts.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.944
&gt;&gt; Great. I mean, can you tell us a little
bit about why you chose Informatix (ph), Picasa,

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:24.230
and YouTube APIs over other APIs like, let’s
say, Flicker? Or have you--you’ve already

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.230
implemented Flicker as well?
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Yes, we’ve implemented Flicker.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.920
And we do have a lot of users, you know, there’s
a lot of demand for it, and the APIs are very

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.230
simple. They can--they can get a little tricky
in terms of the data we get back, but they’re

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.360
very simple and, you know, that the clients--,
the clients libraries that are there right

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:55.640
now are very robustly written, and we actually
in fact use the GData API client library to

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.320
upload to YouTube.
&gt;&gt; Do you have any anecdotes that you want

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.320
to share…
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Yeah, those are…

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.890
&gt;&gt; For everybody?
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Yeah, absolutely. There was a time

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.590
where we were trying to--this was when we
were trying to upload videos for the first

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.830
time from an Eye.fi card. And, at some point,
we were just like, “Where did the upload

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.870
go?” ‘cause it was just, you know, lost
in the system. And we figured that there was

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.060
an issue with the memory management inside
those classes, so what we did to remedy, to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.940
rectify that was basically do chunk uploads.
So, we were, instead of like, say, pushing

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.129
in a gig file in to the class to YouTube be
where--you know…

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.390
&gt;&gt; Splitting it up?
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Splitting it up into 4 kilobytes

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.150
each and then sending it through. So, that
was pretty, pretty neat. I mean, you know,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.680
basically you’re doing a socket connection
and kind of using that technique to it to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.120
do it.
&gt;&gt; And then there was actually a bug report

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.670
and we’re not aware of the bug and we’re
kind of resolving it.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.840
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Well...
&gt;&gt; Well, that’s a good plan. It’s a very

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.840
interesting stuff.
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Thank you.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.980
&gt;&gt; You have anything else that you’d like
to add?

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.000
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Yeah, as far as the APIs are concerned,
you know, the Google data APIs are awesome

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.490
and--in fact we extensively use the Maps API
as well. So, what the Eye.fi card is going

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.269
to do is it actually geo tags the pictures
and the videos that you take.

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.550
&gt;&gt; : Cool.
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: So, we can show it very, you know--

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.790
in a real-time basis as far as the users are
concerned to--they can see where they took

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.230
the picture. And we actually plotted down
on, you know, the Maps to show them.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.349
&gt;&gt; That is--that’s a really nice feature,
I think.

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.010
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It could be released well in the future,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.730
especially on, like, vacations wherein you
want to see where you took the picture.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.110
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Exactly, right? You don’t know
where you are at and, you know, it’s (INDISTINCT).

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.060
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you for coming at the I/O
and this interview.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.240
&gt;&gt; PRAJ: Thanks for inviting me.
