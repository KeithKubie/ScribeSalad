00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If we have a triangle like this one here and we're looking at this angle,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
this is what we call our reference angle for now. We have three sides we can talk about.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now this one, the largest side, will always be called the hypotenuse--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so I'm going to abbreviate the hypotenuse with Hyp.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This side here at the bottom is opposite the angle we're referring to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so let's call that the opposite side.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This side being next to the angle is adjacent. We're going to label that AdJ.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Adjacent just means "next to," and one thing to be careful of is not to call this side the adjacent side.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Even though, yes, it is next to this angle, we give this one the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
special name hypotenuse because it is the longest side.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now if we think back to our sides from before or side lengths.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We have 5 meters, 12 meters, and a hypotenuse of 13 meters.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What we now know is that anytime we have a similar triangle to this one--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
a right triangle with an angle of 22.6 degrees here--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the ratio of opposite to adjacent will always, always be 5/12.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This ratio is so important that we're going to give it it's own name.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The first trigonometric ratio you're going to learn is the tangent,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and the tangent of an angle is always equal to the opposite over the adjacent,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which in this case would have been 5/12.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I would write that by saying the tangent of 22.6 degrees equals 5/12,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but that's not the only ratio we can talk about.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We can also compare the opposite to the hypotenuse.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When we do that, we're using what's called a sine, so I should note that I am making

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
abbreviations here--tan for tangent sin for sine.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Sine is just the opposite over the hypotenuse.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Can you tell me what would the sine of 22.6 degrees be?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Remember the tangent of 22.6 was 5 over 12, what's the sine?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Enter in your answer here--you can enter it as a fraction

00:01:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
with the numerator up here and the denominator down here.
