Hey there and welcome to Networking For
Web Developers.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.760
In this course you'll learn a bunch
about how the internet works and

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.250
how applying that working knowledge can
help you make your web apps better.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.050
As a web developer you may already know
a bit about HTTP, but you might not yet

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.180
know what it's built out of.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.870
This course gives you a basic
understanding of the workings of

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.070
internet protocols.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.370
Focused on the protocols
that underlie HTTP.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.390
To get the most out of this course,
you should already be familiar with HTTP

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.490
itself, and also with using the Linux
shell, SSH and command line programs.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.930
If you need a bit of
a refresher on those,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.230
take a look back at the Audacity
courses in Linux Command Line Basics,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.399
Configuring Linux Web Servers,
and Designing RESTful API's.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.700
To do this course,
you'll need to log in to a Linux system.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.350
If you're taking this course as part
of a Udacity nanodegree program,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.100
you can use the development
instance that we've set up for you.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.950
In case you lost track of it, there's
a link to it in the instruction notes.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.990
Otherwise, you can use
a real Linux server, or

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.860
you can set up a virtual machine
that runs on your regular computer.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.580
See the instructor notes for
a link on how to do that.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.980
Next up, I'm going to give you some
written instructions on how to install

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.200
the tools you'll need for
this course on your Linux system.
