00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
As you know DPLA is the new kid on the block,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
born yesterday, in actual fact,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you could say the inspiration for the DPLA goes back to the founding fathers,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
people who are enshrined in the national archives

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and Jefferson put it perfectly when he described what he

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
called the action of the thinking power called an idea as

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a process of transmitting light.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
As he who lights his taper to candle.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That receives light without darkening. I have to admit, bedevil Kenco to Jefferson.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
-- The devil can quote Jefferson

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and it is it easy to sound high-minded about to my tenant

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and it is difficult to translate abstract principles into reality.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
After all, someone had to pay for Jefferson's taper, his candle.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And Jefferson, himself, was not great at business plans.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Especially, when it came to running Monticello. So,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the time has come for action.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Practical action, business plans included.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The DPLA has now reached the stage  where it needs to tap

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
another American tradition,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
they can do no-nonsense pioneering

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and pragmatic spirit but also accompanied the founding of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the republic. America was built, in large part,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
by entrepreneurs and enterprise was off

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and public spirited. Think of Andrew Carnegie.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
He used his private wealth to build public libraries across the entire continent,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
opening access to knowledge for millions of Americans who

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
have had very little contact with books.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We need a Carnegie system for the 21st century,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
one that will make the cultural heritage of humanity

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
accessible to everyone. To pay through schools,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to students at community colleges,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to start up experimenters and grudges,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
senior citizens and retirement committees,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
people everywhere with a love of literature,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a thirst for learning, desire to get ahead, and curiosity about the world surrounding them.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We can do it.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We could make it happen.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
In fact, it is already happening and therefore,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
we would like to report on a work in progress among the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
six groups organized by the DPLA  Secretariat,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
with a mission to tackle key issues that must be resolved

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
if we are to get this library as an running,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
at least in a preliminary phase.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
18 months from now.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So the first report will come from Peggy, director

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and librarian of the Texas State Library and archives commission

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
or issue a report on the work done

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and to be done in the audience and participation registry.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And my cochair Friday

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and participation is Carla Hayden at the Pratt public

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
library. As you can see, the mission statement is still,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
our version of the version mission statement is still a work in progress

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and this is what we created that had a lively group of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
individuals who engaged a rich conversation yesterday that her vision

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and mission is to create a digital public Library of

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
America that is a trusted first platform for knowledge on

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
line that is universally accessible, participatory,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and compelling for all. And the next slide,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
members of the workgroup, and we will keep moving.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Our top priorities,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that was the next thing we refocus our attention on,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and the questions that need to be researched in a TV delved into,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is the cultural relevance of what is in the DPLA .

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We want to foster social interaction,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
provide a pivot point for people's lives as they are

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
interacting and intersecting with the DPLA

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and that would be universally accessible andd

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and what is the killer app is one of the questions that

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
was asked for a service that is user focused

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and that enables collaboration between and among users.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What are the issues around privacy and openness?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
They were our dynamic tension they are but we certainly

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
think we have got to delve into that so that we can

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
preserve pay to privacy,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
something that is important to libraries

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and then communication with libraries,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
we have to let libraries know,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
all the libraries out there, then what DPLA is,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
where are we now at this stage?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Our top challenges, what is the DPLA?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We spent a lot of time talking about that we will

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
continue to do so.  DPLA needs to be the first

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
or second place that people visit to access information

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
or use to enable access to information.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It goes beyond that we feel will be lost.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
There is a tension between, as we talked about earlier,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
the traditional role of libraries in the evolving new

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
roles of libraries in the Digital age we feel that one of

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
our top challenges this understanding the voice of the typical user,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
not the person who I enjoy a great deal of success but

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
those individuals who might need to have additional support in order to benefit.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Our work products,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
we want a blue print for libraries to libraries can

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
understand how they interact with the Digital Public Library of America

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and how they help their patients interactive talking

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
points for libraries to bring back to their funders

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
because that is something that is of great concern,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
they don't want the funding for public libraries to

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
suffer as a result of the unintended consequence of local

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
government officials thinking than a national digital

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
public library with additive under local library a longer

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
break defining audiences based on the services that we

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
want to provide because those are going to be many.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
They also came up with those individuals that we think

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
need to be added to the conversation among them school librarians, educators,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
representatives of the public at large, content creators, authors, publishers,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and you can see some of the service for error case that

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
we felt were very important for us to focus on as we begin our work on DPLA.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
As you can see, these people have been hard at work

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and yesterday we had a series of discussions,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I should have explained that,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
they are reporting on the results of these workgroups and a workgroups

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and the working streams have been expanding

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and expanding and certainly public library

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and have become key players in defining what the digital

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
memory of America's great the second workgroup do with

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
content and scope. Rachel,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
who is director of the Digital Library Federation program

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
will report on it. Soon I felt like content scope, people were saying,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
we have to know what is in content scope,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
but I think it is one of the things about the work

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
streams that we are working in parallel it is important

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to talk amongst each other as we move forward in some

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
things we talked about today, inform the conversation in content

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and scope those philosophies around open interoperable on

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
the idea of permanent persistence

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and how it relates to building trust in the DPLA as a trusted resource

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and working with people who are willing

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and able to contribute in a noncompetitive

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and collaborative way that was really important,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
not only to collections but to build community and the DPLA added a unique value.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So,  to that end, this is our mission statement,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we were wordsmithing sometimes,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
but what is behind me is to facilitate the discovery

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and exposure of digital heritage content preferment

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
"access for the enhancement of knowledge and community.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We hope, to this end, the next 18 months,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to content work stream while identifying

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and engaging digital content providers

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and producers who are willing to participate in DPLA

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
content building. Who want to leverage

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and build interest with people who we see could be

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
brokers that are content aggregators with the Internet

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
archive and DCC and -- and we want to foster open

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and transparent conversations about collection

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
development for the DPLA soberly engaged  the public at

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
large in this conversation of what our valuable

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
collections to be part of the DPLA.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Who want to encourage digital content creation,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and help facilitate the discovery of more content for the

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
digital collection. And we see,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
what our top three challenges are in we define what we

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
mean by content and we are including Ms.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and the DPLA and  comparing rules of engagement

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and what we think our challenge which is coordinating

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
other work streams for us

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and the next couple of months at top priorities are to

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
identify content communities a corresponding immunity

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
advocates to help identify the various for participation was DPLA.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
What would be the incentives  to participate in DPLA

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and what are the rewards for contribution and DPLA?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And to flesh out the whole idea between the relationships

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
between persistence and preservation.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Thank you. As you can see,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Rachel has been dealing with these questions for a long

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
time and is the Digital Library Federation program,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but I said we are the new kid on the block, I meant it,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
a lot of people have been working on these issues for a long time

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and we are grateful to you for bringing that experience

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
to us. The third group -- financial

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and business information network Street has a lot of work

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
ahead of anonymity may be curious to know where the money is going to come from.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Kevin Guthrie has some revelations there, I hope

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and anyhow, he can tell us what is.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
He is president of Ithaca

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and has contributed enormously to this whole endeavor.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The revelations may be too strong of a word but for an

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
eraser we have interdependencies

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and we are trying to put together [Indiscernible low audio]

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Our mission is simple,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
explore mechanisms to generate ongoing support

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and thinking about that,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
we felt it was important to think about how to

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
[Indiscernible low audio] regenerate demand for this

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
enterprise and what it provides

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and if we can regenerate that we can generate the current

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
supply of funds to support it

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and a lot of what we were doing in the discussion

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[Indiscernible low audio] was identifying the issues we need to address

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and as a people thinking about business modeling,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
process inputs in order to make certain kinds of

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
recommendations? The first key areas for the content,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
what is going to be in the DPLA

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and the second was audience,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
those of the two key questions

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and those that have web-based resources [Indiscernible low audio],

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that is an issue you have to address on the scope of

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
these enterprises are quite large and that is okay.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
At some point, choices will have to be made

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and the script and a secondary pieces on the cost side the technical

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
solutions and governments are going to play a big role in thinking

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
about helping to determine those.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We know the DPLA is going to represent a diverse

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
collection of things  that are available

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and also there'll be supported by a diverse set of

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
resources and again, we will meet priorities

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and then we talked about was the importance of marketing

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and communications and advocacy and by marketing,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
we don't mean putting out brochures.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
In fact full understanding of what it is value

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and be able to communicate effectively

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and certain ways we are seeing the benefit of this and great marketing

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and a sense of creating awareness of this resource

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and the excitement around it as movement that is being

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
felt in the question is how to institutionalize that movement.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
There were some key assumptions that we thought Nader to

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
make sure their rocksolid before we go forward in the Q1

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
prudish Keith what was the notion of the DPLA

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and the end user

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and what your options are for a way to generate funds

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and they said that is not the assumption,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
tell us now to make adjustments.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
The key questions, we try to service questions that would be important for

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
this community,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
for the steering group in terms of setting priorities

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and we think that these some bold line distinctions,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
will be DPLA  actually holds content?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Will it have content? It is like to have it

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
or that is a key for the road.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Will the DPLA take in account director some stability for

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
submissions? We've heard this day

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and a variety of ways there's a risk in DPLA says is not

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
preservation visualizing projects are distributed around

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
relying on thewithout it being  resourced to check ourselves ability.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
The key question is: what is the preservation

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
responsibilities that DPLA urged a great ,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
this has came up again, thinking about audience and funding,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
if they can't seriously funded by governments,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and be part of local public library infrastructure,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the thing that we said, the question will be,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
what is in it for the kids

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and we have to think about that from the standpoint of the audience.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So we raised possible models of heavy things to determine them.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Membership, what would motivate members

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and public libraries to become members,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
not in a financial way but in terms of supporting the

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
government funding is a major potential part of this, philanthropic funding,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
we did not know about the announcements coming today but

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
clearly, institutional foundation funding

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and other agencies is going to play a role.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
As is the opportunity of those questions earlier for individual donations and philanthropic gifts.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Another issue that came up this one, that we thought about was how

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
there is a lot of structure that exists that maybe is not

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
being used as much as it was before

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
or could be purposed with this Presidio model in San

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Francisco were some infrastructure is out there that

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
could be repurposed in terms of physical infrastructure

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and services that could be provided.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
A really key thing that we talked about at the end,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
the devil is in the details on how this works when you

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
think carefully between time cost

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and recurring costs supporting us not to get completely

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
caught up in the capital but thinking about --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and we thought about the possible work products

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
and things we could do that would be helpful in some research

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and I mentioned the notion of the existing infrastructure

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and thinking about what is out there were other places

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
was among the infrastructure.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
It was not about the possibility of the paper the sample

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
sizes existing research of making information freely

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and widely available can support economic growth rate for

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
thought that free content can actually generate economic

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
value which is a compelling argument for governments

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
trying to synthesize the research that is out there

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
and finally conducting research

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and thinking about this question that keeps coming up

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
about the role of the public library

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
and one thing that came up as a brainstorm in our group,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
if there was an organization and a brand

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
and a local public library

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
or historical Society was thinking about digitizing content,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
if it were affiliated with a larger national organization,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
but that increase the likelihood to make the case locally

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
for the funding to do digitization and actually,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
that could be a compelling way to raise funds and local context

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
and we thought we might want to conduct research

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and having that affiliation -- so that was the range of

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
things we talked about more questions

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
and inquiries that answers to have to think about the business model.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Thank you, Kevin. There are a lot of questions

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
and you probably have a lot of questions so we are now

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
seeing through these presentations to leave time for your questions as well.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
The next presenter is Susan -- the director of the

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Institute for the Museum of library services rate she

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
will report on the discussions of the governance for extreme.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Good afternoon and I'm reporting on behalf of our work street that is

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
cochaired by John --

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and David Faria so we don't have to worry about anything else, they will figure it out.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Our goal is to develop decision-making and management for DPLA

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
and  what we found in our work yesterday, as Bob said,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
there are more questions than answers but the first thing

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I would like to say in terms of governance,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
is that I am so thrilled to see all of these interested

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
parties in this room staying until four o'clock on a

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Friday afternoon so your planes are late

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
or you have an hour else to go but I am excited you are

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
here great to want anybody to think, what went on on Thursday

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and what should we know about Thursday?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
We have a group of dedicated individuals trying to get

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
this off the ground to give us a lift but we first want

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
everyone to know that this is a very open process.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
So all of our minutes in activities and notes are public

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and if anyone has a particular interest in joining any of these work streams

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
and I'm sure that we were welcome to do that.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
We are just self organizing ourselves and we would welcome your contributions

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
and your involvement and one of the things we initially talked about was models of organization.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And it is challenging when you don't know what you're

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
going to be that we did brainstorm models that we thought

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
we could do further research on think about

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
and learn from and again I would ask all of you,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
if you have suggested models, please share them with us.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
We first thought about the obviously relevant models that

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
we're all familiar with and web organization

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
and its many different web organizations but we are

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
particularly interested in the IETF period this is

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
organization for the qualifications for membership as he

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
had come to the meetings and Stancil's and voting was done by the loudest --

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
and it hasn't interesting protocols

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
and I'm off it will mimic those that we have a enjoyable

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
time. It is apparently notorious in the web world.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
We thought a little bit about libraries

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and our group was Maureen Sullivan

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
and we suggested a LA and she said,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
that is going to cause the table quickly

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
and if there are AOA members in here,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
you may be aware of that but it is a model to look at the

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
thought of not looking at the European model that worked quite well there.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
But that is the number of states that we are one big organization.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
We are one big country so it is not necessarily parallel

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
to it to look at public

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
and private partnerships because ultimately that is what

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
this enterprise is going to base a bit out there might be

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
some potentially relevant models for us to consider fruit research networks,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
many of us are familiar with in our states in terms of connectivity

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
and high bandwidth to all of our institutions

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
and commercial models who want to consider,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
scholarly organizations and social movements.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
It's interesting that in the sense that we are in the

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
midst of social movements there may be a synthesis to

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
come up with that we feel is the best way to manage this

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
a very ambitious enterprise but the most important thing

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
for you to know, but we are thinking about it,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
we are very open to ideas

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
and we talked about models for participation which is

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
going to be a topic that is very much aligned with

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
financial and business work at developing DPLA.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
So we thought that  there could be different models

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
or levels of participation

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
and as we said in terms of the content,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
there is a basic assumption that there will be content

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
available to any individual for free we believe that is a

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
hallmark of this enterprise but with a thick institution

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
on numbers that would be contributing materials as well

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
as making materials available for audience and clients

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
and institutions that contribute materials some of our

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
major historical societies that have really special

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
content and all of our federal partners,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
they might have a certain level of benefits

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
and institutions that might want to participate but not necessarily contribute content,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
there would be differentiation and also,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
in terms of your question about who will hold content, we really think that ultimately,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
if we do end up holding content,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
we will be a federated system of a number of major nodes

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
of information around the country

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
and if we identify an institution is a node of word DPLA, what requirements will be involved,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
and what benefits would come from that?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
And we are also beginning to think about how institutions

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
would participate knowing that an individual will be able

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
to have access to materials for free.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
That is not to say that as a collective,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
we will not feel our collective energy would allow us to

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
end up going to extend it license agreement we think that publishing models

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
and access your public library structure is really a challenging topic

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.000
and something that is evolving at the time and we are not,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
we think that DPLA might be able to take a role in that

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
and they certainly don't make any decision about what

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
might be able to aggregate content so that some of our institutions

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
or miscible jurisdictions might want to contribute

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
something to provide access but ultimately there would be

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:56.000
a basic level of material that would be available for free. Facile to have some special levels of institutional

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
institutions joining us. Federal agencies, state libraries

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
and other agencies that may not be able to participate

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
for some reason but we want to have that data available to us.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Again, I'm going to reinforce we believe we are operating on

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
basic principles of openness and inclusion

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
and all are welcome as I am sure many of you can go home

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
and talk to your friends and colleagues and if they are interested in getting involved,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
we welcome that, that is exciting. From the governance point of view,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
and all further work streams,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
we are committed to try to make sure that we get things

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
done. And by doing that, in order to do that,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
we have to ramp up an actual organization in place within

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
18 months because our wonderful welcome Ms.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000
at the Berkman Center, we know it launches projects and they go off

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
and have a life of their own aunt who want to get a life

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
of our ongoing within 18 months so we might identify

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
small work streams, workshops, task forces,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
we will make the information about those openly available

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
and anyone can participate that we will be getting things

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
done some as a sleeve also be doing what it takes to get it done.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000
One of our big to do in the governance for extreme does develop a standard

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
and we would like to have a standard that we adopt an if

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
you live in a state where you like your privacy

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
or open meeting laws and you know I crackerjack one,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
we don't use of city and County of San Francisco,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
which can be challenging, having lived through that.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
But we will identify flexible form that we think works

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
for us it really can't be a public statement about our openness and also,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
we will enforce norms for participation in all of our

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
group meetings that everyone has been well behaved today

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
but will make sure we identify the chair of the meeting,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
have agendas, have open mailing list

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
and also to have a situation where someone is challenging,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
deal with them appropriately but in terms of having open meetings,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
we certainly want all of our meetings to be open.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
That is not necessarily imply an individual who is an

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
observer in a meeting will have an opportunity to comment.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Not that they wouldn't do that,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
but we will have a clear protocol for dealing with

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
handling our activities. The governance group, I think, really wants to move forward

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
and we are very excited about opportunities I think all

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
of us in the workgroups will be working together as best

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
as we can wear a dedicated in our governance work strain

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
to have some kind of organization up and running in 18 months.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Thank you, Susan, 18 months is tomorrow.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
This is urgent that it is serious, it is for real.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
And everyone is invited to participate in the same sure

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
you have lots of ideas and your point about a movement,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
it is well taken, and I sense the energy in this room,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
and it was expressed yesterday as well as today it is

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
symptomatic of a movement is gathering force of please spread the word

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
and don't hesitate to let the governance committee of DPLA know your thoughts on that subject.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
We have other subjects.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Notably, the legal and policy work streams of tears,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Jason Schultz associate director at the Samuelson Law

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
technology on public policy clinic at the University of

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
California Berkeley school of Law will report on that.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Jason? Thanks.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
We convened the legal law on behalf of the cochair from Columbia

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
and started to talk about what the legal work streams

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
roll would play in this process which is a parallel process

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
and for those that have had a lot of experience working

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
with innovative experimental emerging technologies in

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
organizations learned that lawyers probably shouldn't

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
believe, the best role is to provide support and guidance

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
and review listening to things that might need input but

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
to be supporting a playing a strategic role to make sure

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
everything goes smoothly but not to get in the way of anything.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000
So she will see from the mission statement to try to portray the philosophy

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
and to think about our role in terms of helping the DPLA

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
balance and a legal risks that are perceived , building a collection

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.000
and enabling experiments in progress and access to those of the two things that I would focus

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
on terms of our conversations,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
thinking about the limbless collection of providing broad

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
access and experiments. In terms about,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
the three main things we decided to focus on,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
helping to establish best practices guidelines of things,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
and people want to deal with the particular situation

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
and we can provide some of that in terms of investigating

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000
emerging problems many of you might know about orphan works

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
and you want to make it accessible that is a problem that

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
has been emerging for a while

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
and in terms of identifying the common policy issues

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
and what the solutions are an then there is an option to

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
organize some workshops over the next 18 months

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
and we are wanting to organize around a partner with

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
other work streams to identify with some of those could

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
be and some of our thoughts were, access,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
a lot of discussion around the best way to provide access

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
especially the visually impaired people, issues around digital lindane

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
and the best practices they are. In terms of acquisition, and also looking at licensing options,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
especially other open licensing

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
and privacy which has come up a couple of times is an

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000
area where policies can play an important role so some of the things that came up for us we are looking to play a

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
supportive role with issues arising are the places we can be strategically helpful,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Thank you. Jason,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
you can see everything is connected with everything so

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
that is what the difficulties in getting organized

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
because legal issues are connected with content which is connected with finance

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
and he did a heroic job of sorting through some of the legal issues

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
and we are counting on top of the future but meanwhile,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
last of the technical work streams was indeed technical

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
and the associate director of the Smithsonian Institution

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
and Martin is great that they might be Hannity PLF

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
or so we are grateful for that

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
and pass it on to your boss but meanwhile,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
can you tell us what is going on here?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
I want to thank the technical group is a good group of

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
people that we can together very well

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
and -- at the Missouri botanical Garden

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
and the technical group is going last telling me to do is build on --

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
and I think the technical group does its work well, you are invisible to the eventual product,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
and detailing or better yet,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
it will appear as magic so what we have to do is become invisible and appear as magic

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
and for the rest of the DPLA.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Some of the challenges we noted, we need to achieve that magic to clarify technical

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
deliverables of DPLA.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
We need to figure out this key technical things are that

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
we need to create in a technical environment and the second one is,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
the one via collaborative development team?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
In addition to the work done correctly, products that are out there,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
ready to cooperate to create whatever the DPLA product

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.000
will be great to the sink, we need to provide input to the rest of the work streams

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
in terms of feasibility.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
It is important to have great ideas at the same time,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
technically feasible at the same time so those are the

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
challenges and in terms of those to Liverpool's,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000
that a number of thoughts in mind of one of the things was,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Susan mentioned me to have a killer apps with it is to be

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
a killer ASP that appears within an environment one thing

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
that we think will be interoperability

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
and openness to think that is a key thing we need to do

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
is have all this data available so people can build their

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
own shiny things on top and at the same time,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
building a shiny thing that can deliver within her 18 month timeframe. The thing is,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
which have plenty of open systems

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
and services that enable other people to build their own

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
localized use of this content such as pushing it out to

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
local libraries and historical societies and Museum

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
and integrate it with their own content for their own

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
local community spirit whatever short-term deliverables,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
we will to do a more thorough analysis of the Sprint

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
competitors so we can see what is out there

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
and what parts are best used

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
and how to integrate all that work into products?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
We also want this to be a very participatory experience

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
and are interested in work streams

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000
and we want to develop the code is openly and visible as possible.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
We will be openly deposited some of the primary sources

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
and we're thinking about Google code etc. and appropriate places where code can be watched as it

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
gets developed another thing is,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
as they deliverables want to make sure that our public participation enables the use

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
and reuse of metadata objects collections

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
and code within DPLA whatever goes into DPLA should come out of DPLA

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
and be reused whenever system serviced around there.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
The other key thing that we looked at with some of the related projects

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
and we don't reinvent the wheel but other projects are

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
out there that we can use and ideas and code and again,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
looking at large-scale models, you have Flickr,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
in terms of public participation in creating content

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
and YouTube am standing examples that come out of the Internet archive and an environment,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
there's also a personal library to a citation praises him -- that was mentioned today

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
and tools that we will label on top can be used in

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
different ways and also collections, registration, repository,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
and how those can inform the development here in Missoula

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
to ignore the commercial side of the world.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
With examples through the network. Development, things like Amazon,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
how's the delivering content is also systems that are

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
done by interesting commercial services, Netflix, sci-fi,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000
overdrive, iTunes, you and the big indexing services and other digital libraries,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
I think you're a busy key model the Wikipedia community, freebase, OCLC

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:28.000
and some of the other types of services so we are hoping to work within the community

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:35.000
and build on what we get from the rest of the work streams to do that.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And Marquis in the first goal should be to have a joint

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
meeting with the content legal group to see what the

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
parameters are going to be where the initial bills.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Thank you very everyone has kept to the time limits

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
and that means we have a good 15 minutes left for discussion

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
and hope you're not feeling exhausted but the energy

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
level is very high and then you have at least a glimpse,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
a preliminary glimpse of this kind of organization kinds of financing and technological support

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
and so on will constitute DPLA.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.000
So,  please ask questions

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
and I can't see that if someone can put their hands

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
visibly off, we can get things started.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
There is a hand in the very back.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Maybe a microphone is on the way.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
If you were to justify yourselves.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
-- Gomez. The question has to do with messages,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
and part of the picture frame, in my mind,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
we are in Washington DC and I'm curious.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Is there some outreach or messages being floated over with some legislators here

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
about this project and the need for some support?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
All of us have congressional delegates back home

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
and I know it might be premature but I can't imagine

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
there is not some discussion about this at some level,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
what is the thinking behind getting some engagement with

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
the congressional leadership about this project? Did --

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
A very good question that has been haunting a lot of

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
people. Can anyone answer it?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000
I am tempted to ask some of the locals such as the Susan,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
it is not as if you are a congresswoman is that you

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000
occasionally cross path with this other race. What do you think the prospects are?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
We spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday as well

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
and I think we all want to get a good assessment of how

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
the meeting went today. And then, I know that the people at the Berkman Center are going to

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
be developing some press releases and getting some information out.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
In terms of talking with our elected officials

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
and other also love it if David would chime in as well.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
This is an absolutely wild time in DC.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
And we have a super committee that is working to get the

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
big budget deal done by the end of November and the agencies are working on resolutions

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
and we don't have budgets

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
and we hear they will be done by November and is really chaotic.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
It is not to say it is not a good time,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
I don't know that they would hear bunch with all that

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
noise but I do think that it is something that steering committee level,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
we need to develop a plan for what we want to make

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
legislators aware this is going on there are some

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
legislators that are interested in digital information

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
and aware that it has a big impact on our communities

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
and trying to identify some that we know will be very familiar

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
and supportive of our general efforts of her not doing

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
any kind of funding. But,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I would like David to chime in and also,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
John said he wasn't going to talk that maybe Bob has some

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
ideas. David, do you have any thoughts on that?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
There is a lot of interest on the hill under the White House on this

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
and for those of you who have not read the president --

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
at the end of December signing a digital future, a $3 billion initiative,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
there are places for us in that initiative.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
The hill is interested in anything related K-12 so when I

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000
have been talking about this, with my contacts, Hill,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I have been teaching it in terms of its value to the K-12 community.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
I was invited to Hartford of the last three weeks by

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Congressman John Larson has a former history teacher to

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000
talk about our products to Grupo superintendents

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
and teachers from the Hartford Connecticut area

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
and we talked about the digital public library to keep

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
their eyes on that is another source. In my own context,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I have been planting seeds that this is something to pay attention to.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
The very first ever house caucus of the national archives

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
has been formed were having our first meeting on the hill

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
sometimes the end of November

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
and something I'm going to be talking about with members

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
of the House caucus. There a lot of opportunities.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Thank you, David, he will put in a good word for DPLA.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Among the lawyers and people interested in the law,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
but has a lot of discussion about possibly an attempt to

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
pass more than book legislation

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
and before the next question comes out of my chest Jason,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
what do you think of this?

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Should we be writing to her congressman saying,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
nevermind about the budget crisis, barbarous --

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
or from books really count.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
I feel that the answer has been laid out before me.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I think dealing with orphan work works defined in many

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
ways, they are not commercially viable, out-of-print,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.000
hard-to-find, different ways to look at that issue and the thing is,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
there is a desire some time to have a one-stop shop

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
solution that I think there are solutions that people are

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
dealing with these different sets of collections in ways

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
which they are able to move forward with the law allows

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
him to that of various doctorates

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
and think that we want to explore the strategies

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
and if it gets to the point where

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
and make sense to think about trying to push for a change

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.000
I think that is something that has to be considered a given name comments made,

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
he don't necessarily want to go there until you have to

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.000
enter a lot of places they go first for you considered

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
those so it is not that it is off the table but we have a

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
lot of innovative and creative places to go and I think the law supports that.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Other questions? I am sure you have plenty.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
I hesitate to speak on communication since the last

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
conversation that my sense is the conversation on

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
communication is top down, policy down,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
the higher end abuse issues in terms of communications

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:38.000
people involved in decision-making

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
and policies I think there is still a need for us to look

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000
at, if you will, the Reader's Digest reader

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000
and bring an action of what DPLA is that what it could

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
mean to those people  who are not thinkingg of the level

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000
of planning a K-12 course

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000
or an academic exercise are doing research of one form

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
or another but look to what we provide in terms of a

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
learning environment and on-the-fly learning,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
on-demand learning, or just in general,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
entertainment in one form or another,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
it still can be entertaining

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
and we have to look at the bottom,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
a very horrible phrase, multiple facets, top and bottom,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
we have to do the whole gamut.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
So one consideration is to work communication set of

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:57.000
problems into the actual discussion that will be going on the various work streams

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
and I think we have to find a way to do that

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
and certainly, with the kind of user in mind the develop,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
that you mentioned, the ordinary reader,

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
certainly not the college professors put the kind of

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
person who is curious about the world surrounding him

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
or her and people who want to have fun

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
and go beyond entertaining and books and reading

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:34.000
and looking at items and who want to build that and in my opinion.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000
And who will take that very seriously as they go to the

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
next streams. Thank you. I saw a hand over here.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
I am a student at -- college.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
My issue is one of ideology rather than logistics.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.000
They're talking about openness and access and social movements

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
and I'm getting my library science degree

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000
and my public history degree

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
and I have dismayed that DPLA  is choosing to invoke the

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
name of Andrew Carnegie as an ideological foundation.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Because while some may know him as a benefactor of libraries,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
the reason that he funded a the Homestead library was

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
because of the public up for him

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
and his direct involvement of the murder of workers in

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
his own null and this might seem nitpicky,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
but as the DPLA continues

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
and then they will be working with public historians

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000
and institutions on cultural heritage institutions I

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000
don't think that this will be the first time that this

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
was brought up because coming from a public history

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
aside, Andrew Carnegie is a hot topic

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
and people love to talk about him and taken apart

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
and so I want to put that out there.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
I think that is really important but I will say that

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.000
whenever I talk about Carnegie

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
and his role on the libraries I focus on not on him

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000
and what his motivation was because I think that there

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
are some really problematic areas you look at the

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:46.000
fullness of his motivation. But to think about his role in partnering with local

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
communities, because what he did,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
he built libraries but only on the condition of that

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
community would continue to support that library with

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
sustainability so when I talk about Carnegie in public

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000
libraries, that is what I focus on

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000
and I don't think anyone here would want to focus on any

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:19.000
other aspect, I think what Bob was referring to was to meet someone

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000
else who is going to have that same vision of partnership

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000
if they can help us build it,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000
and those of us in this room are going to have to help

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000
all of our respective groups and institutions

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
and individuals that we represent views that resource to

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
the fullest. I don't know if that helps any.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000
The question about his motivation

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
and the last conversation about a message,

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:03.000
not that we necessarily want to overstate that when you think about libraries

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
and think about knowledge in this country, the name,

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Carnegie, whatever that story might be,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
is emblematic of that and this lady said,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
we know he did a lot

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
and communities to ensure they would have sustainable

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
facilities for like it or not, it is iconic

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
and when you talk about libraries with the general public,

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
and Carnegie raises this recollection of their building

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
and who want to get away from that.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000
I personally talked about Bill Gates as a 21st century

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Andrew Carnegie which I think he has done a should not

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000
say that in front of -- who has done so much for this

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:02.000
effort but I think that when we think about messaging,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
what to think about that but we also need to be aware of

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000
iconic images that can have an impact with our generic

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000
user that we are talking about.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Our Reader's Digest person who is going to be excited by

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.000
DPLA because of their easy access to amazing information and a lot of it can be local.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
I am excited to have the can provide a platform for local

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000
information is so exciting to people around the country,

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
it is probably never going to be mounted anywhere,

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
but it is so unique and important,

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000
and can rally community for their pride

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000
and interest in what is unique in seeing that,

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
I think that is a great step forward but I think the messaging is critical

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
and I do appreciate your sensitivity of that.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
I'm glad you raised the point

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
and I actually did not hesitate before invoking the name of Carnegie as well as Jefferson.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
There were parts of Jefferson's past but in my view,

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
one of the things that makes this country distinct,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:26.000
this private foundations who work for the public good.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
The DPLA is going to  defend at least for its launch,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
getting started, and private foundations

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.000
and then founded by the Rockefellers, Carnegie's, and so on

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000
and so I feel that we are different from Europeans

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
and the Europeans depend on the state,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:55.000
they don't have a philanthropic tradition that is in any

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000
way comparable so we might as well be open about it

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000
and maybe we should not run the Carnegie flag up the

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
flagpole too high but the Carnegie foundation as a

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:17.000
foundation that I hope will support the DPLA.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
We need this kind of debate so thank you for making a point.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
I am from the free Library of Philadelphia

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
and I have a list ago question.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
I think this covers all of your groups,

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000
do you see any conflict with institutions, especially public libraries,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
continuing to use digitally created items

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000
and images for revenue-generating services for the libraries?

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Are we to expect everything to be put out there was a complete open license?

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
In Texas, we have rules regarding public libraries

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
and if they want to be accredited,

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.000
what they can charge for

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.000
and expect them to make everything that is available in the library whether digital or poor loan

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000
and a physical format,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
or available for free in every state will have a

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
different law or regulation but in our state,

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
that is the latest entry

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Want to make one comment, I think that is a good point,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
that this young lady made great

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
and I think it bears further research

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
and discussion because as we were sitting here discussing these topics,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000
I know that breast since I have worked at the San Francisco public Library

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
and the Seattle public Library in many cases,

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.000
photographs are being made available for commercial purposes, the library

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000
or the friends are foundation get a fee for that so those

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
are the kind of details that we are going to have to work

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
out for those important question that we have to deal with.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
There is a lot of research done about this sharing data

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000
and images and we're talking about content and scope,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
what does it mean when you contribute,

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
a contributing objects?

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Are you contributing data?

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000
There's a lot of information about that's the one thing that makes it very exciting,

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
but you deposit our brain to it,

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
should be opened for reuse for anybody whether it is commercial or not

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:47.000
and so is the libraries to want to commercialize their images and give them to the DPLA,

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000
I think having the freedom to do that in the space to do

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000
that is a good thing to consider for the DPLA.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000
I have to look at my watch, I know there are probably many discussions but David

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Ferriero has something to say

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and we have some things to say about David Ferriero which

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
are mainly, thank you.  We really appreciate it.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.000
[Applause]

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The floor is yours

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
and there may be some other questions as well. The

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Thank you, Bob.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I think we have come to the moment of gleeful rendezvous.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
The next time we should have wine with this crowd.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And you have all become official DPLA groupies by your

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
attendees and your  a part of a new social movement

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and has been an honor to have you occupying my house today.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
A couple of high points for me today for the

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
announcements from the collaboration with us

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and we are not of that we have a collaboration

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and especially listed in the migration exhibit is coming

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
just because of my own history since I've discovered

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
about how my grandparents got into the country

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and wonderful gifts from Sloan and Arcadia,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
thank you very much for your support.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
[Applause] The

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And David Weinberger's comment about having his head

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and heart exploding a to interoperate,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
is a wonderful take away for today.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You still here?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Yes. Where? David has a new book coming out.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
When is it coming out? The middle of December.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
And for those of you who are worried about information

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
overload, forget it,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Davis went to share some insights with you.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You heard multiple versions of DPLA which is what is so

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
exciting about today,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.000
this is very much a work in progress

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
and invitation for you to contribute in one of the nicest

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000
things I heard today was the use of DPLA as a verb.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
You can DPLA it. That is major and a lightning round

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000
and exciting glimpses of

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
and the ability to move quickly and as Bob said,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
18 months is not very far away

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and the metaphor of reservoirs and bridges, and Bob said,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
we can do it. So let's do it. Thank you for being here.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:32.000
[Applause]
