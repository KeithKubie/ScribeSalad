00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.480
Birds do it.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.120
Bees do it.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.500
Hermaphroditic flatworms do it.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.779
To their own face!

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.840
Hey there sexy, Julian here for DNews and
today we’re gonna do it like they do on

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.720
the Discovery channel, which it turns out
can be super weird sometimes.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.449
A recent observation of flatworm insemination
got our curiosity aroused, so to speak, about

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.419
strange animal sex.

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.630
The worm in question, Macrostomum hystrix,
has a needley penis.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.719
Usually it would use its needley penis to
wound another flatworm and inseminate it.

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.719
But when there’s not a lot of stabbing/loving
victims around, the worm will stab itself.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.980
In the head.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.980
To get pregnant.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.630
It’s like I always say, “Love yourself,
even if you’re f*cked in the head.”

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.230
You see most flatworms are hermaphroditic,
meaning they have male and female sex organs.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.289
Some large aquatic species of flatworm actually
mate with a behavior called penis fencing.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.449
It’s exactly what it sounds like.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.399
Winner gets laid and the loser gets stabbed
and pregnant.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.330
One such species is, and I’m not making
this up, the Pseudobiceros hancockanus.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.740
It’s probably pronounced hancockanus but
I think marine biologists just have dirty

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.130
minds.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.890
Hermaphrodites are more common than you might
think.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.950
Like clownfish.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.200
Yes, those clownfish.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.290
But instead of having male and female sex
organs simultaneously like the flatworms,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.439
they’re what’s called sequential hermaphrodites.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.750
Clownfish first develop into males, but will
change over their lifetime as they move up

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.130
the social hierarchy.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.329
Female clownfish are the largest and most
aggressive in the colony, but if she is removed

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.369
then the most dominant male will change his
sex and take her place.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.570
So if Finding Nemo were scientifically accurate,
Marlin would have become a she and Nemo would

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.170
have mated with her.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.170
Did…

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.409
Did I just ruin finding nemo for everyone?

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.810
Sequential hermaphrodites don’t always go
from male to female.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.890
75% of hermaphroditic fish actually go the
other way, like parrotfish, angelfish, groupers,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.220
and some sea stars.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.609
One such sea star is Nepanthia belcheri, and
it’s a special one.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.570
It’s a sequential hermaphrodite, and can
make babies when males and females release

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.569
sperm and eggs into the environment and hope
they find each other.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.649
That’s actually how most sea stars mate.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.680
Gross, Patrick.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.240
But Nepanthia belcheri and some other species
can reproduce asexually.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.580
It doesn’t help their genetic diversity,
but boy does it make them hard to kill.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.420
These sea stars can make entirely new sea
stars by splitting in half and regenerating

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.780
until they’re whole again.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.510
Other species will shed arms that are autonomous,
even though they’re severed from the nervous

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.890
system and the hydraulic system.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.860
They’re just like a zombie’s severed hand,
if the hand could then regrow an entire zombie

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.310
after several months.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.140
Sea stars like this can be problematic, and
there’s no better example than the Crown-of-Thorns

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.140
sea star.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.019
This nasty guy eats the great barrier reef
around Australia, and it’s venomous, because

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.750
of course it is, it’s Australian.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.099
It’s going to town on the reef and Australians
have to cull their numbers to save the reef.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.330
Originally they tried killing them by cutting
them up.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.330
If you cut them into thirds, they die.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.140
But if you cut them in half, 75% of the time
you get two new venomous 20-armed environment

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.530
destroying monsters.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.180
Curse you, asexual reproduction!

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.050
If asexual reproduction is so great, why do
we have sex?

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.360
Aside from it being fun.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.440
Trace has the explainer here.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:23.910
Do you know of any other weird animal sex
stories you want us to disseminate on the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.910
internet?

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.580
Let us know in the comments or on facebook
or twitter, subscribe for more, and I’ll

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.269
see you next time on DNews.
