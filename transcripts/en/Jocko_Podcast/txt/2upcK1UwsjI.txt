Speaker 1:          00:00          Life. We truly appreciate your father's work here in Texas. Would you ever consider a career in politics?

Speaker 2:          00:09          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10          well, I appreciate that. Uh, there's a, just a Sarah by understands that my dad is, uh, a US congressman now. Uh, he's a freshman, you as congressman from a Texas district, 36 and southeast Texas. And uh, I'm very proud of him. He retired after a career as a, as a small town dentist, uh, you know, business, a selling point, business for army and the air force, army, army and air force veteran. And uh, he was fed up with Washington and didn't like the options that he saw. Uh, you know, that he knew were going to be running for that seat. And he said, you know what, I'm throwing my hat in the ring. I'm going to go up there. I'm trying to make a difference. And I, we need more people like that in Washington. Dad Is, my dad is there to make a difference and only to make it deal.

Speaker 1:          00:51          He doesn't care about a career. He didn't care about being there for decades and decades and decades. You know, he's a, he's retired and he'd rather be fishing, hanging out with his grandkids and, and hunting. But, uh, he would, but he's up there. He cares about the country and he is sacrificing to be there and to lead. And I'm, I'm damn proud of the job that he's doing. Uh, and stepping up what I consider a career in politics. Uh, I can't imagine anything to be more miserable than that. Uh, you know what, on the other hand, when I look at our nation, just as my dad know, has, uh, uh, as has felt, you know, called to do that, to step up, to lead, you know, if we don't do it, who's going to do it? So somebody has got to step up if somebody has got to lead.

Speaker 1:          01:34          And I think when you look at the direction of our country right now in the, the, the political climate and, and all that's going on, you know, in this electoral cycle, um, what I do that maybe I just might be able to be talked into it. Uh, we shall see what about UJ go get some, I mean we got, we got the bumper stickers Jocko 2016, uh, you know, see that go Charles. I think I would be running as if I was to run for political office. I would run as a dictator and it's supreme ruler of, of America. And that's why I thought I would do, we, we can, we can bring back some of the Roman rule, try and triumvirate. So me, you and echo who could just take, take over a, I don't know if I have the stomach for politics. I really don't like the political arena too much and not sure it's something I would ever, ever have the desire to do. You know, I guess that's my, that's where I sit. Maybe when I was 70 years old.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Um,

Speaker 1:          02:43          yeah, people, people have asked me to, you know, like, Hey, if you were president, what would you do? You know, about the situation with the Ron, you know, and their development of nuclear weapons or China getting, you know, making big moves in the south China Sea or Russia pushing the envelope. And, uh, and, and kind of throwing their noses at us. And often I've told them that if I were president, I would immediately nominate Jocko Willink, his secretary of defense. We would change secretary of defense to the previous title of secretary of war. And, uh, and I think those problems would, would disappear immediately. Um, I think if I was president, it'd be very smooth. My policy would be pretty simple. My policy would be kick ass. That's what we would do. Economics. We can do, what's your economic plan? Jocko? Kick ass. Well, what's your, what would you do with this situation over here in the Middle East? Oh, there. Oh yeah. Well we're gonna do theirs. We're gonna kick ass. What about the drug problem that we've got coming in through the borders? Oh, the, the drug cartel. Yeah. We're going to kick ass on that. So that, that's my policy. So this is why I probably wouldn't be the best politician that Kinda like BTF the same thing. Yeah.
