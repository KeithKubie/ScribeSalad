00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.010
Jay, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is more perfect,

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.760
a mini series about the supreme court to begin. By the way,

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.150
I'll will explain the top title of this podcast. At the end.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.060
We live in a democracy with three branches in it,

5
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.700
you've got the executive branch, the legislative branch,

6
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:15.750
and the judicial branch.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.900
Now that third branch did judicial the courts consists of about a hundred ish

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
federal courts and on top of those courts is Ville court. This, this,

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.340
this temple of nine now eight unelected lifetime appointees who seem to have

10
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.530
this tremendous power, almost tyrannical power.

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.140
They are wickedly important and we're reminded of this.

12
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:40.770
Scalia's death throws a huge unknown factor into this campaign.

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.060
Every time we turn on the TV,

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.870
we are one justice away from losing our fundamental rights in this country

15
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.510
because here we are in an election and the phrase that you hear a lot,

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.430
one of the most important things in that election,

17
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:53.280
I think this might be the most important thing to those of you who are young

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.160
outside of today is that one of the most important things.

19
00:00:56.161 --> 00:01:00.000
The next president's going to do this next president may very well a point

20
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
between one and three, four supreme court justices. No, nevermind that.

21
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:06.610
Most Americans have no idea who the justices are.

22
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.400
Two thirds can't even name a single justice.

23
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.080
I can't even name the one that just died.

24
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140
I honestly couldn't tell you any of their names. Okay.

25
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.700
I am either the name of a judge. I know judge Judy, doesn't matter.

26
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.330
<v 1>We all know that whoever they are, they're incredibly powerful people.</v>

27
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.430
Did they can boom instantly strike down a law that took years to pass.

28
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.170
Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the flood

29
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.280
gates. They can undo executive orders.

30
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:36.060
They can even change like these long held definitions like what makes a person,

31
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.570
what makes a marriage? They can even decide an election justice Scalia,

32
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.700
my usual response is get over it.

33
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.140
Get over the possible corrupting of the American President

34
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.340
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

35
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.080
<v 1>Now with all the background chatter in the election,</v>

36
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:56.940
it's sorta interesting to think about the fact that when it comes to the court

37
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.010
in their power, it didn't have to be this way.

38
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.900
It didn't have to be this way and it wasn't for a long time and it wasn't for a

39
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.630
long time. Yeah. Reporter Kelsey paget, we'll take it from here.

40
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.430
I mean if you go back in time,

41
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.540
say like early 18 hundreds the court had so little power.

42
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.050
In fact, they were meeting in the basement of Congress.

43
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.480
That's a Linda monk constitutional scholar.

44
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.720
One newspaper refers to it later as a dark,

45
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:26.460
Dank potato potato. Like it was damn for something.

46
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:28.800
I mean, DC at this time was like a swamp.

47
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.940
So I imagine they were spiders in there and they said there weren't very many

48
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:35.400
windows. Well, maybe it wasn't that bad,

49
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.530
but still we think of three separate branches.

50
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.380
It's kind of hard to think of yourself as a separate branch when you're meeting

51
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.900
in the basement of Congress. Not only that,

52
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.350
when Congress actually sets up the first Supreme Court,

53
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.410
they created originally a supreme court of the six justices.

54
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.410
That's your law professor. Akil Reed. Omar, an even number.

55
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.640
How odd. They were freaked out. Oh, the court could be divided for four.

56
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.100
What's going to happen? Oh my God, that'd be a four four split.

57
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.940
You could [inaudible] supreme court is not designed to function with an even

58
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.340
number of justice. You know, we're,

59
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.870
we're in a crisis or cable news be creating their constitutional crisis

60
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.390
graphics. Originally, the first congress,

61
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.630
they created six members because they're not imagining the court as deciding

62
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:24.430
everything. In other words, like if the court split,

63
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.190
<v 3>who cares? Because at the time they weren't deciding big cases.</v>

64
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:32.670
They weren't deciding like affirmative action, Roe v Wade, nothing like that.

65
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.500
They were nailing like these little tiny rinky-dink cases and most of their time

66
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:42.501
was spent literally riding and carriages from town to town trying cases around

67
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.180
the country and that's a big hassle.

68
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:49.020
They don't even get to sleep in their own bed. Wait, why are they riding around?

69
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.291
Well,

70
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:54.291
so they actually each had a separate geographical zone that they're in charge

71
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:58.740
of. That's actually still true today, but unlike today, wouldn't w where people,

72
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.790
you know, come to the Supreme Court back then, people weren't coming to them.

73
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.710
Why would I do that? That's Ellie, Ellie, Mr. Hall, our legal editor.

74
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.740
Why would I go seek out these guys someplace else to hear my local issue in

75
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.080
South Carolina? If they have something to say about it,

76
00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:19.500
they can come to South Carolina and sit on my farm and talk to me.

77
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.623
We've got to think about the,

78
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.700
about the country in 1800 and 1804 this is a states rights states centric

79
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.300
country, all of which is to say that being a supreme court justice at the time,

80
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.700
it's not a great gig. It's, it's rough.

81
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.540
Consequently that people who chose to do this well

82
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.070
<v 1>I got investments. Ah Yeah,</v>

83
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:44.870
totally Ma and who are like really smart but like a motley crew that isn't

84
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.450
organized. That's all right. Savitsky he's a lawyer.

85
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.610
Constitutional history enthusiast.

86
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.230
He says at the time on the court you had this one guy nicknamed old bacon face

87
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.030
who has is like a maniac.

88
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.350
He's like the kind of like Charlie Sheen wild thing and major league type

89
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.410
character. Very hot tempered, had a foul mouth.

90
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.230
There's another one who um,

91
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.140
you know is like four foot five and like really silent.

92
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.660
The supreme court was like a pretty ragtag bunch.

93
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.980
<v 3>All of this happens and I think it's important for,</v>

94
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.860
for people to understand all of this happens in part because the constitution is

95
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.210
embarrassingly silent on what the Supreme Court is,

96
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.230
what it should do, how it should be constituted. Article Three says,

97
00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:31.730
article three of our United States constitution says there shall be a supreme

98
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:35.780
court. Thanks guys.

99
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.520
It's true. I mean it's kind of weird like if you read the comments

100
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.041
<v 1>institution,</v>

101
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.400
we had spends a lot of time talking about the House of Representatives.

102
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.100
How are you going to count slaves and it's going to be by population.

103
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.220
There has to be a census every 10 years because the house is important. But

104
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.130
<v 3>when it comes to the Supreme Court, all you get is like a couple of sentences,</v>

105
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.070
almost nothing at all. You know, and that's, that's of the puzzle of this.

106
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.030
<v 1>Like how did they get so powerful? I mean,</v>

107
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.550
they started out as, it's like

108
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.780
<v 4>nobody's in a basement and now they're these all powerful,</v>

109
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.750
you know, priests of the Constitution,

110
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.550
the Supreme Court of the United States, nine men and women,

111
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.640
high end government who sit in judgment on many of the great questions before

112
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.690
our nation. So how did that happen?

113
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.823
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

114
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.140
<v 1>especially when there's like arguably nothing in the constitution that said that</v>

115
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:34.920
that should happen. All right, so how did it happen? Well,

116
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.310
you can trace so much of this back to one move by one man,

117
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.260
John Marshall, John Marshall, John Marshall, the new chief justice,

118
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.610
he writes to the court in 1801 Marshall calls his first meeting of the court

119
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.150
and one person shows up. What do you mean the other terror?

120
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.580
They've got something better to do. Like they just don't show up.

121
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.300
Actually it was three, but still, maybe before we go too deep.

122
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.150
Can you just like, what did he look like? Oh, they all looked the same to me.

123
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.140
He didn't mean that he was tall.

124
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.660
He was gone hit a square jaw for jowly piercing eyes.

125
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.370
Marshall was, this was a smart cookie.

126
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.840
And he would need to be because he ends up getting in this very famous fight

127
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.790
with his very famous second cousin that would change the course of the American

128
00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:32.970
history like forever. Who's is a very famous second cousin?

129
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.240
Well it just a little man named Thomas Jefferson.

130
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.500
Oh t J now. John Marshall and Thomas Jefferson. We're here. We really,

131
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.840
really don't like each other.

132
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.880
<v 4>I mean on a personal level you think Hamilton and Jefferson is something on</v>

133
00:07:50.881 --> 00:07:51.420
Broadway?

134
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.420
Actually it was Marshall and Jefferson who really despised each other and yet

135
00:07:57.691 --> 00:07:58.890
they both come from Virginia.

136
00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:02.340
They both come from the back country while the hate,

137
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.550
well I mean part of it was this like family beef at one point.

138
00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:10.551
John Marshall's wife's mother rejected Thomas Jefferson romantically.

139
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.320
Yeah, his wife's mother. Yeah. So he's his mother-in-law. Yeah.

140
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.490
No two the Great Thomas Jefferson. No,

141
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:20.520
but that doesn't seem like enough of a reason. Well I mean, okay,

142
00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:21.780
so the main reason,

143
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.090
<v 1>the non gossipy reason,</v>

144
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:27.480
the non fun reason just because they were an opposite political parties.

145
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.480
I think an important thing to understand about Marshall is that he's a party

146
00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:35.460
man. Okay. Party man. He's a party man. Like he likes to party. Uh,

147
00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:40.290
he, he, he's committed to his team and his team is, um, our, the federalists,

148
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.190
the federalists. They love big government. Let's have a national bank.

149
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.940
It's rev up national power. The Republicans, Thomas Jefferson's people,

150
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.140
they like small, tiny government. Let the states have the power that, you know,

151
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.250
we're maybe even in favor of the view that states can veto federal law if they

152
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.710
don't like it. So these two guys, these two cousins,

153
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.580
<v 7>both national figures, totally different philosophies.</v>

154
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.620
And even before Marshall Hits the court,

155
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.090
<v 1>they're going at it, they beef and they beef and they'd be actually a slug fest.</v>

156
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:13.140
To Paraphrase Marshall, you're dishonest Jefferson. You're a hack Marshall.

157
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.010
You and your friends are poisoning America. Dislike that it's a food fight.

158
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.460
It's very difficult to stop the tendency to view the people that you disagree

159
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:23.850
with as, um, as evil.

160
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.680
Somebody that can take our jobs back, right? Because we're going to hell.

161
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.330
It's just really hard. We do that today all the time. Right? They even as much,

162
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:34.710
if not more than today.

163
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.790
They thought that the other side was trying to destroy the America that they had

164
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:39.624
just created

165
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.880
anyway. Drought, the 1790s the federalists are in power.

166
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.350
The federalist hold all the, you know, branches of government.

167
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.410
John Adams is the president, mostly loved by his own party.

168
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.450
Hated by Thomas Jefferson's party.

169
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.740
They literally call him like his Roatan diddy. Very offensive.

170
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.980
So Adams is a power and ultimately our guy, John Marshall,

171
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.570
Marshall is secretary of state,

172
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:09.990
one of the highest officials in the Adams administration, you know, party man.

173
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.060
And for a while things are going well for his party. But then

174
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.133
1800

175
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:22.770
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

176
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.150
<v 1>Thomas Jefferson and the Republicans sweep in and crush,</v>

177
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.970
absolutely crushed the federalists. Like landslide crush. Yeah,

178
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.710
Fleetwood Mac style.

179
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.860
They're republicans ran the table in 1800 they're going to take over the house.

180
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:41.190
They're going to take over the presidency. So John Adams is like, crap,

181
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.310
what do I do? We need to save the republic.

182
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.730
<v 7>Ah, the federalists have basically been swept out, but in his dire moment,</v>

183
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.460
he has this idea. He's thinking like, Oh, I've lost the house.

184
00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:55.240
I've lost the White House. Oh, this supreme court, the Supreme Court.

185
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.340
And normally nobody cares about the supreme court,

186
00:10:57.341 --> 00:11:00.490
but like in this moment he's thinking, oh my gosh, this is my last hope.

187
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.800
And in fact, as luck would have it,

188
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.910
a vacancy pops up a vacant chief justice position. Um,

189
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.960
so just as justice Scalia's recently died and there's a vacancy, well the,

190
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.430
the sitting chief justice Oliver Ellsworth steps down and Adams picks his

191
00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:20.431
secretary of State John Marshall to be the new chief justice.

192
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.330
That's how we got John Marshall. And John Adams says one other thing

193
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.410
<v 1>in the waning seconds of his presidency,</v>

194
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.580
Adams and these reputed federalists jam through a whole bunch of federal

195
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.450
judgeships.

196
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.110
They create scores of new judges and they throw federalists into almost all of

197
00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:39.850
those positions. Like 40 appointments.

198
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.370
He just throws in 40 judges right at the last minute.

199
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.190
Hollars creates 40 judges at the last minute and then he appoints 40 chairs.

200
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.100
Wow. I fired Jefferson. I would be pissed. Jefferson is pest,

201
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.710
which we'll get to in a second. But the meantime,

202
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.810
Adam says just a few days left in his presidency.

203
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:58.150
So he's like frantically trying to get all these judges in,

204
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.660
nominate these people, confirm that once you confirm someone,

205
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.310
you have to like give them their commission.

206
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.950
You can't just go around claiming you're a judge or claiming or whatever.

207
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.030
You have to have a commission,

208
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:10.660
like a piece of paper with the formal seal and the signature of the president.

209
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.130
And as the story goes, as the clock is striking,

210
00:12:14.131 --> 00:12:16.320
midnight on John Adams's last day,

211
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.100
Adams and his team there in his office and they're trying to get these papers

212
00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:22.890
out the door. They're frantically signing them, stamping them.

213
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.460
I just imagine like young boys sprinting through the dead of night,

214
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.600
he's waving these papers over their head, no commission. The fact that the like,

215
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.660
I think totally Apocryphal story is that Jefferson's attorney general like lots

216
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.550
in the door at midnight and he's like, yeah, put down your pen. You know,

217
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.720
don't do it. So, but apparently some of the commissions don't get delivered.

218
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.200
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

219
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.300
<v 1>they just are left sitting on the desk because,</v>

220
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.790
is it like an oversight or something or clerical error?

221
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.270
It's not even like a click. They just ran out of time. Oh.

222
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.690
But they thought like if a couple are left on the desk, it's no big deal.

223
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.110
If it is like it's a signed commission from the president and it's like still a

224
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:03.990
binding docket. The fact that it wasn't formally delivered, you know,

225
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.400
you still get your appointments.

226
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.300
So this sets up this like kinda terrible situation for Jefferson.

227
00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:14.301
He shows up the next day to take power and the judiciary

228
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:19.150
<v 4>[inaudible] is filled with ghosts of presidential appointees past just</v>

229
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:19.400
[inaudible]

230
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.740
<v 1>bastion of partisan judges.</v>

231
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:25.800
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

232
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.060
<v 4>so as you can imagine, Jefferson and his friends think that this,</v>

233
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:31.140
this is not fair.

234
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:36.290
Jefferson sees Marshall and all of the other judges that Adam's appointed as

235
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.850
Adams, his spies on his administration. So Jefferson,

236
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.390
he decides to immediately retaliate because you know, he won the presidency,

237
00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:46.290
he won by a lot

238
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.230
<v 1>and he's like, you're shoving all these judges down my throat.</v>

239
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.620
And on top of that, the guy you've named to be the head of the judges,

240
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.080
the head of the Supreme Court is my evil second cousin. Whoa. What is this?

241
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.270
So Jefferson is running the country

242
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:00.190
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

243
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.170
<v 1>and working with the Republican Congress too.</v>

244
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.373
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

245
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:09.090
<v 1>Among other things had sold the supreme court term for 1802</v>

246
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.970
they just canceled the whole term. They just canceled it.

247
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.460
They were like say like go home. Yeah. They were like,

248
00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:17.050
there's no more supreme court. Sorry.

249
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.090
Imagine if that happened today when Obama's plan for immigration gets mapped

250
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:22.570
out,

251
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.390
imagine to him like instead of having like that peaceful press conference where

252
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:26.800
he like shows us disappointment.

253
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:31.270
Imagine instead he was like Supreme Court though your room. No good pumps.

254
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.580
That's right. Anyhow, Marshall send away for over a year.

255
00:14:35.581 --> 00:14:38.550
There's no full supreme court meetings and when he comes back,

256
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:43.350
it's pretty clear to him that the supreme court, it's on life support

257
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.690
that the Republicans could pull the plug in any minute.

258
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.900
Marshall knows already that there are there rumblings that one of his

259
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:56.660
colleagues, Amanda man named Chase Old Bacon face,

260
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.860
you know Becca should be impeached.

261
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.960
So when he sees this motley crew and a dark dank potato hall,

262
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.290
he's like, I gotta do something. We're fighting for our life here.

263
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.050
<v 9>I was thinking about this on the way over and it kind of reminds me of,</v>

264
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.470
you know those like summer camp movies where there's like a baseball team and

265
00:15:19.471 --> 00:15:22.200
they're like super ragtag and like can't get it together.

266
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.920
And then like at the end they have to, I play the really good team with the,

267
00:15:25.921 --> 00:15:30.921
like the nice professional uniforms that's kind of like the judges on the

268
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.240
Supreme Court and Marshall is kind of like the counselor or the camper,

269
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.600
you know, with the new kid on the [inaudible]

270
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.520
<v 1>black hoop who comes to the team and is like, we can do this guys. We can do it.</v>

271
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.493
Cue Eighties Movie Training Model

272
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.523
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

273
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.650
<v 1>he knows that if the u s is even going to have a court system of the supreme</v>

274
00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.720
court, he's got a beef this team up.

275
00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.640
One of the first things that Marshall does is just professionalize the

276
00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:04.990
judiciary. Like so for example, he starts this tradition of wearing black robes.

277
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.410
Does that make them look, the part that is appeared in their robes of justice?

278
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.550
He figured that the black robes would make them look less like partisan hacks

279
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.110
and more like

280
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.630
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

281
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.370
<v 1>They're floating above the fray</v>

282
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.060
beyond politics.

283
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.180
<v 4>Next, he moved all the justices into this one door,</v>

284
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.290
the same rooming house. No wives, no family, all business.

285
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.310
He's trying to create that more perfect union in the judiciary.

286
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.980
And just to grease the wheels a little bit, how does somebody wrote my dear?

287
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.500
Is that some wine? Yes. Pod. It's a fortified wine.

288
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.460
Goldman Justice Marshall will order it in great quantities that many scholars

289
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:56.270
think was part of John Marshall Secret.

290
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.030
<v 1>Okay, so he's professionalizing the team, he's getting them together,</v>

291
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:06.390
and then they get put to the test in 1803 it's a cousin on cousins smackdown

292
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.020
<v 2>that's coming up and we continue.</v>

293
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.380
This is more perfect.

294
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.613

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.460
<v 4>Amazing night out and yes, she's coming. The funniest woman in the world.</v>

299
00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.480
Jen Kober. I'm do my hung in the lady forest.

300
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.320
Gen POBA rock's a brand new story. Get tickets.

301
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.280
It's snap judgment.org I've never gotten applause for it before.

302
00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:59.400
If you guys could call my mom, that'd be awesome. She's still pissed.

303
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.610
<v 1>Yay. I'm Jad Abumrad this is more perfect.</v>

304
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.470
Back to our story from Kelsey paget and we arrive at the pivotal moment that

305
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:10.630
cousin on cousin's smackdown that would change America. Okay,

306
00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:14.560
so remember how Ra told us that some of those commissions didn't get delivered?

307
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.870
Yeah,

308
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.090
think five and that they were just like sitting on a desk somewhere and how they

309
00:18:19.091 --> 00:18:22.960
thought it wasn't a big deal because it's still a binding document. Well,

310
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.040
when Jefferson comes to power, apparently he finds those papers and it's like,

311
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.610
oh look at this. You didn't deliver these commissions.

312
00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.520
Guess you can't get those positions. Sorry.

313
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:38.530
And one of the people that I'm lost out because they're commission did not get

314
00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:41.860
delivered was one Mr. William Marbury, whose businessman,

315
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.600
39 years of age, he got appointed to be justice of the peace.

316
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.700
It's a pretty low ranking position.

317
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.220
So he's sitting there and he's waiting for his commission to show up and like,

318
00:18:51.221 --> 00:18:55.240
of course it never does. And it finally dawns on him like, Oh,

319
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.330
the Jefferson administration has it. Aye, I'm going to go get it.

320
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.220
He files a lawsuit. So,

321
00:19:01.221 --> 00:19:04.190
and what he does is he actually ends up being really important,

322
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.540
but he files a lawsuit directly in the Supreme Court. Hey, you can do that.

323
00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:11.830
You can just go right to the supreme court like first. Well,

324
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.130
at this time Congress had just passed a law that said like in certain very

325
00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:19.040
strange circumstances, you can just go directly to the Supreme Court.

326
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:22.460
He goes directly to the Supreme Court and he says, I have a right.

327
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.350
I have a legal right.

328
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.390
I want you the Supreme Court to order Thomas Jefferson.

329
00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:32.450
Give me that darn piece of paper that says I'm really a judge.

330
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.240
The case gets named Marbury v Madison because James Madison is Jefferson

331
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.210
Secretary of state who is actually suing,

332
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.850
but he's essentially suing the president,

333
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.930
forcing Marshall in the court to have this confrontation with Jefferson.

334
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.760
So now it's the showdown. It's between Marshall's Ragtag team and Jefferson

335
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:52.940
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

336
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.590
<v 1>So basically what happens is the court has a trial</v>

337
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.430
Marbury and his lawyers, they get up there and they're like,

338
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.730
what happened to the papers? Where is the commission? Did you have them?

339
00:20:04.731 --> 00:20:06.940
What'd you do with them? Jefferson? The people get up there and say, Bob,

340
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.120
I don't know what you're talking about.

341
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.740
I won't answer the question of what happened to them.

342
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.800
They stonewall to which Marbury's lawyers are like, seriously,

343
00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:15.770
these are all look important. Official documents signed by the president.

344
00:20:15.771 --> 00:20:20.630
Like no one knows what happened in them. They go back and forth, back and forth.

345
00:20:20.631 --> 00:20:24.290
Things get very tense and you know, I mean to their credit, like no one,

346
00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:25.310
like punched out.

347
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.200
Eventually they stop arguing about whether or not the papers exist and they're

348
00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:32.820
like, this is the more important question.

349
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.820
Does the Jefferson administration have to honor those papers?

350
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:39.210
Do they have to give the commission to Marbury? Are they required?

351
00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:41.430
Is there a legal requirement that they give it to them?

352
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.280
And in Marshall's head it's a resounding hell yeah,

353
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.920
he should've gotten that commission because the law is the,

354
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.230
and if you decide you're not going to follow the law just because you don't like

355
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:53.140
the guy who made the law or you don't think it's fair,

356
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.510
<v 3>that's anarchy. I mean that's, we, we talk a lot in this country.</v>

357
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.620
We pat ourselves on the back in this country about our peaceful transfer of

358
00:21:01.621 --> 00:21:02.454
power.

359
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.400
Ellie ms doll again about how we seamlessly can go from one party to another

360
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.680
party without bloodshed in the streets in whatever. Good for us.

361
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.200
But what, how do we actually get to that point?

362
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.610
And this is a key reason why we've gotten to that point because the decisions of

363
00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:20.490
the past administration still hold value.

364
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.460
Even when that administration is kicked out of office,

365
00:21:23.461 --> 00:21:26.250
kind of overthrown by popular vote.

366
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.600
Their decisions still have still have sway, still have a legal force.

367
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:36.260
Jefferson was quite obviously negating that.

368
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.110
<v 1>So Marshall wants to say to Jefferson, you know, suck it up cousin.</v>

369
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.310
You have this guy whose papers, you're an official do your job,

370
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.600
but he thinks twice.

371
00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:49.130
He understands how weak his court is according to to kill a Mar.

372
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.600
Marshall's afraid that if he orders Jefferson to give over those papers,

373
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.410
Jefferson is going to straight up laugh in his face and say you and what army,

374
00:21:55.411 --> 00:21:56.280
I'm not going to do it.

375
00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:00.960
Literally they just got back from a congressionally mandated.

376
00:22:00.961 --> 00:22:02.700
You can't come to work time.

377
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.780
<v 3>Jefferson knows full well that he has no intention of granting that commission.</v>

378
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:12.590
He will never give that commission. Jefferson knows this, Marshall knows this.

379
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.830
Marshall knows that if he tells Jefferson to give him the commission,

380
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.550
Jefferson is going to ignore him and then the power of the supreme court

381
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.650
basically evaporates because Ellie says like if you think about it,

382
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.860
if the executive branch is going to say kind of right at the jump that if you

383
00:22:27.861 --> 00:22:30.920
make a decision they don't like, I'm just going to ignore that.

384
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:36.260
Then every executive branch going on from Jefferson throughout the rest of our

385
00:22:36.261 --> 00:22:40.370
history is going to just ignore the supreme court when the Supreme Court does

386
00:22:40.371 --> 00:22:42.380
something that the executive doesn't like.

387
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.540
<v 1>So basically Marshall's kind of stuck</v>

388
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:47.990
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

389
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.670
<v 7>if he rules for Jefferson,</v>

390
00:22:49.671 --> 00:22:52.460
he's selling out the law and he's going to make the court look weak.

391
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.110
If he rules against

392
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.580
Jefferson Jefferson's gonna ignore the court and they're going to look weak.

393
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.060
Either way, Jefferson wins and either way,

394
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.390
supreme court maybe disappears forever.

395
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.770
Marshall needed to find a way to get through this.

396
00:23:09.771 --> 00:23:13.100
He needed to find some way to kick this case. To be clear,

397
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.820
John Marshall is running away from a fight with Thomas Jefferson.

398
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.060
He says all sorts of things, but he knows the Thomas Jefferson,

399
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.370
<v 1>you know, straight up has more power and so he's retreating. Wow.</v>

400
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.420
It's like suddenly feels like an apocalyptical moment. Yeah. What does he do?

401
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.800
Well, so the thing that he does,

402
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.910
it's like the most Jedi mastering thing ever.

403
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.050
<v 7>He writes this hundred something page decision and in the beginning if you</v>

404
00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:43.380
actually read the decision, it's a lot of pages of telling Jefferson

405
00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:45.980
how he's

406
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.110
<v 4>wrong, how he can't do what he did,</v>

407
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.880
how he is, you know, ruining America. Right.

408
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.880
There's a lot of that and the Marshall decision,

409
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.570
but then when he gets to the matter at hand, he does this little

410
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.920
<v 1>shift. So he says, okay, hold up.</v>

411
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.850
Yes Marbury is right. He should've gotten that commission.

412
00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:12.240
And yes, Mr. Jefferson should not be doing this,

413
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.190
but we the supreme court, we don't have jurisdiction to hear this case.

414
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:18.820
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

415
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.220
<v 1>Courtney is to have the power to hear a case and if a court doesn't have the</v>

416
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:26.300
power to hear a case, even if you're completely right,

417
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.470
even if your position is right, you can't get relief. Wait,

418
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:35.360
why would he say that they don't have jurisdiction with this is like where he

419
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:36.770
uses the force. You know,

420
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.120
earlier I had mentioned that Marbury brought this case under a law congress had

421
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:44.300
passed that said Marbury could come straight to the supreme court,

422
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.570
like for this kind of situation. Well, John Marshall,

423
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:50.540
he goes back to his constitution. He's reading around, he's like, guys,

424
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.000
I'm trying to figure out like what he can do here.

425
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.480
And he finds his little sentence. Yeah. So it's article three,

426
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:59.540
section two in the constitution that says like,

427
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.420
basically you're not supposed to go to the supreme court first.

428
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:06.440
You're supposed to go to a different court and then the supreme court,

429
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:09.500
it's an appeals court. Wonky. Exactly. But,

430
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.510
but he basically tells Marbury the plaintiff,

431
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.540
you came in and you came to the Supreme Court first and you did that because

432
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.180
Congress passed a law that said that you could come to the supreme court first,

433
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.130
but the constitution says that you can't come to the supreme court first.

434
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.310
So I can't help you. Nope. It's not your fault, Mr Marbury.

435
00:25:28.311 --> 00:25:31.880
But that law was unconstitutional and we're not going to follow that

436
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:34.250
unconstitutional directive. So you see what he did there?

437
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.160
<v 11>Aye,</v>

438
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.020
<v 1>maybe. I see. I don't know if I see, you know,</v>

439
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.470
that part in star wars was a week.

440
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.210
The first one where Obi wan Kenobi is fighting with Darth Vader. And he says,

441
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:52.460
<v 4>strike me, Don. All powerful. Anyone possibly imagined</v>

442
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.430
this is like that,

443
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.740
<v 1>but real Marshall is agreeing to lose.</v>

444
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.250
He's like found this way to lose to like let Darth Vader strike him down and

445
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.260
that's actually gonna make it more powerful.

446
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:07.480
He's basically saying to his cousin, Oh, okay,

447
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.940
you don't have to give my braise commission.

448
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.750
And the reason you don't have to give my RIAs commission is a cause that law

449
00:26:13.751 --> 00:26:16.750
doesn't work because we, the court,

450
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.460
we get to decide when something agrees with or doesn't agree with constitution.

451
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.880
So like Kratz UN cousin, Oh and by the way,

452
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.320
<v 4>we, the court have the power to declare things unconstitutional.</v>

453
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.960
That was the sort of Jedi master move. That's the move.

454
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.760
Instead of jumping off the cliff for laying down,

455
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:37.790
he jukes to the right and he establishes a new rule of the game unconstitutional

456
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.220
<v 7>inside this one highly technical,</v>

457
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:50.820
highly political drama between these two cousins.

458
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.750
John Marshall sneaks in an atomic bomb.

459
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.270
This incredible power

460
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:59.080
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

461
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.680
<v 7>and in Marshall's decision you wrote is some Fadli the duty and provenance of</v>

462
00:27:02.681 --> 00:27:05.860
the judicial department to say what the law is.

463
00:27:05.861 --> 00:27:10.300
Say what the law is to say what the law is, and with those words,

464
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.070
he made the court what it is today.

465
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.700
<v 12>The U S Supreme Court ruled Monday a law allowing Americans born in Jerusalem to</v>

466
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:22.140
list Israel as their place of birth is unconstitutional, is unconstitutional.

467
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.740
Now Doma is ruled unconstitutional, unconstitutional, unconstitutional,

468
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.810
unconstitutional, and no one had ever done that before. Well,

469
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.630
I mean like people talked about it,

470
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.320
lots of theories about it in some smaller courts, smaller decisions,

471
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.930
but this is the first time that the supreme court does it and he does it in the

472
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:41.070
face of the president.

473
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:42.843
<v 7>Just wait,</v>

474
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.031
<v 13>Ernesto,</v>

475
00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:48.920
a Miranda petitioner versus Arizona connection against the United States

476
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.450
<v 7>that set us on this path.</v>

477
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.780
<v 13>New York Times company, petitioner versus lb</v>

478
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.340
<v 7>day. The court is so much more powerful.</v>

479
00:27:57.341 --> 00:28:01.600
It's grown into the 800 pound gorilla. When it slam says jump.

480
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:06.310
Other branches tend to say how high we'll hear argument now a number,

481
00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.950
oh nine 49 George W.

482
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.920
Bush and Richard [inaudible] were just taking for granted three words.

483
00:28:11.921 --> 00:28:15.700
Bush v Gore. They decided to presidential election and and no one blinked.

484
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.260
<v 15>Let me just jump in for one second. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you could be,</v>

485
00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:31.460
if we have to say this before we close,

486
00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:35.420
you could reasonably argue that Marbury versus Madison was not the big moment

487
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.040
when the court got its power because it really depends on what you mean when you

488
00:28:40.041 --> 00:28:40.874
say power.

489
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.290
Like I guess we were talking with our legal editor, Ellie, Ms [inaudible],

490
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.890
constitutional scholar, Linda monk. They both said like,

491
00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:53.400
look at what happens after this case. Just 30 years down the road, ish.

492
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.800
John Marshall's still the chief justice.

493
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:59.100
He gets into a dustup with Andrew Jackson and this is Jackson we're talking

494
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:00.450
about. So generally it was,

495
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.870
I would like to do horrible things to native Americans, and the court was like,

496
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.300
you probably shouldn't do horrible things than native Americans.

497
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.530
And Jackson was like, shut up.

498
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.160
I don't remember asking you a God damn thing to essentially you had a situation

499
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:16.980
where Marshall makes a ruling saying we have to respect native American

500
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:20.880
sovereignty. And Andrew Jackson famously said, oh, supposedly said,

501
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:22.620
we don't know if that's true. Oh look,

502
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:25.920
I think it's more fun to believe that Jackson did say that it works better than

503
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:30.420
the musical. Okay. The court has made its ruling. Now let them enforce it.

504
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.200
John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it and obviously he

505
00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:38.270
couldn't. So to make a long set story short, you get the trail of tears.

506
00:29:38.271 --> 00:29:40.850
Thousands of native Americans were marched off their lands.

507
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.130
There's evidence that

508
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.430
<v 0>they were purposefully moved during the winter so that more people would die</v>

509
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:49.870
along the way. So while the court maybe had constitutional authority,

510
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.730
it didn't have actual power

511
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:57.350
<v 10>until we just got here on this end that the students are fast forward to the</v>

512
00:29:57.871 --> 00:30:01.470
1950s court order schools to desegregate, they don't.

513
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.660
And the president sends him the troops,

514
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.430
takes Eisenhower directing the youtube groups on the putting boots on the

515
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.450
ground, picks Kennedy

516
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.570
<v 0>of Alabama National God-man,</v>

517
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.340
<v 3>putting boots on the ground takes force.</v>

518
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
It's still so often comes down to an executive willing to put boots on the

519
00:30:21.951 --> 00:30:24.410
ground in order to enforce their laws.

520
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.610
<v 0>That's when the power becomes real.</v>

521
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:29.263
<v 3>Although maybe not</v>

522
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:30.900
<v 15>la, I don't know.</v>

523
00:30:30.901 --> 00:30:35.901
A time before I went to college and even shortly after I was in college where

524
00:30:36.991 --> 00:30:39.270
things were not separate.

525
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.240
<v 0>At one point as we were working on the story,</v>

526
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.190
Ellie talked to his mom and she told him that when she was growing up in the mid

527
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.710
sixties, and this is years after desegregation,

528
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:53.090
more than a decade past Brown v Board, you would still never know what happened.

529
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.950
<v 15>No one would know it. And Clarksdale,</v>

530
00:30:54.951 --> 00:30:58.580
Mississippi at that time there was a public library,

531
00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.300
but I was not allowed to go to that library. My father,

532
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.480
who was Chinese, could go into the library.

533
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:10.510
So many times I sit in the car while that went into a library to get a book that

534
00:31:10.731 --> 00:31:11.564
I wanted.

535
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.830
<v 3>And this is, this is after the passage of the Civil Rights Act even. Yes.</v>

536
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.810
<v 15>I'm saying high school. I graduated in 67</v>

537
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:25.650
<v 3>67. Wow. Just yesterday as we're recording this, um, uh,</v>

538
00:31:25.651 --> 00:31:30.651
court had to issue a current court had to issue a nother ruling ordering a town

539
00:31:30.751 --> 00:31:34.190
in Mississippi to desegregate its schools. Yeah. That,

540
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:38.430
that didn't happen five years ago. Then how that happened yesterday, man,

541
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.880
yesterday, the courts can make these laws,

542
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.480
but if the people aren't willing to go along with it,

543
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.880
<v 16>then what do these laws mean?</v>

544
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.170
I think ultimately I agree with learning hand.

545
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:57.390
He was a judge in New York in the early 19 hundreds that we place our hopes too

546
00:31:57.391 --> 00:32:00.480
much upon laws and courts and constitutions,

547
00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:05.070
that these are false hopes. Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women,

548
00:32:05.071 --> 00:32:08.340
and when it dies, there no law, no court, no constitution can save it.

549
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:11.770
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

550
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.080
<v 0>in the end, for better or worse, we,</v>

551
00:32:16.081 --> 00:32:17.550
the people still have the power.

552
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.453
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

553
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:24.763
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

554
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.233
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

555
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.653
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

556
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:37.930
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

557
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:38.111
<v 0>okay,</v>

558
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:41.870
so why do we call this podcast the strange thing we called it as it turns out,

559
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:45.530
well, I guess we mentioned this at the top. Vast majority of Americans,

560
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:49.190
like 66% cannot name a single supreme court justice.

561
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.470
We also found that when we went out,

562
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.010
a lot of people had no idea how many justices.

563
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.170
<v 18>I do not know how many Supreme Court justices that, I'm not sure.</v>

564
00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:03.050
12 or a couple of hundred. One Sarah, seven Supreme Court judges,

565
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.010
<v 0>maybe 12, nine, nine. Yes. We'll know eight.</v>

566
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.070
Uh, we think we should know about these people.

567
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.690
We should at least know their names.

568
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.720
So the title of this podcast is a pneumonic device to help you remember the

569
00:33:18.181 --> 00:33:22.680
names of the justices. So their last names are Kagan,

570
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.120
Kennedy, Thomas Ginsburg, briars. Sorry, Briar,

571
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:31.980
no s there, Roberts, Alito and Sotomayor. And if Merrick garland gets on,

572
00:33:31.981 --> 00:33:35.620
then you've also got garland, Kagan, Kennedy, Thomas Ginsburg, Briar Roberts,

573
00:33:35.621 --> 00:33:40.600
Alito, Stoudamire, maybe garland. So first letter, last name, k, k,

574
00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:43.090
t. G. B. R. A. S, maybe g.

575
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.940
What if we turn that into a song to help you remember

576
00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.190
<v 18>kittens, tick Kigali, blue robot all cellar.</v>

577
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.120

<v 18>Can you kittens? Giggly boo robot all sober.</v>

579
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.520

604
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.040
Back to our story from Kelsey Padgett and we arrive at the pivotal moment that

605
00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:36.200
cousin on cousin's smackdown that would change America. Okay,

606
00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:40.130
so remember how Ra told us that some of those commissions didn't get delivered,

607
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:44.660
think five and that they were just like sitting on a desk somewhere and how they

608
00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:48.530
thought it wasn't a big deal because it's still a binding document. Well,

609
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:52.610
when Jefferson comes to power, apparently he finds those papers and it's like,

610
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:56.180
oh look at this, you didn't deliver these commissions,

611
00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.120
guess you can't get those positions. Sorry.

612
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.610
And one of the people that um,

613
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.540
lost out because they're commissioned and not get delivered was one Mr. William

614
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:10.400
Marbury, he is a businessman, 39 years of age,

615
00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.270
he got appointed to be justice of the peace. It's a pretty low ranking position.

616
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.820
So he's sitting there and he's waiting for his commission to show up and like,

617
00:37:16.821 --> 00:37:20.810
of course it never does. And it finally dawns on him like, Oh,

618
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.910
the Jefferson administration has it. Aye, I'm going to go get it.

619
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.800
He files a lawsuit. So,

620
00:37:26.801 --> 00:37:29.770
and what he does is he actually ends up being really important,

621
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.120
but he follows the lawsuit directly in the Supreme Court. You can do that.

622
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:38.140
You can just go right to the supreme court. Like first at this time,

623
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:42.010
Congress had just passed a law that said like in certain very strange

624
00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:44.650
circumstances, you can just go directly to the Supreme Court.

625
00:37:44.651 --> 00:37:48.040
He goes directly to the Supreme Court and he says, I have a right.

626
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:49.930
I have a legal right.

627
00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:54.970
I want you the Supreme Court to order Thomas Jefferson.

628
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.030
Give me that darn piece of paper that says I'm really a judge.

629
00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.810
The case gets named Marbury v Madison because James Madison is Jefferson

630
00:38:01.811 --> 00:38:03.790
Secretary of state who is actually suing,

631
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.430
but he's essentially suing the president,

632
00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:10.510
forcing Marshall in the court to have this confrontation with Jefferson.

633
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.400
So now it's the showdown. It's between Marshall's rag tag team and Jefferson

634
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.450
[inaudible].

635
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:23.200
So basically what happens is the court has a trial

636
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.010
Marbury and his lawyers, they get up there and they're like,

637
00:38:27.011 --> 00:38:30.310
what happened to the papers? Where is the commission? Did you have them?

638
00:38:30.311 --> 00:38:32.570
What'd you do with them? Jefferson people get up there and say, man,

639
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.700
I don't know what you're talking about. I won't answer the question.

640
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.750
What happened them? They stonewall to which Marbury's lawyers are like,

641
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.381
seriously,

642
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:41.350
these are all like important official documents signed by the president.

643
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:45.520
Like no one knows what happened in them. Like it's like they go back and forth,

644
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:49.270
back and forth. Things get very tense and you know, I mean to their credit,

645
00:38:49.271 --> 00:38:50.890
like no one like punched out.

646
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:56.770
Eventually they stop arguing about whether or not the papers exist and they're

647
00:38:56.771 --> 00:38:58.390
like, this is the more important question.

648
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.390
Does the Jefferson administration have to honor those papers?

649
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:04.780
Do they have to give the commission to Marbury? Are they required?

650
00:39:04.781 --> 00:39:07.000
Is there a legal requirement that they give it to them?

651
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.850
And in Marshall's head it's a resounding hell yeah,

652
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.820
he should've gotten that commission because the law is the law.

653
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.790
And if you decide you're not going to follow the law just because you don't like

654
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:18.700
the guy who made the law or you don't think it's fair,

655
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.080
<v 3>that's anarchy. I mean that's, we, we talk a lot in this country.</v>

656
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.220
We pat ourselves on the back in this country about our peaceful transfer of

657
00:39:27.221 --> 00:39:28.054
power,

658
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:32.030
Ellie ms doll again about how we seamlessly can go from one party to the other

659
00:39:32.031 --> 00:39:36.260
party without bloodshed in the streets and whatever, Eh, good for us.

660
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.780
But what, how do we actually get to that point?

661
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:43.190
And this is a key reason why we've gotten to that point because the decisions of

662
00:39:43.191 --> 00:39:46.040
the past administration still hold the value.

663
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.040
Even when that administration is kicked out of office,

664
00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:51.830
kind of overthrown by popular vote,

665
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.150
their decisions still have still have sway, still have a legal force.

666
00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:01.520
Jefferson was quite obviously uh,

667
00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.413
negating that.

668
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:06.690
<v 1>So Marshall wants to say to Jefferson, you know, suck it up, cousin,</v>

669
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:11.160
give this guy his papers. You're an official, do your job. But he thinks twice.

670
00:40:11.161 --> 00:40:13.710
He understands how weak his court is. According to Kiel.

671
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:17.160
Amar Marshall is afraid that if he orders Jefferson to give over those papers,

672
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:21.000
Jefferson is going to straight up laugh in his face and see you and what army,

673
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:21.870
I'm not going to do it.

674
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.520
Literally they just got back from a congressionally mandated.

675
00:40:26.521 --> 00:40:28.260
You can't come to work time.

676
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.340
<v 3>Jefferson knows full well that he has no intention of granting that commission.</v>

677
00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:38.180
He will never give that commission. Jefferson knows this, Marshall knows this.

678
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.420
Marshall knows that if he tells Jefferson to give him the commission,

679
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:45.140
Jefferson is going to ignore him and then the power of the supreme court

680
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.230
basically evaporates because Ellie says like if you think about it,

681
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.440
if the executive branch is going to say kind of right at the jump that if you

682
00:40:53.441 --> 00:40:56.500
make a decision they don't like, I'm just going to ignore that.

683
00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.840
Then every executive branch going on from Jefferson throughout the rest of our

684
00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:05.950
history is going to just ignore this important court when the supreme court does

685
00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:07.960
something that the executive doesn't like.

686
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.120
<v 1>So basically Marshall's kind of stuck</v>

687
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:13.600
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

688
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.250
<v 1>if he rules for Jefferson,</v>

689
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:18.040
he's selling out the law and he's going to make the court look weak.

690
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.660
If you rules against

691
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.160
Jefferson Jefferson's gonna ignore the court and they're going to look weak.

692
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.640
Either way, Jefferson wins and either way,

693
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:30.970
supreme court maybe disappears forever.

694
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.360
Marshall needed to find a way to get through this.

695
00:41:35.361 --> 00:41:38.690
He needed to find some way to kick this case. To be clear,

696
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.380
John Marshall is running away from a fight with Thomas Jefferson.

697
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.010
He says all sorts of things that he knows the Thomas Jefferson, you know,

698
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:49.940
straight up has more power and so he's retreating. Wow.

699
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.490
It's like suddenly feels like an apocalyptical moment. Yeah.

700
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.370
What does he do well, so the thing that he does,

701
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.480
it's like the most Jedi masters thing ever.

702
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.660
<v 4>He writes this hundred something page decision and in the beginning if you</v>

703
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:08.990
actually read the decision, it's a lot of pages of telling Jefferson

704
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:13.670
how he's wrong, how he can't do what he did,

705
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.470
how he is, you know, ruining America. Right.

706
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.470
There's a lot of that in the Marshall decision,

707
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:25.160
but then when it gets to the matter at hand, he does this little

708
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.510
<v 1>shift. So he says, okay, hold up.</v>

709
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:35.580
Yes Marbury is right. He should have gotten that commission. And yes,

710
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.960
Mr. Jefferson should not be doing this, but we the supreme court,

711
00:42:39.961 --> 00:42:42.750
we don't have jurisdiction to hear this case.

712
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.820
Court needs to have the power to hear a case and have a court doesn't have the

713
00:42:47.821 --> 00:42:51.870
power to hear a case. Even if you're completely right,

714
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:56.070
and even if your position is right, you can't get relief. Wait.

715
00:42:56.071 --> 00:42:59.700
Why would he say that they don't have jurisdiction with [inaudible]?

716
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.340
This is like where he uses the force. You know,

717
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.690
earlier I had mentioned that Marbury brought this case under a law congress had

718
00:43:06.691 --> 00:43:09.870
passed that said Marbury could come straight to the supreme court,

719
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.140
like for this kind of situation. Well, John Marshall,

720
00:43:13.141 --> 00:43:15.090
he goes back to his constitution, he's reading around,

721
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.590
he's like guys trying to figure out like what he can do here and he finds this

722
00:43:19.591 --> 00:43:22.050
little sentence. So it's article three,

723
00:43:22.051 --> 00:43:26.880
section two in the constitution that says like basically you're not supposed to

724
00:43:26.881 --> 00:43:27.990
go to the supreme court first.

725
00:43:27.991 --> 00:43:32.010
You're supposed to go to a different court and then the supreme court,

726
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.060
it's an appeals court. [inaudible] exactly. But,

727
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.080
but he basically tells Marbury the plaintiff,

728
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:42.110
you came in and you came to the Supreme Court first and you did that because

729
00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.750
Congress passed a law that said that you could come to the supreme court first.

730
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:50.700
But the constitution says that you can't come to the supreme court first.

731
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.860
So I can't help you. Nope, it's not your fault, Mr Marbury.

732
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.480
But that law was unconstitutional and we're not going to follow that

733
00:43:57.481 --> 00:43:59.820
unconstitutional directive. So you see what he did there?

734
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.880
I maybe I see it. I don't know if I see, okay,

735
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.260
so with you that you know that part in star wars,

736
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.800
<v 4>it was a week old man.</v>

737
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.800
The first one where Obi wan Kenobi is fighting with Darth Vader. And he says,

738
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.020
strike me. [inaudible] powerful. Possibly. Imagine

739
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.020
this is like that.

740
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.760
<v 1>But Real Marshall is agreeing to lose. He's like,</v>

741
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:28.700
found this way to lose to like let Darth Vader strike him down.

742
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.830
That's actually gonna make it more powerful.

743
00:44:30.831 --> 00:44:32.250
He's basically saying to his cousin,

744
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 7>Oh, okay, you don't have to give Marbury's commission.</v>

745
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.330
And the reason you don't have to give Barbara his commission is a cause that law

746
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:42.360
doesn't work because we, the court,

747
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:47.040
we get to decide when something agrees with or doesn't agree with constitution.

748
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.460
So like, congrats, you win cousin. Oh, and by the way,

749
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.910
<v 4>we, the court have the power to declare things unconstitutional.</v>

750
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.520
That was the sort of Jedi master move. That's the move.

751
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.790
Instead of jumping off the cliff or laying down you jukes to the right and he

752
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:03.750
establishes a new rule of the game. Are you constitutional?

753
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.293
[inaudible]

754
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.810
<v 12>inside this one, highly technical,</v>

755
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:15.600
highly political drama between these

756
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.340
<v 7>two cousins. John Marshall sneaks in an atomic bomb.</v>

757
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.860
This incredible power

758
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.330
in Marshall's decision he wrote is some Fadli the duty and province of the

759
00:45:28.331 --> 00:45:32.600
judicial department to say what the law is. Say what the law is,

760
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.350
<v 12>say what the law is,</v>

761
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.650
<v 7>and with those words he made the court what it is today.</v>

762
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.280
<v 12>The US Supreme Court ruled Monday a law allowing Americans born in Jerusalem to</v>

763
00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:47.720
list Israel as their place of birth is unconstitutional, is unconstitutional.

764
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.320
Now Doma is ruled unconstitutional, unconstitutional, unconstitutional,

765
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.340
unconstitutional, and no one had ever done that before. Well,

766
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.210
I mean like people talked about it,

767
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.900
lots of theories about it and some smaller courts, smaller decisions.

768
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:05.510
But this is the first time that the supreme court does it and he does it in the

769
00:46:05.511 --> 00:46:08.500
face of the president against wait,

770
00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.611
<v 13>Ernesto,</v>

771
00:46:09.611 --> 00:46:14.530
a Miranda petitioner versus Arizona connection against the United States

772
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.030
<v 7>that set us on this path.</v>

773
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.360
<v 13>New York time was coming from the petitioner versus lb</v>

774
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.920
<v 7>day. The court is so much more powerful.</v>

775
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:27.150
It's grown into the 800 pound gorilla when it slam says jump.

776
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.890
Other branches tend to say how high we'll hear argument now. A number,

777
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.530
oh nine 49 George W.

778
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.280
Bush and Richard [inaudible] just taking for granted three words. Bush v Gore.

779
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.280
They decided the presidential election and, and no one blinked.

780
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.830
<v 0>Let me just jump in for one second. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you could be,</v>

781
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.040
if we have to say this before we close,

782
00:46:57.041 --> 00:47:01.000
you could reasonably argue that Marbury versus Madison was not the big moment

783
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:05.620
when the court got its power because it really depends on what you mean when you

784
00:47:05.621 --> 00:47:09.060
say power immediate.

785
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.870
Like I guess we were talking with our legal editor, la Ms Stalin,

786
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.460
constitutional scholar, Linda monk. They both said like,

787
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:19.000
look at what happens after this case. Just 30 years down the road, ish.

788
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:21.400
John Marshall's still the chief justice.

789
00:47:21.401 --> 00:47:23.500
He gets into a dustup with Andrew Jackson

790
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.010
<v 7>and this is Jackson we're talking about. So generally it was,</v>

791
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.470
I would like to do horrible things to native Americans. And the court was like,

792
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:30.070
you probably

793
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.590
<v 3>shouldn't do horrible things than native Americans. And Jackson was like,</v>

794
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:33.424
shut up.

795
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.840
I don't remember asking you a God damn thing.

796
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.490
<v 15>So essentially you had a situation where Marshall makes a ruling saying we have</v>

797
00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:45.330
to respect native American sovereignty. And Andrew Jackson famously said, oh,

798
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.730
supposedly said, we don't know if that's true.

799
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.211
<v 3>Oh look,</v>

800
00:47:48.211 --> 00:47:51.480
I think it's more fun to believe that Jackson did say that it works better than

801
00:47:51.481 --> 00:47:56.010
the musical. The court has made its ruling now let them enforce it.

802
00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.990
<v 15>John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it,</v>

803
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.710
and obviously he couldn't. So to make a long set story short,

804
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:03.850
you get the trail of tears.

805
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:06.430
Thousands of native Americans were marched off their lands.

806
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.120
There's evidence that they were purposefully moved during the winter so that

807
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:11.980
more people would die along the way.

808
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.460
So while the court maybe had constitutional authority,

809
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:17.290
it didn't have actual power

810
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.410
<v 10>until, oh wait, that's got a ring on it.</v>

811
00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:25.330
And the students are fast forward to the 1950s court orders,

812
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:29.240
schools to desegregate, they don't and the president sends them the troops,

813
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:30.440
takes Eisenhower,

814
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.640
Jackie's order directing the use of under putting boots on the ground picks

815
00:48:34.641 --> 00:48:35.380
Kennedy,

816
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.910
<v 15>the Alabama National Godman, putting boots on the ground takes force.</v>

817
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:45.590
<v 3>It's still so often comes down to an executive willing to put boots on the</v>

818
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:49.990
ground in order to enforce their laws.

819
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:55.370
<v 15>That's when the power becomes real. Although maybe not la,</v>

820
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:56.480
I don't know.

821
00:48:56.481 --> 00:49:01.481
A time before I went to college and even shortly after I was in college where

822
00:49:02.571 --> 00:49:06.830
things were not separate. At one point as we were working on the story,

823
00:49:06.831 --> 00:49:11.780
Ellie talked to his mom and she told him that when she was growing up in the mid

824
00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.300
sixties and this is years after desegregation,

825
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.680
more than a decade past Brown v Board, you would still never know what happened.

826
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:23.570
No one would know it and Clark said Mississippi at that time there was a public

827
00:49:23.571 --> 00:49:27.890
library, but I was not allowed to go to that library. My father,

828
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.070
who was Chinese, could go into the library.

829
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:36.100
So many times I sit in the car lot that went into the library to get a book that

830
00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:37.154
I wanted.

831
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:42.410
<v 3>And this is, this is after the passage of the Civil Rights Act even. Yes.</v>

832
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:47.840
I'm saying high school. I graduated in 67 67. Wow.

833
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:51.050
Just yesterday as we're recording this, um,

834
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:55.790
a court had to issue a current court had to issue a nother ruling ordering a

835
00:49:55.791 --> 00:49:59.780
town in Mississippi to desegregate its schools. Yeah. That,

836
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.590
that didn't happen five years ago. They didn't have it. That happened yesterday,

837
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:07.460
man. Yesterday. The courts can make these laws,

838
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.060
but if the people aren't willing to go along with it,

839
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.473
<v 16>what do these laws mean?</v>

840
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.750
I think ultimately I agree with learning hand.

841
00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:22.970
He was a judge in New York in the early 19 hundreds that we place our hopes too

842
00:50:22.971 --> 00:50:27.971
much upon laws and courts and constitutions that these are hopes

843
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.970
<v 0>liberty lies in the hearts of men and women. And when it dies, there are no law,</v>

844
00:50:31.971 --> 00:50:33.920
no court, no constitution can save it.

845
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.360
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

846
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:41.640
<v 0>in the end, for better or worse, we,</v>

847
00:50:41.641 --> 00:50:43.140
the people still have the power.

848
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:46.743
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

849
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.333
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

850
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.393
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

851
00:50:58.450 --> 00:50:59.283
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

852
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:03.460
<v 17>[inaudible].</v>

853
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:03.701
<v 0>Okay,</v>

854
00:51:03.701 --> 00:51:07.450
so why do we call this podcast the strange thing we called it as it turns out,

855
00:51:07.451 --> 00:51:11.110
well, I guess we mentioned this at the top. Vast majority of Americans,

856
00:51:11.111 --> 00:51:14.770
like 66% cannot name a single supreme court justice.

857
00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:18.970
We also found that when we went out, a lot of people had no idea how many

858
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.090
<v 18>justices there are. I do not know how many Supreme Court justices that,</v>

859
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:26.480
I'm not sure, even 12 or a couple of hundred.

860
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:28.610
One there are seven supreme court judges,

861
00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:33.590
<v 0>maybe 12, nine, nine. Yes. Well, no, eight.</v>

862
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.650
Uh, we think we should know about these people.

863
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.270
We should at least know their names.

864
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:43.300
So the title of this podcast is a pneumonic device to help you remember the

865
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:48.260
names of the justices. So their last names are Kagan,

866
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.970
Kennedy, Thomas Ginsburg, briars. Sorry, Briar. No.

867
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.560
S they're Roberts, Alito and Sotomayor. And if Merrick garland gets on,

868
00:51:57.561 --> 00:52:01.190
then you've also got garland, Kagan, Kennedy, Thomas Ginsburg, Briar Roberts,

869
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:06.170
Alito Sotomayer, maybe garland. So first letter, last name, k, k.

870
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:08.690
T. G. B. R. A. S. Maybe g.

871
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:11.510
What if we turn that into a song to help you remember

872
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:16.223
kids,

873
00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:19.630
<v 18>you can live to robot seller,</v>

874
00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.720

876
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:31.740

878
00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:41.820
maybe Goddamn kittens kicked the robot.

[inaudible] Baby Goddamn kittens taper.

880

Oh, sorry, baby kittens.
