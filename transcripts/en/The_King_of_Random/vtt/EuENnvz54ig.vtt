00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.140
Hey guys, I'm Nate, and welcome back to the workshop!

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.400
Today, we're going to try our hand at something called hydro dipping.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.880
Hydro dipping is a process by which a tint is sprayed onto the surface of a fluid, usually water...

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.720
...and then the object that you're trying to paint is passed through it!

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.860
All the paint or ink gets applied evenly to the surface of whatever it is you're painting...

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.659
...even if it has an uneven texture or little bits of in's and out's to it.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.080
We're going to see if we can replicate the effects of hydro dipping by using spray paint...

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.200
...and a large bucket which we'll fill up with water.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.140
To start off, I've got this little squirt gun, and we're gonna see if we can change the colors of it to something entirely different.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.689
If there are any parts that we don't want to change the color of, we do want to mask those off using some tape.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
On this gun, I think I'll mask off the trigger and just the opening where the water squirts out.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.740
Our gun is now taped off in the spots we want to be, but before we start dipping into spray paint in the water...

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.460
...I'm gonna hit it with a layer of primer to really help make sure that all of our colored spray paint is going to stick to it well.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.280
All right, the layer of primer on our little plastic squirt gun has now dried,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.080
so I think we're ready to try dipping it into the water after we add some paint.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.980
So I think the first thing we have to do is choose a good color scheme.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.620
For this gun, we're gonna try using red and yellow and the general idea of how to do this...

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.900
...is to spray one color in and then spray the other color down inside the sort of circle that we'll have formed in the water.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.080
If you want the effects to have a lot more layers and lines in it, you can switch back and forth several times

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.780
Alright, here goes!

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.620
That looks pretty good. The paint will now coalesce a little bit more into the center.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.000
And I'm gonna just try and dip it right into this area with all of the stripes.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.540
Let's see how this goes...

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.520
Keeping the gun pushed slowly down through the paint, and now that it's all the way under the water...

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.940
...I'm gonna swirl away all of the extra paint on the surface so that as I pull it out...

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.600
...It's not gonna pick up more paint as that would ruin our finish.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.200
There we go now, this is a squirt gun so it filled up with water. It's got a lot of hollow spaces in it.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.860
It likes to leak out the handle, looks like...

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.560
[Laughter] But thats pretty cool! Look at that. It's like a marbled red and yellow.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.420
It does have some spots that look pink...

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.780
...because I'm using such a large container, the paint does like to sort of spread out to the edges.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.420
And with the amount that I used, it wasn't very densely packed together, so the parts that look pink are where it was red..

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.560
...but sort of a spread out weaker red.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.360
Overall I think that turned out really nicely!

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.700
Very cool marbling. I wear gloves pretty much all of the time on this show...

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.540
...but this is one where I DEFINITELY recommend that anyone trying it wears gloves

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.820
...because this stuff will get all over your hands as you're dipping stuff down into the paint!

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.500
Normally spray paint will dry in as little as 15 minutes...

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.599
...but this stuff having been in the water,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.170
can even have little bits of water trapped underneath the paint, and so to really let this dry off all the way what we really

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.100
want to do is give it up to 24 hours in a room-temperature area to completely dry off.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.840
And then we want to hit it with a clear coat to make sure that the paint isn't gonna chip...

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.580
...and wear off too quickly! (Gahh!)

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.180
After dipping our squirt gun. There's still quite a bit of paint left on the surface of our water.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.009
But we don't have to pour it out and fill a new bucketful!

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:33.940
We can clean the paint off the surface of the water pretty easily just using some paper towels!

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.620
You can see that at this point the paint is sort of a plasticy film...

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.479
And it doesn't stick to things as well in this state.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.899
Which is why we want to spray and then have everything prepped:

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.150
So we can just dip it in immediately, because it won't grip as well if the paint isn't as new!

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.040
I've got another little squirt gun that I've primered up. Let's choose a couple other colors and try painting this one.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.060
This time we're gonna try purple and pink see how that gun turns out!

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:17.600
It's interesting Our pink is responding a little bit differently than other paints have, but we'll see how this goes on.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.920
Hmm that pink color went on really oddly it sort of formed into that plastic sheet that I was explaining about

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.160
Immediately as soon as it hit the water the purple did a really good job

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.700
So I like how that turned out

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.590
But the pink you can see

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.920
Like this is just thin sheets of plastic

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.689
And it didn't like to spread it all so it didn't stretch going over the contours of the gun

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.539
It's not a terribly ruined effect, but it doesn't work as nicely as some colors

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.450
So you may have to experiment with which colors are gonna work the best

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.790
We've had one successful test with a squirt gun and one less than successful test with the squirt gun

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.920
Now we're gonna move on to trying something else. This is a phone case that I've taped off and painted with our white primer

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.860
We're gonna see if we can give this a nice swirled marble texture

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.409
I'm gonna see if I can get three different colors to work all at once of this one alternating, which one I spray

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.440
bit of an experiment

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.580
Ooh

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.460
There we go, I'm liking the look of that quite a bit

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.240
missing

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.130
Stringy bits, but I think those are all attached to the tape not the case itself

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.300
I can we've got some good swirl patterns going their. That is a neat phone case pattern, i think

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.880
That phone case works, so well. We're gonna try one more

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.139
I have another case here, which has a little bit of a texture to it, and I'm not sure how that's gonna change

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.459
How well the paint bonds to it, but I have taped this off and hit it with our primer

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.269
So let's try a different pattern. I'm gonna go for red and black on this one

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.340
Ooh

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.570
Hmmm a little bit of mixed results that this red really seems to like to spread out overall. I like the look

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:05.730
I like the switching between colors, and it still kept most of the texture beneath our paint which is pretty cool. However

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.920
You can see that. We're getting sort of a Pinker look over here, and I was hoping for a little bit more red

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.619
But overall I think this is still a pretty sweet design

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.480
I did want it to be all red

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.269
But if it couldn't be all red I at least liked that the thinner spot is almost centered around the camera hole

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.970
So it looks like it's all radiating out from that point

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.119
One more thing that we're gonna try grant wanted me to see if I could

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.900
Successfully use this hydro dipping method on the slide of his Glock

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.070
So we're gonna try and give this a sort of snow camo look using black gray

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.529
And white and we'll see how it's turned out I've tried to tape off every bit of the surface that I don't want painted

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.929
It's still going to be a bit of an experiment

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.450
Hopefully it turns out well

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:20.319
All right there we go we had a bit of an ordeal

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:26.889
Getting our paints to really work the gray was doing the same thing as the pink and that it would kept just turning into sort

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:28.720
Of a plastic film as soon as it hit the water

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.999
I think the solution was actually just to keep

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.789
Shaking the whole can up a lot so the paint inside was much more evenly mixed that seemed to fix it with the gray

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.409
I'm I wanted to do another test with the pink and see if it's doing the same thing overall though

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.409
I think we got a pretty cool

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.510
swirled snow camo effect on this slide

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.380
So we'll let this dry and then we'll attach it back to the gun and see how it all looks

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:55.449
there we go the pieces that we hydro dipped have now had plenty of time to dry out and

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.459
Completely cure, so now we're gonna

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:01.089
Do is hit them with a layer of clear coat and hopefully that will make it so that they're safe to handle

00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:03.279
And we won't have any paint chipping or coming off

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.549
There you have an at-home method of Hydra dipping using spray paint and water

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.060
We don't mean to imply that

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.189
Guns and phone cases are the only things that you can do this with there are all sorts of materials

00:09:37.189 --> 00:09:42.559
That would work great for Hydro dipping and some of them would actually get handled less than squirt guns and phone cases so the spray

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.699
Paint may hold up a little longer on there if you try this at home. We want to know about it

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:50.389

Thanks for joining us for this video and remember to come gear yourself up with hats shirts and other cool merch at the kingofrandom.com

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:57.339
see you there

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:02.749
Sometimes you can swirl them around a bit you can get a little bit more of a marbled texture, which can also look pretty neat

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.120
Five guns, and two phone cases no other examples
