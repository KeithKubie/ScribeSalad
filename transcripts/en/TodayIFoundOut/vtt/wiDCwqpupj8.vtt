00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.570
A 
short while ago we wrote about the fact Queen

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.080
Elizabeth II needs neither a passport nor
driving license thanks to a quirk of British

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.080
law.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.590
But what other powers does the Queen of many
titles have and what could she theoretically

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.830
do if she decided to flex the full might of
the authority she wields?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.760
As it turns out, thanks to the Royal Prerogative,
a terrifying amount if she really felt like

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.840
it, or, at least, assuming parliament went
by the letter of the law and they and the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.010
people didn’t decide to stage a little revolt.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.860
In reality, the Queen rarely exerts even a
fraction of the power she theoretically wields

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.619
as it’s kept in check by the only person
in the UK who can tell her what to do- herself.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.730
This is very much a calculated move on her
part in order to stay in the good graces of

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.570
her subjects (as is voluntarily paying taxes
even though she’s technically not obligated

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.990
to).

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.300
Not only does she avoid openly flexing her
political might, she also tends to keep her

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.870
opinions outside of the public sphere.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.960
As historian Frank Prochaska notes,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.310
The real secret of royal influence is saying
nothing.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.990
And anything the Queen does say publicly,
is pretty anodyne.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.290
The minute a monarch, or any of the royals
say anything remotely political or opinionated,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.420
they alienate people and they lose some power.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.770
This silence played a large part in how the
British monarchy survived post World War One,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.180
when other European royal families didn’t.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.310
In fact, for almost two decades now the monarchy
has regularly had polls run and focus groups

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.470
put together to keep track of how the general
public feels about them and their various

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.470
actions.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.100
They also have on payroll individuals whose
job it is to ensure the Queen stays in the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.390
public eye and in a way that is most likely
to endear her to her subjects- as with politicians

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.480
who rely on the voting public, with each public
change she presents, right down to carrying

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.230
a cell phone or not, carefully calculated
in terms of the impact it might have.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.870
While this may seem only self-serving, the
Queen has a very lengthy track record as an

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.680
admirable public servant and is also acutely
aware that she is a prominent public face

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.010
representing her subjects, so is keen on avoiding
being viewed in a bad light lest she in turn

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.790
paint them in a bad light by her actions.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.739
As she noted at the tender age of 21 in a
speech to the Commonwealth she gave on her

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.739
birthday,

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.599
I declare before you all that my whole life
whether it be long or short shall be devoted

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.010
to your service and the service of our great
imperial family to which we all belong.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.150
Surprisingly, for many years the full extent
of exactly what powers the Queen handed off

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.980
to the government, but technically retained,
weren’t publicly known.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.840
That is, until 2003, when the government released
a partial list of the things it can do on

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.840
the Queen’s behalf.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.300
For the most part, the list confirmed that
the government could do things to save the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.550
Queen time, such as issue or revoke passports
which simply wouldn’t be a feasible thing

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.380
to be the sole prerogative of the Crown in
a modern society.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.440
However, many things were quite worrying to
some, such as her ability to declare war,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.180
which under the rules of Royal Prerogative
can be done without consulting parliament.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.440
On top of that, the Queen is totally immune
from prosecution and is considered above the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.910
law in the UK.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.710
And as a head of state, she enjoys diplomatic
immunity in any foreign country she happens

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.710
to visit.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.599
As such, she could commit any crime conceivable
anywhere on Earth and, at least as the law

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.860
currently stands, suffer no consequence for
doing so.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.820
However, as with everything, she’s generally
exceptionally careful to ensure she doesn’t

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.820
break any laws.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.930
Of course, what she does in private is completely
her own affair, despite her prominent political

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.349
position, as she is exempt from Freedom of
Information requests.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.230
Moving on- because technically speaking “the
people of Britain are not citizens, but subjects

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.430
of the monarch” she could have anyone she
wanted arrested and presumably seize their

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.659
property or land for the crown.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.400
Speaking of which, the Queen owns all of the
sea beds around the UK and can commandeer

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.959
any ship found in British waters “for service
to the realm”.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.739
Oddly enough, she also has first dibs on any
whales that wash up on shore.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.440
The Queen could also administer any manner
of punishment to an individual who offended

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.690
or otherwise displeased her as the crown has
“prerogative power to keep the peace within

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.710
the realm”.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.840
And since she’s immune from prosecution,
nobody could really do anything if this punishment

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.330
wasn’t entirely within the scope of the
law.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.780
If the government tried to stop her, the Queen
could decimate the British political landscape

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.940
by dissolving parliament and appointing anyone
she felt like as prime minister.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.950
This is because it’s the Queen’s duty
to appoint the prime minister and she could,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.810
in theory appoint anyone she wanted to the
position, regardless of the way the British

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.970
public voted in an election.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.490
On top of that, in the event the Queen didn’t
like the outcome of an election, for instance

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.260
if she didn’t like the replacement parliament
members voted in, she could just call for

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.990
another one using Royal Prerogative until
she got the parliament she wanted.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.660
Not that she’d need to, because she could
just bring in the army to keep everyone in

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.310
line if she so chose.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.310
How?

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.200
Well, the Queen is also the Commander-in-Chief
of the entire British military with every

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.089
officer, soldier, sailor and pilot swearing
allegiance to the Crown and nobody else.

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:17.930
They’re not called Her Majesty’s Armed
Forces for nothing.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.060
Noted as being the “ultimate authority”
on all British military matters, the Queen

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.560
could authorise a nuclear strike on France
or make North Korea an ally as she has the

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.250
power to declare both war and peace with foreign
nations.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.930
As for laws, while technically the Queen can’t
create new laws, as she can only sign them

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.350
into law after they’re decided upon by parliament
(in fact, her Royal Assent is required to

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.719
make the law official after being passed by
parliament in the first place), she could

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.320
appoint ministers who’d make any laws she
wanted a reality and then just sign them into

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.560
law that way.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.149
Beyond Royal Assent, there’s also the Queen’s
consent, which requires she give her consent

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:55.700
before any law that affects the interests
of the monarchy can even be discussed at all

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.700
in parliament.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.820
(She actually has used this power before,
such as in 1999 when she refused to allow

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.120
the discussion of a bill that would have given
parliament power to authorize military strikes

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.909
in Iraq, instead of needing her authorization.)

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.670
So that’s on the political side- it doesn’t
stop here.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.050
The Queen technically has a sort of power
not only over her subjects’ physical beings,

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.460
but also their souls.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.460
How?

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.219
She’s the head of the Church of England,
including having the power to appoint Archbishops

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.020
and power over many other such matters concerning
the church.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.230
As for most of these powers that technically
allow her to rule with an iron fist, as previously

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.810
mentioned, the Queen is hesitant to ever use
them in such a way that would displease her

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.190
subjects and certainly isn’t about to disregard
their representatives in parliament.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.789
However, these powers still exist for a variety
of reasons including potentially being needed

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.860
in a time of extreme crisis where an individual
ruling unilaterally for the good of her people

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.860
can potentially be of benefit- one of the
few scenarios her subjects might not mind

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.860
her flexing her political muscles a bit without
necessarily consulting parliament, depending

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.860
on the circumstances.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.860
That said, just because she isn’t in the
practice of exercising her powers against

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.099
the will of the people, it doesn’t mean
she isn’t occasionally an active political

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.050
powerhouse in private.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.630
Extremely well respected and known worldwide,
with the ability to bend the ear of most heads

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.240
of state, the influence the Queen wields is
difficult to quantify, but, as noted in an

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.360
article discussing why the BBC named the Queen
the most powerful woman in the world in their

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.310
list of 100 most powerful women,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.919
Her Majesty’s power is more about influence
– a discreet nod of the head, a polite word

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:20.150
in the ear of a Prime Minister at their weekly
meeting, or a strategic patronage of a cause

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.899
being overlooked by the Government – is
how she can indirectly effect our world without

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.490
us even knowing.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.680
To conclude, the Queen has many powers she
could theoretically legally use to her own

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.010
ends unless her subjects and parliament simply
decided to stage a revolt.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.979
However, she generally avoids doing anything
overt that might upset her subjects, and otherwise

00:07:38.979 --> 00:09:08.240
simply works in the background more or less
in an advisory role when she feels there 

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:55.579
is need.
