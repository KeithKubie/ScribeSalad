00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219
looking at shielding you know what kind
 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.529
looking at shielding you know what kind
of lightweight shielding would be most

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539
of lightweight shielding would be most
 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.410

exercises I said seems to counteract a

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080
exercises I said seems to counteract a
 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.050
exercises I said seems to counteract a
lot of that but right now we exercise

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060
lot of that but right now we exercise
 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.670
lot of that but right now we exercise
two hours a day on the station which is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
two hours a day on the station which is
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.710
two hours a day on the station which is
a huge hit out of your day I mean it's

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720
a huge hit out of your day I mean it's
 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.050
a huge hit out of your day I mean it's
great for staying in shape but you know

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
great for staying in shape but you know
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.580
great for staying in shape but you know
it cuts into the productivity of the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590
it cuts into the productivity of the
 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.290
it cuts into the productivity of the
crew

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300
crew
 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.120
crew
and and you if you look at how expensive

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130
and and you if you look at how expensive
 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.940
and and you if you look at how expensive
it is to get a crew into space if we can

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950
it is to get a crew into space if we can
 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860
it is to get a crew into space if we can
keep them healthy but and have them

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
keep them healthy but and have them
 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.600
keep them healthy but and have them
exercise but you know spend less time

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
exercise but you know spend less time
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.630
exercise but you know spend less time
doing it we can get more done

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
 
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.340
 
well it's it's very important first of

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350
well it's it's very important first of
 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.420
well it's it's very important first of
all if you if you think about it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430
all if you if you think about it
 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.740
all if you if you think about it
especially on a long flight like a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
especially on a long flight like a
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.770
especially on a long flight like a
six-month space flight and on the ISS if

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780
six-month space flight and on the ISS if
 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.230
six-month space flight and on the ISS if
you didn't exercise in you know use the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240
you didn't exercise in you know use the
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.090
you didn't exercise in you know use the
analogy honor if you'd be like laying in

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100
analogy honor if you'd be like laying in
 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.370
analogy honor if you'd be like laying in
bed so just imagine laying in bed for

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380
bed so just imagine laying in bed for
 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.080
bed so just imagine laying in bed for
several months and even just trying to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
several months and even just trying to
 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.610
several months and even just trying to
get up and walk you probably wouldn't be

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
get up and walk you probably wouldn't be
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.200
get up and walk you probably wouldn't be
able to but if you got up and you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210
able to but if you got up and you
 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.660
able to but if you got up and you
exercised two hours a day he'd probably

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
exercised two hours a day he'd probably
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.790
exercised two hours a day he'd probably
be okay and that's the same in space the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800
be okay and that's the same in space the
 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.040
be okay and that's the same in space the
exercises we do we do cardiovascular and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050
exercises we do we do cardiovascular and
 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.260
exercises we do we do cardiovascular and
resistance exercises and so we have a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270
resistance exercises and so we have a
 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.000
resistance exercises and so we have a
treadmill but of course we have

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010
treadmill but of course we have
 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.740
treadmill but of course we have
harnesses and rubber bungees to hold us

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
harnesses and rubber bungees to hold us
 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.050
harnesses and rubber bungees to hold us
down to the track so that we don't float

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060
down to the track so that we don't float
 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.750
down to the track so that we don't float
away we have exercise bicycles and we

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760
away we have exercise bicycles and we
 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
away we have exercise bicycles and we
also have a resistive exercise device

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770
also have a resistive exercise device
 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.340
also have a resistive exercise device
that uses loaded chords that we can vary

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350
that uses loaded chords that we can vary
 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.440
that uses loaded chords that we can vary
the resistance on and you can attach a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450
the resistance on and you can attach a
 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.240
the resistance on and you can attach a
bar or harness to these chords and do

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250
bar or harness to these chords and do
 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.580
bar or harness to these chords and do
weight lifting type exercises so that

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590
weight lifting type exercises so that
 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.870
weight lifting type exercises so that
helps keep your bones and your muscles

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880
helps keep your bones and your muscles
 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.070
helps keep your bones and your muscles
in shape

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080
 
 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.350
 
well one of the ultrasound experiments

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360
well one of the ultrasound experiments
 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.490
well one of the ultrasound experiments
that we did on board was very

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500
that we did on board was very
 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.960
that we did on board was very
interesting we were doing something

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970
interesting we were doing something
 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.060
interesting we were doing something
called telemedicine where we were using

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070
called telemedicine where we were using
 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.620
called telemedicine where we were using
the ultrasound and I'm not an MD neither

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630
the ultrasound and I'm not an MD neither
 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.500
the ultrasound and I'm not an MD neither
was my my crewmate on board but we were

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510
was my my crewmate on board but we were
 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.540
was my my crewmate on board but we were
able to with very little training show

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550
able to with very little training show
 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.880
able to with very little training show
that we could produce diagnostic quality

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890
that we could produce diagnostic quality
 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.880
that we could produce diagnostic quality
images of Bones eyes internal organs

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890
images of Bones eyes internal organs
 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.130
images of Bones eyes internal organs
things like that and so one interesting

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140
things like that and so one interesting
 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.830
things like that and so one interesting
application of this ultrasound is the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840
application of this ultrasound is the
 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.210
application of this ultrasound is the
possibility that you could actually use

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220
possibility that you could actually use
 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.330
possibility that you could actually use
it to measure critical bone areas or

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340
it to measure critical bone areas or
 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.520
it to measure critical bone areas or
areas where we know historically have

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530
areas where we know historically have
 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.200
areas where we know historically have
seen a lot of loss and you could

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210
seen a lot of loss and you could
 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.730
seen a lot of loss and you could
actually track during a long space

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740
actually track during a long space
 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.040
actually track during a long space
mission do measurements and track if

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050
mission do measurements and track if
 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.600
mission do measurements and track if
you're losing bone in these areas so

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610
you're losing bone in these areas so
 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.740
you're losing bone in these areas so
that's something that's very exciting

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750
that's something that's very exciting
 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.570
that's something that's very exciting
because on earth when they check you for

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580
because on earth when they check you for
 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.550
because on earth when they check you for
for boneless you get in this big machine

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560
for boneless you get in this big machine
 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.710
for boneless you get in this big machine
I mean it's huge it's the size of a room

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720
I mean it's huge it's the size of a room
 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.199
I mean it's huge it's the size of a room
and it's got a platform with an xray

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209
and it's got a platform with an xray
 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.849
and it's got a platform with an xray
that kind of scans your whole body and

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859
that kind of scans your whole body and
 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.039
that kind of scans your whole body and
in there in critical areas and it takes

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049
in there in critical areas and it takes
 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.200
in there in critical areas and it takes
takes a while and it just wouldn't be

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210
takes a while and it just wouldn't be
 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.790
takes a while and it just wouldn't be
practical to have a machine like that in

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800
practical to have a machine like that in
 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.860
practical to have a machine like that in
space so if you could show that using a

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870
space so if you could show that using a
 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.140
space so if you could show that using a
portable diagnostic quality ultrasound

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
portable diagnostic quality ultrasound
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.210
portable diagnostic quality ultrasound
which basically is the size of a laptop

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220
which basically is the size of a laptop
 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.940
which basically is the size of a laptop
with you know some extensions to it if

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950
with you know some extensions to it if
 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.650
with you know some extensions to it if
you could actually measure reliably bone

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660
you could actually measure reliably bone
 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.970
you could actually measure reliably bone
loss with that that would be a great

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980
loss with that that would be a great
 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.999
loss with that that would be a great
tool to have

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009
 
 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.920
 
well there's some very exciting work in

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930
well there's some very exciting work in
 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.049
well there's some very exciting work in
that area and one of the researchers is

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:45.059
that area and one of the researchers is
 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.089
that area and one of the researchers is
funded by NS Bri is working on exactly

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099
funded by NS Bri is working on exactly
 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.339
funded by NS Bri is working on exactly
that and that has real application

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349
that and that has real application
 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.629
that and that has real application
because when you're monitoring an

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639
because when you're monitoring an
 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.339
because when you're monitoring an
astronaut we're not always monitored but

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349
astronaut we're not always monitored but
 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.079
astronaut we're not always monitored but
during certain times when we're having a

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:54.089
during certain times when we're having a
 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:56.299
during certain times when we're having a
physical exam you know we have to take

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:56.309
physical exam you know we have to take
 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.189
physical exam you know we have to take
blood samples or we have to give other

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199
blood samples or we have to give other
 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.439
blood samples or we have to give other
samples and it's you know it's not easy

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449
samples and it's you know it's not easy
 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.659
samples and it's you know it's not easy
to do especially in zero gravity you

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669
to do especially in zero gravity you
 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.609
to do especially in zero gravity you
know so can you can imagine trying to

00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:04.619
know so can you can imagine trying to
 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.559
know so can you can imagine trying to
squeeze blood out of a finger prick and

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569
squeeze blood out of a finger prick and
 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.450
squeeze blood out of a finger prick and
then getting a new capillary tube and

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460
then getting a new capillary tube and
 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.070
then getting a new capillary tube and
getting that into a machine to be

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080
getting that into a machine to be
 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.829
getting that into a machine to be
analyzed you know it all can be done and

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:12.839
analyzed you know it all can be done and
 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.839
analyzed you know it all can be done and
we do it but it's you know then you've

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849
we do it but it's you know then you've
 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.189
we do it but it's you know then you've
got you might have some droplets of

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199
got you might have some droplets of
 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.869
got you might have some droplets of
blood floating around you know so if you

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879
blood floating around you know so if you
 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.639
blood floating around you know so if you
can find a non-invasive way to do it

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:19.649
can find a non-invasive way to do it
 

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.200
can find a non-invasive way to do it
that would certainly make life easy for

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210
that would certainly make life easy for
 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.540
that would certainly make life easy for
us on board also when you're in a space

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550
us on board also when you're in a space
 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.760
us on board also when you're in a space
suit you know we do some very

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770
suit you know we do some very
 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.649
suit you know we do some very
rudimentary monitoring right now in both

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659
rudimentary monitoring right now in both
 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.089
rudimentary monitoring right now in both
the Russian in the u.s. space suits we

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099
the Russian in the u.s. space suits we
 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.869
the Russian in the u.s. space suits we
load up a simple electrocardiogram and

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879
load up a simple electrocardiogram and
 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.089
load up a simple electrocardiogram and
thus flight surgeons can look at the you

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099
thus flight surgeons can look at the you
 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.559
thus flight surgeons can look at the you
know your your heartbeat while you're

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569
know your your heartbeat while you're
 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.399
know your your heartbeat while you're
doing the spacewalk they can also well

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409
doing the spacewalk they can also well
 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.449
doing the spacewalk they can also well
they don't have it right now but they

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:41.459
they don't have it right now but they
 

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:43.399
they don't have it right now but they
could also theoretically look at maybe

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409
could also theoretically look at maybe
 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.709
could also theoretically look at maybe
with this device the oxygenation of your

blood and other parameters just to
determine the health of the astronaut

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:49.559
determine the health of the astronaut
 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:51.739
determine the health of the astronaut
who's doing the spacewalk so this kind

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:51.749
who's doing the spacewalk so this kind
 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.719
who's doing the spacewalk so this kind
of technology is very exciting and has

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729
of technology is very exciting and has
 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.639
of technology is very exciting and has
real application in space and the neat

they also have application for patients

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:01.649
they also have application for patients
 

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:02.899
they also have application for patients
on the ground the ultrasound that I

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909
on the ground the ultrasound that I
 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.600
on the ground the ultrasound that I
mentioned it has application not only in

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610
mentioned it has application not only in
 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.699
mentioned it has application not only in

expeditions like to the Antarctic but

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930
expeditions like to the Antarctic but
 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.409
expeditions like to the Antarctic but
just a remote area a small town

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419
just a remote area a small town
 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.449
just a remote area a small town
somewhere you know the local doctor is

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:20.459
somewhere you know the local doctor is
 

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.249
somewhere you know the local doctor is
not going to know everything and so if

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259
not going to know everything and so if
 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:23.959
not going to know everything and so if
that person can link in with a

diagnostic ultrasound to the hospital in
New York City you know through the

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889
New York City you know through the
 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.689
New York City you know through the
internet then we can do a very quick

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699
internet then we can do a very quick
 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.499
internet then we can do a very quick
diagnosis of something that's wrong with

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509
diagnosis of something that's wrong with
 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.480
diagnosis of something that's wrong with
someone who's in this remote area

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490
 
 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.520
 
well if you ask astronauts will tell you

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530
well if you ask astronauts will tell you
 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.070
well if you ask astronauts will tell you
there's no issue you know but of course

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080
there's no issue you know but of course
 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.140
there's no issue you know but of course
fatigue is a problem it's as big a

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150
fatigue is a problem it's as big a
 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.760
fatigue is a problem it's as big a
problem in space that as it is on the

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770
problem in space that as it is on the
 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.830
problem in space that as it is on the
ground and you could make an argument

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840
ground and you could make an argument
 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.600
ground and you could make an argument
that it's even more critical in space

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610
that it's even more critical in space
 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.719
that it's even more critical in space
because a mistake up there could be

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729
because a mistake up there could be
 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.490
because a mistake up there could be
literally life-threatening or could

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500
literally life-threatening or could
 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.740
literally life-threatening or could
cause you know big problems in the

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750
cause you know big problems in the
 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.170
cause you know big problems in the
mission so fatigue is an issue that

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180
mission so fatigue is an issue that
 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.790
mission so fatigue is an issue that
we're concerned about we're definitely

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800
we're concerned about we're definitely
 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.999
