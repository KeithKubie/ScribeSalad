00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start by filling out what was given.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We know the initial x velocity is just this velocity--50 m/s.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The x acceleration is 0, as it almost always is, and the y acceleration is 10.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Δy is this height--100 m--and the initial y velocity is 0,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because this is being shot exactly horizontally--no component of this velocity is vertical.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We can plug these variables into this equation to get a value for t.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When we do this algebra, we get a time of 4.47 s.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Remember, both of these times are identical.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I can use these three values to find the final y velocity.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It gives me a value of 44.7 m/s.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And what about the x?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, if I know the initial x velocity is 50 m/s,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I know that velocity never changes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The acceleration is 0 in the x direction. This means the final x velocity is 50 m/s.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
To calculate the distance it travels in the x direction--that's this distance here--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I can use this equation. Of course, this term goes to 0, since the x acceleration is 0.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When I solve this, I find Δx is equal to 224 m.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Well, if you got this on your first try, I am very impressed.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If you didn't, hey, go back and try it again.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If you're still confused after a few tries, go to the forums.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll be there. So will Jonathan, the assistant instructor and all of your classmates,

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and we're all happy to help.
