00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.170
That was awesome.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.494
&gt;&gt; I know. The reason that we showed you guys, the

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:06.789
example of a Porsche to illustrate use, good user experience design.

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.733
Is because we want to explain that, good user experience should

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.830
make your users happy, it should make you happy. That's kind of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.840
the whole point. And UX design is about all of these

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.538
tons of different things coming together. So if every person that

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:21.805
made the Porsche if anyone dropped the ball, the UX of

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:25.729
the Porsche wouldn't be awesome. It's, it's all these things coming together

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:27.114
that really makes user experience

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:30.300
design, because design is everyone's responsibility.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.380
&gt;&gt; No, exactly, and I think one of the

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.810
important things for, for us as developers to remember

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.090
is that, all the things that made that Porsche

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.425
amazing, can actually port it directly into the software world.

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:40.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.980
&gt;&gt; So let's bring it from the Porsche world,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.380
into the software world. Now, when we're in the software

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.850
world, as developers, we think in terms of code. So,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.110
let's look at all the code that we write as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.550
something that goes in this box, and let's say that all

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.290
the code, contributes to what's called the user experience, of a particular

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.710
application. So now if you, take a little bit closer look at

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.050
the chunks of code that we write. Let's say that you have

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.490
code, that essentially puts pixels on a screen or interacts with the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.590
user in any way. This could be through audio input or audio

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.550
output. Let's say that that is your UI code. Let's say the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.130
rest of the code that you write, stuff for your backend and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.760
so on, the non-visual code, that actually does not

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.190
have an impact on the UI, but it does

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.910
have a direct and strong impact on the UX.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.090
And that's something that, we should always keep in mind.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.280
&gt;&gt; So, this is basically the difference between

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.350
UI and UX. They're not synonyms, but they

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.150
get thrown around a lot so I think

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.830
it's important to kind of, disambiguate these two terms.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. The visual and non-visual code come together

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.410
to deliver the user experience for your application, whereas

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.860
the visual code almost exclusively delivers the user interface.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.280
&gt;&gt; But the most important thing is that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.650
he overall UX, should make your users feel happy.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.327
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so think about an applications that's made

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:56.880
you happy. What has blown your mind by delivering

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.200
an awesome user experience? Keep that app in mind,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.430
because we're going to be using that later on this lesson.
