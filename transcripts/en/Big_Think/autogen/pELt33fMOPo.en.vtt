00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.430
 
oh of course they talked about it

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
oh of course they talked about it
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.610
oh of course they talked about it
incessantly that was the main subject of

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
incessantly that was the main subject of
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.269
incessantly that was the main subject of
conversation for many years and so

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
conversation for many years and so
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310
conversation for many years and so
people had very strong feelings about it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
people had very strong feelings about it
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.220
people had very strong feelings about it
on both sides and people who thought it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
on both sides and people who thought it
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.870
on both sides and people who thought it
was the greatest thing that ever done

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
was the greatest thing that ever done
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.499
was the greatest thing that ever done
and people who thought it was just an

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509
and people who thought it was just an
 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.470
and people who thought it was just an
unpleasant job and people thought they

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
unpleasant job and people thought they
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.110
unpleasant job and people thought they
should never have done it at all so the

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120
should never have done it at all so the
 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.390
should never have done it at all so the
opinions of all kinds

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400
 
 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:46.810
 
well it's very hard to tell I mean it I

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820
well it's very hard to tell I mean it I
 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.100
well it's very hard to tell I mean it I
I grew up in England at the time when

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110
I grew up in England at the time when
 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.500
I grew up in England at the time when
England was winning Nobel prizes right

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510
England was winning Nobel prizes right
 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.230
England was winning Nobel prizes right
and left I mean it was amazing how many

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240
and left I mean it was amazing how many
 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.700
and left I mean it was amazing how many
Nobel prizes England was winning in

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710
Nobel prizes England was winning in
 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.560
Nobel prizes England was winning in
chemistry and physics and biology and

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570
chemistry and physics and biology and
 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.010
chemistry and physics and biology and
all the sciences and at that time the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020
all the sciences and at that time the
 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.020
all the sciences and at that time the
teaching of science and the schools was

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030
teaching of science and the schools was
 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.530
teaching of science and the schools was
really lousy I mean I I experienced that

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540
really lousy I mean I I experienced that
 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.410
really lousy I mean I I experienced that
myself we learned almost nothing in

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420
myself we learned almost nothing in
 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.390
myself we learned almost nothing in
school science was very unpopular it was

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400
school science was very unpopular it was
 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.430
school science was very unpopular it was
I mean science was blamed for all the

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440
I mean science was blamed for all the
 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.609
I mean science was blamed for all the
horrors of World War one just as it's

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619
horrors of World War one just as it's
 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.750
horrors of World War one just as it's
blamed today for nuclear weapons and and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760
blamed today for nuclear weapons and and
 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.460
blamed today for nuclear weapons and and
quite rightly I mean World War one was a

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470
quite rightly I mean World War one was a
 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.650
quite rightly I mean World War one was a
horrible war and it was mostly the fault

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660
horrible war and it was mostly the fault
 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.260
horrible war and it was mostly the fault
of science so that was in a way a very

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270
of science so that was in a way a very
 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.359
of science so that was in a way a very
bad time for science but on the other

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369
bad time for science but on the other
 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.010
bad time for science but on the other
hand we were winning all these Nobel

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020
hand we were winning all these Nobel
 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.960
hand we were winning all these Nobel
prizes well since then of course

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970
prizes well since then of course
 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.520
prizes well since then of course
teaching of science in schools in

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530
teaching of science in schools in
 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.940
teaching of science in schools in
England has improved tremendously and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
England has improved tremendously and
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.860
England has improved tremendously and
the number of Nobel prizes has gone down

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870
the number of Nobel prizes has gone down
 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.300
the number of Nobel prizes has gone down
and I think that might even be connected

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310
and I think that might even be connected
 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.649
and I think that might even be connected
I don't know but it's I think it's quite

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659
I don't know but it's I think it's quite
 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.710
I don't know but it's I think it's quite
possible that the more science you teach

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720
possible that the more science you teach
 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.570
possible that the more science you teach
kids in school the more it turns them

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580
kids in school the more it turns them
 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.590
kids in school the more it turns them
off so I don't know I mean you never can

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600
off so I don't know I mean you never can
 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.360
off so I don't know I mean you never can
tell which way it'll go

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
 
 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.890
 
indeed there are of course I mean it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900
indeed there are of course I mean it
 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.990
indeed there are of course I mean it
it's it's strange in a way that we had

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000
it's it's strange in a way that we had
 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.229
it's it's strange in a way that we had
already we were scared of biological

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239
already we were scared of biological
 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.640
already we were scared of biological

Huxley wrote his novel brave new world

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870
Huxley wrote his novel brave new world
 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.670
Huxley wrote his novel brave new world
and started out with anthrax bombs so we

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680
and started out with anthrax bombs so we
 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.740
and started out with anthrax bombs so we
knew all about anthrax already in the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750
knew all about anthrax already in the
 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.800
knew all about anthrax already in the
30s and in fact we expected that I mean

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810
30s and in fact we expected that I mean
 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.920
30s and in fact we expected that I mean
World War one when World War two came

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
World War one when World War two came
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.250
World War one when World War two came
along which was when it when I was a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260
along which was when it when I was a
 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.069
along which was when it when I was a
teenager we all expected we would have

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079
teenager we all expected we would have
 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.220
teenager we all expected we would have
anthrax bombs and this kind of stuff we

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
anthrax bombs and this kind of stuff we
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.460
anthrax bombs and this kind of stuff we
thought it would be a biological war

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
thought it would be a biological war
 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.170
thought it would be a biological war
fortunately it wasn't and and but it's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180
fortunately it wasn't and and but it's
 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.839
fortunately it wasn't and and but it's
because the danger is still there and

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849
because the danger is still there and
 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.339
because the danger is still there and
forth by the some miracle we did we

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349
forth by the some miracle we did we
 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.280
forth by the some miracle we did we
escaped all that and so you never can

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290
escaped all that and so you never can
 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.979
escaped all that and so you never can
tell what's going to happen but biology

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
tell what's going to happen but biology
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.220
tell what's going to happen but biology
certain there could be even worse than

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230
certain there could be even worse than
 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.480
certain there could be even worse than
physics and chemistry

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490
 
 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.060
 
of course exists there have been on a

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070
of course exists there have been on a
 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.630
of course exists there have been on a
small scale there have been and of

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640
small scale there have been and of
 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.250
small scale there have been and of
course a few people got killed with

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
course a few people got killed with
 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.090
course a few people got killed with
anthrax right here in Princeton

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100
 
 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.470
 
well it's always a mixture we don't know

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
well it's always a mixture we don't know
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.410
well it's always a mixture we don't know
with some things to a better than you

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420
with some things to a better than you
 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.320
with some things to a better than you
expected other things go worse so I'm I

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330
expected other things go worse so I'm I
 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.880
expected other things go worse so I'm I
think the only sensible thing is just to

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890
think the only sensible thing is just to
 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.890
think the only sensible thing is just to
wait and see and the what I'm doing when

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900
wait and see and the what I'm doing when
 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.750
wait and see and the what I'm doing when
I'm writing books I'm not doing science

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760
I'm writing books I'm not doing science
 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.180
I'm writing books I'm not doing science
so much anymore mostly I'm just writing

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190
so much anymore mostly I'm just writing
 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.940
so much anymore mostly I'm just writing
books for the public and so I trying to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950
books for the public and so I trying to
 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.450
books for the public and so I trying to
just describe for the public what the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460
just describe for the public what the
 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.120
just describe for the public what the
choices are what they might have to have

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130
choices are what they might have to have
 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.580
choices are what they might have to have
to expect in the future and so by

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590
to expect in the future and so by
 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.560
to expect in the future and so by
warning people ahead of time maybe you

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570
warning people ahead of time maybe you
 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.690
warning people ahead of time maybe you
have an effect I think the fact that

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700
have an effect I think the fact that
 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.380
have an effect I think the fact that
Aldous Huxley wrote brave new world and

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390
Aldous Huxley wrote brave new world and
 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.200
Aldous Huxley wrote brave new world and
talked about anthrax bombs probably

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210
talked about anthrax bombs probably
 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.690
talked about anthrax bombs probably
helped because it meant at least we

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700
helped because it meant at least we
 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.630
helped because it meant at least we
people had the understanding before the

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640
people had the understanding before the
 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.000
people had the understanding before the
war began that's something we didn't

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010
war began that's something we didn't
 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.340
war began that's something we didn't
want to get into so I think it's much

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350
want to get into so I think it's much
 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.870
want to get into so I think it's much
better to have your eyes open but on the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880
better to have your eyes open but on the
 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.760
better to have your eyes open but on the
other hand of course it can do harm if

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770
other hand of course it can do harm if
 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.420
other hand of course it can do harm if
you tell people look there's all these

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430
you tell people look there's all these
 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.010
you tell people look there's all these
terrible things you can do and then some

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
terrible things you can do and then some
 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.760
terrible things you can do and then some
idiot may go ahead and do it
