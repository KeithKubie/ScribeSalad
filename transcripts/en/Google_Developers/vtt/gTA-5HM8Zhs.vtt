[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.920
Welcome to Google I/O.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.690
Today, we have three things to
talk to you about-- momentum,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.650
mobile, and more.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.440
This year we did
something new.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.580
We had over 110 cities have
viewing parties set up and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.550
stream this event live.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.280
We have activated over 100
million Android devices and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.770
200,000 applications
available.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.570
I'm happy to announce the next
major Android release--

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.410
ice cream sandwich.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.370
Users can rent movies from
Android Market and instantly

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.780
stream them to their
Android devices.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.570
Today we're introducing
music beta by Google.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.660
You can listen on the web or
any compatible device.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.690
It's just like a
big toy store.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.820
I'm like in heaven right now.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.790
They just gave 5,000
tablets away.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.630
And we get one of them.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.780
Where's yours?

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.920
Everyone's so excited about all
these new technologies,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.820
meeting all the vendors.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.950
It's really a great
experience.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.745
Robots are cool, that's
all I gotta say.

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:11.100
And there's lots and lots
of robots around here.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.180
We are here to talk about
the Open Web, the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.500
amazing platform it is.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.670
The pace at which it's
making progress.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.970
We have more than doubled Chrome
users in the last year.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.740
We are bringing Angry Birds to
the biggest platform out

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.940
there, the web.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.620
We want to make sure every
I/O attendee gets a free

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.850
Chromebook.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.895
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:32.980
We've been blown away.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.320
Thank you.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.550
Thank you, Google.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.050
All of my friends, they
should really be here.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.210
Who's playing?

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.020
Jane's Addiction.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.275
Really?

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:38.990
That's awesome.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.660
That is awesome.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.940
That is the most amazing
platform in our lifetime.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.040
The future of the web, that's
what you make of it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.590
Google I/O is awesome.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.970
If you can ever get a chance to
go, you definitely should.
