[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:07.640
YASCHA MOUNK: Thanks for
this very kind introduction.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.135
And I love being at
Google, because it's

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.759
the one place in the world where
I feel hopelessly overdressed.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.740
At the beginning of his
beautiful commencement speech

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.370
at Kenyon College,
David Foster Wallace

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.050
tells of a story you may have
heard of two old fish that

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.340
are swimming along
peacefully, and they

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.570
run into a younger fish.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.120
And they say, oh,
how's the water today?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.892
And the younger fish
says, what water?

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:31.505
What are you talking about?

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:33.880
They have never thought about
what water is, because it's

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.900
always been around them.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.390
So they haven't
noticed how important

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.730
it is to them for
their livelihood--

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.340
for actually being able
to live and breathe.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.330
I think, in a strange way,
we are at a similar place

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.610
with our political system.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.450
We've taken it for
granted for a long time.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.647
When I grew up, I
thought that there

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:56.230
was really important
political battles

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.550
to be fought, that it mattered
a lot what kind of health care

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.300
policy we might end up having,
how we would treat people who

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.430
are gay, and all those
kinds of questions

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.230
which were live issues
when I was growing up.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.880
But I also assumed that there
was a whole set of even more

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.990
important issues that we really
didn't have to worry about.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.360
That obviously, 20
or 30 years from now,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.150
we would still be
living in a democracy,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.270
that we would have free
and fair elections,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.120
that people wouldn't be
prosecuted or not prosecuted

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.330
depending on what
kind of relationship

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.490
they have with the president
of the United States

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.590
or the prime minister
of whichever country

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.870
I was living in.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.911
And I fear that these
things are now under threat,

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:50.410
that what we're
living through right

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.080
now politically is
not just a moment

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.660
of high political
tension, not just

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.040
a moment of big drama
with headlines every day

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.730
playing out one unlikely
saga after another.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.520
This, I think, is only the
epiphenomenon-- only one

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.220
of the symptoms of a much deeper
malaise of liberal democracy,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.510
of our political system.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.390
For decades,
political scientists

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.700
believed that poor democracies
could sometimes fail.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.870
They knew that rich,
authoritarian countries

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.540
could actually continue
to be quite stable.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.780
But they also had this
really optimistic belief

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.610
that countries that
are already rich,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.180
that are already
democratic would continue

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.810
to be so for a long time.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.190
The richest democracy
to have ever failed

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.380
was Argentina in the late
1970s, and that country

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.220
had a GDP per capita of about
$14,000 in today's terms.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.590
And so the conclusion
was that once you're

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.970
in that kind of
area, once you've

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.678
had a couple of
changeovers of government

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.530
with free and fair elections,
once you had a GDP per capita

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.160
of about $14,000, you really
didn't have to worry anymore.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.620
Democracy had
become consolidated.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.470
It had become the
only game in town,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.725
and it would stay
there forevermore.

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:26.600
What it was supposed to
look like when you're

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.790
the only game in town is
that most of your citizens

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.460
actually give great
importance to democracy,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.920
that they reject authoritarian
alternatives to democracy,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.590
and most importantly,
that all of the parties

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.450
and political
candidates in the system

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.970
actually accept the most
basic rules and norms

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.980
of a political system.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.745
So before Donald Trump was
elected, with a colleague,

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:49.790
[INAUDIBLE],, I started
to look at that question.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.630
I started to look at, is
it actually still true

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.710
that most people give this
deep importance to democracy?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.840
Do they still reject
authoritarian alternatives,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.210
and most importantly, aren't
there more and more politicians

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.530
who seem to challenge that?

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.670
And what we found
was pretty worrying.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.600
So in the United States,
among older Americans

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.280
born in the 1930s
and 1940s, over 2/3

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.779
say it's absolutely important
to live in a democracy.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:24.870
Among people born since
1980, less than one third do.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.230
20 years ago, one
in 16 Americans

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.680
said that army rule is a
good system of government.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.685
Now it's one in six.

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:35.310
And among young and
affluent Americans,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.350
it's actually gone up from
6% 20 years ago to 35%

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.220
now, nearly a six-fold increase
over those couple of decades.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.590
And it's not just in the United
States that this is happening.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.220
In new survey data
from last year,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.330
we saw that the number of
Germans and French people

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.810
and Brits who say that a
strong leader who doesn't have

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.350
to bother with parliament
or elections is a good thing

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.270
has gone up a lot.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.350
In Germany, it was
16% 20 years ago.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.260
Now it's 33%.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.270
In France, the United
Kingdom, it was 25%.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.170
Now it's 50%-- one
in two people--

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.740
who long for a strong leader
who doesn't have to bother with

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.810
parliament and elections.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.640
Now, as you know,
how people answer

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.449
survey questions can be a
little difficult to interpret.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.990
So it would be
tempting to say, well,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.031
who knows what exactly
they mean when they answer

00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:26.520
those kinds of questions?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.050
Do they really want army rule?

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.660
I mean, probably they don't.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.560
But we're also seeing
actual voting behavior

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.040
changing more and more.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.010
You're seeing the rise of
authoritarian populists,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.580
not just in the United States
but in many democracies

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.800
around the world.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.910
We saw a few weeks ago
an election in Italy

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.740
where nearly 2/3
of the electorate

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.820
voted for very radical
populist parties.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.100
You saw the rise of populist
leaders in Central Europe,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.670
in Poland and Hungary, where
democracy is now actually

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.710
under threat.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.470
And you see it even
in countries that

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.994
were once supposed to be safe.

00:06:11.994 --> 00:06:13.410
Once question I'm
often asked when

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.780
I go around the country
talking about this stuff is,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.890
well, aren't there
some countries

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:17.830
where this isn't happening?

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.700
What about Sweden?

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.450
What about Canada?

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.340
Well, in Sweden, the
Sweden Democrats--

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.980
the party that comes out
of the neo-Nazi movement--

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.150
is now polling above 20%.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.150
In Canada, Doug
Ford, the brother

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.360
of Rob Ford, whom you may
remember from such hits

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.870
as being mayor of Toronto and
being caught on video smoking

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.290
crack with drug dealers--

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.430
his brother, who is a populist
in the broadly Trumpian vein,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.640
may be about to become
the premier of Ontario,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.610
the most important
province in the country.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.110
So there's no places
that are safe from this.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.520
So what I want to do today
is to say a little bit

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.000
about what populism is
and why it's dangerous,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.930
to think about some of the
causes of why this is happening

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.139
in so many countries
all at once,

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.555
and to start talking a little
bit about some of the things

00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:16.554
that we might actually
be able to do to confront

00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:17.470
all of these problems.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.370
So what is populism?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.250
Why should we be concerned
about these kinds

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.529
of political figures?

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.070
It would be tempting to say that
these populists have nothing

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.370
in common with each other.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.240
Donald Trump doesn't appear
to be overly fond of Muslims,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.760
I think it's fair to say.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.550
Recep Erdogan, who's, I
think, rightly often called

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.280
an authoritarian populist-- the
prime minister and president,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.110
now, of Turkey--

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.560
doesn't appear to be overly fond
of anybody who isn't a Muslim.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.070
There are some
populists who advocate

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.930
for very right-wing
economic policies,

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.420
either in their rhetoric or at
least in their actual actions.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.250
And there's others, like the
late Hugo Chávez in Venezuela,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.640
who advocate for very
left-wing economic policies.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.210
So why does it make sense
to call all of these people

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.550
by the same name?

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.290
Well, I think the
answer to that has

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.410
to do with a shared political
language and a shared

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.410
moral imagination.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.810
All politicians say
there's something

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.390
wrong with the current
political class.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.360
All politicians say,
it's really important

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.880
that I get elected rather
than that guy over there.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.909
It's really important that
my policies are better.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.036
They speak better to my voters.

00:08:39.036 --> 00:08:40.410
That's a normal
part of politics.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.920
But traditional
politicians also say

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.960
that the people
on the other side

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.620
are adversaries
rather than enemies.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.350
That though they are much
better than the opposition,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.980
if the opposition wins
the election, that's fine.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.870
They, too, are loyal citizens.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.080
The country is not going to be
destroyed if the other people

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.120
take a turn at governing.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.830
Well, populists are
different in that.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.290
Populists say, the
only reason why

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.630
we have any real
political problems

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.790
is that the political leader's
corrupt and self-serving.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.500
And so actually, all
commonsense, ordinary, good

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.620
folk know what to
do politically.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.740
Common sense is enough to
deal with all of our problems.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.190
And I, the populist,
have a unique ability

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:37.060
to speak for people's ideas, for
people's desires, for what they

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.770
really want.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.960
As Donald Trump said at
the Republican National

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:48.730
Convention in Cleveland in
2016, "I am your voice."

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.260
Now, once they actually
get into government,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.570
it turns out that all of
the big promises they made

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.350
are difficult to keep.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.796
And so populists end
up saying things like,

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:03.670
who knew that things
could be so complicated?

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.470
Who knew that health care
could be so complicated?

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.660
Who knew that negotiating
with Kim Jong-un

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.134
might turn out to
be complicated?

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:15.550
But of course,
they don't actually

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.870
want to say, hey, I was wrong.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.070
Politics is complicated.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.800
It's difficult to solve all
of the problems we have.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.280
And so they need
to start blaming.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.880
And blame they do.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:33.620
They blame media for being
purveyors of fake news.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.340
They blame the
political opposition

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.760
for being traitors,
illegitimate.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.600
And they blame
independent institutions,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.310
whether it's judges in courts
or independent institutions

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.159
like the FBI and the
Department of Justice,

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:53.200
as enemies of the people.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.850
And we see exactly
where that leads

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.760
in countries where
authoritarian populists actually

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.250
manage to put through their
program in a disciplined way.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.830
Take the case of
Hungary, a country which

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.890
political scientists, five years
ago, considered a consolidated,

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.350
a safe democracy.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.560
Scholars of Central
Europe praised Hungary,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.090
along with Poland--

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.280
which is now going
through similar troubles--

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.370
the most successful case of
transition from communism

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.590
to democracy.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.520
Well, once Viktor Orbán took
control as prime minister

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:41.270
there, he reformed the judiciary
in order to be able to nominate

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:46.730
his own judges and assign
cases to particular judges.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.410
He turned the state media
into a Shia propaganda outlet

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.070
and forced the sale of the most
important private media outlets

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:59.930
to his friends and
political associates.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:05.570
He flooded the electoral
commission with his loyalists.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.910
And as a result, we now have
an election coming up just

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.610
a couple weeks from now in
Hungary in which it's very

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.730
difficult for anybody to
criticize Viktor Orbán

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.260
in the public media in which
the electoral system has been

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.960
gerrymandered in
unconstitutional ways without

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.957
judges being able to
stop it from happening.

00:12:26.957 --> 00:12:28.540
And in which, perhaps
most shockingly,

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.340
the electoral commission
has investigated all

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.830
of the opposition parties,
fining them huge sums of money

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.760
so that they essentially
can't campaign,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.520
while the party of
Viktor Orbán, Fidesz,

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.550
miraculously was
never investigated,

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.370
and therefore never fined.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.640
So we have elections
coming up in Hungary

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.820
which are neither free nor fair,
in the heart of the European

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.920
Union.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.300
Now, I think it's important
to actually understand

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.650
what kind of political system
has been erected in Hungary.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.200
How to understand what's
actually going on there.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.904
In my terms, we live
in a liberal democracy.

00:13:17.904 --> 00:13:19.570
Now, liberal, in this
sense, has nothing

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.766
to do with liberal
and conservative.

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:26.950
It has nothing to do with Barack
Obama versus George W. Bush.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.900
Liberal in the
sense that I use it

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.786
simply means a commitment
to individual rights,

00:13:31.786 --> 00:13:33.410
to minority rights,
to the rule of law,

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.600
to the separation of powers.

00:13:37.145 --> 00:13:38.770
And once we define
liberalism that way,

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.140
we can use a very
straightforward definition

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:46.226
of democracy, which is actually
translating popular views

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:48.100
into public policies--
the rule of the demos,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.320
the rule of the people.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.569
So the political system needs
to be responsive to what

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:54.310
people actually want.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.040
I think the way to
understand populists often

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.110
is as a form of illiberal
democracy, of democracy

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.640
without rights--

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.680
at least initially.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.100
Take the case of
a Swiss referendum

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.600
a little less than a decade ago
on the building of minarets.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.730
A majority of Swiss people
in direct referendum

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.490
voted that Muslims
in the country

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.772
should no longer be able
to build towers which

00:14:21.772 --> 00:14:23.230
are traditionally
used for the call

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.919
to prayer as part of the
mosques in the country.

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:28.960
So as a result, the Swiss
Constitution now reads,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.740
and I quote, "There's freedom
of religion in Switzerland.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.880
The building of
minarets is forbidden."

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.090
Which doesn't make much sense.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.700
Now, that was criticized
in the Swiss media

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.020
and abroad as undemocratic.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.780
And I think that's a
confusion of terms.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.940
What it was was illiberal.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.330
It violated, in ways
that I found intolerable,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.700
the rights of a
religious minority--

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.090
the biggest religious minority,
in fact-- in Switzerland.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.100
But to call it undemocratic
is a little odd,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.102
because a majority of the people
did, in fact, vote for it.

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:05.560
So the way I think to understand
what Viktor Orbán has done

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.530
in Hungary and the way to
understand parts of what Donald

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.200
Trump is trying to do
in the United States is

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.510
it's instituting a form of
democracy without rights,

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.220
a form of illiberal
democracy in this country.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.220
And the danger of it is
that once you've gotten rid

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.800
of the separation of
powers, once you've

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.040
gotten rid of the rule of
law, then eventually it

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.660
becomes very difficult to get
rid of a democratically-elected

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.939
president or prime minister
by democratic means.

00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:37.480
So it's illiberal
democracy, but it's

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.050
an unstable political
regime form.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:48.380
Now, the big question is,
why is this happening?

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.980
Why do we see the
wave of this kind

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.600
of politics rising in
so many different places

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.770
at the same time?

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.700
Now, if you'll indulge me,
I'll answer this question

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.340
by talking about yet another
animal-- not just fish,

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.065
but in this case, a chicken.

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:06.940
And this is the kind of
chicken that we'd all

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.770
like to eat for dinner--

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.160
which is to say, those of you
in the audience who are not

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.197
vegetarian or vegan, at least.

00:16:14.197 --> 00:16:16.030
But it's a good chicken,
because it's local.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.740
It's organic.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.640
It lives on a farm very happily.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.460
It gets to run around.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.230
But the other
animals on the farm

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.290
warn it and say,
hey, be careful.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.360
The farmer only seems nice.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.970
One day, he's going
to come and kill you.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.220
And the chicken says, what
are you talking about?

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.320
All my life, the
farmer has fed me

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.700
and muttered some
encouraging words.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.750
Why would he suddenly
act so differently?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.410
Well, Bertrand Russell-- who
I'm stealing this story from--

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.400
in his nice, wry, British wit,
says, but eventually the farmer

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.770
does come to wring the
chicken's neck, showing

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.620
that more sophisticated views as
to the uniformity of causation

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.360
would have been to
the chicken's benefit.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.047
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:57.047 --> 00:16:58.130
What does he mean by that?

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.838
Well, what he means
by that is that there

00:16:59.838 --> 00:17:02.710
are scope conditions
to how things

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.210
happen in the world, right?

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:11.410
As long as the chicken was too
thin to be taken to the market,

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.500
the farmer had an incentive
to keep feeding it.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.130
Once it was fat enough
to fetch a decent price,

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.140
he had an incentive to kill it.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.670
I think in order
to understand why

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.300
it is that democracy was
so stable for many decades

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.790
and now appears less
and less stable,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.670
we have to ask the
chicken question.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.950
Which is to say
that we have to ask,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.980
what scope conditions were
in place for the past 50,

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.480
60 years that are no
longer in place now?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.757
What's changed?

00:17:42.757 --> 00:17:45.090
And I think that when you
look beyond the United States,

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.740
there's at least
three reasons for that

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.200
that are at play in
many of these countries

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.700
at the same time.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.160
The first is the stagnation
of living standards

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.960
for ordinary people.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.130
So from 1945 to 1960,
the living standard

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.950
of the average American doubled.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.330
From 1960 to 1985,
it doubled again.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.820
Since 1985, it's
essentially been flat.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.220
It's essentially been stagnant.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.380
That really changes how
people think about politics.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.810
They used to say, you know what?

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.580
I don't love those
politicians in DC.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.930
I don't completely trust them.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.871
I don't completely
see myself in them.

00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:29.620
But you know what?

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.660
I'm twice as rich
as my parents were.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.510
My kids are going to
be twice as rich as me.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.270
Let's give them the
benefit of a doubt.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.490
They seem to be delivering.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.130
Now, I think a lot of people
are saying, you know what?

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.080
I've worked really
hard all my life,

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.720
and I don't have all
that much to show for it.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.810
My kids are probably going
to be worse off than me.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.759
So let's throw some shit against
the wall and see what sticks.

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:53.800
How bad could things get?

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.970
Now, there's been a lot
of intelligent commentary

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.750
in the last year or two that
said that the rise of populism

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.930
has nothing to do
with the economy.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.250
And the main argument for that
has been that it's not actually

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.424
true, in the United States,
that poorer people voted more

00:19:15.424 --> 00:19:16.840
for Donald Trump
and richer people

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.880
voted more for Hillary Clinton.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.707
That's correct, but there's
very clear geographic patterns

00:19:23.707 --> 00:19:26.290
to support for populists, which
you see not only in the United

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.270
States, but also in countries
like France or Germany

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:33.730
or Italy, and in countries like
Poland and Hungary and India

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.230
as well.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.790
One of those is
that populists do

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.640
much better in parts
of the country that

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.540
are less economically
affluent, much better in parts

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.680
of a country where there's been
less recent investment, even

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.630
much better in
parts of a country

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.750
where the share of jobs
that might be automated

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.130
in the coming decades is high.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.890
So they are people who
might still be doing OK

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.310
but who have good reason to
fear that the future is not

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.520
going to be especially
kind to them economically.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.270
People who perhaps
still have a decent job

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.894
and are paying off
a mortgage, but they

00:20:11.894 --> 00:20:14.860
are seeing that their
neighbor is having trouble

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.160
keeping up with his mortgage,
and one neighborhood over, it's

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.450
already starting to turn.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:28.060
Now, the other argument against
the economic cause of populism

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.890
is that it also seems
to have something

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.590
to do with identity and
something to do with race.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.250
And I agree with that.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.240
But I think it's a mistake to
think that most interesting

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.530
things in the world
are mono-causal--

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.380
that there's only one cause.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.170
Most of the time,
things go together.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:54.500
If your partner leaves you
because you've cheated on them

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:59.540
and you're an alcoholic and
you're rude to their friends,

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.140
you don't ask which of the
three things is it that did it.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.990
It's clearly a little
bit of all three.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.430
I think the same
way with the rise

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.740
of populism, this whole debate
of, is it cultural identity,

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.350
is not very fruitful.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.190
It is both of those
things, because they

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.130
reinforce each other.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.200
One way of thinking
about this is that when

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.450
people are doing
pretty well and they

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.600
see somebody who they think of
as a member of an outgroup--

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.246
of different along some
salient characteristic--

00:21:32.246 --> 00:21:34.400
they might say, hey,
I'm doing great.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.550
This person over there
is doing great, too.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.610
Good for them.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.540
If they feel like,
I'm not really

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.220
getting what's owed to me.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:43.720
I'm stuck.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.053
I'm not doing particularly
well, and that guy over there

00:21:46.053 --> 00:21:47.700
is doing well?

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.570
Well, what's that all about?

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.000
They become much
angrier about that.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.070
And that's particularly
salient because we're

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.270
going through a very big and
actually historically unique

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.790
transition in virtually
all liberal democracies

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.221
around the world.

00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:03.970
So in continental
Europe where I grew up--

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.220
I was born in Germany and lived
in various parts of Europe--

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.050
most democracies were founded
on a mono-ethnic, mono-cultural

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.920
conception of a nation.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.260
There'd always, obviously, been
a lot of migration in Europe,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.580
and national identity
is a complicated thing

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.651
that's partially
historically constructed.

00:22:24.651 --> 00:22:26.025
But when you asked
a German, when

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:29.700
you asked a Swede, when you
asked an Italian in 1960,

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.020
who is a true Swede?

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.252
Who is a true Italian?

00:22:32.252 --> 00:22:33.960
They would have had
a very simple answer.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.570
They would have said,
well, people who ethnically

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.997
descend from the same group.

00:22:39.997 --> 00:22:42.330
And obviously, somebody who's
brown or black or somebody

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.950
who's Muslim or Jewish or Hindu
is not Italian, not Swedish.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.780
That's clear.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.920
Now, thankfully that has
changed over the last decades

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.590
as we've had a lot
of new immigration

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.670
into European countries.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.670
The legal understanding of who
really belongs has changed.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.740
Citizenship law has liberalized.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.960
A lot of people have
embraced the idea

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.950
that yes, of course somebody can
be a true German irrespective

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.294
of the fact that their
parents or their grandparents

00:23:10.294 --> 00:23:12.960
came to this country from Turkey
or from Syria or from somewhere

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.086
else.

00:23:14.086 --> 00:23:16.650
But there's also a mass
rebellion against that.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.530
People who keep insisting
on that older conception

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.100
of national identity.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.850
And though we don't
have to condone that--

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.530
I personally don't
condone that--

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.460
I think it's actually
helpful to pause for a minute

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.070
to see why that's
understandable.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.764
It shouldn't surprise us
that this is happening.

00:23:34.764 --> 00:23:36.180
And one of the
reasons for that is

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.230
that if you're not the
richest guy in the country,

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.320
you're not the most
educated guy in the country,

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.440
you perhaps don't command
the most social respect,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.250
it's very tempting to
say, well, at least I'm

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.620
better than that guy over there.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.632
And for a long time, that's
what society told you, right?

00:23:52.632 --> 00:23:54.090
Well, that guy over
there might not

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.080
be a politician, that guy over
there might not be your boss.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.430
They may be getting as much or
more social respect than you.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.100
And that means that you're
losing the one thing that you

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.440
can proudly point to
and say, hey, this

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.030
is giving me something.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.770
So it shouldn't
surprise us that there's

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.560
a mass rebellion against that.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.870
Now, the case in
the United States

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.100
is both similar and different.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.480
It's different in
the obvious way

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.855
that the United
States has always

00:24:20.855 --> 00:24:22.840
been a multi-ethnic society.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.540
It's similar in the
equally obvious way

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.914
that the United
States has always

00:24:25.914 --> 00:24:29.880
had a very strict racial
and ethnic hierarchy which

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.880
gave huge advantages to one
ethnic and religious groups

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.832
over others.

00:24:36.832 --> 00:24:42.010
Now, for the past
20, 40, 60 years,

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.890
we've actually made a lot of
progress on that dimension.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.650
It's easy to forget that when
you just look at the headlines.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.060
But I think there's practically
no doubt that for members

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.990
of virtually any minority
group, it's better

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.030
to live in the United
States today than, perhaps

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:03.040
not two years ago, but certainly
20 or 40 or 60 years ago.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.060
And that's something
to actually celebrate.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.520
But again, it's equally
obvious that there is now

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.290
a very strong
rebellion against that,

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.290
and that that rebellion
happens particularly

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.320
in parts of the country not that
have traditionally been diverse

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.320
and that perhaps are more used
to dealing with people who

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.700
are not like the majority group,
but in parts of a country that

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.520
used to be very
homogeneous and are rapidly

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.490
becoming less homogeneous.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.190
Over 2/3 of American
counties were

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:42.176
over 90% white 25 years ago,
and are now less than 90% white.

00:25:42.176 --> 00:25:44.230
And that's an interesting
point of transition,

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.840
because it's about the moment
where you go from rarely having

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.256
to deal with anybody who, quote
unquote, is "not like you"

00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:51.670
to having to do so
on a daily basis.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:01.040
Now, if the economic
causes of all of this

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.360
leads to a baseline lack
of trust in government

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.740
and a baseline
anger about what's

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.840
going to happen to
you in the future,

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.300
and if a lot of that
anger takes a form

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.450
of cultural and
ethnic resentment--

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.544
which is a jealousy at
people being accorded

00:26:16.544 --> 00:26:17.960
equal status when
you used to have

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.350
a whole bunch of privileges--

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.870
then the third
ingredient you need

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.690
to make this cocktail
really lethal

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:31.700
is the rise of the internet
and of social media, which

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.990
explodes a lot of this
underlying frustration.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.470
When you go back 25
years, you, in some way,

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.780
had a world of
communication that

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.400
was quite similar to
300 or 400 years ago.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.090
That sounds like a
ridiculous claim,

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.480
so let me walk you through
it, what I mean by that.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.580
Well, 25 years ago, you had CNN.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:57.350
You could broadcast news
events live with sound

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.490
from all across the world.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.990
That's always
something you couldn't

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:01.430
have done 300 years ago.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.860
But you had a
situation which I would

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.400
call one-to-many communication.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.770
So to have a real voice in
our society 20 years ago,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.140
you had to own a television
station, a radio station,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.040
a publishing house, a
newspaper, or be somebody

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.170
whom the owners of
those institutions

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.171
wanted to give a platform to.

00:27:21.171 --> 00:27:22.670
What's happened
since then is, first

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:29.180
of all, the democratization
of one-to-many communication.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.360
As you have the rise of
websites and the internet,

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.750
anybody can make a site
called [? joeblocks.com, ?]

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:39.920
and billions of people
with internet access

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.030
can go, free of charge,
and see that website.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.860
That is an incredible
structural transformation.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.530
But it's still somewhat
limited, because people

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.560
need to have the idea of
going to [? joeblocks.com. ?]

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.240
And though they might
find you on Google

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.190
and so on, that
number of people is

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.130
going to be relatively limited.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:01.880
Well, in the next step, we went
from democratized one-to-many

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.480
communication to a form of
many-to-many communication,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.530
which is social media.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:13.010
So now you might only have
100 followers on Twitter,

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.900
but if you're on a
United Airlines flight

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:22.017
and you're re-accommodated and
somebody takes a video of that

00:28:22.017 --> 00:28:24.350
and you share it with your
100 followers and 10% of them

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.810
retweet it and 10%
of them retweet it,

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:31.880
very quickly, millions of
people can see this video clip.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:38.240
What this does is to
reduce the importance

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.340
of societal gatekeepers--

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.440
the people who used to
have the power because they

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.970
had political power and capital.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.960
Now, in some countries,
that's a very good thing.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.820
In dictatorships, it
makes it much easier

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:57.820
for the democratic opposition
to organize, to spread news

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.140
about government suppression,
to let people know

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.690
that the dictator is corrupt.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.670
Even in democratic
societies, it can

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.000
empower a lot of
marginalized voices

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.510
that weren't listened to
in the same way earlier.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.060
Just think, as a
recent example, of some

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.726
of the students at
Parkland High in Florida

00:29:18.726 --> 00:29:20.350
who would never have
had the importance

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.100
in our national discourse
and the platform

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.632
they now have if it
weren't for Facebook

00:29:24.632 --> 00:29:25.840
and social media and Twitter.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.650
At the same time, it
obviously also makes

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.700
it easier for people who
want to spread hateful views,

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.890
for people who have
racist views, for people

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.700
who want to spread fake news,
for people who just want

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.360
to organize at the extremes
of the political spectrum

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.430
to be much more effective.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.970
So social media favors
the forces of instability

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:03.330
and of change over those of
stability and continuity.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.170
And at a moment
when there's already

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.150
a lot of political
disenchantment and distrust

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.850
of the system and
there's already

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.890
a difficult moment of
transition on the way

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.470
to an equal multi-ethnic society
from which a lot of people

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.150
have something to lose, that
becomes a very dangerous

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.100
addition to the mix.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.960
So what do we do
about all of that?

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.150
How do we respond to
these three developments?

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:36.890
Well, I think that we need
to actually counteract

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.380
some of the structural
drivers of populism.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:45.240
And that means dealing with
each of these underlying causes.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.360
The first thing
is to show people

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.780
that politics can
actually deliver on them,

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.560
and that they can have a
better economic future.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.510
That things are
not already great,

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.800
that things are not going
to be worse in the future,

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.920
that they're actually
going to be better.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.550
The people who advocated--
the Brexiteers who advocated

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.970
for the United Kingdom to
leave the European Union--

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.120
had a slogan that actually
was quite brilliant.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.580
It said, take back control.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.890
Now, there was an element of
anti-immigrant dog whistle

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.460
to that, but there's also
an appeal to very legitimate

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.550
aspirations that people have.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.830
Citizens want to feel
that they have control

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.170
of their own lives,
and that the nation has

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.096
control of its fate in
the age of globalization.

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:31.970
I think there's a lot
more that politicians--

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.374
without going to the
ideological extremes,

00:31:34.374 --> 00:31:36.290
and certainly without
going towards populism--

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:39.920
can do to deliver
on that promise.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.550
There's no reason why it should
be so easy for rich individuals

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.670
to hide their money
in tax havens.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.600
We can make much stricter
rules around that.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.910
We can invest much more money
into investigating them.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.760
We can raise
punishment for people

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.490
who do hide their money
in that kind of way,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:02.640
creating a real
disincentive to doing that.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.860
There's no reason
why corporations

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.304
should pay more or
less tax depending

00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:10.970
on whether their
nominal headquarters is

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:17.690
in Delaware or Massachusetts
or in Ireland or Luxembourg.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.170
So there can be
changes around that.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:26.000
We can do a lot more in order
to raise productivity, which

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.610
is one of the great
drivers of inequality

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:32.090
and economic stagnation-- the
lack of growing productivity.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.820
And that requires us to invest
a lot more money in education,

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.750
to use technology much
more smartly in education,

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.760
and to make sure that
we actually invest

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.850
in ongoing adult education, not
just at the point when somebody

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.360
might lose their job, but at
the point when they're in a job.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.410
They should have the resources
to keep up with technology,

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.490
to keep up with the
cutting-edge skills they need

00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:00.020
in their particular fields.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.360
And finally, we also
need to make sure

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.720
that people don't have to spend
such a vast share of what they

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.750
earn on life's necessities.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:14.540
When you just look at the
post-tax income of people,

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.910
it has actually gone up.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.210
But the post-tax
disposable income

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.490
has barely gone up, or in many
parts of the country gone down.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.990
And one of the reasons for that
is the vast amounts of money

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:31.370
they have to spend to send
their kids to school or college,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.600
go to the doctor,
and buy a house.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.540
And there are things we can
do to solve that, including

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:44.270
trying to actually vastly
increase the supply of doctors

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.270
in the country, the supply
of housing in the country.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.920
The second question
is around how

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.170
we can facilitate
this transition

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.530
to a multi-ethnic society.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:02.165
Now, having grown up Jewish
in Germany, my temptation--

00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:04.790
and it's a temptation that a lot
of people on the left have had

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.500
for a long time--

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.530
has always been to say, let's
leave collective identity

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.090
behind altogether.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.239
Why do we need this weird
thing called the nation?

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.449
Let's leave that in the 20th
century, which it so cruelly

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:20.290
shaped.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.350
A more recent
response to the rise,

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.484
particularly of
exclusive nationalism

00:34:26.484 --> 00:34:28.650
and what I would call the
white nationalism of parts

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:34.120
of the White House, is
to say, let's celebrate

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.679
different collective groups.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:40.310
Let's celebrate every ethnic,
religious, and sexual group,

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.040
but not the nation--

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.909
all of the groups at
a sub-national level.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:49.090
Now, I've come to think
that both of these responses

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.350
are, in important
ways, mistaken.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:56.350
That actually, yes,
you need to fight

00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:00.010
against the jingoistic
aspects of nationalism.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.470
And yet, of course,
without any compromise,

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.950
you have to defend groups
that are under attack

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.285
from the policies of the
current administration

00:35:08.285 --> 00:35:09.910
and other governments
around the world.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.330
But at the same
time, you actually

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.440
should emphasize what
unites us as Americans

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.464
across racial and ethnic
and religious divides.

00:35:24.464 --> 00:35:26.130
That actually,
nationalism traditionally

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.700
has been a way of
increasing solidarity

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.500
beyond your immediate
family group,

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.020
your immediate ethnic group,
your immediate neighborhood

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.040
or town.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.110
So that even as we sit in
Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:44.250
we can look at a hurricane
in Houston, Texas,

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.591
or for that matter in
Puerto Rico, and say,

00:35:48.591 --> 00:35:50.887
those are our compatriots.

00:35:50.887 --> 00:35:51.720
We should help them.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.360
The crucial thing, of
course, is to fight

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.710
for a notion of this nationalism
or this patriotism that

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:03.955
is inclusive.

00:36:03.955 --> 00:36:05.330
I've come to think
of nationalism

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.850
as a half wild beast.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.580
That if you leave it alone,
the worst kinds of people

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.520
are going to come in and
stoke it and bait it until it

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.160
becomes really dangerous.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:21.230
And the response, I think,
is to try and domesticate it

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.695
as best we can, being aware that
it can always turn dangerous,

00:36:24.695 --> 00:36:27.590
but that we need to
claim its meaning

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.420
and make it work for us.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.960
I don't always agree with
Emmanuel Macron, the president

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.390
of France, but I think he
had a really beautiful speech

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:39.980
in the city of Marseille
during his election campaign.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.930
Where he said, when I
look into this room,

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.640
I see people from
the Ivory Coast

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.860
and from Mali and from Algeria
and from Italy and from Poland,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.790
but what do I see?

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.357
I see the people of Marseille.

00:36:49.357 --> 00:36:49.940
What do I see?

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.340
I see the people of France.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.580
Look here, ladies and gentlemen
from the Front National, this

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.160
is what it means to
be proud to be French.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.690
That, to me, encapsulates
what I'm talking about nicely.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.110
Now, third and
finally, and then I

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:08.300
promise that I'm
about to shut up,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.340
how do we respond to the
role of social media?

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.923
Well, I don't think
the right response

00:37:11.923 --> 00:37:15.309
is to censor what can
be said on social media.

00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:16.850
I don't think that
works technically.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.800
I think people would
go to other platforms.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.970
I certainly don't think
that the government

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:20.886
should have that role.

00:37:20.886 --> 00:37:22.580
I certainly do
think that we should

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.770
push Facebook and Twitter
to enforce the community

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.950
guidelines more strongly and
the privacy guidelines more

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.627
strongly.

00:37:29.627 --> 00:37:31.460
But I don't think that
the government should

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.001
be overly-involved in regulating
free speech on the internet,

00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:35.870
because I believe in
the First Amendment.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.960
So if we can't
effectively control

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.790
the supply of hate
speech, what we can do

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.260
is to control the demand for it.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.700
And one of the
ways of doing that

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.910
is to actually become
more proud defenders

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.190
of our political system.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.440
Look, from Plato to
Aristotle and from Rousseau

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.600
to the founding
fathers, every set

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.820
of historical thinkers
about self-government

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.830
has emphasized the
importance of transmitting

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:05.870
our political values from
one generation to the next.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.650
And we don't take that
seriously anymore.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.690
The number of hours we spend on
civics lessons in our schools

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:15.410
has plummeted over
the past decades.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.880
Even when you're teaching at
college, as I do at Harvard,

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.660
I think very few professors
think of their role in part

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.792
as being to instill
our political values

00:38:26.792 --> 00:38:29.000
and a pride in what's good
about our political values

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.541
in the young.

00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:33.044
We talk a lot about what's
wrong with our political system.

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:33.710
And that's good.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.209
There's lots of
things wrong, and we

00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:36.990
need to be upfront
about those things.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.690
But we never explain why it
is that despite the injustices

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.740
in the United States today, it
is better to live in America

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.280
than it is to live in
Russia or China or Venezuela

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.100
or any number of other
authoritarian regimes

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.600
around the world.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.370
And that's something that we
need to do more proactively.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:39:00.710
Now, sometimes
when I talk, people

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.880
tell me that I'm a
little depressing.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.600
So I hope I haven't
depressed you too much.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.150
But I want to end
on a hopeful note.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.440
I went to see a talk by
Amos Oz a few months ago,

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.770
and he said, look, there's
a big fire burning out there

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.300
in the world.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.270
And it can feel helpless to know
what we, as individuals, can

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.650
do about it.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:26.610
But frankly,
there's a lot of us.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.060
There's a lot of us in the
room and watching the video,

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.601
and there's a lot
of people out there

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:34.430
in the world whom we can
reach with our message.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:38.180
And if each of us pours a little
bit of water on the fire, then

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:43.096
collectively, we might
just be able to put it out.

00:39:43.096 --> 00:39:44.720
So I think one of my
goals in this talk

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.040
is that if you agree with me
on some of the analysis, then

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.320
you'll have some ideas of
what you can go and do.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.380
If you disagree with me,
you'll have your own ideas

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.800
about what we should do in
order to fight populism.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.270
But there's things we can do.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:03.410
Unlike people in Russia
and Venezuela and Turkey,

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:06.950
we still have the ability to
go and fight for our values

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:12.170
without living in fear of
being imprisoned or murdered.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.236
So let's fight for our values.

00:40:14.236 --> 00:40:15.192
Thanks.

00:40:15.192 --> 00:40:18.538
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.880
AUDIENCE: So if we accept
that economic stagnation

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.790
and inequality are very much at
the base of what's happening,

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.170
a big question that I
have is, why hasn't there

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.320
been more of a successful
leftist response

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.481
to this instead of an
authoritarian populist

00:40:41.481 --> 00:40:41.980
response?

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.390
Seems to me there are two
rather obvious things.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:47.230
One is all of the animosity
toward immigrants,

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:49.090
blacks, et cetera.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.380
The other is the decline
of labor unions, which

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.857
I think needs to be explained.

00:40:54.857 --> 00:40:56.940
I don't think it should
just be taken for granted.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:01.750
But even with all that, we had
a very popular Bernie Sanders

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.300
movement.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.890
What's a little more
mystifying to me

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:08.500
is what's happened in
Europe, where there

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.740
is a much stronger
labor movement,

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.310
much stronger socialist
party kind of movement.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.080
And yet, all of those
socialist parties

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.720
seem to be falling apart.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.190
And I don't know that much about
the situation with the labor

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:29.890
movement in Europe,
but in general,

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.180
what is there that's inevitable
about a move to the right

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.700
rather than a move to
the left, which one

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.299
might expect to see more of?

00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:40.090
YASCHA MOUNK: So I
think part of the answer

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.950
is that there
certainly are countries

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:47.110
in which there has been a
rise of far-left populism.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:50.140
Obviously, Venezuela, which
had many decades of economic

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.840
stagnation before Hugo Chávez
took power there and eventually

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.660
really did destroy democracy
there in a terrible way.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.090
But also parts of
southern Europe, right?

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:02.130
So when you look at Greece and
Spain, in certain ways, Italy--

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.990
though a little less so than it
looked a couple of years ago--

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.620
you do see some of that.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.960
But I think, in the end--

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.520
and this is my
response to people

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.987
who want to defend
left-wing populism-- now,

00:42:12.987 --> 00:42:15.070
on my definition of populism,
it's not clear to me

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.320
that Bernie Sanders is
a populist, by the way.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.160
I don't actually
think he is, right?

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.510
So you can have a robust
left-wing economic policy

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:26.020
program without saying,
my political adversary

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.930
is illegitimate and I should
be given all of the power

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:29.856
and so on, right?

00:42:32.686 --> 00:42:34.060
But one of my
responses to people

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.518
who are tempted by a form of
actual left-wing populism that

00:42:36.518 --> 00:42:38.380
says, get rid of all
of these institutions.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.590
Who cares about any of that?

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.890
We just care about
economic or social justice.

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.140
Well, one of the answers
is that you might end up

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.800
in a place like Venezuela, which
is not a great place to live.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.720
But the other answer
is, I think, in the end,

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.410
you're not going to win.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:56.680
I just think that between saying
the banks are screwing us over

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.750
and capitalism is a
problem and saying,

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.000
you know what your problem is?

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.511
That guy over there.

00:43:02.511 --> 00:43:03.760
He's coming into your country.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.570
He's stealing your job.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.220
I just think that's
more powerful.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.130
And so whenever you
get a competition

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.950
of left and right populism,
you get a fracturing

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.511
of a coalition you need to
actually defend democracy.

00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:16.510
And in the end, the people
who tend to win out--

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.360
and we've seen this many times
over the course of history--

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.630
is the far-right.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.610
AUDIENCE: My question's
about populism and education.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.140
Is there a connection
where lowered education

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.390
drives populism, or maybe
the other way around?

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.769
Or is there no
connection at all?

00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:35.560
YASCHA MOUNK: Well, so
there's definitely--

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:41.230
I mean, as Donald Trump famously
said, "I love the uneducated."

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:43.820
So there's definitely,
in many countries,

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.750
a link between people
who are less qualified,

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.450
less educated, and
the willingness

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.940
to vote for populism.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.980
There are some interesting
cases where that's not the case.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.450
I mean, actually, in Germany--

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.280
I'll take a wild
guess that that's

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.740
where you're from, as am I--

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.279
interestingly, there's
not a very clear pattern

00:44:05.279 --> 00:44:07.070
in support for the
alternative for Germany.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.160
It's actually a lot of more
educated people as well,

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.520
so there are some
exceptions to that.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.121
But yeah, by and
large, I would say

00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:16.870
there's two educational
roots of populism.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.696
One of them is just
that the less educated

00:44:19.696 --> 00:44:21.070
you are, the more
reason you have

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:22.810
to be afraid of the
future, the more you

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.280
might act out in that
kind of populist support.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.090
And the second is,
well, I think we haven't

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.210
done a good job of transmitting
our values through education,

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.400
and that's a broader
set of reasons

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.300
why people don't do that.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.140
Now, I think that needs
to go, by the way,

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.311
beyond critical thinking.

00:44:39.311 --> 00:44:41.560
So both in Germany and, to
some degree, in the States,

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.510
the well-meaning
response to this

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.660
is, well, we just have to teach
people to think critically

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.860
about the world.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.729
But actually,
populists always claim

00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:51.520
that they think critically
about the world.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.810
Don't trust the institutions.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.450
Don't trust what the
mainstream media tell you.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:56.680
You're sheeple.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.897
You have to go and
research for yourself.

00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:01.480
So it has to go beyond critical
education or critical thinking

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.180
skills.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.790
It has to be critical
thinking skills

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:09.310
rooted in a defense of our
institutions and of our values.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:13.030
AUDIENCE: You mentioned economic
stagnation in the last 40 or 50

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.410
years in the United States.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:16.930
Are there examples of that
in other countries, too?

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.500
I'm just not familiar
with the history

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.180
in, for example,
Germany and the UK.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.050
YASCHA MOUNK: So absolutely,
in most of Western Europe,

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.590
you have a less extreme
set of developments,

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.620
which is one of the
signs that the reasons

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.740
for the absolute stagnation
of middle-class incomes

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.840
in the United States is not
globalization and automation,

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.880
all of those things.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.152
A good part of it is
political choices.

00:45:42.152 --> 00:45:44.110
And those political
choices have, by and large,

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:45.651
been little better
in Western Europe.

00:45:45.651 --> 00:45:50.554
And so as a result, you have
a little higher improvements

00:45:50.554 --> 00:45:52.220
of living standards
for ordinary people.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.880
But absolutely, when you look
at most of Western Europe

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.997
from 1950 to 1975, 1980,
you went from lots of people

00:45:58.997 --> 00:46:01.330
not having central heating,
definitely not having a car,

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.290
not having a television, in
some cases not having access

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:11.680
to doctors, to living a
comfortable life with a house

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.410
and a car or two and a
big entertainment system

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.890
at home to boot, right?

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.790
And though there's been some
increases in living standards

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:21.520
for the past 30 years,
it's been nothing

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.667
comparable to that
moment of transformation.

00:46:24.667 --> 00:46:27.250
Now, the case gets a little more
complicated in Central Europe

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.440
and in parts of Asia.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.650
But there, I think,
it is people have

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:34.006
fallen short of expectations.

00:46:34.006 --> 00:46:35.380
So though Poland
and Hungary have

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.505
done very well economically
over the last 30 years,

00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:39.379
people thought they were
going to have living

00:46:39.379 --> 00:46:40.570
standards like in the West.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.120
And what they've seen,
especially in rural areas,

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.491
is not nearly close
living standards.

00:46:46.491 --> 00:46:48.490
And the people who have
done best in this system

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.500
are the people who are
politically connected,

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.750
often who are old Communist
elites, often who are crooks,

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:54.250
right?

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.960
And so there's a real
anger there that's

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.126
economically rooted as well.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.670
AUDIENCE: There
are some people who

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:06.510
allege that some of the
elections that we've

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:14.670
seen strong populist
results from

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:20.820
are, in part, the result
of active state-sponsored

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.930
campaigns of propaganda
and misinformation,

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.690
and that some of those
votes, arguably-- or that

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.180
those elections, arguably--
have already not been

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:35.010
free and fair here and
in France and in Italy.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:38.940
And I wondered if you
had thoughts about that,

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:46.560
and if there are structural
approaches to combating

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.180
that state-sponsored
action from nation-states

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.930
with an active interest in
destabilizing democracies?

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:56.680
YASCHA MOUNK: Yeah.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.820
So look, that's
another area where

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.240
I think there's all of these
weird, fruitless either/or

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.490
discussions, when it
can clearly be both.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.010
Sometimes, when you
look about debates,

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.660
it's obviously
the Trumpist right

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.632
that has an interest
in just downplaying

00:48:11.632 --> 00:48:13.590
any kind of Russian
meddling, because they just

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.890
want to defend Trump.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.670
But even on the left of that,
even among people who dislike

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:22.126
Trump, for some, there's this
weird debate between more

00:48:22.126 --> 00:48:24.000
of a center-left than
the far-left in certain

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.260
incarnations, but it can
take different forms as well,

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.990
where it--

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.650
to caricature one
position, it's--

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:35.089
well, Russia is the only reason
why Hillary Clinton lost,

00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:37.630
and so let's just focus on that
and everything else is great.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.830
And then on the other side,
let's not talk about Russia.

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:41.230
All the people who want
to talk about Russia

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.360
just want to talk about
Russia because they

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.550
love Hillary Clinton and
don't want to-- right?

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.800
And it can be both, right?

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.750
I mean, it's
absolutely plausible

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.860
that various forms of
meddling and the data

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.500
breach with Cambridge
Analytica and all

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.540
of those kinds of
things may have

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.970
made a difference of 80,000
votes in three states.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.860
It's very, very
difficult to test that.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.570
It's plausible that
it may have been.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.790
At the same time,
it's obviously true

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.592
that even if that
hadn't happened,

00:49:07.592 --> 00:49:10.050
Donald Trump still would have
been within striking distance

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.610
of winning the presidency.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.000
And if everything was fine,
if people weren't pissed off

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.170
at the political
system, if it had

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.420
a non-populist political
candidate they were really

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.630
excited about, Donald Trump
shouldn't have been anywhere

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:23.800
within striking distance
of winning the election.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.115
So we can take the threat
of Russian meddling

00:49:27.115 --> 00:49:28.740
and other forms of
outside interference

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.532
very seriously without having
to fall into the trap of saying,

00:49:31.532 --> 00:49:33.990
well, if that's the case, then
there's nothing else we need

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.250
to change, right?

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:37.780
Now, to your specific question
of what can we do about that?

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.100
Well, in lots of
European countries,

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.173
the answer is
really simple, which

00:49:40.173 --> 00:49:42.256
is that they don't have
the laws that America has.

00:49:42.256 --> 00:49:44.130
Until I became a citizen
about a year ago,

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.680
I wasn't allowed to donate
to political campaigns.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.080
It was actually a
reasonable law, right?

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.910
In Europe, there
isn't such laws.

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:53.610
So Russian state
banks can bankroll

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:55.215
European political parties.

00:49:55.215 --> 00:49:58.740
They usually don't do it openly,
but they do it legally, right?

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.980
Well, we can change that.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.730
In the United States,
I think we can

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:06.410
be much clearer in
investigating what's going on,

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:10.830
obviously protecting
the Mueller probe.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.820
But also actually improving
our electoral infrastructure.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:18.630
It's very, very easy to hack
into our voting machines.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:22.320
And an outside
power can do that--

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.110
in one county, change
a couple of votes

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.960
around, not have an impact on
the outcome of the election,

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.530
and have a huge de-legitimizing
impact on people

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.980
trusting their democracy.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.970
So we need to act on that
really, really urgently,

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:38.070
and we're not, and
that's really scary.

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:44.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you, I want to
pick up on the electoral system

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:45.270
question.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:46.770
I'm wondering to
what degree you see

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:49.380
a connection between
the rise in populism

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.040
and the electoral
systems we have,

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.330
particularly in
the United States.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.820
Donald Trump won the election,
but he didn't actually

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.250
get the most votes.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:50:59.880
And--

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.280
YASCHA MOUNK: He did, because
it was all fraud and fake news.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.270
AUDIENCE: He got the
most electoral votes,

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.480
but he didn't get the
most votes of the people.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.540
YASCHA MOUNK: No, I
mean Donald Trump claims

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.530
that he won the popular vote.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:07.910
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:08.820
YASCHA MOUNK: But
we'll ignore that, so.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.380
AUDIENCE: Ignore that part.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:14.820
And most jurisdictions, we
don't have any kind of majority

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.410
runoff or ranked choice system.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:18.118
We don't have proportional
representation

00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:19.770
in the United States,
which restricts

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.890
the degree to which people
have a say in their government.

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.377
So just comment on that and
what connections you see.

00:51:26.377 --> 00:51:27.960
YASCHA MOUNK: So
look, I think there's

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.270
one set of institutional
failings that is a big part

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.728
of a [? book, ?]
that I didn't talk

00:51:31.728 --> 00:51:34.650
about in this particular
talk, which is just

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.950
around the
unresponsiveness of a lot

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.730
of our political
institutions and the role

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:40.800
that money plays in
politics and the revolving

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.570
door between lobbyists
and legislators,

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:45.042
and the rise of a
very complicated

00:51:45.042 --> 00:51:46.500
bureaucratic and
technocratic state

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.610
which makes people
feel like nobody's

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:48.568
listening to me anyway.

00:51:48.568 --> 00:51:51.715
I think that's one
particular reason.

00:51:51.715 --> 00:51:53.340
I also think that
there are, obviously,

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.519
problems with gerrymandering
and with the electoral college

00:51:56.519 --> 00:51:58.810
in the United States that
are specific to this country.

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:04.450
But I'm not sure that
institutional explanations

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:06.940
have a lot of weight in
understanding populism

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.100
in general.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.420
In political science--

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.259
I'm a political
scientist-- the last 40, 50

00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:14.800
years of political science have
only been about institutions.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.280
They've all been
about before us,

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.446
people ignored institutions.

00:52:17.446 --> 00:52:19.000
It's actually all
about institutions.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.500
Well, what's
fascinating is that you

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.200
have a rise of populists
in two-party systems

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.880
like the United
States, but you also

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.380
have them in
parliamentary systems

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.150
like Hungary and Poland.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:30.280
You also have them in
presidential systems.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.600
So actually, since
this similar phenomenon

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.854
is going on in all kinds
of different countries

00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:38.520
that don't have a
two-party system, that

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.780
don't have the
electoral college,

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.690
I don't think that that's the
most important driving force,

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:46.070
though it certainly exacerbated
the [? former ?] talk

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:50.590
in the United States in 2016.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.590
AUDIENCE: You touched a
little bit on the impact

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:57.190
that economic instability
can have on people's

00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:00.140
long-range viewpoints.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:03.177
So we've got a big rise
in automation and lots

00:53:03.177 --> 00:53:04.635
of jobs disappearing
because of it,

00:53:04.635 --> 00:53:06.200
and it's not really
going to stop.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.530
It's going to get worse.

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:11.800
What do you think institutions
or nations or governments

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.610
can do to address that
underlying instability, where

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.890
we may be in a scenario
where 10%, 20%,

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.530
30% of people in a
country don't have jobs,

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:23.570
or they don't need to have jobs?

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:24.820
YASCHA MOUNK: So a few points.

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:28.150
First, I know that universal
basic income is something

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:30.680
that people who work for
companies like Google

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.170
like to think about.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.774
And I think there's a serious
discussion to be had there.

00:53:34.774 --> 00:53:36.190
I'm a little
politically skeptical

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:37.810
of it, because I think
a lot of the people who

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:39.940
vote for populists are people
who think of themselves

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.690
as superior to some
other people in society.

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:42.370
That's true of most people.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:43.995
We think of ourselves,
in various ways,

00:53:43.995 --> 00:53:46.900
as superior to some other people
in society, so don't judge.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.667
But they say, I'm lower-middle
class and middle class,

00:53:49.667 --> 00:53:51.250
and I'm not somebody
who's unemployed.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:53.650
I'm not somebody who's
working class, right?

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:55.900
And to go to those people
and say, hey, you know what?

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.910
You're probably going to lose
your job, but it's fine--

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.446
because life for people at
the very bottom of society

00:53:59.446 --> 00:54:01.540
who are going to get
universal basic income

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.740
is a politically difficult
conversation to have.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:07.600
And so I have some skepticism
about the political feasibility

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.430
of that.

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:12.240
More broadly, I think that,
look, if 50% of our jobs

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.080
are just going to go away
because of automation,

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.515
it's going to be very difficult
for democracy to survive.

00:54:17.515 --> 00:54:21.210
But thankfully, that
may be overblown.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:22.610
It may not be 50%.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.827
So in the meanwhile,
what we can do is--

00:54:24.827 --> 00:54:27.160
I'm sometimes asked about
whether I support a robot tax.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.790
And I say, no, I don't, but
I'm against the human tax.

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.290
At the moment, a company that
makes a billion-dollar revenue

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:37.930
a year and has 10 employees
pays a lot less in tax

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:40.630
than a company that has a
billion-dollar revenue a year

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.240
and has 1,000 employees,
because of payroll taxes

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.490
and all kinds of other things.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.350
So there's all kinds of things
we can do to actually encourage

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.020
investing in humans and
employing humans that

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.600
is short of either the universal
basic income or something

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.735
like a robot tax.

00:54:53.735 --> 00:54:55.360
AUDIENCE: I just have
a question that's

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.160
building off one of
the prior answers

00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:02.557
about how we see people
ultimately lean to the right.

00:55:02.557 --> 00:55:04.390
I think, in some of the
texts that I've read

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:08.170
and so forth, particularly
within the political system

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:11.620
in the United States, more
of the left-leaning policies

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:16.300
require a little more research
and a little more understanding

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:20.140
to see how they can benefit the
population, as opposed to some

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.940
of the more populist
policies that

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.220
feel more visceral for certain
populations and so forth.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:29.440
So with this rise of populism
and with this impulse politics

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.770
that is just fundamentally
easier for a lot of people

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:33.620
to grasp--

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.950
and this question may be too
big for anyone to answer,

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:38.440
but how do we, as a
country or as a society

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.280
or, as the cautiously
optimistic few that are

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.810
trying to put out the fire--

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:49.360
work to educate people to see
the benefit of not defaulting

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.616
to impulse?

00:55:50.616 --> 00:55:52.990
YASCHA MOUNK: Why don't I take
both questions, and then--

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.180
AUDIENCE: I was just
wanting to follow up

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:58.000
on the basic income thing.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.710
I understand that there are
two different variants of it

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.210
around.

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.450
One that phases out
as one has a good job,

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:08.770
and I can easily see how
that would be very insulting.

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.830
What about an actual
universal income,

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:16.530
where the government sends out
per capita checks to everyone,

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.820
whether they have a job or not?

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.120
YASCHA MOUNK: Yeah,
so I didn't mean--

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.970
I had that in mind, right?

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.950
And I don't mean that it's like,
oh, once you lose your job,

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.350
we're going to help you
and people [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:36.400
I think that's the
big answer, right?

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.640
We assume that 50% of
jobs are going to go away.

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.130
Now, our big answer is, it's OK.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.710
Like everybody else in society,
you're going to get a check.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.520
It still basically tells
people that the social distance

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.305
between them and other people
in society is being flattened,

00:56:51.305 --> 00:56:53.180
and they're not going
to be happy about that.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.600
Now, perhaps that's
the best we can do.

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.312
And we certainly don't have
a claim to feeling better

00:56:59.312 --> 00:57:00.520
than other people in society.

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.840
It's not like there's
a God-given right

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.964
to feel superior to others.

00:57:02.964 --> 00:57:05.441
I'm just saying that I think,
as a political response,

00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:06.940
it's not going to
be very effective.

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.645
Because if you tell people, hey,
I know you're losing your job,

00:57:09.645 --> 00:57:11.020
but don't worry,
everybody inside

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.853
is going to get a basic
income and you still

00:57:12.853 --> 00:57:15.670
get to have a
basically decent life,

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.580
I'm going to say, oh, but
I once was somebody, right?

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.780
This is a way of--

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:28.234
to go back to that intersection
between economics and culture,

00:57:28.234 --> 00:57:29.650
I talked to a
politician who said,

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:31.900
look, 25 years ago, when I
asked people, who are you,

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:35.260
in my district, they
said, I'm a Teamster,

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:39.380
or I'm a steel worker, or I'm a
foreman in the factory, right?

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.750
Today, they don't have that.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.892
They don't have that
earned identity anymore.

00:57:43.892 --> 00:57:45.850
They don't get the same
belonging and pride out

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:46.570
of their job.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.240
And so now when I ask them,
who are you, they might say,

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.000
well, I'm white, and I don't
like those people over there,

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:51.790
right?

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.280
And I fear that
basic income is not

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:58.000
able to give people an earned
identity in the kind of way

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.520
that pushes them away from
the temptation of that kind

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.400
of ascriptive identity.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.260
Now, in response to
the other question--

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.970
look, one way of
talking about this

00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.490
is that, to me,
the 2016 election

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:19.120
was a competition between a
moderate politics of the status

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.969
quo and an extremist
politics of change.

00:58:22.969 --> 00:58:25.510
Now, a lot of people vote for
the extremist politic of change

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:26.770
perhaps because
they're extremists.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:29.103
I think, more likely, because
they really wanted change.

00:58:29.103 --> 00:58:32.236
They really wanted a
vision of a better future.

00:58:32.236 --> 00:58:33.610
And so I think
what we need to do

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.359
is to give them a realistic,
non-extremist vision

00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:38.650
of what that future looks like.

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:41.800
In the end, as long as people
say, the system is screwed

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.810
and nobody cares about
me and there's not

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:45.484
much for me in
the future anyway,

00:58:45.484 --> 00:58:46.900
they're always
going to be tempted

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:48.620
by the most extreme people.

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:52.330
And so what we need to do is to
give people a realistic sense

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:54.002
that no, you know what?

00:58:54.002 --> 00:58:55.710
If [INAUDIBLE] people
who are [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:57.670
[? accept ?] an equal
multi-ethnic society,

00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:00.360
if I do my bit,
then you know what?

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.170
Actually, life is going
to be better for me.

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:05.920
Politicians do have
something to offer me.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.687
The system has
something to offer me.

00:59:07.687 --> 00:59:09.520
And that's really hard
work, because there's

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.880
all kinds of complicated reasons
why a system doesn't do it

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.590
effectively at the moment.

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:18.610
But if we manage to do that,
if we manage to actually

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.811
give people hope
for a better future,

00:59:20.811 --> 00:59:22.810
then I think they're going
to be willing to vote

00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:25.600
for people who can actually
make that possible.

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.800
Thanks.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.150
[APPLAUSE]
