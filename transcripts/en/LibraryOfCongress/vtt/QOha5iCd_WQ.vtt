00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.910
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.910
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Welcome
to marine invertebrates.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.960
I think that's pretty
cool; right?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.240
[ Applause ]

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.590
Any marine invertebrates
here today?

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.890
Anybody? No.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.760
My name is Linda Holmes,
and I work at NPR.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.630
I host a podcast called
Pop Culture Happy Hour.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.890
And I am not a scientist.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.840
But when I had the opportunity
to find an interesting event

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.940
to perhaps help moderate,
I gravitated to this one

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.390
because it looked so
interesting to me.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.690
So I dove right in, so to speak.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.850
Sorry. Terrible water puns.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.080
And we're going to have a chat.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.020
I'm going to ask both of you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.310
to introduce yourselves,
if you would.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.520
Because, since I'm
not a scientist,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490
I'm afraid I'll say
something wrong.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.170
So, Sy, you want to
introduce yourself.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.480
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery:
I'm Sy Montgomery.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.300
And, gosh, often I introduce
myself as a former swine herd.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.230
But we just had one pig.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.960
My, a previous book was
called "The Good Good Pig."

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.260
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.560
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yes, yes.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.860
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: So,
but this is my first book

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.160
about a marine invertebrate.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.460
Everybody else I've written

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.670
about in my 26 books has
been vertebrate animals.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.740
But most of the world, as
we know, most of the animals

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.600
on the world are invertebrates.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.150
And most of them
live in the sea.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.450
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes:
It's a big place.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.750
It's a big place.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.050
Lots of animals.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.350
Juli, you want to
introduce yourself.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.650
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.950
I'm Juli Berwald.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.250
And I used to be a scientist.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.550
And now I'm a science writer.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.050
And, let's see, I
often introduce myself

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.740
as a science writer.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.040
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.570
So, and I apologize
for doing that.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.110
Because really normally I would
give the lovely introduction.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.580
But I was so afraid,
like I said,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.410
that I would misstate something.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.760
Because this is, as I
said, not really my field.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.790
But it was fascinating
to me as a layperson.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.500
Which I think with both of
your books, they are meant

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.830
to have sort of not just a
science-directed viewpoint.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.260
But they are meant to mean
something to people even

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.120
if they don't have a
strong basis in science.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.420
Is that right, Sy?

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.720
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.020
Absolutely.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.710
And I am not a scientist.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.390
I'm just a writer.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.080
But the layperson is the
person that has the power

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.460
over whether this sweet
green world survives or not.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.190
So I'm honored to be
writing for that audience.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.490
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.790
Is that true of you too, Juli?

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.090
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.390
I mean, you know, when I
got the idea to write a book

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.820
about jellyfish, I was like,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.960
who wants to read a
book about jellyfish?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.040
And then I, but then
I realized, you know,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.780
I think anyone might want to
read a book about jellyfish

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.140
if it's written so that
there's other things in there

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.520
that make it a compelling read.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.250
And I really had in mind I want
to write a book about science

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.390
that people who never have read
science before might enjoy.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.690
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.990
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: So that
was a big part of, yeah,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.290
that was big part
of my motivation.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.590
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.200
So I'm going to start,
Juli, why jellyfish?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.690
And people who have read the
book know some of this story.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.280
But what is it about jellyfish?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.580
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.380
They're definitely the
underdog character, so to speak.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.390
But, yeah, jellyfish are
telling us about, they're sort

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.090
of the opposite of the
canary in the coal mine.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.090
In that there's a lot of places
in the world, more than half

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.390
of the coastlines

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.890
where jellyfish numbers
seem to be on the rise.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.990
They're abundances are growing.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.430
And for, the reasons
are a lot of the things

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.070
that we are doing to the ocean.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.920
So things like coastal
development

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.470
without really thinking
about what we're doing.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.590
Overfishing.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.970
Shipping. You know,
building big canals.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.510
These things that
seem kind of distant

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.520
from us are affecting
the jellyfish.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.820
So the jellyfish gave me this
platform to talk about things

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.620
that are really, really
important in a global sense.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.050
But from a really
interesting angle that a lot

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.290
of people didn't
know much about.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.590
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.950
Okay, Sy, why octopuses.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.310
And I will say, Less, do
you think I am illiterate?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.590
And they are struggling
not to correct me.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.750
It is octopuses, am I right?

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.050
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Absolutely.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.350
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Okay.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.650
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: I
grew up hearing octopi.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.050
But apparently that
is incorrect.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.160
Or at least you will be
corrected if you talk

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.400
to the people who
study these animals.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.330
So we got to stay in
their good graces.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.630
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Absolutely.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.290
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: So
octopuses, as I said,

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.470
I'd written about lots
of vertebrates before.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.320
I have 26 different books
from snow leopards to pigs.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.080
To, I actually did have
another eight legger,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.750
but he was a tarantula.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.840
But octopuses are so unlike us.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.160
You know, we're separated

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.150
by half a billion
years of evolution.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.790
Their bodies don't even go,
you know, head, body, limbs.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.090
They go body, head, limbs.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.810
The part that you think is the
head is really what we consider

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.100
the torso where the
excretory and reproductive

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.540
and respiratory organs
are located.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.180
They taste with their skin.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.010
They have three hearts.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.580
And yet they're capable of
these incredible superpowers.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.000
They can, with one 3.5-inch
sucker, lift 30 pounds.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.470
And a giant Pacific octopus has
200 on each of its eight arms.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.530
And as different
as this animal is,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.370
you can still have a
friend who's an octopus.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.530
So the octopus afforded me a
way to look at consciousness

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.680
in the animal world
at a time that I felt

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.980
that readers might be hungering
for that kind of connection.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.680
And, boy, did they, did they
ever fulfill everything you

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.980
could ever.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.370
I had no idea that I would
fall in love with an octopus

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.230
so much that, when the
animal died, I wept.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.300
And I had no idea that
these octopuses would kind

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.330
of be the core of this group of
fabulous disparate friendships

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.680
that kind of cut across taxa.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.190
Some of us were vertebrates.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.490
Some of us invertebrates.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.790
Some of us were marine.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.090
Some were freshwater.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.390
And others were terrestrial.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.780
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: You talk in the
book about scientists wanting

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.190
to avoid anthropomorphising
animals.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.800
You know, your dog doesn't
want to go to the prom

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.720
and all that kind of stuff.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.450
That they don't dream of
a future in the same way

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.610
that people do and
those kinds of things.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.380
What do you think?

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.400
Because obviously, as you say,
you came out of the book talking

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.960
about having a friendship
with this octopus.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.520
Where did you come down
in terms of the dangers

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.630
of anthropomorphising too
much versus the dangers

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.250
of not understanding
commonalities enough?

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.820
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Well,
I feel that modern people

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.060
in the western world
error on the wrong side.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.980
I think the biggest mistake you
can make is deny that the rest

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.050
of animate creation has
no thoughts or feelings.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.360
That they lack emotion.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.410
I have found every single animal
I've ever known clearly seems

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.570
to love its life
the same way I do.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.900
And if you error in the opposite
direction, that's just going

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.780
to make you a more
compassionate person.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.060
But if you make the mistake
of denying them the dignity

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.600
of having a mind, well,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.490
that error is a much
more grievous sin.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.350
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Did you
feel self-conscious at all

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.530
when you found yourself
in grief for an octopus?

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.550
Did it feel strange?

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.040
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery:
Did it feel odd?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.840
Well, no because I was so
overwhelmed with the emotion.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.140
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.440
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: But here's
the interesting thing.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.570
I mean, I don't think that
the octopuses that I knew felt

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.420
about me the same way
I felt about them.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.120
But I know that they
liked when I showed up.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.100
Because we know from
scientific experiments

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.020
that octopuses do recognize
individual human faces just

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.600
looking up through the water.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.040
We know this from
scientific experiments.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.560
And we also know that they like
some people and dislike others.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.730
And we know that because,
if they don't like you,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.360
they will jet away often
after blasting you in the face

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.870
with 47-degree freezing
cold ice water.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.250
So that's pretty clear.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.950
And if they like you,
they will come over.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.770
Their arms with come
boiling up out of the water,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.660
and they will embrace
you with their suckers.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.350
They'll play with you.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.330
And if they feel excited
to see you, they turn red.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.990
If they feel very
calm in your presence,

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.680
they'll turn white
beneath your touch.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.490
So I know they felt something.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.790

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.090

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.390
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.690
Juli, one of the things
that I thought was

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.940
so interesting reading these
two books together was that,

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.710
whereas, it seems like a lot of
Sy's journey with the octopus is

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.410
about the octopus
as an individual.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.000
A lot of the journey with the
jellyfish is the jellyfish

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.240
as a bigger phenomenon
and species.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.260
And, in fact, you had an effort
to sort of keep some jellyfish

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.700
at home more like pets
that did not take.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.000
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Don't do it.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.240
I mean, you can't, I
shouldn't say that.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.410
Some people can do it.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.620
But I think it requires,
you know,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.830
a big filtration
system and, yeah.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.130
When I was working on the book,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.600
I heard about this
kick-starter for jellyfish pets.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.900
And I ordered it.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.070
I got, you know, first in
line, and I got this tank.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.370
And I put it in the dining room.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.050
And I got three jellyfish.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.690
And my kids named them
peanut, butter and jelly.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:01.170
And we, you know, we tried
to keep them for a while.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.430
And it was really fantastic
having them in our dining room

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.100
where I could kind of
be mesmerized by them.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.530
And they are super.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.830
There is something

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.070
about watching a jellyfish
move that's extremely relaxing.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.960
And it seems to kind of hit
in this place of your heart.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.570
And, in fact, the jellyfish,
around the edge of their bell,

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.210
they have these many
little faces sort of.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.000
That it, where their
sensory organs are.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.130
And there's a thing
called a pacemaker.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.310
And it's, that's the
technical word for it,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.610
right next to each face.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.080
And that controls how fast
the jellyfish pulse is.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.210
So there's actually like this.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.510
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: It's
like a lava lamp.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.810
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.110
They're like watching
lava lamps.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.700
Right. And they do seem
to sort of make you calm.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.860
But they don't like
living in living rooms.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.550
Especially not in Austin, Texas.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.710

goldfish from the carnival.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.010

Although I think with
jellyfish maybe some

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.430
of the more interesting
ideas are kind

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.820

many stories of octopuses

have snuck back in their tank

up for the jellyfish

So the jellyfish may not have a
brain, but they do have, like,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.780
very interesting
sensory abilities; right?

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.080
So they sting.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.800
Like, that's their way of
getting around in the world,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.860
is they sting with
these stinging cells.

Which you probably know,
if you've ever been stung.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.890
And that stinging cell explodes

with an acceleration
of 5 million G's.

the acceleration of gravity.

And it's the fastest motion
in the animal kingdom.

where they can smell
and sense currents.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.630

where there's food.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.690
They migrate up and
down, day to night

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.050
so that they don't get eaten
by birds diving into the water.

I mean, they have, they're the
oldest swimmers on our planet.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.240
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Right.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.540
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: It's
so similar to ours.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.840
Their eyes are very
similar to ours.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.140
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Right.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.150
Wait, but, okay, so
this is really cool.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.950
Like, now octopuses have eyes
that are similar to ours.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.250
They're like camera eyes.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.750
And the box jelly,
which is, you know,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.820
the most toxic animal
in the world.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.970
It has 8 eyes that
are camera eyes.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.270
Just like ours do.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.630
They have 24 eyes and
8 of them have a lens.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.220
A retina. And an iris that opens
and closes in response to light.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.870
And that's jellyfish.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.170
So that's, yeah.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.470
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Well,
who needs a brain?

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.770
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Right.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.750
That's the question.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.430
I mean, it's a very
good question.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.880
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Just because
you don't have a brain doesn't

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.960
mean you don't have any sense.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.260
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Exactly.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.560
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: So.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.860
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Well, it
raises an interesting question,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.160
what you're talking about.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.460
Not only what do we
mean by intelligence?

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.970
Which I think is one thing
that you're both talking about.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.400
But what do we mean by a soul.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.450
In the title of your book
"The Soul of an Octopus,"

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.780
what do you mean by a soul?

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.810
What does a soul mean to you?

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.000
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: I'm glad
that's your question.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.300
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: No, no.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.030
This was something I've
given a lot of thought.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.850
I mean, I think all of
us wonder, you know,

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.340
do we even have a soul?

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.290
Is a soul the same
thing as a self?

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:32.700
Is a self the component of
consciousness that matters?

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.770
And there's different
philosophers that look

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.070
at this in different ways.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.360
And some philosophers,
human philosophers will say

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.340
that we don't have selves.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.820
Well, I thought I did.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.000
But, you know, they'll even say
we don't have a self much less

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.430
a soul.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:54.160
I was raised in a Methodist
church, so I believed

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.920
that humans and animals
had a soul.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.920
And I always believed
that there was something

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.910
of the holy in the soul.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.500
And when I look around
at all the lives

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.850
that animate this world, I feel,

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:19.160
there's this great quote that's
attributed to Thales of Miletus.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.670
That says the universe is alive.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.240
Has fire in it and
is full of gods.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.880
And to me that says that
this world that we live

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.350
in is so much more alive.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.600
And so much more incandescent.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.040
And so much more holy
than we might dare dream.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.360
So I would say, yes,
octopuses have a soul.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.430
And I would say jellyfish
have a soul.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:52.200
And that we should behave
towards them as if they are holy

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.890
in the same way that
our lives are holy.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.190
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.490
I mean, yes.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.720
Jellyfish have this really
interesting situation.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.440
And they have a very
complicated lifecycle.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.610
And they, the medusa
part that we're familiar

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.460
with is only a very small
part of their lifecycle.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.660
Much of it is lived as a polyp,
which is like a sea anemone.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.990
And that polyp actually
slices itself horizontally.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.730
And then each one of those
pancakes, I guess, pops off

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.580
and becomes a medusa
that we see.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.000
And then that polyp, which is
planted on the bottom of a dock

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.310
or the underside of a, you know,
jetty or something like that.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.270
It can grow again and
do the same thing.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.930
It's called strobilation,
where it cuts itself

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.930
into these like 24 slices.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.180
And then they all pop
off and become medusa

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.480
over and over and over.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.510
And so I was talking to
some jellyfish scientists,

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.810
and I said.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.430
Are we thinking about jellyfish
correctly when we think

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.320
about them as animals?

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.310
Aren't they more plantlike,

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.110
where the polyp is
sort of like the tree?

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.160
And the medusa are like
the apples, you know,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.390
casting themselves off to
reproduce and form new trees?

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.530
And the jellyfish scientists,

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.980
and I really had been
thinking about that, you know.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.620
Sometimes, when trees
are stressed,

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.010
they will produce a lot
of offspring in order

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.320
to find places where there's
a better place to be living.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.020
And I was thinking
about the oceans

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.700
and how we're damaging them.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.520
And maybe these blooms of
jellyfish were happening

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.100
because they're trying
to find new habitat.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.010
And the jellyfish
scientists cautioned me,

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.940
and they were like, no.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.180
Don't think about it like that.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.220
Because of what you said,
because they're animals.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.750
And to deny their
animal nature means

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.760
that you don't understand
the jellyfish.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.020
And so I think that, yes, you
know, jellyfish are animated

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.800
by the same thing that
animates all animals.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.490
And it's very important
to remember that.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.560
And to realize, I mean, I think
the jellyfish are telling us

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.360
something about the damage
we're doing to our oceans.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.090
And that they're animals that
are, you know, proliferating.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.340
And we should pay
attention to those signals.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.640
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: How do you?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.940
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Kind
of got a little away

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.440
from the soul thing but, yeah.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.750
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: No,
I mean, I think part

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.440
of what you're getting
at in the book is

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.450
that the jellyfish I think, as
I said, I think the inspection

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.210
of the octopus is a
little more individual.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.510
And the inspection

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.810
of the jellyfish is
more at a species level.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.900
But they're both,
like Sy was saying,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.540
they're both something
holy and meaningful.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.840
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.350
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Because one
of the things that you talk

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.670
about is how the jellyfish, the
role that the jellyfish plays

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.130
in so many different
parts of the ecosystems

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.100
that they, where they live.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.960
Because they're both, they
prey on certain things

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.910
and are preyed upon by
certain things and all of that.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.210
Is that true?

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:07.510
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald:
It's true, yeah.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.860
And so the thing about jellyfish
is that we don't know as much

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.340
about them as we wish we did.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.570
And part of that is because
the way we studied the oceans

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.200
in most of the 20th century.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.230
Once we got boats and
motors and winches and nets.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.530
Where it's really fast.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.830
We drive through the ocean.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.770
Pull these big nets
behind the boats.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.800
Pull everything up and dump
it on the back of the ship.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.520
And then sort through it.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.600
And that, jellyfish don't
handle that treatment very well.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.490
So we obliterated our baseline
for understanding jellyfish.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.440
And, in fact, sometimes they
would pour bleach on the boat

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.280
to really dissolve
away the jellyfish

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.250
and disable their stings.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:52.550
So, yeah, so we don't know a
lot about what's, you know,

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.930
this is one of the big
controversies in the book

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.320
that I try to uncover.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.100
Is this question of
what's really happening

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.400
with the jellyfish?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.450
And it's very hard to tell
because the baseline is so poor.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.810
And I forgot the question.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.880
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Well, I'm
not sure the question was,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.570
I think you probably did
a better job answering

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.870
than the question did asking.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.170
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald:
Oh, the [inaudible].

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.530
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: I did
want to ask you both.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.280
One of the things that the
jellyfish and the octopus have

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.400
in common is a sort of a
history of perceived menace.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.270
Because you talk about
the octopus and the kind

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.660
of the giant of the sea.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.030
And the whole idea of
boats being sucked under

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.240
and all of that business.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.070
Where do you, did
you wind up feeling

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.160
like that's an overblown
idea given the likelihood

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.250
that people have actually
ever seen an octopus that big?

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.850
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Oh,
honest to god, yeah.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:49.510
I mean, I'm always on the side
of the underdog, you know.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.870
I just wrote a book
about hyenas.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.820
And I'm working about
one on vultures.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:59.120
So, you know, but they're
magnificent creatures, you know.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.630
Hyenas actually one of
the top predators, steals.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.450
He doesn't steal his
food from the lion.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.940
The lion steals from him.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.500
And you can go on and on and on.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.800
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.100
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: And on.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.400
But it's wonderful to be
able to find something

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.700
that looks like it's one way.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.670
And then discovering
it's the opposite.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.990
And particularly with an animal
like a jellyfish or an octopus.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:26.040
Because both are you such agents
and symbols of transformation.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.620
When you were talking
about, you know,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.960
how you start out as a medusa.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.260
Which looks like
something that you found

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.560
on the bottom of your shoe.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.860
And then grows up to become one

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.290
of the most beautiful
things you can ever imagine.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.000
And octopuses are, you
know, as people know,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.960
they change color and shape.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.450
They can sprout spots
or stripes.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:46.760
They can change color
in less than a second.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.960
At first they look like a
whole of striped snakes.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.150
And the next thing you know
they're looking look a piece

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.450
of coral.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.230
And, no, they're something else.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.330
And I think that's why both
of these animals, I think,

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.880
can speak to us at a time
that our very Earth is

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:09.470
under going this huge
transformational, huge change.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:16.100
And for me the octopus was
an agent of transformation.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.640
Because it opened the
world to me in a way

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.690
that had never been
opened before.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.770
And as I was writing about
these animals and learning

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.630
about the sea, at the
same time the institution

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.640
where I was getting to
know the octopuses best,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.940
I did learn to scuba dive.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.150
But the ones that I knew
best lived at the aquarium.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.890
It was undergoing a
huge transformation.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.580
It was being, it was
rebuilding the giant ocean tank.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.210
And so change was all around us.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.510
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.550
And the jellyfish, there are
some harrowing jellyfish stories

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.850
in the book.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:48.150
The Diana Nyad story is.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.450
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.750
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Amazing.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.050
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Oh, my god.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.350
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.650
I mean, jellyfish, you know,
they have definitely been seen

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.950
as an agent of menace.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.950
And, you know, they, some
of them do deserve it.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.420
I mean, not, but, you
know, you have to remember

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.100
that we are not, we're not
the object of their sting.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.660
The prey is.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.240
We just get in their way.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.510
And so, yeah, the story, the
box jellies that I mentioned,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.840
the ones with the 24 eyes,
8 of which are camera eyes.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.150
They are also the most toxic
group of jellyfish in the world.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.900
And one of them can
kill in three minutes.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.860
It's perhaps the most
toxic animal in the world.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.510
And Diana Nyad, who I'm
not sure if you know.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.980
She was, she's an
amazing long-distance

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.280
competitive swimmer.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.670
And at something like 63,
decided to swim from Cuba

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.880
to the Keys, the Florida Keys.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.700
And she tried four
times and failed.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.050
Not because she wasn't
strong enough.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.880
Not because she couldn't handle
the salt water chafing inside

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.180
her throat.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.050
Not because she couldn't
stay up for the 53 hours

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.400
that it takes to swim that far.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.140
But because of jellyfish
stinging her.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.750
So she actually had to put
together like a jellyfish team

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.960
and develop gear that went
all the way down her throat.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.880
So that she wouldn't
get stung in her mouth.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.240
And she did it on the last try.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.010
She's the only person to
have ever made that swim.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.310
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.610
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: But she had a
jellyfish scientist pretty much

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.190
swimming beside her
the whole time.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.490
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.790
Did you, Sy, when you were
talking before about the kind

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.030
of the relationship
with the octopus.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.330
And meeting the octopus.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.180
And how they welcome
and greet you.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.580
The description in the
book of kind of your first

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.910
up close encounter with an
octopus is, I'm not going

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.100
to say it's like a
love scene exactly.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.750
But it's very tactile.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:49.110
It's a very kind of,
you use a comparison

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.980
to a kiss quite a bit.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.110
What was that moment
of encountering

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.600
that octopus like for you?

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.930
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Oh, man.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.040
Well, it was really
transformative.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.520
I'd never known anyone
like that before.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.600
Also, very seldom, you know, are
people feeling and tasting you

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.510
so early in your relationship.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:15.430
[ Laughing ]

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.700
And other people who
have put their hands

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.990
in with an octopus
have recoiled.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.180
Because, okay, it is cold.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.480
It is slimy.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.780
They're sucking on you.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.220
You're going to have
to go home and explain

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.040
to your husband why you
are covered would hickies

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.110
after [inaudible].

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:38.530
So, but I was never at all
afraid when I first met Athena.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.440
Even though she was
pulling me into the tank.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.390
But I wanted to go
into the tank.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.890
But I knew I wouldn't fit.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.430
And I also had some
strong people there

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.090
who would pull me
out of the tank.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.390
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.690
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery:
If I needed to.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.620
Interestingly, though,
octopuses are also venomous.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.920
They are all venomous.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.220
And some are deadly.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.480
But I never worried that
these octopuses would bite me.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.820
And only once have I seen
someone bitten by an octopus.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.820
And the octopus chosen
to envenomate.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.190
So isn't that nice.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.570
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: That's
cool they can choose whether

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.870
or not to envenomate.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.170
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Yes, totally.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.270
Yeah. And, of course,
they choose whether or not

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.730
to bite you in the first place.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:24.800
And I think, you know, when this
octopus, her nail was Colley.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.180
And she bit a friend of
mine, a teenager named Anna.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.280
And here's the cool
thing about octopuses.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.190
I mean, talk about
sensitive new age guy.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.960
They are tasting and
feeling you at the same time.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.660
And they're not just
tasting, I believe,

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.410
the surface of your skin.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.850
But I think they can
taste the blood beneath.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.150
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Wow.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.600
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: And
I think the reason

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.800
that she was bitten was she was
on various different medicines.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.690
And she had changed
her medicine.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.210
I think she tasted differently.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.510
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Wow.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.810
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: And that she
was trying to figure out like.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.110
&gt;&gt; [multiple speakers]
What's going on.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.410
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.710
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Maybe
should I bite you, you know.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.010
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald:
That's interesting.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.310
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.610
Well, you both seem to
have had experiences

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.240
that partly involve figuring
out how to think about a type

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.410
of animal that a lot of people
grow up without a framework for.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.580
How do you think
about this animal?

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.310
Do you think about it
more like a dog or a cat?

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:21.930
Or do you think about it more
like a worm or a plant even?

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.920
And one of the things
that made me think about,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.290
I mentioned before my
dog likes the Kong.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.100
My dog totally accidentally
the other day caught me

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.400
with a tooth.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.700
That's what this is.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.580
And I spent so much time
trying to figure out,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.230
I realized I was thinking
about it in terms of like,

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.840
well, he didn't mean it.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.710
Which is a very weird,
very human way to try

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.440
to analyze animal behavior.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.880
And it's very difficult I
think to get out of that habit

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.070
of trying to think about an
animal the way would you think

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.370
about a person.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.140
Especially if you're
close to them.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.950
So what do you think, how do
you think about invertebrates

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.070
in general at this point?

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.050
What is your framework for kind
of thinking about jellyfish?

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:13.710
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: I think I've
always seen invertebrates

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.320
as the rulers of our world.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.270
I mean, as Sy said, there's
way more invertebrates

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.490
than vertebrates.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:27.100
And, you know, they
were here before us.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.470
And they will be here after us.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:37.470
And, yeah, I think to
see it as a reflection

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:43.650
of us all the time is maybe a
little self-centered, you know.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:49.030
And I think, but I do think
that we have reached the stage

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.800
where we are very
powerful on this planet.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.100
And we're changing it

00:30:53.100 --> 00:31:02.130
at a chemical level that's
extremely, yeah, scary.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.090
And so, you know, the,
I think the cephalopods

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:09.500
and the Cnidarians will
weather that storm.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.610
Probably more easily than I do.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.350
I think that's where my
thoughts go most often

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.210
when I think about
invertebrates.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.500
Because they've been
through it before.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.970
They've been through
massive shifts

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.690
in the planet's climate
and temperature.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:32.600
And they have very ancient
behaviors that, you know,

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.640
that allow them to
withstand those things.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.400
Like jellyfish, some
jellyfish can walk along,

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.900
when they're in the polyp stage.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.710
Which is like the
sea anemone stage.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.660
They can walk along the
sea floor and leave parts

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.320
of their feet, parts
of the bottom

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.430
of them behind almost
like a little seed.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:55.500
And those seeds can live for a
decade or more, we don't know,

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.800
until conditions change.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.040
And then burst out and
become a polyp again.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:08.490
So I don't know how, yeah,
I feel like they have very,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.670
very good behaviors that can
protect them more than us.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:14.970
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.270
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: That's what
I think about most often.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.570
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:18.870
How do you think about the
octopus these days, Sy?

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:23.080
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Well, they are
so, the thing that is striking

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.240
to me is that, as alien as
they seem, they are very much

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.620
like us in the way we think.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.710
One thing that I
learned in my research

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.290
from a scientist who's
been studying octopuses

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.590
for a long time.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.380
Dr. Jennifer Mather
[assumed spelling].

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.140
Is that the same
neurotransmitters

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.040
that we have when we're in love.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.120
When we're frightened.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.620
When we're happy.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.640
Those same neurotransmitters
are present in all animals

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.570
that they've ever looked for.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.060
Including oxytocin.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.730
Which you may have heard of,
that's the cuddle hormone.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.030
It's called the cuddle hormone.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.030
It's actually like
a social hormone.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.350
But in mammals it
facilitates milk let down.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:14.950
It facilitates social
bonding with your offspring.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.940
Well, octopuses have their eggs
at the very end of their lives.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.980
They use their last breath

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.920
to blow their tiny
paralarvae out of their lair.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.520
They don't have maternal
care after that.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.490
They don't get to
know their children.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:35.860
But they have a neurotransmitter
so like oxytocin.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.230
It's called cephalotocin.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:42.080
So as different as we are,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.480
in a very basic way we're
also shockingly similar.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.270
So I think one of
the greater sins

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.290
than anthropomorphism
is anthropocentrism.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.590
Believing it is all about us.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.510
And just as you pointed
out that they have these

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.970
incredible abilities.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.500
I mean, being able
to leave pieces

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.350
of your feet as,
in your footsteps.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.650
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Right.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.420
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: For
pieces of you to grow up.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.430
My gosh. I mean, okay.

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.540
So we can, we invented
writing, but.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.840
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.140
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: But, wow.

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.440
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.740
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: We're
not leaving pieces

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.040
of our feet behind.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.340
Yeah. Actually, on that topic,
it's actually very interesting.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.340
After my book was published, it
turns out some graduate students

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.130
at Cal Tech were messing
around with jellyfish.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.090
And they were watching them,
and they were like, oh,

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.440
they seem to chill out at night.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.030
Like what's up with that?

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.310
And it turns out
jellyfish can sleep.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.160
And they actually put
melatonin in the tank,

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.190
and it put the jellyfish
to sleep.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.490
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Wow.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:44.790
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald:
So just like us.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.090
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: The receptors.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.390
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah, just.

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:48.690
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Yeah.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.990
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald:
The same receptors.

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.290
You know, melatonin is a
sleep receptor or transmitter,

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.590
I don't know what exactly it is.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.890
But, anyway, it helps us sleep.

00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:55.190
And it works on jellyfish too.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.460
So these neurotransmitters,
you know, these chemicals

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.090
that affect our behaviors
come to us

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:02.490
from a very, very long time ago.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.790
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.090
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: And we
do share a lot in common

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:09.320
with these animals that
are even, you know,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.150
500 or 650 million years old.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.710
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery:
So we're all family.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.010
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.450
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: And that's
the way we should behave.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.670
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Well, we
have enough time for just,

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.490
I think, a few questions.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.340
If people have questions
about an octopus,

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.780
a jellyfish that you
might have known.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.230
Or not known.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.060
Go ahead.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.660
This is really, really
interesting.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.320
If I go to the Baltimore
Aquarium

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:42.800
and I ask the people there about
the octopus or the jellyfish.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.660
Are they on board with
what you're saying?

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.240
Are they, you know, the
relationship between you

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.690
and aquariums to get
your information.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.520
The research that you did.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.730
I mean, will they give me
the same kind of information

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.270
that you're giving out today?

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.540
Or are they, you know,
more cutting edge?

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.840
Are they behind?

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.330
Or, you know, what is it?

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:06.290
Because a lot of people
will go to an aquarium

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.200
to find information
about sea life.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.430
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Well, a
lot of the, I have found

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:18.110
that the keepers of octopus
always named their octopus.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.070
Even when they weren't
supposed to.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.660
And a lot of the stuff
that scientists later found

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.780
out just bore out things that
the people who actually worked

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.850
with these animals already knew.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.970
They already knew how smart
these animals were before we

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.190
gave them anything
like IQ tests.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.590
And we're actually going
to the Baltimore Aquarium.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.570
And I've been there before,
and I've met some of the folks

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.350
who are volunteers
and who work there.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:49.180
And they seem to have great
respect for their creatures.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.480
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.140
I don't know people at
the Baltimore Aquarium.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.750
But at the jellyfish
facilities I've been to,

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.140
like in Monterey Bay.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.910
Those jellyfish breeders
are unbelievable.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.240
And they know, they are, they go

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.520
to all the scientific
meetings with the scientists.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.990
And they are scientists.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:10.950
So they know, yeah, they know
very much about jellyfish.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.770
I don't know all aquaria.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.590
But, yeah, the ones I've talked
to are incredibly knowledgeable.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:18.890
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.190
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Thanks so much.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.490
Okay, we're going
to go over here.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.090
Very provocative.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.480
Looking forward to
read both books.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.780
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Thank you.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.080
&gt;&gt; With the products and
inventions that have come

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:36.800
from biomimicry, could you talk
a little about any breakthroughs

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:42.320
that either through octopuses
or jellyfish we've been able

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.680
to make some breakthroughs?

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.320
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: I
have a great story.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.620
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Oh, good, go.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.200
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: So I went
and talked to so robotic,

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.690
some people making
robotic jellyfish.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.670
And this is really one of my
favorite stories in the book.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:38:00.260
But by trying to make jellyfish
robots, they discovered

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.840
that it's not the
push of the jellyfish

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.140
that makes it go forward.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.470
It's actually that
peplum, the flap,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.460
the very pretty part
of the jelly.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.270
It doesn't have any
muscles in it.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.000
But just the movement of it
is actually what drives the

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.660
jellyfish forward
through the water.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.830
And what they later
discovered is

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.770
that the wiggle creates
these turbulent eddies

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.720
that create a low pressure
system in front of the animal.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.400
So jellyfish are actually
sucking themselves

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.700
through the water.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.450
Like if you take a breath, yeah.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.620
And if you start looking
around in the ocean,

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.470
you start noticing how
does everything swim?

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.770
Well, they all wiggle.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.070
Everything wiggles.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:41.590
And the reason for that wiggle
is to create this low pressure

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.730
that pulls marine creatures
and aquatic creatures

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.420
through the water
rather than pushes.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.990
And we're so, you know,
we're so terrestrial.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.480
When we walk, we push back
on the ground behind us.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.770
But that's not what
goes not in the ocean.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.340
So extraordinary discovery.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.180
And it came from looking
at jellyfish swimming.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.580
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: That is great.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.880
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.180
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Well, and
I know that they are looking

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.100
at octopuses as models for
soft robots, for example.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.400
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Right.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.700
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: So, I mean,

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.000
because they're just
made like nothing else.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.300
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Right.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.830
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: And they
have such strength, you know,

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.660
to be able, and they have
strength and precision.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.940
The sucker is so dexterous.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.240
It's super strong.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.720
As I mentioned earlier, 3.5-inch
sucker can lift 30 pounds.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.350
But it's also dexterous enough

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:29.780
that they can untie
knots in surgical silk.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.560
Which they discovered when
they did operations on octopus.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.060
And they, in the
morning they come in

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.740
and all this silk
is just untied.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.980
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: All right,
let's go back over here.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.300
&gt;&gt; Thank you both
for being here.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.980
I grew up in Hawaii, and
I love eating octopus.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.900
And so, but I'm also fascinated
by both jellyfish and octopus.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.620
And I know that both
are delicacies.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.900
And so I was just wondering
what your thoughts were on both

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.240
of them being delicacies?

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.460
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Does any, I'm
probably pronouncing it wrong.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.050
But they call it
hey-e [phonetic].

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.700
&gt;&gt; I grew up with it,
in the Japanese, taco.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.160
So I know it as taco.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.830
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Oh, I've been
a vegetarian for a long time.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:11.770
So, yeah, I'm not
going to eat them.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.410
But a lot of people
have come up to me

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.010
after reading the book
saying, I can't eat them now.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:20.200
But I tell people, you
know, good for you.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:25.350
But if you want to
help octopuses,

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:30.870
the most important thing
you can do is help the sea.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:35.820
And helping the sea, probably
the most important thing you can

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:40.430
do is try to stop or
slow global warming.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.510
Because it is affecting
the sea worse.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:49.040
[ Applause ]

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.340
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: You
talked a little bit

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.640
about eating jellyfish.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.940
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.240
Jellyfish have been eaten
in Asia for 1,000 years.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.160
And they are all protein.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.630
And they are packed
with antioxidants.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:05.500
So they have been kind of used
also pharmaceutically for things

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.500
like arthritis, rheumatoid
arthritis.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.670
Understanding what
that would mean

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:18.220
for western markets is still
sort of being explored.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:22.390
And I tasted them
when I went to Japan,

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:26.050
chasing the giant jellyfish
which grows to be 500 pounds.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.960
I went out with a
commercial fisherman,

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.260
and we caught jellyfish.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.870
And his wife served me
some jellyfish salad.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.760
And to me it tasted very
much like green pepper.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.330
It was really, really not
exotic tasting at all.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:45.850
So the thing is one of
the ways they preserve it.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.150
Jellyfish were are watery.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.450
They're 95 percent water.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.040
That you have to
kind of pickle them.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.590
You have to pull the water
out really fast or they spoil.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.210
And they use this
salt called alum,

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.880
which isn't very
good for us, in Asia.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.180
And then what they do is they
rinse it, and they pull the alum

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.660
out before they turn
it into a salad.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:07.890
But that's probably not
going to fly western markets.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.120
So there's Italians, Italian
foodies who are looking at it.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.440
Doing other things like
sous-vide or fast freezing.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.740
And, anyway, you know,
there are so many,

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.120
in places where the
oceans are out of kilter

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.090
and the blooms are really big.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.390
There is this question of,

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.050
should we be eating
jellyfish, you know.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.460
And so I don't think that
question is settled right now.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.940
I think it's one of these
kind of emerging questions

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:37.010
and answers that we really are
going to have to think about.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.340
It's not as clear
as with octopus.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.110
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Well,
sea turtles eat jellyfish.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:42.410
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald:
Yes, sea turtles.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:43.710
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.010
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: And sea turtle
populations are plummeting.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:46.390
I don't know if that's
also contributing.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:47.920
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah, they are.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:53.230
In fact, people who study sea
turtles look for the jellyfish.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.910
That go out on airplanes
looking for jellyfish in order

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.660
to find the sea turtles.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.960
Yeah.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.290
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: All
right, let's go over here.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:01.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.920
I guess the biggest question
I have is, even listening

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.180
to you guys talk, that
we separate ourselves

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.840
from the animal kingdom.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.870
And if we brought
ourselves back into it,

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:14.970
could we deal with these issues?

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:18.240
You know, a little,
make it closer to home.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.800
And I'm not sure if that's
anything you can answer, but.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.100
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery:
That's why I write.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.400
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah, I
don't think it would hurt.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.020
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: No, I think,
you know, the us and them thing.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.870
If it's them, you can do
anything you want to them.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:35.270
But if it's us, if
we're all one family,

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.430
then it's a whole
different thing.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:42.000
It's about expanding your
capacity for compassion.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.750
I think you hit the
nail on the head.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.680
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Okay.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.880
&gt;&gt; Juli, a lot of book
clubs read your book.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.240
And I can't believe that they're
just reading about jellyfish.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.720
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: I can't either.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.020
&gt;&gt; What is it about your book

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.860
that book clubs seem
to be drawn to?

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.460
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: So the
book is not just science.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.470
There's memoir, as Sy's
book has memoir also.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:11.030
And the book is about
me learning

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:14.160
to grow my own spine
as a writer.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.720
And so my story is in there.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.550
You can find out
about, you know,

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.840
my terrible grad
school experiences.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.320
And my bad boyfriend.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.770
And, you know, like
lots of things

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:31.120
that hopefully help the
reader move through the book.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.320
And see how I really grew

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.520
as I followed jellyfish
around the world.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.940
And tried to understand
what's happening

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.240
with them in today's oceans.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.180
And, you know, I, the reason
it's called "Spineless" is

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.480
because jellyfish are spineless.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.780
And because I had to kind
of grow my own spine.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.080
And then because of our
collective spinelessness towards

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.880
the health of our
planet as Sy was saying.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:45:02.040
[ Applause ]

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.340
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: All right, I
think we can get through both

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.090
of these if we go quick.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:11.160
&gt;&gt; In either of your research,
did you encounter experiments,

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.620
for lack of a better word,
with invertebrates and music?

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:15.920
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: I'm sorry.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.220
&gt;&gt; Invertebrates and music.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.520
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Oh.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.640
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: I don't think
octopuses can hear the way

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.940
that we do.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.590
Although they certainly
sense vibrations.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.100
And, boy, if you
wanted someone to dance,

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.400
no one could be more graceful.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.120
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: I
did not find anything

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.420
with jellyfish and music.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.470
But it's a great question.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:44.880
I know they can sense currents.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.250
And it's, oh, I do
have one story.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.130
Yeah. When the jellyfish
stinging cell,

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:55.980
the stinging cell actually has
hair cells just like inside

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.650
of our ears as a
trigger mechanism.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:03.470
And they listen for the
buzz of a zooplankton.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.260
Which would be like
the buzz of a fly.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.560
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Oh, my gosh.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.640
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: And if
it's the correct frequency.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.510
And they can also have these,
there's these sugar sensors

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.660
that smell like zooplankton
are kind of like pigpen.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.150
They give off all these sugars.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.170
And so, if it senses
both the sugars

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.510
and the correct frequency,
then it will trigger the cell.

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:23.260
And then it gets even crazier.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:27.180
They also have a sensor
that smells proline.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.100
Which is in crustacean blood.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.230
And they twist those hair cells

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:35.220
so that they detect
a higher frequency.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.500
And if they smell, it's
like hitting a zooplankton.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.550
It will panic, and it will
buzz at a higher frequency.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:43.850
And its blood will
be in the water.

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:47.110
It will send off a second
battery of stinging cells.

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:51.410
So, and they've actually, the
jellyfish have repair proteins

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.110
to fix those hair cells
on their stinging cells

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.420
if they are disrupted.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.980
In our cochlea we
don't have them.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.790
Which is why, when we hear
loud noises, we can go deaf.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:05.790
And they have extracted
those repair proteins from,

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.320
actually from sea anemones.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.770
Which are easier
to grow in the lab.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:11.780
And applied them to
damaged mouse cochlea.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.460
And it repaired the hair
proteins in the cochlea.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.490
So they're looking at it
as, more for military.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.220
Like if you're around
a big explosion,

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.990
they are could get
this, repair proteins

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.230
in your inner ear
and fix that up.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:26.450
So, yeah, that's the only sound

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.180
and jellyfish answer
I have, but.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.480
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah,

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.780
sounds like they have
everything they need

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.080
to hear music certainly.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.380
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.680
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: All right.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.040
&gt;&gt; Sy, I think one of my
favorite parts of your book is

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.620
when you talk about
the sea star.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.240
And how, I think
it was a sea star.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.750
And how he's trying to get
the food from the octopus

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.280
or interested in when they're
feeding the octopus in the tank.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.940
And so I was wondering if
you and, Juli, also yourself,

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.750
if you're planning on
writing any more books

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.050
about invertebrates.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.400
I just found this topic
really fascinating.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.210
And would love to learn more
about some other animals

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.250
that are out there
in this category.

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.820
&gt;&gt; Sy Montgomery: Boy, well,
there's certainly, there's a lot

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.520
of potential subjects out there.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.160
Because most of us are
marine invertebrates,

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.560
most of us animals on Earth.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.620
So, yeah, I would love to.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.960
I have a memoir coming
out later this month

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.310
in which we have a
little more on octopus.

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:22.520
Because they're almost an
inexhaustible to write about.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.620
But the next book I'm
researching is actually not a

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.920
marine invertebrate.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.220
But it's actually, it's rays.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.410
Marine vertebrate.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.710
But, yeah, I'd love to.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.080
I would love to do more.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.380
&gt;&gt; Juli Berwald: Yeah.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:40.580
I started actually on a fiction
book about a 16-year-old girl

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:42.800
who saves the world
from climate change.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.550
So I really want to get that,

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.570
but I think there's
a coral book in me.

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:49.870
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Fantastic.

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:51.170
Well, thank you guys so much.

you for being here.

guys for being here.
