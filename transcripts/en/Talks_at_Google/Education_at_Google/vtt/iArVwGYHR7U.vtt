[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.540
SPEAKER: So to get
us kicked off today,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.380
you're going to hear a keynote
from a mystery participant who

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.020
nobody has ever seen
before and you have not

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.670
met several times
over the course

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.350
of the past couple of days.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.290
She also, though,
is so much more

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.385
than what she has been
doing for you so far.

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:26.010
And so much more than
what you will see

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.360
through the rest of the week.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.090
One of my favorite people.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.900
I'm going to do her
full bio, just that you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.090
can see the wealth
of things that she's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.670
done so far in her
career, and how excited we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.800
are to have her here with us.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.060
Jennie-- Jennie Magiera is
the chief program officer

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.690
for EdTech team.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.320
Previously, in fact,
prior to about,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.020
I don't know, a month ago,
she was the chief innovation

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.860
officer at Des Plains Public
School District 62 outside

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.744
of Chicago.

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:55.410
She was the digital
learning coordinator

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
for the Academy for Urban School
Leadership and a Chicago Public

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.770
Schools teacher.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.530
Jennie uses her
classroom experience

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.480
to inform her work
supporting educators

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.280
to create new and
better opportunities

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.200
for their students.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.930
She believes that despite the
many challenges facing schools

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.570
today, every classroom
can be a place for what

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.590
she calls adventures--

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.180
student-centered, passion-based,
experiential learning.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.510
Her work centers around
acknowledging problems

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.970
and finding innovative
ways to navigate them so as

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.060
to allow teachers and students
to dive into these classroom

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.410
adventures.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.210
Jennie is also passionate
about reimagining

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.670
professional learning,
as you can see here,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.176
to facilitate more
relevant teacher support.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.050
She has served on the
Technical Working Group

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.840
for the US Department of
Education's National Education

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.350
Technology Plan, and co-founded
various new conference

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.204
concepts, such as PLAYDATE.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.620
She's been recognized
for her work

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.350
as a White House Champion

and featured on various programs
such as NBC's "Education

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.965
Nation," CSPAN's "Reimagining
Education," and NPR.

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.570
Whew, that's a lot.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.141
Jennie also shares
her experience

00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.140
taking risks in the
classroom and helping others

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.750
to feel comfortable doing the
same in her book, "Courageous

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.890
Adventures," which you
will all see on your desks

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.440
in front of you.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.520
Some of you may also remember
Jennie from the amazing keynote

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.760
that she did about a month
ago at the ISTE Conference.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.090
She had 6,000 educators
laughing and crying along

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.830
with her, including me in the
front row, wiping away tears.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.350
We are truly honored
to have her join us

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.850
as part of this program team.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.230
And I'm so excited
to have her be

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.530
your keynote speaker for today.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.801
So thank you.

00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:45.106
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.550
JENNIE MAGIERA: All
right, I think I did it.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.980
We'll find out in a moment.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.280
All right, so this
morning I'm really

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.650
excited to have some
time with all of you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.320
to just talk and to
think about what you're

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.370
getting into as coaches,
as principals supporting

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.400
this innovation and
transformation in your schools.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.670
And so I want to begin
by telling you a story.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.770
Yesterday, AT had
storytime with you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.500
and he introduced you to
the venerable characters

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.864
of Miss Beyonce and
Principal Madonna,

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.030
but I want to go a little
bit more traditional today

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.550
and go back to one of
my favorite stories

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.409
from when I was a
child, "The Hobbit."

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.200
Anyone else read this
when they were a kid,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.557
or read it with your kids?

00:03:28.557 --> 00:03:29.510
Yay!

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.760
I have to just like call out
that this is the coaching

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.560
fellowship, and in,
like, the sequel,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.351
there's like "The
Fellowship of the Rings,"

00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.800
but we won't go down that road.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.210
So for those of you who aren't
familiar with JRR Tolkien's

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.250
novel "The Hobbit," it
stars two main characters.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.550
There's Gandalf the
Grey, who's a wizard.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.140
And he's a plucky wizard.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.220
He's got lots of jokes.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.990
He wants to go on adventures.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.450
And then you've got Bilbo
Baggins, who's a hobbit.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.026
And essentially, what happens is
Gandalf knocks on Bilbo's door

00:03:58.026 --> 00:04:00.106
and he's like, [KNOCKING NOISE],,
hey, what's up?

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:00.730
How's it going?

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.840
And Bilbo's like, ah, I'm
having a birthday party.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.190
Leave me alone.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.500
And Gandolf the
Grey says, "I'd like

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.130
to invite you on an adventure
that I'm arranging."

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.580
And I remember
reading this when I

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.560
was nine years old for
the very first time,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.459
and thinking that this statement
was the most amazing quote I'd

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.260
ever read in a book before.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.262
Because, first of all, I
had never heard someone

00:04:20.262 --> 00:04:22.220
say that you could just
determine that you were

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.150
going to have an adventure.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.608
Like I'm going to arrange a
nice little adventure for seven

00:04:25.608 --> 00:04:27.400
and invite my friends.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.870
And that you could have
people come with you.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.150
And as I became an
educator, I thought, man,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
wouldn't it be great if
every day, instead of lesson

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.760
planning, I could
arrange adventures

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.110
for my students to come along?

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.700
And so as the story goes,
eventually, Bilbo says yes.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.950
And he goes on this adventure.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.637
He goes out.

00:04:46.637 --> 00:04:47.720
He gets his walking stick.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.590
He meets a Gollum.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.400
He gets a ring.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.870
He fights a dragon.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.800
He gets some gold.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.410
He goes home and he
lives happily ever after.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.330
Sorry, spoiler alert.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.090
That's "The Hobbit."

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.230
So great.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.730
That's the story
of "The Hobbit."

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.190
But with that being said,
there's a lot more to it

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.050
than a lot of us want to retell.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.090
For example, in
that first scene,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.220
when Gandalf the Grey knocks on
Bilbo Baggins's door and says,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.700
I'm looking for someone to
share an adventure that I'm

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.600
arranging, he follows up
with, "it's very difficult

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.390
to find anyone."

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.060
And what's more is Bilbo
responds, "I should think so."

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.934
He tells them that
we're plain people,

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:30.350
we don't like going
on adventures.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.850
They're nasty,
uncomfortable things.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.960
And they make you
late for dinner.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.100
And as I read this, it
really occurred to me

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.390
that this is so analogous
to my life as a coach,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.160
as a school leader.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.260
And I think about if I truly
want to invite my colleagues

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.860
and my students on
adventures, how often

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.700
do they say this back to me?

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.467
I literally told
teachers, when I'm like,

00:05:57.467 --> 00:05:59.800
let's stay after and talk
about Google, they're like no.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.670
It's going to make
me late for dinner.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.870
Go away.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.890
And so I want to think a
little bit about our teachers.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.220
And specifically going
back to this analogy.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.190
In the book "The
Hobbit," JRR Tolkien

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.250
describes hobbits as not
the adventuring type.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.620
Bilbo Baggins says that
to Gandalf the Grey.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.870
I'm not the adventuring type.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.960
Now yesterday,
Jeff Duncan-Andrade

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.270
talked to us about a concept
that Claude Steele popularized

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.570
in his book "Whistling
Vivaldi," which by the way,

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.400
I have to plus one
that recommendation.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.240
It's amazing.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.260
Read it.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.370
But he talks about stereotype
threat and the self-identity

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.130
that many of our
students have where

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.810
they believe the stereotypes
that society has given to them.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.400
And then that then
becomes a psychological,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.130
and sometimes in his book
he proves physiological,

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.120
barrier to achieve
and to be successful.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.460
But I posit to you that
that happens to our teachers

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.330
as well.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.280
There's stereotype
threat that our teachers

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.890
face in their own self-identity
of what they can accomplish.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.800
And as coaches and
principals, it's

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.370
our role to help them overcome
that stereotype threat.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.300
Now, Bilbo Baggins said, I'm
not the adventuring type.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.400
But Gandalf the
Grey, his coach, was

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.890
able to help him overcome
that stereotype threat

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.370
and see a new self-identity for
himself so that he could go on

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:26.430
to fight Gollums, get rings, get
riches, go home, fight dragons.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.950
And this reminds me of
a really amazing TED

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.760
Talk by a Nigerian author
named Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.780
Has anyone seen this before?

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.079
Oh, it's so great.

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.620
So what I'd like
for all of you to do

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.480
is I'm just going to get
off and take the next 18

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.396
minutes to watch this.

00:07:40.396 --> 00:07:42.210
I'll be right back.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.900
JK.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.740
So in this talk, Chimamanda
talks about something

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.680
called the single story.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.630
The single story
is what she says

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.860
is the single story that is told
about a certain group of people

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.050
over and over again
until it becomes

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.420
all anyone knows about them.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.280
As a Nigerian
middle class woman,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.900
she encountered the
single story of Africa

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.140
when she came to the United
States for university

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.890
and realized that people had one
understanding of her society,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.170
and her culture,
and this continent

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.280
as one giant country that's a
village of barefoot children.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.810
She said, this is crazy.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.580
This is the single story.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.880
And she goes on to say
something about stereotypes.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.930
She says "stereotypes
aren't wrong.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.270
They're just incomplete."

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.190
And as educators, I started
to think about that.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.150
And I said, what are the single
stories and the stereotypes

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.299
that are then propagating
the stereotype

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.360
threat in our organizations
and in our industry?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.360
So today I want to look
at the single stories

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.220
that we have about ourselves
as teachers, as coaches,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.560
as principals.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.680
The single stories that we have
about each other and our peers.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.570
And consider the
untold stories that we

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.270
need to be considering
as we go in

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.940
to support our colleagues in
transforming our communities.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.130
So I have three
stories for you today

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.900
that we're going
to talk through.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.320
The first one is the single
story of our resistant

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.810
colleagues and the untold
story of friendly dragons.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:15.520
Now, when I first became
a coach, I was resistant.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.440
I was a classroom
teacher who was working

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.540
on one-to-one iPads in my room.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.300
And I always knew that I
wanted to be a teacher.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.270
I wanted to be a teacher because
I knew I got long way better

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.230
with kids than adults.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.410
It's a lot less frustrating
when a third grader's

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.520
throwing a temper tantrum.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.090
But like when a
40-year-old is, it's like,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.150
you're a grown person.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.620
Let's do this.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.060
So when I became a coach for the
very first time, it validated

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.730
my single story of what life
as an administrator would be,

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.490
which is the first time
I walked into a room

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.400
to support a group of
teachers on one-to-one iPads,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.317
they literally ran away from me.

00:09:50.317 --> 00:09:52.150
And I don't mean that
at all metaphorically.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.890
I walked into the staffroom
and they looked at me,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.390
and they're like, oh
no, it's the iPad lady.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.973
And they all walked
out the back door.

00:09:56.973 --> 00:09:57.970
They're like peace.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.560
Nope, nope.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.285
And they hid.

00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:01.660
And I don't know
where they went,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.850
but they would not hang with me.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.040
And it was constantly
that I was physically

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.130
chasing people to support them.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.120
And always, it was like Jennie,
I get it, you're excited.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.330
You love this iPad stuff.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.950
But I don't have time for this.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.510
And it was a lot of yes buts.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.300
And it really began to
weigh on my heart and soul,

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.390
because I truly had seen
and witnessed firsthand

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.200
how technology could
transform the opportunities

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.480
that my students could
have in front of them.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.330
I saw how my students who
needed the most support

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.180
had access to it by having
the access to the world's

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.720
information, to each other,
to amplify their voices.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.790
And people were
running from that.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.310
And I got really frustrated.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.270
And I gotta say,
I was resentful.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.246
And I started thinking
about something

00:10:51.246 --> 00:10:52.370
I'd learned in grad school.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.453
How many of you are familiar
with Everett Rogers's

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:56.680
"Diffusion of Innovation?"

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.900
So Everett Rogers
was a sociologist.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.470
And in the '60s, he developed
this bell curve model

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.700
for organizations.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.620
And it's how quickly innovation
is adapted in organizations.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.220
And he said that the top 16% are
innovators and early adopters,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.550
folks who are going to jump on
board quickly and get geeked up

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.780
about these things.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.860
The middle 68% can be convinced.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.720
But that last 16%, he
called them laggards,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.750
are very resistant and
refuse to get on board.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.080
And while I saw this, and
my logical brain said, OK,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.020
that's true, I thought
it was more like 90%

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.255
were laggards in my schools.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:37.390
It was like all of them were
just like, no, leave us alone.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.010
And going back to
our metaphor, I

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.537
began to think about
this as the innovators

00:11:41.537 --> 00:11:43.870
and the early adopters in my
buildings were the wizards,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.340
were the Gandalfs who were like,
let's go on adventures, yay,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.180
flip grid.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.010
And everyone else
were the laggards.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.020
They were our hobbits.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.729
And so what I want
to think about--

00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:56.770
and sometimes I even felt
like they were dragons.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.950
Like they weren't even on it.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.980
So then I really started
to reach deep back

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.870
into what I could do, and
did some soul searching.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.290
And I remembered this story
that my mother used to tell me.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.020
There was this painting that
hung over my parents' bed

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.390
in my childhood home.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.470
I don't have a photo, a
nice photo of it anymore.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.380
This is when we were
packing up their house,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.490
so you can see it right there.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.590
And it's a painting of a
cliff on an island called

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.720
Jeju Do on the south of Korea.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.310
And this is Dragon Rock.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.350
And my mother would
tell me this fable

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.970
about Dragon Rock all the time.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.209
Which, side note disclaimer,
I found out as an adult

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:38.250
when I actually visited
there and saw the placard

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.340
that her story was
completely made up and false.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.665
But she's my mom, so she
gets to make up mom facts.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.720
And it really works for this.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.011
And it inspired me, so I'm
telling you this fake story.

00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:53.990
Feel free to use it.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.520
Now, according to this
fake mom fact story,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.130
there was a village at the
bottom of this mountain.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:05.311
And the villagers truly
had a good feeling.

00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:06.310
They were getting along.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.180
They were eating.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.530
Like life was OK.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.290
They were like that bottom level
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.370
like food, shelter water.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:12.870
Nailed it.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.460
Got it.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.610
But they knew it
could be better.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.770
And there was something at
the top of this mountain

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.730
that they knew if they could get
to it could change their world.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:27.350
It could make life wonderful for
every person in that village.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.740
And so they decided to go up
the mountain and try and get it.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.040
But every time they'd get almost
to the top of the mountain,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.260
they'd get stopped by a dragon.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.490
And this dragon would fight
them and would attack them.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.522
And they'd come
running back down.

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:43.730
And so they began to give up.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.500
They're like, we can't get
to the top of the mountain.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.690
There's a dragon up there.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.880
I guess we'll
just-- this is fine.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.240
It doesn't suck too bad.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.040
Let's just continue.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.110
Until one day
someone decided no.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.670
No, I know we can do this.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.840
I know we can be better.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.200
I'm going to go to the
top of the mountain.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.794
So he starts climbing
up the mountain.

00:13:59.794 --> 00:14:00.710
He gets to the dragon.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.650
And right as he's about
to fight the dragon with--

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.800
I don't know what he
would fight-- taekwondo,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.410
he sees on the dragon's
arm that there's thorns

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.570
all wrapped around his arm.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.440
So he puts down his fists
and he takes the thorns,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.110
and he puts some salve on
it, and he helps fix it.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.410
And as the dragon's wounds
begin to heal, the dragon slowly

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.530
transforms into the friendly
villager that had been missing

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.370
for years, that they'd assumed
had been eaten by said dragon.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.650
And the first villager
said, hey, Steve.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.880
Well, I guess his name--

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.900
Sunkjung, it's great to see you.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.540
What's going on?

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.024
And Sunkjung,
says, I don't know.

00:14:40.024 --> 00:14:41.940
This is a made up name
for this made up story.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.840
So Sunkjung, says, I
have been stuck here

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.730
for years with these thorns.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.560
And every time
people come up, they

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.230
try and battle me to get around
me to get to this other thing.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.900
And no one would
help me until you.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.570
And then once his
wounds were healed,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.190
he helped the villager
get to the top

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.887
and achieve his goal as well.

00:15:00.887 --> 00:15:02.970
And my mother would tell
me this story because she

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.400
would say to me, Jennifer--

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.900
she called me
Jennifer, not Jennie--

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.310
Jennifer, when people
are trying to fight you,

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.900
and when people are
arguing with you

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.025
about what you are trying
to achieve, why don't you

00:15:15.025 --> 00:15:16.890
stop arguing with
them and listen

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.350
to what their problem is first?

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.140
And if you can find the
kindness in your heart

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.220
to help them solve their problem
first, even if it doesn't help

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.320
you with your
problem, you will be

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.550
amazed by how much
they will do for you.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.460
And as coaches
and as principals,

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.090
I really think that
this is helpful for us.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.670
I told you guys the other day,
I am a recovering district

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.930
administrator.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.944
I was a slave to
the board goals.

00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:47.610
Everything I did was
like, how does that

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.430
relate to the board goals?

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.520
That's a different story.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.800
So I understand that
when I come into schools,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.220
both as a building
leader, as a coach,

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.090
as a district
administrator, we really

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.392
want our kids to achieve to what
is the vision of our district.

00:16:03.392 --> 00:16:05.100
But when I put that
on pause for a moment

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.470
and first helped my teachers
with what they really

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.860
needed, their highest
hierarchy of need,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.100
they would jump over moons
to help us with our goals.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.210
And so I think that as we
see these resistant dragons,

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.590
we can find that
they could truly

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.900
be wizards if we
give them a chance

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.000
and help them unwrap
their own thorns.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.334
So those resistant
colleagues that many of you

00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:27.750
have encountered,
I'm sure you can

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.910
think of the hobbits
in your midst,

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.530
think about how
you can engage them

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.030
and find out what
their stories are.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.550
Find out their untold stories
and their untold challenges.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.420
And think about how we can make
time in our very busy schedule

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.400
to address those on
an individual level,

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.620
just as we would do
for our students,

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.330
so that we can find
those friendly dragons.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.760
My second story for you
is about the single story

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.370
we choose to tell the
world and the untold story

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.470
of our inner selves.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.250
Now, as leaders and
coaches, and we're

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.960
looking at this
hierarchy of needs

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.589
and this diffusion
of innovation scale,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.839
we can look at the
people who are always

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.150
saying, I can't,
and like I said,

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.599
we can be a little bit
frustrated with them.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.900
But I really want to unpack
that "I can't" for a moment.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.300
That "I can't" come
from a place of identity

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.280
for a lot of our folks.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.240
My husband, Jim, is an attorney.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.140
Boo.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:33.480
And if you were to meet
him at the grocery store,

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.191
and you were waiting
in line, and you

00:17:35.191 --> 00:17:37.440
got to chatting with him,
you'd learn a lot about Jim.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.690
You'd find out that he loves
to barbecue and smoke ribs.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.080
We have-- I live in a
little apartment in Chicago

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.670
with a tiny front porch.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.450
And we have five grills.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.300
You would find out that he's
a huge Chicago Cubs fan.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.196
And he said that
last year when they

00:17:56.196 --> 00:17:57.570
won the World
Series was the best

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.410
day of his entire life, which
is really sad, because one

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.562
of the days of his
life he married me.

00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:05.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.220
But you would not find
out he's an attorney.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.136
And the reason why you
would not find out he's

00:18:09.136 --> 00:18:11.600
an attorney is because, as
Jim says, being a lawyer

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.890
is just what I do for a job.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.330
It's not who I am.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:19.106
But if you and I were to meet,
within the first five minutes,

00:18:19.106 --> 00:18:21.230
the first thing you would
know about me is that I'm

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.010
an educator, because being an
educator is not just what I do,

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.280
it's who I am as a person.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.920
It is intrinsically
related to my identity.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.080
And so when we're
asking our colleagues

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.350
to change, and to do
something different,

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.686
and to change the entire
definition of what it looks

00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:40.310
like to teach and
learn in a classroom,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.770
we're asking them to change
part of their identity

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.290
and how they exist
in their schools.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.000
And that leads to fear.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.635
And that leads to disbelief.

00:18:49.635 --> 00:18:51.010
And that identity
is something we

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:56.140
need to be very careful to
acknowledge and to talk about.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.112
Speaking of identity, I recently
came across this Facebook post

00:19:01.112 --> 00:19:02.320
about Facebook, funny enough.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.210
It was like Facebook inception.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.960
Right here.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.110
Don't let Facebook
make you miserable.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.610
And I was on Facebook
at the moment,

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.800
and I was like, I am
definitely feeling miserable

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.790
right now by Facebook.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.680
This is free, let's
click on this.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.800
And this is by a
journalist named

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.560
Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, who
works for "The New York Times."

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.920
And he basically says that
all of your friends and family

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.370
are dirty, awful liars.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.260
Does anyone have
a friend or family

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.710
who seems to always be on
vacation, all the time?

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.210
They're like constantly
living hashtag best life ever.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.930
And you're like, god,
I'm always at my school

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.400
and you're always
at like Barbados.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.550
How is this possible?

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.220
Do you not work?

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.470
And so he got frustrated
by that feeling

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.720
of looking at social
media and seeing

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.610
this version of his
friends and family

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.610
that seemed to be, first
of all, unbelievable.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.130
But also like incredibly
happy, while his life looked

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.530
dreary and depressing.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.000
So he decided to
do some research.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.577
He pulled up some analytics
and he looked up some data.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.160
And he was able to
find the following.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.940
For example, Americans spend
six times the amount of hours

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.980
in a week washing
dishes as playing golf.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.790
And yet, they tweet
about golf three times

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.290
more often than washing dishes.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.660
They're not like, man,
this Dawn soap is great,

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.350
hashtag best dish ever.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.700
Like it's not happening.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.380
Additionally, the budget hotel
in Las Vegas, Circus-Circus,

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.980
has the same number of rooms as
the luxury hotel, The Bellagio.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.340
And yet, people check
into the Bellagio

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.770
six times as often on
Facebook than Circus-Circus.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.419
They're like, man, this
gold toilet is great.

00:20:38.419 --> 00:20:38.960
I don't know.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.570
I've never been there.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.470
Do they have gold toilets?

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.060
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.437
JENNIE MAGIERA: OK.

00:20:43.437 --> 00:20:45.270
We're in education,
though, so let's take it

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.380
back to some reading.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.560
Let's look at what are our
colleagues and friends reading?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.560
How many of you are
familiar with the periodical

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.590
"The Atlantic?"

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.420
OK.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.020
They write some articles,
like 50 greatest inventions.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.710
OK, love it.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.220
And then there's also
the esteemed, renowned,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.520
and historic
"National Enquirer,"

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.184
which is like
Skynet is a reality,

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.850
Terminator's definitely
going to happen.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.150
Please go home and
smash your computers.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.650
Now, does anyone want to guess--

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.120
well, let's first say this.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.690
The "National Enquirer"
sells three times the number

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.286
of copies every year as
"The Atlantic," all right?

00:21:23.286 --> 00:21:24.910
Does anyone want to
guess how many more

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.320
times your friends
and family are

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.784
claiming to read "The Atlantic"
over the "National Enquirer?"

00:21:29.784 --> 00:21:30.700
AUDIENCE: Three times.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.570
JENNIE MAGIERA: Six.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:32.830
Three times more.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.990
Anyone else?

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.065
10 times more.

00:21:35.065 --> 00:21:36.940
I have to turn this on
its side to show you--

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.602
45 times the number of people
claim to read "The Atlantic"

00:21:42.602 --> 00:21:43.810
over the "National Enquirer."

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.500
Now, let's break that down.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.460
They're like, yeah man,
I read that article.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.630
It was great.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.697
There's inventions, and
there were 50 of them,

00:21:49.697 --> 00:21:50.530
and they were great.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.640
You didn't read it.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.010
You just pretended
to on Facebook.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.260
So here's the thing,
Seth Stephens-Davidowitz

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.511
also has this quote.

00:22:00.511 --> 00:22:03.010
It's a maxim that's used in a
lot of different places, which

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.690
is "don't compare your insides
to other people's outsides."

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.270
And then he goes on to add
to that maxim, "of course,

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.890
this advice is
difficult to follow,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.970
because we never see
other people's insides."

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.830
There's always
this false reality

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.250
that people are putting
out of perfection and ease.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.870
So he said, how can
I break this down?

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.330
And he decided to
use-- wait for it--

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.220
Google.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.800
Now, he decided to look
at the top five statements

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.470
that people seem to be making on
Facebook, which is, I'm always

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.362
on vacation, I'm
always having brunch,

00:22:34.362 --> 00:22:36.070
I'm always taking
selfies, and I'm always

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.200
having hashtag best life ever.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.590
At this time, he
also looked up what

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:46.360
the top five autofills for
the search "I'm always"

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.810
was on Google.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.050
And this is public
data aggregate

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.150
from across the world of
what people are actually

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.696
looking up for "I always."

00:22:53.696 --> 00:22:55.570
And what he found at
the time of this article

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.051
was that people are not always
on vacation, having brunch,

00:22:58.051 --> 00:22:59.800
taking selfies, and
living best life ever.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.460
They are feeling tired,
have to pee, have diarrhea,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.718
and they're bloated.

00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:07.586
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:13.900
Now, I have to acknowledge
that these are not

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.890
mutually exclusive.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.330
People can be on vacation
and have GI issues.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.648
But the thing is--

00:23:18.648 --> 00:23:21.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.310
--there's a difference between
the story we're sharing.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.890
So then I decided to ask
myself, am I guilty of this?

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:31.240
Am I guilty of hashtag
best life ever lying?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.310
And so I looked at
my own Facebook page.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.410
And I'm like geothermal
pool in Iceland,

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.670
hashtag best life ever.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.220
Indoor sky diving with
friends, best life ever.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.592
Sitting with my husband by
a mountain, best life ever.

00:23:41.592 --> 00:23:43.550
Mountains are a big deal
for people in Chicago.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.020
We don't have
anything like that.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.770
And I thought back to what
Seth Stephens-Davidowitz was

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.090
saying about comparing your
insides to other people's

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.070
outsides.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:56.830
And so I decided
that I was going

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.650
to start trying to be a
lot more open with my life

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.590
and share my insides a bit more.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.140
Now, this is a story
that I've started

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.420
sharing with more people
over the past couple months

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.900
actually because
of this article.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.040
So I'm going to talk to a
of you about it as well.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.840
For the past six
years, my husband and I

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.740
have been having
a lot of issues.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.640
Not maritally.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.240
I like him.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.050
I like his BBQ.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.870
Go Cubs.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.240
But we've been trying
to start a family.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.310
And it's really frustrating
when you spend your entire life

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.710
trying not to start a family and
then you decide to and then you

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.220
can't.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.680
And so for the past six
years, we've been struggling.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.980
And when you're also
struggling with something,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.660
it seems like it's
easy for everyone else.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.380
And so the more and the
longer that we were struggling

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.930
to have a family, I was
like, everyone around me

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.160
was pregnant constantly.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.020
Like chew, sneeze,
you're pregnant.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.080
Like how is this happening?

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.127
Oh my gosh.

00:24:54.127 --> 00:24:55.460
There's something wrong with me.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.330
I'm so embarrassed.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.788
And I didn't want
to talk about it.

00:24:57.788 --> 00:24:59.780
And so I started to
get really frustrated.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.250
And I stopped wanting to try.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.840
I was like, it's
just not for us, Jim.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.514
We're not the baby
making people, I guess.

00:25:05.514 --> 00:25:06.680
Like we'll just get over it.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.960
Let's get more dogs.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.850
And then finally,
we decided to go

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.740
to the next step for treatment.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.619
And I was terrified.

00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:14.160
I was scared.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.618
And I wanted to
ask for help, but I

00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:18.590
didn't know anyone who was going
through fertility treatment.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.780
I didn't know if it was what
I wanted to do spiritually,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:22.656
mentally, physically.

00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:24.363
But I didn't have
anyone to ask for help,

00:25:24.363 --> 00:25:26.720
because my friends are all
like, sneezy rabbits who

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.940
get pregnant immediately.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.720
So I decided to
put it on Facebook.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.360
And I asked my husband,
are you OK with this?

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.330
And he said, it's fine.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.296
And I posted this
post on Facebook.

00:25:37.296 --> 00:25:38.920
And I shared with my
friends and family

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.309
that we were having a
hard time, and that we

00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:43.600
were going to try something
new, and that I was scared.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.470
And if anyone, by the grace
of God, had gone through this,

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.040
could they please
reach out to me?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.580
And I thought, God,
my friends are all

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.240
going to think I'm
broken and this is awful.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:02.470
But within one hour I had over
288 likes and 75 comments.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.600
And what's more is
in the next 24 hours,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.850
over 80 friends
and family called,

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.120
texted, or showed up at
my door to talk to me.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.970
And to tell me,
you're not alone.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.390
And you might have thought you
were the only one struggling

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.220
and you were the only
one going through this,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.540
but I'm going through this too.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.960
And I had to go through
this to have all of my kids.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.521
And these kids, we
had to get help.

00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:26.770
And you know what, we don't
even like them that much--

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:28.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.060
--so if you want one,
I have some spares

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.055
to donate to the cause.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.560
Now, the thing that was really
amazing for me about this

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.960
was that I had spent
so long in the dark,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.980
isolating myself in my struggle,
because I saw the single story

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.070
that my friends chose to share
to the world of the ease it

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.530
was for them to
overcome challenges

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.740
and to meet that goal.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.730
And I started
thinking about this

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.780
as we are building up our
communities and our schools.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.640
And we're trying
to inspire people

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.570
to overcome a lot of challenges
and hurdles to innovate.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.910
And thinking about how
teaching is an identity

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.140
for many of our colleagues.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.600
And we're asking them to change
what teaching looks like.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.840
And so I started
to think back, do I

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.420
need to do a better job
of sharing my insides

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.850
and my journeys to innovation?

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.320
Do people look at
what we've done

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.886
and they see the tech
coaches amongst you,

00:27:23.886 --> 00:27:25.760
and they were like, oh,
it's so easy for him.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.810
It's so easy for her.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.460
I could never do that.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.860
She sneezes and uploads
a video to YouTube.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.780
Like I could never do that.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.030
And so I thought about my
story, about how I was a teacher

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.760
and I was doing my thing.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.190
And I had my computers
in my classroom.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.600
Computers meaning three.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.320
And it looked-- that's it.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.060
And it took 18
minutes to turn on.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.134
And they literally smoked
when you turned them on.

00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:50.800
And my kids would be
like, is this safe?

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.580
I'm like, don't worry about it.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.350
Do more Accelerated Reader.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.050
It's great.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.070
And I remember my first big tech
was this overhead calculator.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.140
And I put it on my overhead.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.560
And my kids were like, whoa!

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.500
It's clear.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.290
You can see it.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.710
It was gnarly, right?

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.590
You're like, yes!

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.100
And I put it in its little
bed every night, in its foam.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.370
It was great.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:19.465
So for me-- for me--

00:28:21.995 --> 00:28:23.424
AUDIENCE: It was high quality.

00:28:23.424 --> 00:28:24.590
JENNIE MAGIERA: Yes, it was.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.250
I'm not going to lie.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.970
I still have it.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:26.956
I really love it.

00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:28.229
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:30.020
I don't have an overhead
projector anymore,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.560
but I kept the calculator.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.370
So I was really
excited when they--

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.890
Chicago Public Schools had
announced a grant for iPads.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.150
And I was like, woo!

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.040
And to be clear,
iPads were announced

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.780
to the world in April, 2010.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.610
And they announced
the grant in June.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.400
It was like the first time
CPS was the first in anything.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.560
But I didn't know
what an iPad was.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.290
I thought was like a giant
phone that couldn't make calls.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.390
But I knew I wanted one.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.540
So I applied for this
grant with my team.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.550
And somehow, we got it.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.120
And I was so excited.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.477
And I was like, yay,
I'm getting iPads.

00:29:02.477 --> 00:29:03.560
This is going to be great.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.830
And the cart came like three
days before the kids came.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.870
And I was pretty
pumped about it.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.720
But really, it turned more
into like this like this.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.180
My life was a hot mess.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.077
Like I thought I knew
what was going on.

00:29:20.077 --> 00:29:22.160
And I was like, yay, I'm
going to change the world

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.430
with technology.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.112
And it was like,
no, I want to bury

00:29:25.112 --> 00:29:26.570
the iPads in the
back of the school

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.330
and pretend they got lost.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.920
It was awful.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.400
And the thing was I was
spending a lot of time googling,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.620
like how do you use
iPads in fourth grade?

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.550
And this was 2010.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.680
And so nobody knew
what an iPad was.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.630
So I had to change
to technology.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.620
And a lot of people were telling
me to flip my classroom and use

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.870
videos to differentiate.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.072
And so I started doing that.

00:29:48.072 --> 00:29:49.780
And the story that I
would tell the world

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.870
is I'm using videos
for differentiation.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.900
I'm meeting every
kid where they're at,

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.610
personalized learning, winning.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.310
And a lot of people who
have heard about the work

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.130
that I've done in Chicago,
my colleagues in the network,

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.795
are like yeah,
Jennie's that iPad lady

00:30:04.795 --> 00:30:05.920
who does flipped classroom.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.480
It's so easy for her.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.080
But the story I didn't tell them
was about the hot mess part.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.970
And I've started to try and
narrate that more, to know

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.530
yeah, I've done these things.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.380
But the first time
I tried to do this,

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:22.210
I did create a really
epic video about volume

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.130
of a rectangular pyramid.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.110
And I did come in on
Saturday and sync it

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.580
to all my kids' iPads.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.650
And they did come in on
Monday, and they did put

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.200
on their headphones,
and they did hit Play.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.540
And they were silent
for three full minutes.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.130
And I thought, ah,
truly I am a wizard,

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.980
for I have made 39 fourth
graders silent for three

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.730
minutes.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.960
But what I didn't tell
people was that at that point

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.480
a little girl giggled, and
then a little boy giggled.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.650
And I was like, hmm, funny.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.170
Volume isn't usually comedic.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.210
So I went over and I was
looking at their iPad.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.293
I'm like, what's going on.

00:30:56.293 --> 00:30:58.540
And then, to my horror, I
realized that I had not,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.310
in fact, synced the video that
I had painstakingly created.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.740
But instead, the
2010 raunchy comedy

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.917
classic "Hot Tub Time Machine."

00:31:07.917 --> 00:31:10.839
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.271
And they have been watching
it for three minutes.

00:31:20.271 --> 00:31:22.576
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.916
So I was like, well,
it's been real.

00:31:25.916 --> 00:31:27.290
I'm definitely
getting fired now.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.300
Goodbye forever.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.800
But here's the thing.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.000
I talked to my principal.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.980
I had a really interesting
conversation with her.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.260
I had lots of very interesting
conversations with parents.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.660
And it was hard for me
and I wanted to give up.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.150
But I had a coach.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:47.390
I had a coach who
told me, don't worry.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.670
It's OK to make mistakes.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.140
Keep trying.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.540
Just don't do it
again next time.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.114
And as coaches,
what I really want

00:31:57.114 --> 00:31:59.280
to tell you is great about
that coach that I had was

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.890
she was always vulnerable.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.660
And she always
showed me her warts.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.710
And she always showed
me her inner self.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.070
And when she made a mistake,
she was really transparent

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.134
about it.

00:32:09.134 --> 00:32:10.800
And anytime I was
trying something hard,

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.240
she told me about
her failures when

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.406
she tried it the first time.

00:32:13.406 --> 00:32:16.290
And she made that
path so approachable

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.610
for me to walk down.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.500
And she was not perfect.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.800
And that was the
best thing about her.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.740
And so as we think about the
single story we tell the world,

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.470
really think about the
inner story of yourself,

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.350
the untold stories that we
may not share all the time.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.180
And think about how
to create a path that

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.250
is approachable for all of the
people who follow behind you.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:40.530
No, my final story for you
is about the single story

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.550
of teachers.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.430
We've talked a lot about
the identity of teachers

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.040
and how you might
see that as part

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.410
of this existential
version of you.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.950
But I also want to think about
the untold story of wizards.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.420
And I want to start
off with Mr. P.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.760
Mr. P is a teacher that
I coached in Chicago.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.852
He's a middle
school math teacher.

00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:01.560
There he is right
there, lifelike drawing

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.610
of Mr. P. Mr. P came to me
with a problem of practice.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.630
He said, Jennie, I
really need some help.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.310
My kids hate math.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.580
And as a fellow math teacher,
oh, it just broke my heart.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.204
He's like, I don't think there's
anything I can do about it.

00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:19.620
If a kid's going to hate math,
a kid's going to hate math.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.290
Maybe they're a reading person.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.730
And I said, come on, Patrick,
you know better than that.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:27.540
You know that we're not like
a math person or a reading

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.230
person.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.510
We just have to
help them understand

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:34.640
the content in a way
that makes sense to them.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.605
So he said, my kids hate math.

00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:38.230
And I said, well,
I'm going to give you

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.619
a book then, which was, like,
you want me to read a book

00:33:40.619 --> 00:33:41.410
and they hate math.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:41.950
This doesn't make any sense.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:42.370
I'm like, don't worry.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.660
It's a book about math.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.370
And it's actually
by a local educator.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.540
His name is Matt Vaudrey.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.990
And he wrote a book called
"The Classroom Chef."

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.850
And I said, the
thing that we can

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.880
do to help kids love math
is to find the story in it.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.190
To find the way to narrate this.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:00.700
So let's think about a
different way to approach it.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.320
And we looked at the
book and we found

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.610
a lot of different examples.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.659
And as Mr. P was looking through
the book, his eyes lit up.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:11.581
And he was like, oh, I
know what I want to do.

00:34:11.581 --> 00:34:12.830
I was like, what did you find?

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.389
Tell me more.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.939
And he had found a
chapter about mullets.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.280
Now, the problem
was he was thinking

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.239
about how to use mullets
in his classroom,

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:27.060
but his kids didn't
know what a mullet was.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.449
It's 2015 at this time.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:32.312
Mullets are not the most
popular hairstyle anymore.

00:34:32.312 --> 00:34:34.270
And when you Google it,
this is the definition,

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.285
the number one
definition is a fish.

00:34:36.285 --> 00:34:38.659
And so he was thinking, what
is the definition of mullet?

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:39.810
How can I show my kids?

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.889
So he began to find images.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.860
And of course, there is
the dictionary definition

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.989
of a mullet, which is
business in the front

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.889
and party in the back.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.139
And in the book,
"The Classroom Chef,"

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.570
Matt Vaudrey has cooked
up a way to teach

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.460
middle school math via mullets.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.030
And that is through the very
important mathematical theorem

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.490
of the mullet ratio.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.710
Now, the mullet
ratio is one's ratio

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.350
of party in the back to
business in the front.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.620
And to visualize this
for you, it's as such.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.470
So one measures the party
to business in centimeters

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.580
and then creates a ratio
where the numerator is party

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.060
and the denominator is business.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.770
And Patrick decided to
take us into his classroom

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.039
and try it out.

00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:26.580
He found some images of mullets
and he gave them to his kids.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.284
And they began to determine
the mullet ratio--

00:35:29.284 --> 00:35:32.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.480
--and they found that it varies.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.640
And that it's not age defining.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.280
And you know, young, old can
have a pretty strong mullet

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.330
ratio.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.070
And they went
around the classroom

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.997
and they began to
find these ratios.

00:35:45.997 --> 00:35:47.580
He found out a lot
about his students,

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.920
and he read a lot about Matt
Vaudrey's experience as well.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.157
For example, students
can love math.

00:35:54.157 --> 00:35:56.490
You just have to give them
the right entree point, which

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.590
is apparently '80s hairstyles.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.680
And that people
like Billy Ray Cyrus

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.840
are always dreamy
to teenage girls.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.810
This is an actual worksheet
that was turned in to a teacher.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:14.600
Now Mr. P decided to
take this further.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.005
So his kids were
studying ratios.

00:36:16.005 --> 00:36:19.160
And then next they were looking
at linear relationships.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.180
And he decided, I
want to continue

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.289
an entire thematic unit
on mullets for math.

00:36:25.289 --> 00:36:26.830
So he decided to
think about how they

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:30.130
could graph a one-to-one
party to business line.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:32.590
And then he took modern
celebrities to find,

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.050
is the mullet surreptitiously
coming back into style?

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.451
And he found that it might be.

00:36:37.451 --> 00:36:38.950
He determined that
there's something

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.140
called the one-to-one
proportional line, which

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.510
is the Obama Bieber line.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.550
2010 Justin Bieber
and Barack Obama

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:50.110
had a perfect one-to-one ratio
hairstyle mapped as P to B

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.260
right here.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.220
And then you can see Miley
and Harry Styles are all

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.970
mapped along this continuum.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:37:00.230
Now, the thing about Mr. P was
that he had started to give up.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.260
He had started to
say, I don't know if I

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.520
want to be a teacher anymore.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.010
Every day I come and teach
these seventh graders.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.790
They hate it.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.410
They don't do their homework.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.910
And he just needed
to look at this

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.210
from a different perspective.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.630
He needed a chance
to inject that fun.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.360
And he had the single story
of himself as a math teacher.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.710
And the single story he had
of himself as a math teacher

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:26.340
was his math teacher when
he was in seventh grade.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.950
And what his coach was
able to do for him--

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:34.500
it was me-- was help him say
that your untold story is

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.470
your own and you don't have
to emulate the single story

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.510
of another teacher.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.750
You can be yourself.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:42.520
You can find your own
identity in your classroom.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.390
And if you have fun and
you enjoy being there,

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.960
perhaps your kids will be too.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.210
And so Mr. P was able to go from
hobbit to wizard and to find

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:54.040
that inner wizard in himself.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.140
Now, this last teacher
I want to tell you about

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.090
is Miss R, Lindsay Rose.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.600
And Lindsay Rose was a
teacher in my building.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.320
And her problem, her practice
was that her students

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.210
were never on task.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.370
And they were
constantly disengaged.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.520
They were constantly
playing around.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.650
And so what we
decided to do was take

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.390
a look at what
they were focusing

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.860
on instead of, again, math.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.630
Jeff Duncan-Andrade
told us yesterday

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.250
that our kids are
coming to school

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.669
with a litany of other
stories and narratives

00:38:26.669 --> 00:38:28.710
that are going on in their
head, other challenges

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.860
that they're facing other than
linear regression and ratio.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.690
And in the case of
Lindsay Rose's students,

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.370
the challenges that
they were facing

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.590
was the community
that they lived in.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.004
How many of you have
been to Chicago before?

00:38:40.004 --> 00:38:40.787
Yay!

00:38:40.787 --> 00:38:42.620
How many of you have
been to the South Shore

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.650
neighborhood of Chicago
at 103rd and Exchange.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.610
I know, you work there.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.540
A few of you.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.530
Yes.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:52.370
Now, for those of you who
raised your hand, Sarah, Rachel,

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.160
you know that probably there's
a lot of really great things

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.030
about South Shore.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.250
It's a beautiful lakefront.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.850
There is the stable where the
Chicago Police Department's

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.230
horses are held.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.910
There's a golf course.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.590
But if you Google
South Shore, what

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.840
you're going to find in
the news are these types

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.590
of articles about gun
violence and drug deals

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.050
and the number of gang activity
happening in that neighborhood.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:23.660
It is the number one gun
per capita area of Chicago.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.390
It was so bad that
the local media

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.300
started referring to it directly
as Terror Town instead of South

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.350
Shore.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.080
And the single story
that was being propagated

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.932
in the mass media was that it
was a dangerous place to live,

00:39:34.932 --> 00:39:37.390
you shouldn't be there, and we
need to clean up the streets

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.556
because they're gang ridden.

00:39:38.556 --> 00:39:41.170
And everyone there
is a terrible person.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.950
And the kids were
really frustrated.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.436
They were frustrated to have
boot prints on their homework

00:39:45.436 --> 00:39:47.560
coming to school because
the police had busted down

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.760
their door the day before.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.800
They were frustrated
that every time they

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.020
turned on the television,
it was something negative

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.020
about their community.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.700
They were frustrated that nobody
was telling their true story.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:04.810
And so Lindsay Rose said, I now
understand why my kids are not

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.430
engaged in math.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.420
What can we do?

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.720
So we decided to
do something crazy.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.420
She took the book, "The
House on Mango Street,"

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.060
by Sandra Cisneros,
and she decided

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.760
to read an excerpt of it
to her class every day.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.220
Have any of you read this book?

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.940
Really great mentor text.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:30.060
And what she did was she had her
kids use the Cisneros's words

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.660
to think about, how
could they find a way

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.250
to tell the
counter-narrative to what

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.380
they were seeing in the news?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.910
Now mind you, she was doing
all of this during math class.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.070
But because she decided
to take this risk,

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.590
and I was able to work with her
to feel comfortable in doing

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.990
it, we were able to
get principal support

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.949
to give her five minutes a
day to work with her students.

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.490
And at the end of
every day, we said,

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.530
this doesn't lead
to a math standard,

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.320
but we believe by giving
our students a chance

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.300
to express themselves
during this period,

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.560
to build this relationship,
to talk through these issues,

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.102
it's going to allow them to be
better focused during the day.

00:41:07.102 --> 00:41:09.184
And so the principal said,
I'm willing to give you

00:41:09.184 --> 00:41:09.810
this chance.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.940
And so I'm really
glad that there

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.390
are 50 principals
in this room who

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:16.140
can be there to give that space
to take risks in classrooms.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.830
Because here's
what happened next.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.400
The students wrote
this counter-narrative.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.500
And they used social
media to share it out

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.320
with all of the major
news outlets in Chicago.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.550
The "Chicago Sun-Times," the
"Tribune," NBC, ABC, NPR.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.190
And it was picked up by
every single one of them.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.610
What's more is the "Chicago
Sun-Times" sent a news truck

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.260
and media crew
down to the school,

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.970
to Bradwell School
of Excellence,

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.580
to record the sixth
graders telling the story

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.770
from their own point of view.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:44.670
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.220
- We saw your news
trucks and cameras here,

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.260
and we read your
article, "Six shot

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.430
in South Shore laundromat
and another mass

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.830
shooting in Terror Town."

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.900
- We saw the news
reporters with fancy suits

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.840
in front of our laundrymat.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.560
- You spent 24 hours here,
but you really don't know us.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.590
- Those who don't know us think
this is a poor neighborhood,

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.907
with those abandoned buildings
with the wood covering

00:42:06.907 --> 00:42:09.690
the windows and broken doors.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.840
- Those who don't know us
saw the police on the corner

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.060
and think that we're
all violence and drugs.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.610
- They see the candy wrappers
and empty juice bottles

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.990
and think we don't care.

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.940
- Uneducated, jobless thieves.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.040
You'll be scared of
these heartless people.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.480
- When you see us coming,
you might hurry up and run

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.240
to your cars and lock the door.s

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.220
- Then speed down these
streets at 60 miles per hour

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.360
like you're on a highway trying
to get out of this ghetto.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.480
- We want to know us.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.880
We aren't afraid.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.350
We know that man at the corner.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.990
He works at the store and
gives us free Lemonheads.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.710
- Those girls jumping rope are
Precious, Anaya, and Nevaeh.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.540
- The people in
suits are not going

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.050
to funerals, but to church.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.250
- That little creepy dog is
[INAUDIBLE],, Lamar's dog.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.640
- We are the kids who fly on
crates so we can shoot hoops.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.200
- When the sun
shines here, it's not

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.080
Got saying he wants to burn us.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.200
But he sees us all
with bright futures.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.560
- Those who know us look at the
ones who want to go to college,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.270
not the ones who dropped out.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.160
- If you lived here, you'd
here this laughter and chatter

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.613
from the group of
girls on the corner

00:43:11.613 --> 00:43:13.862
who are best friends and
really care about each other.

00:43:13.862 --> 00:43:16.560
- Do you see the smile
on the cashier's face

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.450
when the kids walk in?

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.830
Why?

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.320
Because this neighborhood
is filled with love.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.150
- This isn't Chiraq.

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:25.660
This is home.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.264
This is us.

00:43:27.264 --> 00:43:28.622
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:28.622 --> 00:43:30.080
JENNIE MAGIERA:
For the first time,

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.640
the students had
a chance to tell

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:37.380
the world about their untold
story of their community.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:43.350
And this teacher, Miss
Rose, she had this in her

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:46.630
the entire time.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:47.390
I was her coach.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.500
I helped her to get
the materials together.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.420
I helped her to find a book.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.030
I helped her to feel
confident to do it.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.607
But this was all Lindsay.

00:43:57.607 --> 00:43:59.440
And the thing that I
want you to think about

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.150
as you're going
back to your schools

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.800
and working with
your teachers is

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.250
that as coaches, as
principals, we're

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.230
there to help our
colleagues be the best

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.860
versions of themselves.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.590
That this is all
in them already.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:15.990
Miss Rose was already a wizard.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:18.120
She just needed someone
to unlock that in her

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.990
and to give her the freedom and
permission to take that risk.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.110
So as we think about the
single story of teachers,

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:28.800
know that all of our teachers
are secretly inner wizards.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.700
And as coaches, as
principals, it's our duty.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.200
And what we truly hope is going
to come out of this coaching

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.910
fellowship event is
that you are going

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.790
to find the tools to bring
out those inner wizards

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:40.290
in your teachers.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:43.500
So thinking about Mr. P and
finding his inner wizard,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.095
thinking about Miss Rose
and her inner wizard,

00:44:46.095 --> 00:44:47.970
and thinking about all
the other teachers who

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.940
are in your schools who may be
acting like hobbits or dragons,

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.450
but truly are wizards, my
call to action for all of you

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.040
is to think.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.560
When you go home,
how are you going

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.260
to use what you've
learned here this week,

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.420
the connections you've
made with each other

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.180
to inspire the people
in your buildings

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.120
and cultivate the
wizards in your school?

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:09.990
Thank you.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.040
[APPLAUSE]
