00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.030
If I were to draw a hand, and
let me just draw a hand really

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.500
fast, so I'll draw
a left hand.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.620
It looks something like that.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.220
That is a left hand.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.970
Now, if I were to take its
mirror image, let's say that

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.460
this is a mirror right there,
and I want to take its mirror

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.970
image, and I'll draw the
mirror image in green.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.450
So its mirror image would look
something like this.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.910
Not exact, but you
get the idea.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.590
The mirror image of a left
hand looks a lot

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.140
like a right hand.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.780
Now, no matter how I try to
shift or rotate this hand like

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.750
this, I might try to maybe
rotate it 180 degrees, so that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.500
the thumb is on the other side
like this image right here.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.260
But no matter what I do, I will
never be able to make

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.340
this thing look like
that thing.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.190
I can shift it and rotate it,
it'll just never happen.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.590
I will never be able to
superimpose the blue hand on

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.870
top of this green hand.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.110
When I say superimpose,
literally put it exactly on

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.490
top of the green hand.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.030
So whenever something is not
superimposable on its mirror

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:25.040
image-- let me write this down--
we call it chiral.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.540
So this hand drawing
right here is an

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.380
example of a chiral object.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.610
Or I guess the hand is an
example of a chiral object.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.750
This is not superimposable
on its mirror image.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.320
And it makes sense that it's
called chiral because the word

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.950
chiral comes from the
Greek word for hand.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.990
And this definition of
not being able to be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.020
superimposable on its mirror
image, this applies whether

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.560
you're dealing with chemistry,
or mathematics, or I guess,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.470
just hands in general.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.150
So if we extend this definition
to chemistry,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.110
because that's what we're
talking about, there's two

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.259
concepts here.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.500
There are chiral molecules,
and then there are chiral

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.310
centers or chiral-- well, I call
them chiral atoms. They

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.430
tend to be carbon atoms, so
sometimes they call them

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.650
chiral carbons.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.530
So you have these
chiral atoms.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.350
Now, chiral molecules are
literally molecules that are

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.370
not superimposable on
their mirror image.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.720
I'm not going to write
the whole thing.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.120
You know, not superimposable--
I'll just

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.480
write the whole thing.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.310
Not superimposable
on mirror image.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.300
Now, for chiral atoms, this is
essentially true, but when you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.790
look for chiral atoms within a
molecule, the best way to spot

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.760
them is to recognize that these
generally, or maybe I

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.620
should say usually, are carbons,
especially when we're

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.550
dealing in organic chemistry,
but they could be phosphoruses

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.590
or sulfurs, but usually are
carbons bonded to four

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.840
different groups.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.720
And I want to emphasize
groups, not just four

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.250
different atoms. And to kind of
highlight a molecule that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.470
contains a chiral atom or chiral
carbon, we can just

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.390
think of one.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.230
So let's say that I have a
carbon right here, and I'm

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.700
going to set this up so this
is actually a chiral atom,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.100
that the carbon specific is a
chiral atom, but it's partly a

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.230
chiral molecule.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.410
And then we'll see examples
that one or both

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.670
of these are true.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.780
Let's say it's bonded
to a methyl group.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.660
From that bond, it kind of
pops out of the page.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.990
Let's say there's a
bromine over here.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.390
Let's say behind it, there is a
hydrogen, and then above it,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.360
we have a fluorine.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.250
Now if I were to take the mirror
image of this thing

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.892
right here, we have your carbon
in the center-- I want

00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:22.710
to do it in that same blue.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.210
You have the carbon in the
center and then you have the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.750
fluorine above the carbon.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.970
You have your bromine now
going in this direction.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.220
You have this methyl group.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.800
It's still popping out of the
page, but it's now going to

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.800
the right instead of to
the left, So CH3.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.720
And then you have the hydrogen
still in the back.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.320
These are mirror images, if you
view this as kind of the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.970
mirror and you can see on both
sides of the mirror.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.240
Now, why is this chiral?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.090
Well, it's a little bit of a
visualization challenge, but

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.870
no matter how you try to rotate
this thing right here,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.470
you will never make it exactly
like this thing.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.660
You might try to rotate it
around like that and try to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.690
get the methyl group over here,
to get it over there.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.160
So let's try to do that.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.260
If we try to get the methyl
group over there, what's going

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.510
to happen to the other groups?

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.070
Well, then the hydrogen group is
going-- or the hydrogen, I

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.340
should say.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.930
The hydrogen atom is going to
move there and the bromine is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.410
going to move there.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.440
So this would be superimposable
if this was a

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.130
hydrogen and this was a
bromine, but it's not.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.930
You can imagine, the hydrogen
and bromine are switched.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.110
And you could flip it and do
whatever else you want or try

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.120
to rotate it in any direction,
but you're not going to be

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.650
able to superimpose them.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.350
So this molecule right here is
a chiral molecule, and this

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:50.710
carbon is a chiral center, so
this carbon is a chiral

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.990
carbon, sometimes called
an asymmetric

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.970
carbon or a chiral center.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.360
Sometimes you'll hear
something called a

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.265
stereocenter.

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:02.340
A stereocenter is a more general
term for any point in

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.470
a molecule that is asymmetric
relative to the different

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.000
groups that it is joined to.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.350
But all of these, especially
when you're in kind of in

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.730
introductory organic chemistry
class, tends to be a carbon

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.660
bonded to four different
groups.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.530
And I want to to stress that
it's not four different atoms.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.920
You could have had a methyl
group here and a propyl group

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.010
here, and the carbon would still
be bonded directly to a

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.740
carbon in either case, but that
would still be a chiral

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.790
carbon, and this would still
actually be a chiral molecule.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.150
In the next video, we'll
do a bunch of examples.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.810
We'll look at molecules, try
to identify the chiral

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.975
carbons, and then try to
figure out whether the

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:44.180
molecule itself is--
