00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:02.079
All right, I get the hint.

00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:03.963
You actually want
this class to be finished

00:00:03.963 --> 00:00:06.675
sometime before the next
Android release happens.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.373
We're almost done.

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:12.202
So we look in
ForecastFragment in onStart.

00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:14.469
We've actually been cheating a bit.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.784
Every single time we get to onStart,
we actually update the weather.

00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:20.084
Let's get rid of that.

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:21.664
It'll force us to actually have to use

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:24.365
the refresh function
to get new weather,

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:26.250
but it'll help illustrate
the cool stuff

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.391
we're about to do with preferences.

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:29.987
We're going to stop cheating here.

00:00:29.987 --> 00:00:32.877
In onPreferenceChange,
if we're not actually binding preferences,

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:35.119
we're going to execute
a new FetchWeatherTask,

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.012
if there's a change in location.

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:39.382
Otherwise, we'll just notify
our CONTENT_URI

00:00:39.382 --> 00:00:41.453
to allow our cursor to update.

00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:43.880
We still have to do one more thing.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.203
In ForecastFragment,

00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:47.052
we've been using an instance variable,

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:49.827
mLocation, to save
the preferred location we get

00:00:49.827 --> 00:00:52.111
when we're actually an onCreate loader.

00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:53.942
We've been doing that
because we've been planning

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:55.878
to use this for a while.

00:00:55.878 --> 00:00:57.991
Let's override another function.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.710
In onResume, we need to check to see

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.189
whether or not
our location has changed.

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.793
So if our location is not equal to null,

00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:09.286
and Utility.getPreferredLocation
does not equal location,

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:11.478
well, then we can
call update weather.

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.449
Let's see what happens.

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:14.974
You see it immediately changed back.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.754
You didn't see that loading
because it didn't have to load anything.

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:21.627
However, if we change settings
to something else,

00:01:21.627 --> 00:01:23.846
it's refreshed in the background.

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:26.156
Well, it turns out updating weather
doesn't actually help us here.

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:27.959
Why?

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.397
Because our URI hasn't changed.

00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:32.651
Remember, we're doing
everything based upon URI.

00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:35.531
What we really need to do
is reset our loader.

00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:37.285
So, how do we do that?

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:39.184
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.597
Just like we did in onActivityCreated,

00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:43.393
we have to use LoaderManager.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.503
So instead of calling updateWeather,

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:48.275
what we're actually going to do
is call something else.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.968
In this case, not an initLoader,
but restartLoader.

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:54.182
It takes the same parameters
as an initLoader.

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:56.251
Now, let's try this again.

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.092
That already looks better.

00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:00.913
All right, let's change back
to our own weather again.

00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:02.820
And there we are.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.212
As you can see,

00:02:05.212 --> 00:02:08.389
the weather is changing as we go
from location to location,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.526
but we still have this problem.

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.755
Obviously, when we change settings here,

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:14.510
it doesn't affect anything.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.113
So we need to fix that.

00:02:16.113 --> 00:02:17.833
That's where you come in.
