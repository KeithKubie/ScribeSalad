00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.300
A SPACE SUIT
IS A PRESSURIZED GARMENT

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.601
THAT ASTRONAUTS WILL WEAR

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:10.434
THAT IS MEANT TO RE-CREATE
THE CONDITIONS ON EARTH.

00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:12.734
WHEN YOU GO OUT
TO THE VACUUM OF SPACE,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.334
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT'S KEEPING YOU ALIVE.

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:18.100
Narrator: SPACEWALKS CAN BE
AS LONG AS 8 HOURS.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.767
AND AN ASTRONAUT CANNOT
SIMPLY GO BACK

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.667
INSIDE TO USE THE BATHROOM.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.834
BUT THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED BY
THE MAXIMUM ABSORBENCY GARMENT.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.334
VERY FANCY WORD
FOR AN ADULT DIAPER.

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.467
EVERYBODY WORE DIAPERS
AT SOME POINT.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.200
SO I GUESS IF
YOU'RE AN ASTRONAUT,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.801
YOU'RE JUST GOIN' BACK
TO YOUR ROOTS.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.200
Hernandez: WHEN YOU GET INTO
THE SPACE SUIT,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.901
THE FIRST THING YOU DO
IS YOU PUT ON YOUR DIAPER.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:41.000
AND THEN YOU PUT ON
YOUR COOLING GARMENT.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.501
WITHOUT THE COOLING
UNDERGARMENT,

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.234
THE ASTRONAUT CERTAINLY
COULD OVERHEAT

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:45.734
BECAUSE INSIDE
THE SPACE SUIT,

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.501
THERE'S NOWHERE FOR
THE BODY HEAT TO ESCAPE.

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.567
Woman: SPACE SUITS HAVE BEEN
AROUND A REALLY LONG TIME.

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:52.300
AND THEY'VE GONE THROUGH
SEVERAL GENERATIONS

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.767
WHERE THEY GET
BETTER AND BETTER.

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:55.300
Waldman: THE FIRST ASTRONAUT
SUITS ON THE MOON

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.167
WERE ACTUALLY MORE
FLEXIBLE LATEX SUITS.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.100
TODAY, HUMANS CAN
MOVE AROUND A LOT

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.200
MORE THAN THEY COULD
IN PREVIOUS SPACE SUITS.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.167
Narrator: WITH ONLY TWO EMUs ON
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION,

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:06.868
THE SPACE SUITS
HAVE TO BE SHARED.

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:08.467
SO THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SIZES:

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.601
MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA LARGE.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:12.234
THEY CAN BE RECONFIGURED.

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:13.901
AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BE ABLE

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:16.701
TO ACCOMMODATE 95%
OF THE ASTRONAUTS.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.167
Narrator: THE MAIN SUIT
IS COMPRISED OF THE HUT,

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:21.734
WHICH STANDS
FOR "HARD UPPER TORSO,"

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.400
AND THE LOWER TORSO.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.968
IN TOTAL, THERE'S ABOUT
11 LAYERS TO THE SPACE SUIT:

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:28.667
SHELL, A BLADDER LAYER
TO REGULATE PRESSURE,

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:31.234
FIVE LAYERS OF MYLAR
TO REGULATE TEMPERATURE,

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:33.767
A WATERPROOF LAYER,
A FIREPROOF LAYER,

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:37.734
A BULLETPROOF LAYER IN CASE
ANY SPACE GANGSTERS FLOAT BY.

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:39.167
THAT'S A JOKE.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:40.834
ONE OF THE LAYERS
IN THE SPACE SUIT

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.734
MAKES YOU SPACE DUST-PROOF.

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:45.300
SPACE DUST IS CREATED
FROM ASTEROIDS.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.033
IT COMES AT YOU ABOUT THE SPEED
OF A SPEEDING BULLET.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:50.367
IF IT'S GOING SUPER-FAST,

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.467
NO MATTER HOW SMALL IT IS,
IT'S GONNA HURT YOU.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.968
AND THOSE 11 LAYERS
REALLY PROTECT YOU.

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:57.100
THE COMMUNICATIONS
CARRIER ASSEMBLY

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.267
IS WHAT YOU PUT ON YOUR HEAD.

00:01:58.267 --> 00:01:59.934
IT HAS EARPHONES
AND A MICROPHONE

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:02.334
FOR YOU TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE STATION IN THE GROUND.

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:04.100
Narrator: THE CLOTH CAP FASTENS
UNDER THE CHIN

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.834
AND KEEPS THE HEADSET IN PLACE
ON THE ASTRONAUT'S HEAD.

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:08.234
WE CALL THE CCA,

00:02:08.234 --> 00:02:09.968
THE COMMUNICATIONS
CARRIER ASSEMBLY,

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:11.334
THE SNOOPY CAP.

00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:13.634
WHEN SNOOPY USED TO FIGHT
WITH THE RED BARON,

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.067
HE USED TO HAVE THAT
WORLD WAR I FLIGHT CAP.

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:18.033
AND THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT
THE SNOOPY CAP.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.467
THE HELMET IS ESSENTIALLY
A CLEAR PLASTIC BUBBLE

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.000
THAT ALLOWS THE
ASTRONAUT TO BREATHE.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.367
Man: THERE'S A GOLD VISOR

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:25.701
THAT COMES DOWN IN CASE
YOU'RE IN THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT.

00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:27.968
IF IT'S VERY, VERY BRIGHT
AND YOU'RE HAVING TO WORK,

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:29.467
YOU HAVE ANOTHER METAL VISOR

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:32.434
THAT COMES DOWN LIKE
THE VISOR ON YOUR CAR.

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:35.601
THIS VISOR ASSEMBLY
HAS A CAMERA SYSTEM.

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.701
WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF LAMPS
TO WORK IN THE DARK.

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.200
AND YOU HAVE A STRAW
RIGHT HERE AT YOUR MOUTH.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.000
YOU CAN JUST DRINK
ALL THE WATER YOU WANT.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.667
