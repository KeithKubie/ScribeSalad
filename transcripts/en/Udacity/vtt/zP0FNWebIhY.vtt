00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So here I've been using just numbers as the values, but the values can actually

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
be anything we want. They could even be other dictionaries.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So if we wanted to make a more interesting version of elements--so we'll start

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
with an empty dictionary, and we can add a new element. This time we'll use

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the atomic symbol as the key, and we'll make the value of the element

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a dictionary that provides some information about it. So we've added an element

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to our dictionary. The key is the single letter H, and it has as its value a dictionary

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that has 3 entries with the key name, number, and weight, and values associated

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with each of those that could be different types--name as the string

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which gives the full name of the element. We'll add another element to our dictionary.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so for helium, we have the same name, number, and weight to use,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and so for helium we have an extra entry that says it's a noble gas, and the value

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of noble gas is true. So now we can look up the element H. We will see its entry.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Again note that it's a dictionary, so the order is not the same as the order

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that we used here. But we can do another lookup. So now we're looking up element H

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that gets us the dictionary here, and then we're looking up in that dictionary

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the value name, and that will give us the name of the element whose symbol is H.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We could change this to look up some other property. Let's look up the weights.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we can change the element to look up the value for helium instead of for hydrogen.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And now we get the 4.002, which was the weight of helium.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If we look up the noble gas property, we get true for helium.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What's going to happen if we look it up for hydrogen?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So here we get an error, and we get the same error that we got before when we tried

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to look lithium up in the elements that didn't include lithium as a key.

00:02:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We're looking for the key noble gas, but it doesn't exist.
