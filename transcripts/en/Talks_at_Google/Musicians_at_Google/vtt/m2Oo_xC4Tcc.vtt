[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.766
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:15.620
JOHN ALBERT: Great, well,
thanks for coming out.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.330
I want to preface this by saying
I do know Ben a little bit.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.940
So if we exchange in
shorthand sometimes,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.280
that's the explanation.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.840
I've known him since
he was a child.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.520
And Charlie, I'm a huge fan of.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.520
And I wanted to sort of--

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.690
the idea, I think, for
doing this would be,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.300
while I think a
lot of people think

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.130
that they know who
these two guys are,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.500
I don't know that that's true.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.415
And so I wanted to go
a little more in-depth

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:56.700
of who they are as a
people and as artists

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.710
and where this record
is coming from.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.180
So I guess the first question,
which I find interesting,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.870
is how you two met initially.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.937
Because it has this sort of
almost mythical quality to me.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.520
And so I'm wondering
if you guys could

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.350
sort of talk about
who introduced you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.685
and how that happened.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:19.270
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Well, in 1993?

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.201
BEN HARPER: '93.

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:22.700
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
John Lee Hooker

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.770
was playing at a little
club in Mill Valley,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.260
California called
the Sweetwater,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.330
and Ben was opening.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.245
And John Lee had asked me to
come sit in with him-- which

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:35.240
we were real good
friends, so he often

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.959
asked me to come play
with him if I wasn't busy.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.125
And that's where we all met.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:40.035
BEN HARPER: Yeah.

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:43.548
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: That
was the first meeting.

00:01:43.548 --> 00:01:46.500
JOHN ALBERT: And it
was at his suggestion

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.422
that you guys initially
played together?

00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:51.306
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
At who's suggestion?

00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:52.719
JOHN ALBERT: John Lee's.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.094
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
I don't know

00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.446
whose idea it was that he open.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:58.740
BEN HARPER: Well, I
got the opening gig--

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.540
I got the call from John Lee,
and we were at the same agency.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.669
So it just was a clear fit.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.440
And I remember
being in the room--

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.380
I knew I was going to
be opening for John Lee.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.210
And while that was
clear, I had no idea

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.240
Charlie was going to be there.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.156
So I walked into the
room and saw both of them

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:20.976
and jaw hit the floor.

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:23.100
And I just knew it was
going to be a special night.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.000
And they welcomed me.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.300
And I was absolutely just--

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.200
I was green.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.850
I was peon on at that time.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.820
And they were still
so good to me.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.370
It was a special moment.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.640
And that introduction
then grew into Charlie

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.230
and I are crossing paths at
different shows and festivals--

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.310
being on the same circuit.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.370
And then, soon, we got
the call from John Lee

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.870
to record with him.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.332
That was about '96, '97.

00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:53.790
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: He had an
album called "Just Friends?"

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.810
BEN HARPER: "Best of
Friends," I think.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.434
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
"Best of Friends."

00:02:56.434 --> 00:02:58.560
And that's where we
really locked in.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.000
BEN HARPER: That's
where it began.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.820
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
And even John Lee,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.890
after we get through
recording, said,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.849
man, you guys have got
to record more together.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.473
BEN HARPER: Charlie,
you could hear him

00:03:08.473 --> 00:03:09.480
on the end of the song.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.800
At the end, you and I are
resonating our two notes,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.280
and they kind of become
one haunted sound.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.980
And John Lee is on the
record going, sounds

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.050
like a freight train
coming through here.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.945
And they kept that
on the recording.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:22.590
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
The tune stops,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.960
we still have our headphones on,
and John Lee goes, what's that?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.670
BEN HARPER: That
sounds just like him.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.310
And so how did that
experience eventually end up

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.700
with you guys formally
playing together and recording

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.340
together?

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.690
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Well, since John

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.400
said that it was such
a good idea to do that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.792
and we, obviously,
knew he was right--

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:50.500
BEN HARPER: Yeah.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.625
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: --and
we kept talking about it

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.090
for years, but we were so busy.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.850
The problem was finding
a time when we would

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.730
both be off at the same time.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.200
And boy, when we finally
got into the studio,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.210
it's like all those tunes were
really restless and couldn't--

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.710
BEN HARPER: It's
like the music said

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.240
to us, what took you so long?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.590
It felt like that to me, anyway.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.680
And I hadn't felt
like that before.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.250
It's like the music
said to us, like,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.730
what took you two so long?

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.310
And it's about time.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.710
And just one more
thing about John Lee.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.820
He was a man of few words
I think it was fair to say.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.939
And so when he looked
at me straight,

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.980
what with the dark glasses
on, kind of just went,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.080
you know, hey, you and
Charlie have something here.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.136
You should play
with Charlie Moore--

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:37.820
you and Charlie.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.070
And that always stuck with me.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.840
Because he never really gave
me any more in life instruction

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.600
than that, so that
was a big deal.

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.560
JOHN ALBERT: With
you Charlie, I just

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.220
want to know if you can
sort of tell these people--

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.350
your formative years
were in Memphis,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.600
and then you move to Chicago.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.960
And I'm wondering if you
can explain to these people

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.480
why you moved to Chicago
in the first place,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.175
and then if we can talk a little
bit about what you found there?

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:12.920
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: Well, the
only reason I went to Chicago

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.490
was just looking for
a job in a factory,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.410
because that's all I
knew about Chicago.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.360
It was like this
great, big town way

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.220
up north with lots
of factory work

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.810
that paid well and
had lots of benefits.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.680
And friends of mine had
gone up and gotten a job

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.990
and had come back
to visit in a brand

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.330
new, big, red
Oldsmobile or something.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.660
And I kept thinking
about, yeah, I've

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.790
got to get up and get
me one of them jobs.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.200
But I never thought about--

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.580
there was a blues scene there.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.460
Because I'd been told that
all entertainers either

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.740
lived in New York or Hollywood.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.950
So to me, this is just a
big factory town up north.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.460
But when I got there,
boy, did my eyes opened.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.270
JOHN ALBERT: And so you
started going to clubs, right?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.620
And catching all these
artists that you knew about?

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.190
And I'm wondering, at that
time, were those clubs

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.450
fairly segregated?

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.800
And was it odd for
you to be there?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.514
Or was it normal?

00:06:17.514 --> 00:06:19.180
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Well, I had already

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.160
learned how to play
in Memphis and drink.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.900
So it's a common
pastime in Memphis.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.920
But when I got up to Chicago,
I wasn't promoting myself

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.250
or wanting to sit in or--

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.740
I just was hanging out,
and I would request tunes.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.800
And all these guys
thought of me as a fan.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.990
Rarely would you see
any white people.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.800
Sometimes a bunch of kids
from the University of Chicago

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.890
would park as close as they
could to the front door and all

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.590
run in together in a group--

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.960
tight little group,
with their eyes real big

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.315
looking all around real scared.

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:04.630
And I'm sitting at the
bar and thinking, oh no.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.115
Don't come talk to me.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.110
So that was the
beginning of hanging out

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.480
in the blues clubs in Chicago.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.850
JOHN ALBERT: And how did
you go from hanging out

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.790
to actually playing?

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.440
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Well, a waitress

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.660
that I got to know pretty well--

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.480
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
--told Muddy, oh, you

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.950
ought to hear Charlie
play harmonica.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.270
And Muddy was like,
Charlie plays harmonica?

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.780
Well, next thing I know,
he's calling me up to sit in.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.120
And that changed everything.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.280
Because a lot of musicians
hung out at Pepper's Lounge,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.720
which was Muddy's home club
when he wasn't on the road,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.950
because he lived right
around the corner.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.639
And people started
offering me gigs.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.180
They'd say, hey,
come on by Wednesday

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.430
night at it's this place, man.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.610
We can pay you a few bucks.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.830
And, pay me a few bucks?

00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.830
What?

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.690
So that got my
attention because that

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:08.279
was my ticket out of the
factory and my ticket to fun.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.820
JOHN ALBERT: One of
the things that I

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.640
think you guys have in
common at different places

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.610
and at different times
was that you were

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.490
both sort of musical seekers--

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.440
like looking for records,
finding new music.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.730
And Ben, you grew up sort of
amongst musicians-- you know,

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.440
your family was musicians.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.400
You had the Folk Music Center.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.480
But were there records that you
went outside of your comfort

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.530
zone to find?

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.299
I mean, whether it
was like looking--

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.740
whether it was hip hop or
what other genres that you

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.380
went out and looked for?

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.720
BEN HARPER: Yeah, after
mistreating my mom's record

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.730
collection severely, she
bought me a Radio Shack

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.150
realistic turntable--

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.500
I think it had
built-in speakers--

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.810
and gave me a little
lunch money and said,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.534
OK, you've got to go pick
out your own records.

00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:08.950
You've got your
own record player.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.408
Because this is
getting ridiculous.

00:09:10.408 --> 00:09:12.830
My records are all
coming up scratched.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.032
And the first record I
bought was "Smash Hits"

00:09:17.032 --> 00:09:19.240
with the cover of Hendrix
on the front with the three

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.380
different hand positions.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.700
And I don't know what
pulled me to buy it.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.750
I don't know.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.550
What was a nine-year-old
doing buying a Hendrix record?

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.400
But that's what I did.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.800
And that introduced
me to a whole world

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.740
of music, rock and alternative
at that time period.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.960
It was that exploration.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.550
And that was the
cross-pollination

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:50.540
of my love for blues
and rock and roll.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.650
And then in my teenage years,
it was the first wave--

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.080
well, maybe the second wave of
hip hop which was my music--

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.780
that was my voice and my
music from my teenage years

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.855
that represented my
rebellion and my voice.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.050
I caught the tail end
of the Sugarhill Gang,

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.556
which then segued into
all things hip hop--

00:10:14.556 --> 00:10:20.156
you know, EPMD, and Run-DMC, and
Whodini, and the Beastie Boys.

00:10:20.156 --> 00:10:23.200
JOHN ALBERT: And
Charlie, we talked once

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.540
when you were talking about
looking through records--

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.950
like going to like old antique
stores and finding records.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.310
And I'm wondering,
besides the blues,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.800
if there were other
types of music

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.585
that you sort of felt
a relationship with?

00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:42.370
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: Well, I
was just and in these old junk

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.510
stores.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.200
The 78s were like
a nickel or a dime.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.580
And I'm just looking for blues.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.580
But if I saw anything
that looked interesting,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.380
I'd just get that,
too, to take home,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.080
listen to it just to see
what it sounded like.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.280
So I discovered a lot of
music from around the world

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.450
that the scales they were
using reminded me of blues.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.910
And after a while,
I got to realizing

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.510
that maybe every
culture around the world

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.810
has this music of lament about--

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.640
they're all singing
about, my baby left me.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.540
It's a worldwide situation.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.420
So everybody's got
the blues, really.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.930
They might not call it
that in another country,

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.950
but that's what we call it.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.980
It's the same theme, though.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.170
JOHN ALBERT: Yeah, I'm
wondering how these--

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.900
because you both
have like both played

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.350
in different genres of
music and experimented

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.920
with different influences.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.910
And in a record like this,
which is a blues record,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.280
does that still
come into the sound?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: I
guess all my influences,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.130
either consciously
or subconsciously,

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.090
surface from time to time.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.420
That's what happens with me.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.410
I don't know.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.350
That's a good question.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.160
It's hard to say.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.500
JOHN ALBERT: What about you Ben?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.090
BEN HARPER: Yeah, I
think that's a huge piece

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.450
as far as the influence
and other influences

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.910
that you filter
through your voice

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.050
and how it ends up being a part
of your main genre of interest

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.170
or genre of commitment.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.500
In my family's music
store growing up as a kid,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.780
this was before anybody--

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.520
there was no world music.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.910
There was just music from
around the world in the '70s.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.820
And then, as you know--

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.350
you know as well as I
do, that music store

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.220
is an explosion of influence
from music all around the world

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.990
and has been--

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.160
it's our 60th
anniversary this year.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.910
We've had the doors opened
and family run for 60 years--

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.050
five generations working
the cash register--

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.140
me specifically at
the holiday time.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.862
I think people come
into the music store

00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:03.070
and give me a little bit
more abuse because like, oh,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.210
you left town, didn't you?

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.390
So now, you're going
to change the A

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.330
string on my kid's violin.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.574
So there's a certain
mandatory humility

00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:13.990
when I'm back
working in the music

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.740
store around the
holidays, and it's great.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.190
I love it.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.790
But a little bit off
topic, just to say that--

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.980
and literature and
literary references.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.420
I don't quote poetry and
poets and things like that.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.210
But on the shelves
at my house was,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.330
the "Joy of Yiddish" cookbook--

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:44.050
"The Crucible--" the play "The
Crucible," "Arthur Miller,"

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.340
and Alex Haley's "Roots"
would be in a row.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.805
And so that that's
how I grew up.

00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:56.690
JOHN ALBERT: And
so this is like--

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.360
it's a blues record,
but I'm wondering

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.910
if within playing
and doing a record

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.870
that's sort of a
genre record, is there

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.200
some sort of liberating
feel to doing

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.000
that, in terms of creatively?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.620
Like, you don't have to worry
about reinventing something--

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.690
so that it becomes more
of an emotional exercise?

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.440
BEN HARPER: For
me, the blues was

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.120
the music that motivated me,
and inspired me, and hit me

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.290
like a thunderbolt, and
brought me to my instrument,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.230
and set my life's course.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.500
As much as I've been
in throughout so

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.100
many other genres, getting
to work with Charlie,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.866
it's coming home.

00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:43.740
It's where I started.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.780
It's the first music
where I was recognized

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.480
for doing something that
had the chance of possibly

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.200
being unique.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.890
And the blues has a way
of taking care of its own

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:57.600
in that Muddy had Charlie up
on stage in a very special way.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.310
That's a stretch for Mud'
to say, hey, you're with me.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.810
Come on up.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.540
At a young age, I can only
imagine what that would have

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.880
been like for Muddy Waters
to invite you onstage,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.620
irregardless of color,
or culture, or age,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.360
either you can
play or you can't.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.620
And that's what Taj Mahal
did for me when I was a kid.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:25.050
Taj invited me out on tour
when I was a 22-year-old steel

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.747
guitar player.

00:15:25.747 --> 00:15:27.330
And he said, hey,
man, you're with me.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.500
And it's the genre
that discovered me,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.840
and that I discovered,
and it changed my life.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.570
So to work with
Charlie again, it's

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.910
the arrival in full circle--

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.850
place to land.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.580
JOHN ALBERT: I'm wondering-- you
guys have been playing together

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.180
for a while.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.000
And I'm wondering if your
relationship has changed

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.730
and that has affected the music?

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.021
I mean, because you guys have
been friends for a while,

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.650
and you spend a lot
of time together.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.920
And I'm wondering how that is
reflected in this new record,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.602
specifically.

00:16:03.602 --> 00:16:05.060
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Well, any time

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.757
you spend a couple of years
on the road with somebody,

00:16:07.757 --> 00:16:09.465
you're gonna know them
a whole lot better

00:16:09.465 --> 00:16:10.790
at the end of those two years.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.080
BEN HARPER: That's the truth.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.579
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
And a lot of it

00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:16.146
along the way was just
confirming our suspicions.

00:16:16.146 --> 00:16:18.200
BEN HARPER: That's right.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.080
And make no mistake,
nobody ever will know me.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.310
I'm impossible to know.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.560
The only people that
really know me--

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.370
two ex-wives, my wife,
my five kids, my mother,

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.744
and my two brothers are the only
people that will ever know me.

00:16:31.744 --> 00:16:34.160
And I wish it weren't so, and
I wish I weren't so guarded.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.660
It's just who I am.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.780
But outside of that, the
only person that knows me

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.194
is Charlie.

00:16:40.194 --> 00:16:41.068
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:45.520
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: And Ben
knows me like few people,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.306
except Henrietta.

00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:55.820
JOHN ALBERT: And Charlie,
in playing with Ben,

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:02.030
has your actual playing evolved
in your musical relationship

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.339
with him?

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:04.839
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
I like to think

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:10.690
I've been evolving since the
day I started playing as a kid.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.720
And any time I play with--

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.630
if I'm playing with
my own band, I'm

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.630
not going to be learning so much
because they're just backing me

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.460
up, and I'm just
playing what I know.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.310
But when I'm with Ben,
I'm listening to him,

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.420
and I'm sparking off his ideas.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.050
And it's giving me new ideas.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.242
And it's a growth
period, really.

00:17:32.242 --> 00:17:32.950
BEN HARPER: Same.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.750
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: So it's
really exciting on many levels,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.686
but that's one of them.

00:17:37.686 --> 00:17:42.220
JOHN ALBERT: And Ben, in terms
of writing lyrics and writing

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.630
these songs, how is it
different than when you're

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.780
writing a record for yourself,
when you're anticipating

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.370
that this is
something you're going

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.470
to play with the two of you?

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.340
BEN HARPER: When I'm
writing for myself,

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.340
I have as high a
standard as possible.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.030
But you can only elevate
yourself by yourself

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.950
so far and so high.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.450
And hopefully, that's high.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.120
Hopefully that's good enough to
get you to a seat at the table.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.600
But when I'm aiming towards
working and writing around

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.340
Charlie and the
sound of his harp,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.310
it's like All-Star Weekend--

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.680
NBA All-Star.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.250
It's got to be something else.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.310
And again, just
like Charlie said,

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.420
he pushes me to grow
as a lyricist in a way

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.060
that I couldn't otherwise.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.300
JOHN ALBERT: I mean, both of you
guys are incredible musicians,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:42.980
and I think you could
just rely on that.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.970
But what I see in this
record is something

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:50.470
that's really intensely
emotional and personal.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:55.930
And so you've sort of
transcended the playing

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.650
to create something
that has a narrative

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.380
and talks about your lives.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.270
And I think it's interesting.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:11.120
Because neither of you nor
me are particularly young,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.480
so you've lived life.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.610
And it feels like, to
me, that it comes through

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.360
in this record.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.860
And I'm wondering if you can
talk about whether this is

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.160
autobiographical or if it's--

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.770
what it is to you guys--

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.915
what it represents?

00:19:29.915 --> 00:19:30.969
BEN HARPER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:32.010
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: You.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.510
BEN HARPER: Yeah, we have that--

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.914
neither one of us want to
step on each other, so it's--

00:19:36.914 --> 00:19:39.446
yeah.

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:40.820
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
For me, it's

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.910
really exciting because
blues is important to me.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:52.580
It's almost like a philosophy
or way of looking at life.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.670
It's actually more than
just another kind of music.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.100
It's not a fad.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:06.350
And to see it accessible
today and not a rehash of like

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.930
a Muddy Waters tune from 1953,
which a lot of people do--

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.260
and that's OK--

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.000
but it's great, and refreshing,
and means a lot to me

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.540
to see it still get
the core feeling that

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:26.480
makes it real blues, but
it's brand new of today

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.890
and of the 21st century.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.130
And it just means that the blues
is alive and well and tough

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:32.630
as hell.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.750
And you can't kill it.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.822
And it's gonna keep on going.

00:20:35.822 --> 00:20:38.678
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:43.438 --> 00:20:48.180
JOHN ALBERT: Well, I
mean, talk a little bit

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.580
about some of the
lyrics and the songs.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.000
I mean, because there's a
certain sense of reflection

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.660
in these songs.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.785
BEN HARPER: Yeah, for sure.

00:20:58.845 --> 00:21:04.350
There's sight, sound,
taste, touch, scent.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:09.040
Art reminds us that, as human
beings, there is a sixth sense,

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.900
and that's intuition.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.600
And art's supposed to bring
out the best in our intuitions

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.340
as human beings, as
far as I'm concerned.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.890
And the blues-- you
can't fool the blues.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.400
And either it's
blue or it's not.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.090
And this record, lyrically--

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.820
this record exhausted me, Jay.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.780
I've never been lyrically
exhausted in my life.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.360
My second record's done
by the time I get--

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.460
my next record is
usually done by the time

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.390
I'm finished with the
record I'm working on--

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.180
just because it's been
my natural course.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.190
And I never lift
pen up from paper.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.030
I never do.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:51.270
Every conversation I ever have,
every book I ever read, every--

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.640
it's all working its way
into becoming a song.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.880
My life is a song filter--

00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.600
lyrical filter.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:08.370
But this is the first record
that lyrically exhausted me.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.840
I've got nothing
after this one--

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.894
at the moment.

00:22:11.894 --> 00:22:14.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.580
I think we're both probably
sidestepping your question--

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.650
how personal is it.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.580
And if a record's not
personal when you write it,

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.620
it is once you've recorded it.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.410
Everything you say is--

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:32.890
and the danger and the
power in the unconscious--

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.140
are you trying to tell
yourself something?

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.612
Are you reading into the future
about how you want to live

00:22:37.612 --> 00:22:38.695
or where you may be going?

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.740
Blues, when at its best,
is about the past, present,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.460
and the future.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.370
There's not a word
or a syllable in this

00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:02.250
record that hasn't either been
lived or been lived by someone

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.860
incredibly close to me.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.105
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: That
gives you where to go.

00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:08.816
BEN HARPER: OK.

00:23:08.816 --> 00:23:11.080
JOHN ALBERT: Yeah,
I mean it's just--

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.180
there's an intensity,
an emotional intensity

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:18.701
in this record, beyond the
playing, which is noticeable.

00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:20.950
One of the things I want to
ask you about your playing

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.410
is that--

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.225
to go back when I was
talking about influences,

00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:27.100
one of the things that
I hear in your playing

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.270
is there's a phrasing
that, while it's blues,

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.960
like you can hear like
a jazz quality to it.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.690
And I'm wondering, is
that just something

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.975
that comes out of who you are?

00:23:40.975 --> 00:23:42.940
Or is that deliberate?

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.510
Or--?

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.968
I mean, especially,
on this record,

00:23:44.968 --> 00:23:47.760
there's phrasing that's
really fascinating to me.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.770
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Well, that's interesting.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:54.550
I have no idea what I
sound like to anybody else.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.809
So I wish I could put your
head on and listen to myself.

00:23:57.809 --> 00:24:00.100
JOHN ALBERT: I'm sure somebody
here could arrange that.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.462
BEN HARPER: We are at Google.

00:24:03.462 --> 00:24:05.250
JOHN ALBERT: Yeah, we are.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.460
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: But I
listen to all kinds of music--

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.950
gospel-- and growing
up in Memphis.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.450
I heard a lot of rockabilly,
and gospel, and blues,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.730
and it all meant
something to me.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.530
And I listen to a lot
of jazz, especially

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.390
after I got to Chicago.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.500
There was a lot of jazz all
over Chicago on the jukeboxes

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.090
and the blues clubs--

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.990
you know, Jack McDuff
and guys liked that.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.560
And they say it's jazz, but
man, everything they're playing

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.520
is blues, except for
the ballads they did.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.740
Like, Grant Green is
a jazz guitar player,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.140
but many of his riffs--

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.470
they just fit right on
the harmonica perfectly.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:51.516
So I got a lot of ideas
listening to jazz players.

00:24:51.516 --> 00:24:53.890
And a lot of those guys would
come in and sit in with us,

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.110
we'd go sit in with them.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.086
There was a lot of
crossover in Chicago.

00:24:59.086 --> 00:25:02.590
JOHN ALBERT: And both of
you have had these sort

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.960
of fascinating careers.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.620
Because you're not
born out of one

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.750
particular musical movement.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.490
I mean, I'm aware
of like-- you know,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.350
you show up in San
Francisco in the '60s,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.290
and you're playing the
Fillmore, but you're

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:25.630
not a hippie by any means,
but they're responding to you.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.560
And in the same way,
Ben, you've played

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.960
like different types of
music, but you're not

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.610
identified with one thing.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.407
And people-- sometimes I
think they don't really know--

00:25:37.407 --> 00:25:39.490
BEN HARPER: Oh, no, make
no mistake about it, man,

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.910
I am the only living human being
that's opened up for Metallica,

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.860
and Marilyn Manson,
and John Lee Hooker.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.682 --> 00:25:48.265
JOHN ALBERT: That's
an accomplishment.

00:25:48.265 --> 00:25:48.765
Yeah.

00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:50.765
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:53.270
JOHN ALBERT: So
there are benefits.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:59.800
And I'm wondering if that sort
of quality that you both have,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.090
which is that you sort of
transcended particular genres--

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.200
is it a positive?

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.227
Or do you see it as a negative
in how it affects what you do?

00:26:09.227 --> 00:26:11.310
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: I
think it's a huge positive.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.400
If it's a way to pull people in,
and expose them to something,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.290
and treat them to something
new they hadn't heard before,

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.260
it'll be with them for
the rest of their life.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.670
That's the nature of blues.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.310
It'll get you through life.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.192
It's your buddy when you're
up, and it's your comforter

00:26:27.192 --> 00:26:27.900
when you're down.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.184
BEN HARPER: Before I touch
on that in particular,

00:26:35.184 --> 00:26:37.600
do you mind if I just dip back
to the lyrics for a second?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.440
JOHN ALBERT: Yeah, please.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.773
BEN HARPER: I mean, it's hard
to have a lyric that says,

00:26:40.773 --> 00:26:42.670
"There's a price we
pay for the places

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.400
we lay for putting
it all on the line--

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.920
so far down the only sound is
something leaving you behind--"

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.950
like, you can't
write that and not

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.240
have-- you mean what I mean?

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.725
And so it is some personal shit.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.500
You don't have to suffer to
play the blues, but it fuckin'

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.130
helps.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.422
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:06.919
BEN HARPER: So yeah,
damn right it's personal.

00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:08.710
This shit is as personal
as I've ever been.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.360
It's raw.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.190
I may as well burn my
diary, really, in a way.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.140
I mean, it is kind
of that gnarly.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.110
I might as well just walk
on stage every night,

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.450
burn up my life on
pages, and walk off.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.188
But if the blues isn't that,
don't waste anybody's time.

00:27:27.188 --> 00:27:29.646
JOHN ALBERT: Well, how does
that feel to put that out there

00:27:29.646 --> 00:27:29.920
like that?

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.520
BEN HARPER: It's actually--
just rehearsing-- we've

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.230
been rehearsing for
the last three days.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.515
And man, even--

00:27:36.515 --> 00:27:38.130
I'm a shell, dude.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.210
I'm a shell, even just from
rehearsing these songs.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.770
So I've got to pace
myself for sure.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.100
I've got to like eat my
dark leafy greens and my--

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:48.065 --> 00:27:50.210
JOHN ALBERT: And are
there any particular songs

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.190
that feel like--

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.605
that are incredibly
cathartic on this album?

00:27:54.605 --> 00:27:57.860
BEN HARPER: Yeah, "The Bottle
Wins Again--" you know,

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.770
and having to bring
that to the surface

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.540
as far as wrestling
that into submission.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:09.195
You know, I'm a year
sober, which feels great.

00:28:09.195 --> 00:28:14.330
I bought myself a big,
big cake to celebrate.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.470
And all of them, man.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.710
All of them kind of-- they
weigh heavy in their own.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.080
"These days I speak in
whispers, travel lonely to

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.930
and from, come close
you'll see the red

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.010
of a well-bitten tongue."

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.130
My family had to
survive McCarthyism

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.352
and was chased from coast to
coast for not dropping names.

00:28:33.352 --> 00:28:34.810
My grandfather
wouldn't drop names,

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:40.930
so he got fired and chased
after by the powers that

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.360
be and couldn't
stay in the town he

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.960
lived, because he couldn't work
when you're blacklisted, right?

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.510
So that's how I ended up
in Southern California,

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.700
because my grandfather dug
ditches from East Coast

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.640
to West because he couldn't
get a job because he wouldn't

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.210
name names.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.035
So I don't know how I
got onto that, but--

00:29:02.035 --> 00:29:03.020
JOHN ALBERT: It's good.

00:29:05.538 --> 00:29:07.699
I mean, yeah, I mean,
the sense that I get it--

00:29:07.699 --> 00:29:09.490
BEN HARPER: Oh, no, to
finish the thought--

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.040
"These days I speak in whispers,
travel lonely to and from,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.402
come close you'll see the
red of a well-bitten tongue--

00:29:15.402 --> 00:29:17.610
the righteous, the wretched,
the holy and the damned,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.510
is there no mercy in this land?"

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.680
And it is as merciless a time
in sociopolitical history

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.430
as we've been in--

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.590
at least in my lifetime.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.830
So yeah, all of it weighs
heavy in its own way,

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:33.940
as far as being either about
or around what [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.500
going through you hope.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.380
JOHN ALBERT: Well, do
you think that, I mean--

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.610
is it an optimistic record?

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.410
Is there hope in there?

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.546
BEN HARPER: I think even
asking the question,

00:29:45.546 --> 00:29:46.920
"Is there no mercy
in this land?"

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.475
is optimistic because it
reminds us that that should be--

00:29:50.475 --> 00:29:52.020
home of the brave,
land of the free--

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.490
there should be
a third line that

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.145
has something to do with
mercy, as far as I'm concerned.

00:29:56.145 --> 00:30:00.510
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: The
blues is always optimistic.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.930
Even though you might be
talking about times are tough,

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.260
the nature of blues is,
we'll get through this.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:07.980
We can do it.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.760
We're tough.

00:30:11.847 --> 00:30:14.990
JOHN ALBERT: So we should
open it up to questions now.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.000
And we can't really
see out there,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.975
but is there anybody that
has particular questions

00:30:19.975 --> 00:30:20.600
for these guys?

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.830
My grandpa is a big
Johnny Cash fan.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.590
So I understand that you
maybe spent some time together

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.700
in Memphis.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.530
Can you maybe just talk
about the influence

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.050
that listening to
Johnny Cash had on you

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:39.610
and how his style maybe plays
into the work that you've done?

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.490
BEN HARPER: Great question.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.410
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
What was the question?

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.217
JOHN ALBERT: Johnny Cash.

00:30:47.217 --> 00:30:49.050
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
What about Johnny Cash?

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.030
AUDIENCE: Does your
experience listening to him,

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:51.710
growing up around him--

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.126
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: Oh, I
used to see him around Memphis.

00:30:54.126 --> 00:30:56.850
His brother Tommy, we went
to high school together.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.280
Tommy was on the
basketball team.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.690
BEN HARPER: There's a Johnny
and a Tommy Cash in this--

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.424
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:04.424 --> 00:31:06.090
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
And actually, there

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.820
was an older brother named
Roy that had a radio show

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.110
every Saturday for 15 minutes--

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.780
a little hillbilly show.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.550
Anyhow, Johnny would come to
the high school basketball games

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:23.370
to see Tommy along with Dewey
Philips, a local madman DJ.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:31.740
So yeah, I saw a lot of
Johnny at the basketball games

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.000
along with a lot of other local
rockabilly guys and stuff--

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.690
Charlie Feathers and
people liked that.

00:31:40.264 --> 00:31:42.180
JOHN ALBERT: To paraphrase,
was his music ever

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.502
an influence on you?

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:45.210
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Johnny Cash's music?

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:49.700
Oh, I had every thing
he issued on the Sun.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.600
And then when he
moved on to Columbia,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.250
I had everything for a
while, then it kind of--

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.970
But yeah, I was a huge fan.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:03.090
I even recorded a
version of "Big River"

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.770
for what it's worth.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.200
AUDIENCE: Both of
you, as musicians,

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.220
have inspired so many people.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.070
I mean, even just
before we started,

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.520
people were saying how this
song got me through that,

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.040
or like this inspired
me to do that.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.699
As artists, what inspires you

00:32:21.699 --> 00:32:22.740
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: Who?

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.270
Me?

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.549
AUDIENCE: Both of you.

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:27.090
Because your music has been so
inspirational to other people,

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.962
what inspires you?

00:32:28.962 --> 00:32:31.170
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: You
mean like a particular tune,

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.240
or artist, or anything in life?

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.230
AUDIENCE: Anything--
rainbows, music, TV, whatever.

00:32:38.775 --> 00:32:40.875
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Fear inspires me.

00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:41.645
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:44.910
AUDIENCE: That is
a wonderful answer.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.280
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Blues always--

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.490
when I was a little kid,
I was the only child

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.670
of a single mom who would
get up in the morning

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:57.540
when it was dark, and
ride three buses to work,

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.760
and then three buses
home, and it would be dark

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.600
when she got back.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.370
So I was alone all the time.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.070
And when I would hear blues--

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.650
blues is just in
the environment.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.030
It was my comforter.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.425
It made me feel better.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.030
And that's the beginning for me.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.510
The blues helped me
feel OK about myself.

00:33:21.004 --> 00:33:22.920
BEN HARPER: And before
I answer your question,

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.960
if I could just double
back again because--

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.849
AUDIENCE: Sure, sure.

00:33:25.849 --> 00:33:27.390
BEN HARPER: --it is
so conversational

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.550
having known John all my life.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:35.055
But how it's affected me being
as eclectic of a career--

00:33:35.055 --> 00:33:37.040
how that's come into play?

00:33:40.066 --> 00:33:41.440
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.980
It's brought me to
where I am today.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.620
It hasn't been
easy because it's--

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.110
you sidestep-- there's
a certain comfort

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.600
in knowing how an
artist is going to sound

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.120
or how a band is going
to sound from first song

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.480
to last, from one
record to another.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.730
And that's never been for me.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:05.980
So it's made it
super challenging.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.679
But at the end of the day, as
we were discussing on the way

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.889
here, you're just so
fortunate to have people

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:14.199
at all from one
record to another,

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.210
whether you're eclectic or not.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:22.489
So I've always let the
music lead the charge

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:28.567
and celebrated the eclectic
nature of my musical interests.

00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:30.650
JOHN ALBERT: You know, one
of the things I'd add--

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.650
BEN HARPER: Sorry,
[INAUDIBLE],, I'll be right--

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:35.929
JOHN ALBERT: --yeah-- is that,
in collaborating with people--

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:37.190
and especially with Charlie--

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:42.199
it seems to have kept
like an immediacy

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.650
and keeping you
inspired in some way.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.270
So you're not just sort of
doing the same record over

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.210
and different ways.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.540
BEN HARPER: It served
me in that way for sure.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:59.260
And usually, one record
inspires the next in my life,

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.850
but this is the first record
I feel every record I've ever

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.210
made has gone into this one.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.980
JOHN ALBERT: You know, I
would just say, from my point

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.760
of view, I've never seen Ben
as excited about a record

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.930
as this one.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.322
And you've made a few records.

00:35:13.322 --> 00:35:14.030
BEN HARPER: Yeah.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:19.360
JOHN ALBERT: And so I think to
be experiencing that right now

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.277
is--

00:35:20.277 --> 00:35:21.860
I mean, it's a
testament to the record

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.560
and a testament to
the collaboration.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.224
And it's pretty amazing.

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:27.890
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
If you had known me

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.900
as long as you've
known Ben, you'd say,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.170
I've ever seen Charlie
so excited, either.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:33.680
JOHN ALBERT: I'm
aware of that, yes.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:38.720
BEN HARPER: And I would say, for
me, what inspires me to do it

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.590
and to continue to do it is the
communication-- the prospect

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:47.330
of communicating globally as
well as just individually.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.690
To be able to communicate
with you with my pen,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.030
it makes me getting--
so I'm so intimidated

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.297
by a blank page and a full pen.

00:35:55.297 --> 00:35:55.880
Like, darn it!

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.210
The pen's not out of ink.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.370
No excuses.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.850
And to be able to get-- have
this opportunity in a lifetime

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.180
to communicate globally
in the way music offers

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:09.050
the opportunity to do, is--
it's the best part of it.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:14.130
And the pain of your life
that goes into your music--

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.894
I'd say our pain
is your teacher.

00:36:17.894 --> 00:36:19.810
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Does that make sense?

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.360
BEN HARPER: That's fair to say.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.520
But however, there's
a paradox wrapped

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.919
in a conundrum wrapped in a--

00:36:26.919 --> 00:36:28.210
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: An enigma.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:31.660
BEN HARPER: --in
irony, which is,

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.840
I was walking through
the streets of Portugal

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.750
with some friends.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.180
This is when I was
having a moment.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.969
I was recognized in the
streets by 40, 50 people,

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:46.760
and they were all--

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.112
and kids like
pulling on my jacket.

00:36:50.112 --> 00:36:52.070
And they were singing,
"With My Own Two Hands."

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:52.694
I have a song--

00:36:52.694 --> 00:36:55.483
I should never presume
anyone knows what I'm doing.

00:36:55.483 --> 00:36:58.690
There's a song called "With My
Own Two Hands" that I wrote,

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.470
and it's super optimistic.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.065
And there's no song
I'm more proud of.

00:37:03.065 --> 00:37:05.440
And they started singing the
whole song, "With My Own Two

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.320
Hands," and I'm going, wow.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.400
I've really made
a positive impact.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.440
And then it segued.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.450
They went from that song into
a song called "Burn One Down"

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.430
that I've written
about smoking weed.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.382
And then, I went, oh--

00:37:17.382 --> 00:37:18.590
and that one was even louder.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.370
And I went, what have I done?

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.410
So sometimes that
communication is

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:27.890
in conflict-- direct
conflict with itself,

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.815
but it's the communication
component for me.

00:37:29.815 --> 00:37:30.648
AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:31.902
Thank you.

00:37:31.902 --> 00:37:34.870
AUDIENCE: So you guys
mentioned Muddy and Taj

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.870
Mahal as big influences and guys
who kind of brought you along.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:41.860
Curious if you've got any good
stories about younger guys

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.900
you might be particularly
proud of having

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.782
brought along yourselves?

00:37:45.782 --> 00:37:48.400
BEN HARPER: I'd have
to say Jack Johnson.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:54.970
Because I went from seeing him
in the front row of a show,

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:59.430
to getting his demo
tape, to playing

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.790
on one of his first
songs called "Flake,"

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.590
and he must have opened--

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.430
the first shows he ever
played on the world stage

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.670
were opening for myself
and the Innocent Criminals.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.550
And to see him just
launch into the ether

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.260
from that has been a
permanent source of--

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.990
I just feel a certain sense--
whenever I see him doing

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.660
anything great-- and
everything he does is great--

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:30.894
I always take a certain sense
of pride in seeing that.

00:38:30.894 --> 00:38:34.465
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit more about the title track?

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.900
When I heard it, it just
grabbed me at the heart.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.160
And I wanted to get your
insights a little bit more

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.560
about some of the lyrics, and
the power, and the meaning,

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.643
and the message behind it.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:58.090
BEN HARPER: Well,
the song, initially--

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.970
the first verse for the
song was written in honor,

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:06.540
in memoriam of Charlie's mom.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.560
I know Charlie and I--

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.850
I don't want to speak
to something that--

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.070
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: It's OK.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.660
BEN HARPER: But something that
happened in Charlie's life

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.450
affected me to the point
where I had to write it.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.940
And then, the song
spread from that verse

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.110
into what is the song,
"No Mercy in this Land."

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:26.360
And I brought the
song to Charlie

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.670
to check in with him
because it was so heavy,

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:37.040
and it affected me so deeply,
I had to put it on paper.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.450
But it was Charlie's life
that I was writing, so it's--

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.140
you can see where
that's fragile.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:50.000
And Charlie said it was OK.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.800
I mean, he let it live.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.229
He let me do it.

00:39:55.229 --> 00:39:56.520
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: Thank you.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.340
JOHN ALBERT:
Charlie can you talk

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.410
about how-- because
I understand-- like,

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:04.860
you can see that it's a
delicate, sensitive thing,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.580
but what was it like
hearing the lyrics that he

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.830
wrote about that?

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.720
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
Well, I didn't

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.790
want to keep the
death of my mother

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:25.230
and the way she was
murdered buried in me.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.020
Because then, it
would just fester,

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:32.260
I was afraid and have an
effect on me mentally.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.760
So I liked to be able to just
talk about it if the time was

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.630
appropriate.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:42.930
And to have it in a
song really makes it--

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.810
I don't know the word to say--

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.610
special-- there's another
word I want to say,

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.930
but it lets it breathe,
and it puts the sun on it,

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:58.020
and let's it not kill me,
so I can deal with it--

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.860
in a nutshell.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.960
JOHN ALBERT: And was
it always the plan

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.330
to have him sing those lines?

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.310
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE:
No, that was his idea.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:08.121
BEN HARPER: Well, I just--

00:41:08.121 --> 00:41:11.400
it was a bit of a subversive
tactic in that I had the song

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.250
and I just, I said, hey,
Charlie, I've got this song,

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.620
and is there
anything in this song

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.050
that you'd want to sing maybe?

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:23.190
You know, I just kind
of brought it to him.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.850
I didn't make anything of it.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.750
I just presented him the song
when it was done and said,

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:34.260
I'd love to duet this with
you if you're comfortable.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.109
And Charlie just picked his
lines and was, let's get to it.

00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:39.400
CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE: Thank you.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.860
BEN HARPER: Thank
you for letting me--

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.955
letting me write it.

00:41:43.955 --> 00:41:45.970
JOHN ALBERT: Thank
you all for coming.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.310
Thank you guys for doing this.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.643
BEN HARPER: Thank you-- so much.

00:41:48.643 --> 00:41:52.160
[APPLAUSE]
