Hi.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.220
I'm Dan Lavelle from the Google
Play Developer Operations team.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.130
We get a lot of questions from
developers about app visibility

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.820
and search on Google Play.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.370
While we can't reveal every
ingredient in the secret sauce,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.214
I want to cover some tips
to set you up for success.

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:24.880
The first thing you should do is
double-check your configuration

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.710
to make sure your app is
visible to the right audience.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.350
If it's your first
time publishing,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.142
verify that your app is
published, not in draft,

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:34.100
and that it's available
on the Production track

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.460
and not just alpha or beta.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.980
If you previously
pushed your APK

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.540
to the alpha or beta
tracks, click on that track.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.030
Then click the
Move to Prod button

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.840
under Actions for
the version that you

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.476
want to push to production.

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:46.850
Remember, it may
take a few hours

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.750
to see your changes
appear on Google Play.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.309
Next, check your app's
pricing and distribution page

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.600
to make sure you've targeted
all the countries that you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200
want to distribute to.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.015
Click Show Options to verify you
haven't restricted distribution

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.910
to any particular
wireless carrier.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.379
Lastly, you want to determine if
your configuration is excluding

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.730
any devices.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.510
For the APK page under
Supported Devices,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.140
click See List to view the
Device Compatibility list.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.430
By default, you'll
see supported devices.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.470
But you can also filter
the list to see devices

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.660
that are unsupported by your
configuration or devices you've

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.144
manually excluded.

00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:25.060
If your app isn't showing
up in search results

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.460
for a specific device, consider
its feature requirements.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.170
You can see a summary
of APK details

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.380
by clicking on your
APK version number.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.400
The API level, screen layout,
resolution, and other feature

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.730
requirements can often exclude
a user's device automatically.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.190
For example, if you app's
minimum API level is 16-plus,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.642
only uses of Jelly
Bean and above

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:45.100
will see your app
in search results

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.760
when searching Google
Play on their device.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.880
Get as much information
as possible from the user

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.717
when looking into
compatibility issues,

00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:53.800
and make sure you're not
unintentionally excluding

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.590
that device due to your
app's feature requirements.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.020
It may seem like a no-brainer
to create a solid app

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.630
title and description,
but you want

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.400
to make sure that your title
is focused, unique, and avoids

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.080
too many common words.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.590
Your description
should be thorough.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.006
However, the full
text will likely

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:09.979
be truncated under
a Read More button,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.470
so include what's
most attractive

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.890
and valuable to
users above the fold.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.270
Also remember to follow
Google Play content policies

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.780
when creating your
store listing.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.430
Getting more data
about user behavior

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.600
can be critical to
improving your apps.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.690
You can integrate Mobile App
Analytics from Google Analytics

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.770
to get insight
about user behavior,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.180
set up custom campaigns
to judge the effectiveness

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.680
of external marketing
campaigns, and get a better

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.860
understanding of your audience.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.850
Lastly and most importantly,
you should aim to deliver a high

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.470
quality and lasting
experience for users,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.410
deliver regular
updates for your app,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.880
and encourage users to provide
feedback and +1 recommendations

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.114
on Google Play.

00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:49.780
Remember to respond to customers
that have had a bad experience.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.851
It could be the difference in
turning a 1 star review into 5.

00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:56.350
Hopefully some of these tips
help you reach even more users.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.860
But you can always learn more
at the Google Play Android

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.070
Developer Help Center.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.770
Until next time,
I'm Dan Lavelle,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.710
and this has been Play.Bytes.
