00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 in this capsule we will see the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.080
 problem the generalization into 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.760
 learning parents inevitably 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.320
 until now suppose it 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.570
 value functions or functions 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.370
 action value and she presented in son 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.190
 in the form of tables, for example 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.930
 if we did learning tb that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.080
 meant that somewhere but me 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.289
 we had a painting where we had to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.800
 1.0 our estimate of its value for 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.740
 if we had his own estimate for his 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.870
 value is instituted now that's it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.739
 can cause problems 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.070
 the first problem is that if 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.719
 the state space is immense and such 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.399
 that if they generated a chart with 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.379
 all the values ​​for each of the states 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.219
 that would give a huge number 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.239
 it could be that we can afford 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.730
 without memory 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.550
 the second problem that is just as 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.770
 important is that it actually becomes 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.859
 impossible on this representation the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.809
 to generalize to a new state here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.729
 if he has never been visited before by 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.430
 example imagine that we wish 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 develop an agent who plays at heart and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 so in that that if the representation 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.320
 of a state should contain inter alia 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.340
 the formations on the cards of a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 player for example if our player 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.979
 4 'and a king of spades maybe that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.720
 currently other ways our agent 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.600
 felt that the association value is 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.820
 by 10 points now maybe that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 for 4 to 6 1 1 three quarters it if a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.259
 value of 9.9 so this is estimated due to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.840
 makes that their players several parts 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.700
 he observed that when he had 4 to 0 to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.369
 two peaks it gave ten points 1 then 4 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.369
 at 6 1 3 because it gave a value there 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.110
 estimated his share to 9.9 white what 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.909
 which obviously arrives on four 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.740
 years is enough rock who plays anyway 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.009
 a lot of parts but now 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.689
 imagine that I'm coming into a new 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.579
 part I have to make a decision 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.909
 for the case where I actually khatera and 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.290
 body clues and that's a hand 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.420
 I have never had until now 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.330
 how should money be 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.290
 then make an estimate from there 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.610
 then associated with this amazing when 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.800
 also clearly the determining fact 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.360
 it's the fact that there are four to it's 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.210
 really what influences the most 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.120
 possible the high value associated with 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.490
 to have this but then when we would like 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.400
 in fact it is to be able to 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.810
 generalize from observations or 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.850
 I was four years old because this is the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.590
 most important factor 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.390
 so I would like that if I new condition or 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.070
 g4 to sign any other case 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 I would like so much less to have a 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.020
 rough estimate of its value in 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.390
 just returning a value enough 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.120
 high just due to the fact that I'm 4 years old 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.040
 in this case now then to do 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.320
 that what we are going to do is we are going 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.420
 replace the table with values 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.910
 individual for each of the states by 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.430
 actually a linear function that goes 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.920
 try to approach but eventually my 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.540
 table that I could have used if 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.730
 maybe I had to love myself dead or if 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.230
 was not too much state then that I 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.820
 could make sure to have visited all 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.970
 the states at this time so I'm going 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:25.800
 replace my empty table with a 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.450
 linear function that will take that goes 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.970
 represent a state with multiple 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.560
 characteristics that i will noted f2i s 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.350
 escapes that one of its features 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.640
 their vote to write an aspect a 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.440
 property of my state and to make a 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.769
 estimate of the videos is felt I 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.690
 will have a set of parameters that 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.910
 will multiply my characteristics 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.250
 so I'm going to have a linear function 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.670
 who will take a state is what will 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.090
 calculate all its characteristics and 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.550
 who will associate who will calculate or 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.470
 estimate the value for this summer you have there 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.390
 by multiplying each of 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.959
 characteristics by the parameters and 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.060
 a1 and a2 up to tétouan m or internet 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.239
 the number of features then do 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.820
 the sum therefore says otherwise 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.070
 my life estimate is going to be 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.739
 a linear transformation by mastered 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.789
 by my state settings of my vector 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.410
 from f1 to f 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:29.550
 an example of characteristics 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.310
 for poker so f for example Thursday 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.950
 a movie it could be f10 one of 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.310
 features to be from 1 6s 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.040
 corresponds to a hand with 4 to 0 otherwise 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.550
 so that the head to associate with 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.180
 this function tames it is 6th cfdt 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.480
 rate is your some way a score 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.880
 associated with having four aces in 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.710
 his hand because I'm having a liver 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.350
 head to break from 10 to really be 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.770
 the figure that will fit left that goes 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.100
 influence the value of my state if I have 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.700
 actually four to ten in the year 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.080
 so learning has been transformed into 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.080
 of learning we will find the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.940
 value of established parameters such as 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.340
 tea life you voted close your belongings 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:27.920
 to approximate the true function of their lives 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:30.540
 of s then for learning ding 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.180
 so how are we going to adapt our 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.650
 parameters is that we're actually going 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.330
 take a very similar yes approach 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.210
 at the guardian descent 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.610
 so we look at the rule 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:45.450
 of tv learning we see that it's in 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.000
 do my life value ds I'm going to 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.460
 change by taking my current values ​​+1 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.700
 early learning times a species of 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.940
 two factors here a delta that tell me 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.190
 it must increase or decrease my value 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.290
 speed but his record could 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.270
 interpret it as the deltas that 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.610
 I had in the neural networks to 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.280
 know the delta world that would be 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.190
 basically the equivalent of less 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.440
 the partial db versus a cost that 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.730
 I try to optimize the flow 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.820
 partial of a stroke that I try 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.850
 to optimize compared to screw them is 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.710
 now empty es in my approach where 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.130
 mobilized by a function 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.919
 linear low speed depends on my 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.070
 parameters t2i so what I could 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.139
 to do is actually spread this gradient 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.610
 cement 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.090
 this term there that I consider as 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.610
 ingredient to get a gradient or 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.800
 partial derivatives compared to the teil 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.139
 and dense that if I do the math it's going 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.960
 to be just my term that I have here 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:51.689
 who this one here but where I just put 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.449
 the rates to properly indicate if I 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:57.180
 hate to say that 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:00.120
 corresponds to my function estimated value 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.889
 by the transformation so there is 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.400
 I love this world and twice 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.449
 ben the value of the feature that 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.750
 multiply head 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:13.710
 i f2i is what we see that it is very 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.029
 similar in form to example 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.740
 of learning in regression 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:21.599
 logistics where I have a delta xxy and that 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.449
 that's what the game has to do to 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:28.229
 update my my settings are 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:30.000
 noted w he in the slides on the 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:32.060
 logistic regression so the summer rate 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.469
 is a bit like the double empty 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.889
 we are cured of learning in the 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:40.620
 deposits so previous and will end 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:43.740
 to the film but we just got 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.259
 drift and partial of the output of my 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.879
 calculation for my estimation of the 2nd by 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:49.050
 compared to your tons actually 

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:51.270
 since it is a mineral function 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:56.399
 was simply f girl so the term 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:58.050
 which multiplies t tons we can do the 

00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:00.899
 same for the quiou learning 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:06.000
 but in this case we will rather estimate 

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:07.800
 our action function value when 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.389
 it's once again a transformation 

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.810
 lunar characteristics but in this 

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:14.159
 here my features that I have here 

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.889
 it's going to be characteristics that 

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:20.610
 describe a property of my state and 

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:21.270
 a possible action so fds to that for 

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.319
 is equal to 1 

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:27.479
 if my hand is four years old and 

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:30.810
 that action that I consider these of 

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:33.149
 would do so in this case head to 

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.169
 1 it would be a kind of scor associated with 

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:37.740
 do the action at orly 

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:38.969
 if I have a hand with four years and 

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.140
 again I used it even 

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:42.320
 approach to der wien rough 

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.630
 learning in the body or 

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.600
 I use an approximate function 

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.820
 linear like this here to model my 

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.190
 function that in this case I'm going 

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.380
 interpret this term there as a drift 

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.360
 and partial - the partial drift of a 

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.460
 blow compared to the output of the 

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.290
 function that i'm going to multiply his 

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.650
 part drift and partial of my 

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:07.250
 function as compared to a hyper m 

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.660
 head on there is one combines with the function 

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.660
 so also clearly the derogatory 

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:19.310
 partial ass compared for example 

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:23.870
 you are you have a brain tf1 if hideous gdf 

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:26.060
 so that's going to be the rule of setting 

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.320
 day for my settings and yes I 

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:31.730
 would apply it for each of 

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:34.550
 parameters of tons for the near 

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.080
 parent adaptive dynamic pressure 

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.840
 in this case what we value is 

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.700
 rather my transition model 

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.090
 I'm going to I just mention this 

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.740
 quickly so it's possible 

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.570
 to use the near by the primature of 

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.840
 function to generalize new 

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.550
 states by modeling my distribution 

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.460
 conditional like that as being 

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.010
 the exponential one more time of a 

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:01.220
 linear function of features or 

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.750
 there but characteristic describe a 

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.630
 spirit pair 

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.770
 an action while I will do this game 

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.990
 takes the exponential because the 

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.760
 politics must be positive alas this 

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.490
 time they would be proportional to 

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.560
 all these terms here here so another 

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.200
 way to see that is to say that in 

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:22.090
 do I have a tie here here I 

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:25.910
 should have a 

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:29.600
 I will have a tie here and then here I 

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:31.190
 divide by the sum on all 

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.580
 possible values ​​of these spirits 

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:37.070
 maurice of the numerator and so I 

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:40.520
 would finally normalize my numerator 

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.140
 russia for his week in this case too 

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.810
 in video it basically corresponds 

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.810
 learning is being denied or to 

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.210
 every time I observe that from 

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:52.610
 the state in the state s 

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:54.740
 when I do the action did a 

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.980
 transition to a spirit but I can 

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.630
 Finals in shape 

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.330
 still exists there as the problem 

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:04.080
 to predict spirits from hesse and 

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:06.330
 so it's possible I'll show it 

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.950
 not here I like you can watch 

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.550
 in the book and then the references in 

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:13.140
 is to have more details but 

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.110
 so woven possible to define a shot 

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.820
 drift well ingredients for 

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:20.610
 lead my site settings and 

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.620
 introduced a style and there is also 

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.420
 a way to do the same thing so 

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:28.290
 to have an approximate function 

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:30.930
 for in the course of looking for 

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.940
 political plants so of parts and 

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:36.720
 controlled in fact but political 

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:38.220
 finally and for that it's a concept 

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.990
 which is a little bit more notions 

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.790
 before if you're interested invites you to 

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.790
 consult section 20h points 5 

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:50.220
 then an example of application of the 

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.780
 generalization with apprentices 

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.210
 function matters 

00:11:51.780 --> 00:12:01.140
 so it's a very beautiful illustration 

00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:04.020
 did this was demonstrated by toro in the 

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.640
 development of nest to pot the bagad 

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.750
 so that's described in more detail 

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.760
 in the ip if you want to have some 

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.430
 references among other lots that describes 

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.350
 in detail how did that 

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:16.590
 been doing the system in question was 

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:21.090
 baptized ligaments inclined when so 

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:22.110
 it was to model the function our 

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.180
 function of values ​​or actions of 

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.100
 value using a neural network 

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.140
 so rather than using a function 

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.530
 linear as I write them up 

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.050
 now 

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.930
 we could also do the approximation 

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:39.930
 be a function of the 2nd or a 

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:41.580
 function the ass values ​​what is it 

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.080
 could model it as the 

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.200
 out of a network of neurons since 

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.760
 finally take the deltas the 

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.010
 spread across the entire network 

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.630
 so if that gives then some of the 

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.550
 same way that a class ferline rc - 

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.800
 and then five reasons to make that 

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.330
 gives if actually a modeling of the 

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.630
 tank function at the time my function 

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:03.000
 of allers more powerful than a 

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.590
 mining function had initially 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.570
 when they are interested in developing 

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.910
 an ia for backgammon 

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:11.100
 they started with an approach 

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:13.710
 they asked experts to provide 

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.630
 targets after saying explicitly for 

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.790
 the function of the time when the function 

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.020
 covered in dances only if a movie there 

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:23.700
 approached they used a 

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:26.040
 approach with colors and threads 

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.810
 so they asked for a state of the 

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.880
 party was giving an action possibly 

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.220
 experts to give a value according to 

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.500
 a relative value of associated with 

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.450
 carry out a coordinated action for a 

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.290
 eto'o is 

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.850
 but it turns out that it's still 

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.830
 really made here for an expert 

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.780
 to associate like that a real value 

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.990
 between currencies ends up more infinite for 

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:48.300
 a state a given action and the result 

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.190
 is that it gave a player who 

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.350
 was competitive account computers 

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.050
 the other automated systems in this 

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.670
 talent but not against humans 

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.200
 the second approach they followed 

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.700
 later it's learning 

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.680
 by a reinforcement they made a 

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.020
 variant of learning and and 

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.030
 assets or the function of values ​​and and 

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:10.260
 brings here but with a network of 

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:12.690
 neurons and they actually cause the 

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.050
 neural network played against him 

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.060
 even 

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.740
 so if it allowed the network to come in 

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.060
 to make a name but ends up part because 

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.600
 that he never had to play against 

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.680
 add and play against him even this 

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.150
 what I mean in fact is that 

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.580
 it was the same network of neurons that 

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.740
 finally dictate to both players 

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.320
 what specific actions and since the 

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.960
 solve we did not really 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.730
 of interest has favored a player more than 

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.130
 the other in the end we will have you 

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.590
 can learn from the result of the 

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.750
 part of the gaming experience of the two 

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.990
 players at the same time and so they have 

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:49.650
 actually train the neural network with 

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:52.410
 learning the assets on 30000 

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.300
 part is this it gave after several 

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.780
 iterations and then a modification of the 

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.580
 system 

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.960
 a player who was competitive by 

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.400
 report actually to the top three 

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.870
 players in the world 

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.910
 it will be a very nice success in 

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.580
 learning parents necessarily based 

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.050
 on the apprentice mater of function which 

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.590
 based inter alia on a network of 

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.720
 neurons and for more details 

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:15.060
 I invite you to consult book which 

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.170
 gives some city references more than 

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.170
 details on this approach
