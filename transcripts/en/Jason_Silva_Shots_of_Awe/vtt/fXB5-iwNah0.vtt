This episode of Shots of Awe
is brought to you by Norton.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.970
So you hear a lot of talk these
days about the "Quantified

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.420
Self" Revolution.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.130
Everything's being tracked.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.730
We have metrics for everything.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.300
We're extending sensors
into everything.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.760
And all of a sudden
creating an influx of data.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.520
So everything's tracked online.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.120
Now everything is
tracked in our body.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.075
We live in a world in
which human beings have

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:42.650
been reduced-- have been turned
into algorithmic cascades

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.760
of data.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.660
And most people are
terrified of this notion,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.880
of infinite tracking.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.040
But I think the "Quantified
Self" Revolution potentially

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.495
can reveal us to ourselves.

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.674
It can become the
ultimate mirror.

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:55.090
Because you know
what happens with

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.950
those algorithmic cascades?

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.700
These observers,
human beings, will now

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.440
be able to see
themselves as structures,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.340
as patterns amidst the data.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.980
We'll be able to take data
sets of millions of people,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.650
measuring millions
of metrics of data,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.850
and find patterns, and find
spaces of interconnection,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.790
and find emergent
self-organization that

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.970
is occurring on
these mega-patterns.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.425
And then these different scales.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.690
We'll get what Steven
Johnson calls the long view.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.520
We'll get the equivalent of
the microscope or the telescope

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.140
for units of information
for data sets.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.920
Who knows what we might
learn about ourselves?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.290
How might we be able
to take that data,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.110
and use those insights to
feed them back into us, right?

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.080
Creating that affect of
moment of ontological design,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.250
where that information
access feedback

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.430
that further changes
how we act, and changes

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.060
how we optimize the
world and society.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.950
The "Quantified Self"
Revolution is an upgrade

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.280
for this operating system, this
man-machine operating system.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.280
It's human's versions 2.0
That's quantified self.
