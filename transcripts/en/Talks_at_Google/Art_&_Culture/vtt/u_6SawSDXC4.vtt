JORDAN HYATT: Good afternoon,
welcome to "Talks at Google."

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.920
My name is Jordan Hyatt, from
the Google Automotive team,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.430

to have Heartbeat--

[CHEERING]

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.820
--opera here with us today.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.370
This is the first
time we've ever

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.640
hosted an opera
troupe at Google NYC,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.280
and we're very excited about it.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.610
My partner and fellow
Googler, Peter Dolchin, and I

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.400
were introduced to Heartbeat
just a few years ago.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.150
And even though we're not
necessarily opera fans,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.880
we were blown away by the
Heartbeat Opera team's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.520
creativity and
passionate approach

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.050
to bring opera to a whole
new generation of people.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.410
Please give a warm welcome
to the co-music director

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.920
Dan Schlosberg and
soprano Kelly Griffin

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.309
for the first performance,
an aria from "Tosca."

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.820
My name is Jacob Ashworth.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.780
I am the other co-music
director, with Dan.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.685
And I wanted to introduce you
to our next singer, Samarie

00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:40.600
Alicea, who will be doing
a number from Rossini's

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.380
"The Barber of Seville."

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.620
This is where Rosina has heard
her lover outside the window.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.450
And she hears his
voice and she knows

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.200
that she is going to be
able to make him hers.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.150
I will make you
mine and I am going

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.260
to be perfectly obedient, no
worries-- gentle, absolutely.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.040
She's a total firecracker.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.051
And if anybody is
going to cross her,

00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:06.300
they will find out that she
can also be quite a viper.

going to take you

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.900

they had a couple of months

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.440
ago in Brooklyn.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.264

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.060
So I'm Peter Dolchin from
the Global Partnerships team.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.130
Thank you again for taking
the time to come out

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.900
and experience and learn
more about Heartbeat Opera.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.810
The talent onstage
and behind the scenes

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.910
are extremely impressive.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.580
They dedicate so much
time, effort, and energy

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.840
to this movement.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.510
And I'm really excited for us to
learn more about who they are,

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.770
how they've chosen this art--

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.470
many may say that
it's chosen them--

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.320
and what it's like to
produce and perform

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.290
in this more unconventional
and emerging genre?

So with that, I'd
like to introduce--

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.730
or have you
introduce yourselves.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.430
of Heartbeat Opera.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.212
And I'm also a freelance
director of opera and theater.

I'm the producing director
of Heartbeat Opera.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.840
And I guess I'm a
freelance producer also,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.231

met Dan and me before.

But we're the
co-music directors.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.200
And I also run the
ensemble Cantata Profana,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.290
which is sort of our president
ensemble for Heartbeat.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.980
And I also am a

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.810
PETER DOLCHIN: Great,
thank you, guys.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.420
So I'm just going
to throw this out

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.980
for whoever wants
to answer it first,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.950
but how did this all come about?

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.190
Not just Heartbeat Opera,
but your initial interest

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.550
in opera and in music,
and the passion around it,

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:22.510
and how did it blossom into the
formation of Heartbeat Opera?

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.560
ETHAN HEARD: Well, we're all
performers, or were originally.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.260
Louisa Jacob and I actually sang
as kids in opera productions.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.840
I was in DC, Louise in
Berlin, Jacob in New York.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.450
Jacob was the star of New York
City Opera as a boy soprano.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:45.510
So our opera roots are
deep and we met at Yale.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.520
Louise and I were in
a drama school class

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.530
called Opera Practicum,
where we worked

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.920
with singers in the Yale opera
program for about eight weeks.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.890
And it was this really
delicious workshop setting,

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.270
where we got to tackle
classic scenes in fresh

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.220
and sort of edgy ways.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.819
And we wanted to bring that
kind of exploration to New York.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.339
LOUISA PROSKE:
Yeah, and when you

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.440
go to the Met, which is
a beautiful and unique

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.319
experience, you're
often a football field

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.849
away from the singers.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:18.000
And so what we experienced
in this class at Yale

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.180
was if you're four
feet, 10 feet,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.920
two feet away from
the singer, there's

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.339
a different experience of
opera that you can have,

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.440
where you kind of start
to feel the vibrations

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.680
of these amazing voices on
your skin and in your bones.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.440
And it really does
something physical to you

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.040
beyond the sort of intellectual
appreciation of opera

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.700
that we thought we could
bring to New York, that's

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.927
something unique that you
could never have at the Met.

00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:46.260
PETER DOLCHIN: And Jen, I
know you joined the core group

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.522
a little bit after.

00:17:47.522 --> 00:17:49.980
Will you just tell us a little
bit about how that happened?

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.313
JENNIFER NEWMAN: Sure, so
Heartbeat was formed, I think,

00:17:52.313 --> 00:17:54.030
about a year before I joined on.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.390
And they had had their first
time out with an audience

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.120
and creating for the first
time and realized, oh, this

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.660
is something we
want to keep doing.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.730
We want more of this.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.230
And at that point,
they were looking

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.790
for someone who could sort of
be more of a big picture person

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.550
to help usher along their
work as it moved forward.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.720
And I was just coming back
from managing a larger company,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.240
but in China, for about
a year and a half,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.870
and was looking to get my hands
back in once I landed back

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.480
in New York.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.200
And so I watched a little bit
of their work and was really

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.940
excited by the sort of
viscerality of the work,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.590
the intimacy of the work,
and also that it wasn't--

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.800
that didn't feel stayed.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.900
That it felt fresh, and so
that really attracted me

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.900
and so I said, absolutely, I
would like to join you guys.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.190
So as a producer, I
think I look at work--

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.180
I come from a dance background,
but work in all manners of art,

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.770
and so I do look for that
sort of energy exchange.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.990
And that's one of the
things that I really

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.484
liked about Harvey.

00:18:57.484 --> 00:18:58.446
PETER DOLCHIN: Great.

00:18:58.446 --> 00:19:02.850
Show of hands, how many people
have been to an opera before?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.599
Wow, cultured group.

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:07.140
That's great.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.015
DAN SCHLOSBERG: Sold.

00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:09.630
PETER DOLCHIN: So
you were talking

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.340
a little bit about
how different this

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.450
is from the traditional
opera houses.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.790
What do you sort
of try to preserve

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.800
that exists in the
traditional opera houses,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.640
and where are you really
trying to change things up?

00:19:25.328 --> 00:19:28.420
DAN SCHLOSBERG: I
guess I'll start.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.260
This is our mission.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.850
We like to say that we
have a healthy balance

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:38.260
of both reverence
and irreverence,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.540
as you saw in some
of the photographs.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:46.210
We often take
drastic steps to make

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.410
an opera that has been performed
the same way for hundreds

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.430
of years something of our own.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.190
And for example,
two years ago, we

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.520
did Lucia di Lammermoor
and Louisa directed.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.760
And we set the whole opera,
essentially, in a sanatorium,

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.020
and the leading character
was a crazy person.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.090
There's a famous
mad scene in it.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.719
And part of what I do is
create new orchestrations

00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:17.260
of the opera.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.610
We do not have the privilege
of a 80-person orchestra,

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.630
so I reduce the music.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.650
And in this case, I added lots
of percussion and toy piano

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.810
to create this world
of her imagination

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.509
as she's kind of descending
into her craziness.

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:37.300
JACOB ASHWORTH: And
just those arrangements

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.508
that Dan does are something
that I think we found out

00:20:39.508 --> 00:20:42.880
along the way, not having an
80-person orchestra is actually

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.130
one of the things we like
most about this company.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.016
And it's something that
we started probably trying

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:50.890
to sort of approximate
that as best we could,

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.560
and then Dan with
this [AUDIO OUT]

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.360
said, well, what if we do
something completely different?

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.510
And that's kind of become
our MO since then--

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.630
trying to use the
means that we have

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.130
and the resources that we have
to do something that a bigger

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.830
company couldn't do.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.160
ETHAN HEARD: I think there's
sort of the stereotype of opera

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.450
being for the elite, or the
super-educated, or the rich,

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.630
and Heartbeat's mission
is very much about making

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.670
it a popular art form again.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.110
We love it as this
sort of coming together

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.970
of all performing arts--

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.950
dance, singing, drama, text.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.990
And I like to imagine that
high schooler who has never

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.880
been to an opera before
when I'm creating a piece,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.130
and thinking about,
OK, how do we make

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.920
this story accessible to
them, and also fun and sexy,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.550
and bringing it sort of down off
of its pedestal a little bit?

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.930
So our drag show, we now
do an annual Halloween drag

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.740
extravaganza, and it's become
our kind of calling card.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.840
We've done it two years
at National Sawdust, now,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.070
in Williamsburg.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.190
And we like to call it our kind
of gateway drug for someone,

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.600
for an opera virgin who
maybe has never felt

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.360
invited into that experience.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.530
And we want it to be
not only a costume party

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:19.270
and a celebration, but
a sort of sneak peek

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.314
at what our work is all about.

00:22:22.314 --> 00:22:23.980
PETER DOLCHIN: We
were certainly virgins

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.490
when we first checked it out.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.290
So Heartbeat Opera
has been called,

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.460
by Alex Ross from "The New
Yorker," "a radical endeavor

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.860
for taking classic
operas and mixing it

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.220
with unconventional
orchestrations and stagings."

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.750
Tell us about the process you
go through to produce a show?

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.950
How do you go about selecting
the show, the talent,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.770
the location, the set
design, the choreography,

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.870
the orchestration?

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:57.250
How much time does it take and
how much help do you guys have?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.280
I know not very much, so--

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.780
LOUISA PROSKE: Well, I'll start
and then maybe somebody else

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.680
can take over.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.900
So throughout the
year, it's really

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.440
the five of us with maybe two
or three other people running

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.200
the company.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.680
But then come
February, March, when

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.330
we are gearing up
for our festival,

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.360
which this year is in the
first two weeks of May,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.164
the company sort of grows
and we have over 70 people

00:23:20.164 --> 00:23:20.830
working with us.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.240
So suddenly, we become a
quite large organization.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.670
But it all starts,
actually, in the summer

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.910
when we go on retreat together
and we put all of the pieces

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.560
that we love on the table.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.560
And we sort to start a
debate about which one would

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.230
make a good Heartbeat show.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.410
And there's a lot of things to
consider like the cast sizes,

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:45.040
whether it makes sense, or is
exciting to cut this piece down

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.680
to about 90 minutes, which
is how long our shows are?

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.630
PETER DOLCHIN: And
typical shows tend to be--

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.000
LOUISA PROSKE: I mean, opera
is often two and a half,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.070
three, four hours--
five hours, if you're

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.120
talking Wagner, right?

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.264
So one of our signatures is
that we make the pieces shorter.

00:23:59.264 --> 00:24:01.180
But we don't just-- it's
not just a reduction,

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.760
we actually often
rearrange the story lines

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.730
and sort of tell the
story through a new lens

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.850
that we conceive of so
that it feels modern

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.895
and now and relevant.

00:24:12.895 --> 00:24:15.520
JACOB ASHWORTH: And I think when
we're choosing our repertoire,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.520
we put a huge amount
of work all year long

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.976
into, basically, one drag
Halloween extravaganza and two

00:24:23.976 --> 00:24:25.350
productions of
opera, so you have

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.058
to choose really wisely
what you're going

00:24:27.058 --> 00:24:29.770
to put all of that effort into.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.650
And as much as we do
love going to the Met

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.560
to see sort of
whatever's on, there's

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.060
plenty of operas that wouldn't
really take to an adaptation,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.520
and you can't really
make them relevant today,

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.450
or the libretto is
just really poor.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.710
And there is that in opera,
and so we choose wisely,

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.290
but it's also about sort
of taking these pieces that

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.050
might have been incredibly
exciting in their time,

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.470
and we feel maybe have
gotten a little stale.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.560
But there's something at the
heart of them that we love.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.990
We have we have to come to
these pieces out of love,

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.156
or else we would never be
able to put this much work

00:25:06.156 --> 00:25:09.150
into them, and then
try to create something

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.950
over the course of the season,
over the course of the year

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.912
in along germination process.

00:25:14.912 --> 00:25:16.620
ETHAN HEARD: More and
more, I'm realizing

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.920
that being a leader of
an arts organization

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.690
is all about team
building, and it's

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.480
about choosing great
people and helping

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.300
them do their best work.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.090
So the next step in the
process once the shows have

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.999
been selected, is saying, OK,
who's going to design the set?

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.040
Who's doing the lighting?

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.360
Who are we casting?

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.660
And what's been really beautiful
about Heartbeat's growth

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.120
is that we have collaborators
that we return to

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.920
again and again.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.580
So we have 10 core
associate artists now.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.020
We have designers
that have worked

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.900
on pretty much every
piece we've done.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.490
We've had singers who've
come back again and again.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.500
So that team and
that community allows

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:03.180
us to work more quickly
and more deeply,

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.787
just out of trust
and out of love.

00:26:06.787 --> 00:26:08.370
LOUISA PROSKE: One
of the challenges--

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.550
I mean, all of us are also
freelance artists in New York--

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.900
is that your life can
become very segmented.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.580
You work for three
weeks here, you

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.070
work at this regional
theater for four weeks there.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.030
You go and do a show on
the West Coast for a month.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.860
And it's always with different
teams, with different casts,

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.800
with different artistic
directors, so it's a pretty--

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.860
in theater, you get very
intense very quickly in the room

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.500
because it's very personal
work, and then after four weeks,

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.380
it's over and you maybe
never see the people again.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.860
So building a company,
for us, is really

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.290
to find that
continuity that's so

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.200
important in making
art and having history

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.090
with your collaborators.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.060
And when you're doing the
fifth, sixth, seventh project

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.200
together, you just get
to a different plane.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.700
PETER DOLCHIN: I think there
are similarities and parallels.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.570
Clearly we're doing different
work here at Google,

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.180
but I think having
trust in a team

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.420
and collaborating and working
on different aspects of it

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.060
so that we all come
together, is very similar.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.740
So it's just pointing
that out because I

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.930
think it's interesting that
we do something so very

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.471
different than you,
but there's still

00:27:11.471 --> 00:27:17.340
a lot of core similarities and
paradigms that we both share.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.910
When it comes to the work,
what's the most rewarding

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.775
and what's the most
challenging aspects of this?

00:27:25.775 --> 00:27:28.200
JENNIFER NEWMAN: Huh--
who wants to take that?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.770
We're going to be really
superficial on this answer--

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:32.030
no, just kidding.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.370
I think that
rewarding is, for me,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.000
always about the work being put
on stage and audiences getting

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.510
to see it.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.980
I mean, that's the
exchange, right?

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.646
And I think in the
last couple of years,

00:27:41.646 --> 00:27:44.870
we've developed a program
where every performance

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:49.110
we offer 10 free seats to
students in the New York area

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.020
who have never
seen opera before.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.020
And so one of the biggest
rewards to us last year

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.240
was that we had
almost 100 students

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.520
at some point throughout
the season get to see opera,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.530
and then they were
interviewed afterward.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.460
And to hear their words after,
to say that, oh, I got it.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.200
I thought I was
going to walk in here

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.400
and not get it, or
not feel anything.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.240
And then they were able to sort
of recount their experience

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.224
through the opera, and that
was, for us, like, yes, we're

00:28:14.224 --> 00:28:15.140
doing something right.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.640
That's exactly what
we wanted to do.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.350
So that was super
rewarding for us.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.275
And personally, the
challenge is always time,

00:28:21.275 --> 00:28:23.316
and I think you guys can
probably relate to that.

00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:25.370
There's just never enough time.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:29.584
Like we certainly are operating
in a space of non-human hours,

00:28:29.584 --> 00:28:30.750
I think, at a certain point.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.270
And we're just like,
there's more than 24 hours

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:32.895
in a day right?

00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:33.789
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:34.330
I don't know.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:34.914
That's for me.

00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:37.371
DAN SCHLOSBERG: I just want
to-- we'll probably get to this

00:28:37.371 --> 00:28:39.440
in a second, but for
on the reward side,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.560
which is much easier
to talk about--

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.300
just to reach that
opera can have.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.100
It's so easy to
just be caught up

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.740
in your insular New
York arts, especially

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.140
in the arts community.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.690
But Ethan and I just went
on a trip to the Midwest

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.310
in our production
of "Fidelio," which

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.040
you'll hear an excerpt
from in a few minutes.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.140
We're collaborating
with six prison choirs

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.950
and we were able to visit four
of them over the past week.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.630
And just to see the
love and the humanity

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.320
that a project like this,
and singing in general,

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.660
can evoke and can
produce in people,

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:26.560
really reminds you of the
power of this kind of music.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.090
PETER DOLCHIN: So
touching on that,

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.000
what inspired you to select
"Don Giovanni" and "Fidelio"

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.830
for the upcoming
spring festivals,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.130
and where and when are
they taking place--

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.113
a little plug?

00:29:38.113 --> 00:29:40.420
LOUISA PROSKE: Do
you want to talk--

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.950
JACOB ASHWORTH:
Sure, so we knew we

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:48.570
chose these for so many reasons,
but "Fidelio" is particularly,

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:50.832
as Dan has said,
we're setting it--

00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:52.790
I'll let Ethan talk about
it a little bit more,

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.540
he's directing it.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.810
But we're setting in
very current situation

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.490
that's very relevant.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:04.167
And the "Don Giovanni" is one
of the richest pieces of music

00:30:04.167 --> 00:30:04.750
that there is.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.600
And we felt like we're
here, we're at season four.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.260
We're ready to take
this on and to try

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.890
to tackle this
piece which probably

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.490
has the most complicated sort
of texture of characters,

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:21.430
and especially sexuality,
which is just--

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.650
there's characters
in this opera that

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.800
have become the archetypes
that we now refer to,

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.190
but they originated here.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.940
It's the best crucible for all
of these different characters.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.470
And so those two as a pairing
sort of made sense to us.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.590
They're both from this
sort of similar time,

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.810
revolutionary ideas
in both of them

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.080
that seem to be coming
back to us now in 2018,

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.774
and newly relevant.

00:30:50.774 --> 00:30:52.190
PETER DOLCHIN: And
when and where?

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.830
JACOB ASHWORTH: Oh, go for it.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.246
ETHAN HEARD: Do you want to
say more about "Don Giovanni"?

00:30:56.246 --> 00:30:57.830
LOUISA PROSKE: Yeah,
I mean, I would

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.080
say is that maybe something
we haven't really stressed

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.460
is that Ethan and I, our roots
are in music because were

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.380
both child performers
in opera, but we're

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.790
trained theater directors.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.660
We both went to the
Yale School of Drama

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.890
and we really learned all
about directing actors.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.610
And so we bring that
passion and meticulousness

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.570
of working with performers
to opera, where often,

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.790
singers are treated
more like musicians.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.790
They go on stage and they sing,
but there's not necessarily

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.200
that sort of preciseness
of the acting vocabulary

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.050
that you would bring to theater,
and we merge those two things.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.100
And for me, Mozart is just
one of the best writers

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.830
of character and
psychology, and so diving

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.070
into these seven people
in "Don Giovanni"

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.900
is just such a
treat as a director

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.089
because there's so
much to draw on.

00:31:49.089 --> 00:31:51.380
ETHAN HEARD: Just to talk a
little bit about "Fidelio,"

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.560
it's Beethoven's
one opera, and it's

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.240
about a woman who disguises
herself and infiltrates

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.850
the prison where she believes
her husband is wrongfully

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.870
incarcerated.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.350
So I had come across
this opera in grad school

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.570
and was trying to
choose something

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:12.410
to do in 2018 that really
had something powerful to say

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.410
about our moment.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.550
And here we go--

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:21.950
I mean, I started
immediately imagining what

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.140
if it was an
American story today?

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:29.230
What if we saw a lot of
people of color in the cast?

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:35.100
What if this is a Black Lives
Matter activist, actually,

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.090
who has been
wrongfully detained?

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.240
His wife is trying
desperately to find him,

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.320
trying to seek
pro-bono legal advice,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.150
being sort of turned down.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.480
And here is this
corrupt white warden

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:57.950
who's running this prison and
trying to silence his opponent.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.090
So it also came to mind, here
we had this famous prisoners

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.074
chorus that occurs in
the middle of the opera,

00:33:04.074 --> 00:33:05.240
how are we going to do that?

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.810
In the past, Heartbeat has
sort of avoided choruses.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:13.910
We've kept the casts much
more focused and small.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.780
But Dan brought up that he
knew a prison choir director

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.250
in Minnesota.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.560
And we reached out to her,
and Amanda then connected

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.860
us with, I guess, three
other prison choir

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.270
directors across the Midwest.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:31.190
And suddenly, we had six
amazing choirs-- male, female,

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.900
and mixed choirs--

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.460
committed to
collaborating with us.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.780
So we're capturing
audio recordings

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:44.270
of them singing a new four-part
arrangement that Dan did.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.910
And then we're also--
we just this past week,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.910
videoed their
rehearsals, and we'll

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:53.240
be creating an
almost montage music

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.230
video of the real
incarcerated singers

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.074
to be shown in the
middle of the production.

00:34:00.074 --> 00:34:01.490
LOUISA PROSKE: So
the when and the

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.970
where is, if you
look on your seats,

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.380
you have the flyers
for the festival.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.860
It runs from March--

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.980
sorry, May 2nd through 13th.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.949
There are six performances
of each opera.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:15.949
And there's actually
one day where

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.500
you can see both operas in
one day, which would make you

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.719
probably one of the very
few people in history

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:25.130
to have seen "Fidelio" and
"Don Giovanni" on the same day,

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.010
so you can brag about
that for your whole life.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.770
And yeah, it's very easy
to buy tickets online

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:31.908
or over the phone.

00:34:31.908 --> 00:34:32.949
PETER DOLCHIN: Fantastic.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:34.150
DAN SCHLOSBERG: Oh, and where?

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.191
LOUISA PROSKE: Oh, it's
at Baruch Performing Arts

00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:39.050
Center, which is on 27th and
Lexington, so not too far.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.820
PETER DOLCHIN: No.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.629
Are there any questions
from anyone in the room?

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:46.545
JENNIFER NEWMAN: There
are more post-graduates

00:34:46.545 --> 00:34:47.607
that don't have the [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:47.607 --> 00:34:48.024
PETER DOLCHIN: OK.

00:34:48.024 --> 00:34:48.441
AUDIENCE: Is there a mic?

00:34:48.441 --> 00:34:49.441
PETER DOLCHIN: There is.

00:34:49.441 --> 00:34:53.155
There's a mic right in the back.

00:34:53.155 --> 00:34:55.139
AUDIENCE: Hey, y'all.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.890
My question was around--

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:03.452
for most operas being in
non-English, and where--

00:35:03.452 --> 00:35:05.260
I'm sorry.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.595
I still have to start over.

00:35:07.595 --> 00:35:08.520
Hello?

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.020
No?

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:09.970
No?

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:11.870
OK, I don't think it's on.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.794
So my question is
around just language

00:35:13.794 --> 00:35:16.770
and the role it plays
in kind of-- as you

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.690
try make opera more accessible.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.980
How do you approach the
language and telling the story,

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.516
and having people kind of--

00:35:26.516 --> 00:35:27.580
I mean, A, I don't know.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.490
Are you translating?

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.840
Are you doing them in English?

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.990
Are you doing them in Italian,
depending on the language

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.948
that it was written in?

00:35:32.948 --> 00:35:34.970
How do you approach
language and making

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.640
that a part of-- for
English-speaking people,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.252
have that be part of
feeling that opera

00:35:40.252 --> 00:35:41.210
and being a part of it?

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.990
PETER DOLCHIN: Great question.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.670
LOUISA PROSKE: Yeah, we're
not super dogmatic about that.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.880
So sometimes when we feel it's
right, we translate the text.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.190
So when we did "Daphnis
et Chloé" three years ago,

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.570
which is an Offenbach operetta
and it's very populist,

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.640
sort of almost
borderline musical,

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.446
we felt like people just have
to understand immediately where

00:35:59.446 --> 00:36:01.320
the jokes land and where
the punch lines are.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.350
So we translated
it into English.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.470
There are other operas
like Puccini and Bizet

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.050
where the sound of
the words is really

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.510
important to the way
the music is structured,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.510
so it becomes a little more
difficult to translate,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.700
so then we often do supertitles.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.210
But in the case of
"Fidelio" or "Carmen,"

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.720
for example, where it's a mixed
opera with music and dialogues,

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.775
we always translate
the dialogues.

00:36:25.775 --> 00:36:27.275
Maybe you want to
speak more about--

00:36:27.275 --> 00:36:29.399
ETHAN HEARD: Yeah, and this
production of "Fidelio"

00:36:29.399 --> 00:36:33.620
is the first time we hired a
playwright to really re-imagine

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.410
the dialogue.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:35.920
So some of our--

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.740
in adapting the
story, we've actually

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:45.950
taken the opportunity, taken the
liberty of just re-conceiving

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.500
what a dialogue
needs to accomplish,

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.310
and making that a really
contemporary American sound.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.299
JACOB ASHWORTH: I would also
say it's a great question

00:36:55.299 --> 00:36:57.090
and something that we
do think about a lot,

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.910
especially when we
do our drag shows,

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.111
which there's so much more
going on in the design,

00:37:02.111 --> 00:37:04.610
that it's a little bit harder
to imagine somebody looking up

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.220
at subtitles any
time there's somebody

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.330
in a fabulous dress that's just
entered and started singing.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.740
And so we try, there, to either
use as much angle as possible,

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.810
or pick things where we feel
like we can make a design

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.972
and direction
around it, such that

00:37:21.972 --> 00:37:23.180
you don't need a translation.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.770
You know exactly
what they're doing

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.410
and we can somehow show it
to you in a different way.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:31.970
But we are, in general,
trying to make opera more

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.480
closer to the sort of
populist roots that it has.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.122
And opera has,
over the centuries,

00:37:37.122 --> 00:37:39.080
gone back and forth
between being a little more

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.090
popular and a little more
aristocratic, and a little more

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:41.630
popular.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:46.040
And you notice popular's
the top of the crest for me.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.000
But I mean, I'll go ahead and
say here, at Talks at Google,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.950
that my prediction is
that in about 50 years,

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.230
we're back to translating
everything and putting

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.380
everything in the vernacular,
and we're singing everything

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:02.270
in English the way that people
did only 70, 80 years ago

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:03.920
when people wanted
populist opera,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.340
but didn't have subtitles yet,
didn't have the technology.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.420
There was a period
where that happened.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.409
And so we're always
talking about it.

00:38:12.409 --> 00:38:14.700
PETER DOLCHIN: Great, so
before we start losing people,

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.730
there are two more
performances, so we want

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.020
to save some time for that.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.060
Are there any other questions?

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.320
There's one more question.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.320
AUDIENCE: Super quick one-- so
I remember back in high school,

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.470
directing a one-act play and
sending in my $50 to Samuel

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.157
French for the royalties.

00:38:30.157 --> 00:38:32.240
And so I'm thinking for
small comp-- are royalties

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.012
a thing in opera, and do they
prevent you from doing things

00:38:37.012 --> 00:38:38.845
that you want to do as
a very small company?

00:38:38.845 --> 00:38:40.678
LOUISA PROSKE: Well,
almost everything we do

00:38:40.678 --> 00:38:43.860
has is beyond royalties, so
it's in the public domain, which

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.980
is part of the great joy of then
being able to cut it up and use

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.905
it however you want.

00:38:47.905 --> 00:38:49.530
JACOB ASHWORTH: But
it does restrict us

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:51.613
from doing anything that
was written 10 years ago,

00:38:51.613 --> 00:38:54.660
or 20 years ago without
very explicit permission.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.360
Because the thing that we
would struggle with the most

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.580
is if we said you know to
John Adams or somebody,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.038
we'd like to do
your opera but we'd

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:04.860
like to do it for six
clarinets, are you OK with that?

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.390
And most likely, no--

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.420
although, actually,
he might, he might.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.860
But if you do things that
are over 75 or 90 years old,

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.020
depending on the
country, you get out

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.340
of most of that trouble.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.654
But it is a consideration, yes.

00:39:20.654 --> 00:39:21.570
PETER DOLCHIN: Thanks.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.910
So before we jump
into the performances,

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.520
I just want to thank you
for taking the time to come.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.270
You guys are doing cutting edge,
really cultural, unique things

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.140
in society, and in New
York, specifically.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.159
And I just hope that this
helped build that fan base,

00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:38.700
so thank you.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.110

you for having us.

00:39:42.822 --> 00:39:44.690
PETER DOLCHIN: So
we'll head off.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.910
While we're setting up
for the performances,

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:50.240
we're going to have another
video of their fall--

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.950
of the spring festival.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.940
So will you
introduce what it is?

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.000
LOUISA PROSKE: Oh, it's going
to be "Butterfly" and "Carmen,"

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.292
which were our last spring
productions a year ago, yes.

00:40:01.292 --> 00:40:02.708
PETER DOLCHIN:
Awesome, thank you.

[OPERATIC MUSIC]

00:41:36.174 --> 00:41:37.590
LOUISA PROSKE: So
now you're going

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:40.980
to hear two more selections from
our upcoming spring festival,

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.200
actually, first, an
aria from "Don Giovanni"

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.270
and then an aria from "Fidelio."

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.650
So this aria from
"Don Giovanni,"

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:53.520
it's the character Zerlina,
who is an expert with men.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.760
And she just came back
from sort of trying

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.720
to seduce this very, very
beautiful nobleman called

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.000
Don Giovanni, and being
interrupted in it.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.040
And so now she's back
with her husband,

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.150
who is just furious that he
left her on their wedding day

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.710
to go with this other man.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.460
So she is sort of dealing
with his anger by saying,

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.510
go ahead, beat me.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:16.770
Beat me up if you want to.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.060
You can scratch my eyes.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.440
You can tear my hair.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.080
But afterwards, we'll
make peace again.

00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:30.870
ETHAN HEARD: Our next and
final selection is from

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:36.900
"Fidelio.'" So Leah has just
overheard the corrupt warden

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.470
making plans to murder her
husband who is being wrongfully

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.610
kept in solitary confinement.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:47.580
So she starts with just
an explosion of rage.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.040
She goes to a very
despairing place.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.380
And then by the end
of the aria, she's

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.200
finding strength and
hope again that she

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.450
will be able to save him--
