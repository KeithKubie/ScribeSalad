[PHONE RINGING]

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.146
ODED BEN DOV: Hey, Giora.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.472
GIORA LIVNE: Hey, Oded.

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:15.225
How are you?

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:16.600
ODED BEN DOV: I'm
good, I'm good.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.190
I'm actually headed
to your place now.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.874
The team is joining
us for lunch later,

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:21.790
and we want to show you
this cool new feature.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.370
I think you'll love it.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.411
GIORA LIVNE: I'm waiting.

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:26.512
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.000
ODED BEN DOV: I started
Sesame around five years ago.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.730
I didn't know I was
headed that way.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.382
And I got on TV to
demonstrate a game

00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:39.670
I developed that was
controlled using head gestures.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.830
You move your head around,
and you chase this character.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.220
The day after, I
get a phone call.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.910
And the guy on the
line says, hi, I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.180
can't move my hands or legs.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.350
Can you make me a
smartphone I could use?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.249
GIORA LIVNE: He
came, looked at me,

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.300
and said, well, I
have a new company.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.554
I am not ready for changes now.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:04.570
I told him that this
will be much better idea

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.060
to do good for the whole world.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.120
And he was convinced.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.130
ODED BEN DOV: It really
put a new perspective

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070
on what technology
can accomplish

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.600
and how we can change lives.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.020
And the Android operating
system's open nature

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.330
really allowed me to
innovate beyond what

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.440
I could imagine at first.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.470
GIORA LIVNE: Ah, the first time
I used that, it was like magic.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.834
I almost jumped from the chair.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.500
ODED BEN DOV: So you
say, "open sesame."

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.537
GIORA LIVNE: Open sesame.

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:35.370
ODED BEN DOV: That's
how the phone opens on.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.112
And from that point on, it
allows for operation of any app

00:01:38.112 --> 00:01:39.320
by using only head movements.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.799
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.420
Long time been asked
for a selfie feature.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.420
I think it would be fun.

SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:03.650
ODED BEN DOV: It's not
a standard company.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.110
You have days when you're
crying from happiness,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.910
because you really, really
touched the person's life.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.880
With the app now
being on Google Play,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.570
anyone can download
it around the world,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.500
and we're seeing that.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.260
One of our greatest
users is Alex Friedman.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.110
I met him on social
circles, and at the time,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.350
he was just starting a
campaign to raise awareness

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.940
around disabilities in Israel.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.085
And he uses Sesame remarkably.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.032
SPEAKER 2: It's fun, because we
can communicate all day long.

00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:56.780
ALEX FRIEDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.480
ODED BEN DOV: Google Play
Console gives us a lot of tools

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.640
to care for our users better.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.892
We see what's working
right and what's not.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.350
Through the ratings
and reviews, we

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.150
can actually be in
touch with users

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.900
and take benefits from
all the great stuff

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.930
the Play Store offers.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.850
I think the biggest
takeaway from Sesame

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.350
is the lives you touch.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.960
Every successful user
is not just a number.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.880
It's a whole life.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.310
It's a whole story.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.110
And we take those with us,
and those propel us forward

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.240
to keep doing what we do.
