1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,170
Hey Jocko, what can we do with
a coworker who isn't on board?

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,870
When someone brings up something to him,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,770
he gets defensive and turns it
into being everyone else's problem.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,030
[inaudible] this was a Twitter
question by the way. And uh,

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,790
and I answered it and I answered it
really simply, really straightforward.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,180
Take ownership of the problem, solve it,
take ownership of the problem and fix it.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,600
Right? Cause think about
what's happening here, right?

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,830
The what the person is saying
like, Oh this is me saying, oh,

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,290
echo won't take ownership of the problem.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,510
And every time I tell him he does
something wrong, he just gets defensive.

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,920
So I mean obviously I'm not
communicating with you well enough.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,250
If all I'm doing is blaming you and
you're getting defensive. And by the way,

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,520
if I'm the type of person that
takes ownership of things,

14
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:52,300
why am I blaming you in the first place?
I should be looking at myself.

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,220
I should be looking at myself.
And by the way, if Echo,

16
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:58,500
if you point your fingers at me
and you say, Hey, this is my fault,

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,580
you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I agree.

18
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,920
It is my fault and here's what
I'm going to do to fix it.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,260
Now I'm not going to rub it in your
face. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna do it.

20
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,270
So I prove a point.
That's not what I'm doing.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,070
I'm actually doing it because I want to,

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,440
when I'm actually doing it because
I want to accomplish the mission.

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,120
That's why I'm going to fix the problem.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,233
Hmm.

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,580
Now, if we have a weak member of the
team that doesn't take ownership,

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,090
then guess what?

27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,670
It's my responsibility to take
ownership of the problem and fix it.

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,653
And eventually,

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,390
but the good thing about this is if you
make an excuse about something and I

30
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:30,240
fixed that excuse and then you make
an excuse about something else,

31
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,103
I fixed that one.

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,360
And then you make an excuse about
something else and I fixed that one.

33
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,310
Eventually.
There's no more excuses for you,

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,180
and now you're left with what you can
actually handle as echo with no more

35
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:45,240
excuses to make. And then either you're
capable of, you're not in. By the way,

36
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,170
guess what?
As the leader,

37
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:51,171
then it's becomes my job to
get rid of you if you can't,

38
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,560
if you cannot do the thing that I asked
you to do or that you're supposed to do

39
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,960
for the team.
So,

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,673
okay.

41
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,160
Yeah, because I mean
eventually if you, if,

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,850
if I keep stepping up and
taking things away from you,

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,020
there's not gonna be any more excuses
and you'll either end up with no

44
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:13,350
responsibility and therefore no
value and then you have no job.

45
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,900
That's the way it works.
Now, let me ask you this.

46
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,590
When is there a time that a subordinate

47
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,260
does something
and it's not the leaders fault?

48
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,410
So,
so think about this.

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,780
W W W and when something goes
wrong with a team member,

50
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,480
when is it not the leaders fault?

51
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:48,481
So if you've got a machine gunner and
the machine gunner shoots outside of his

52
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:52,870
field of fire, clearly he didn't
pay attention during the brief.

53
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,883
That's the problem.

54
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,180
If I have a machine gunner that engages
non-hostile targets is a machine gunner

55
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:03,370
his fault because he didn't do improper.
He,

56
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,180
he did improper positive identification
of his targets and engaged

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,860
a friendlies or or at least non hostels.

58
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,950
So that's the machine goes wrong or the
machine gunners at weapon goes down.

59
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,420
Yeah

60
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,100
because the machine gunner didn't click,

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,920
it's his fault cause he didn't clean his
weapon, maintain his weapon properly.

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,860
The machine gunners fault.
So all those things,

63
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,510
the machine gunner shoots out of his
field of fire and a machine gunner gauges,

64
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:29,600
non hostile targets and machine
gunners weapon goes down.

65
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,300
All those of the machine
gunners fault clearly.

66
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,853
Okay.

67
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Or maybe not so clearly because here's
how I would look at those things.

68
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,060
Cause by the way,

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,460
when I point if you're my machine gun
and I put my finger at you and start

70
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:46,170
yelling at you and telling you
that you did something wrong,

71
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,700
obviously we know what happens.

72
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:52,701
You start making excuses and blaming
other people and and you don't accepting

73
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:56,430
responsibility cause you get defensive.
And that's what people do. So for me

74
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,770
in what a good leader
does is a good leader.

75
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,210
When the machine gunner shoots out of
his, fueled the fire, the leader says, Oh,

76
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:09,590
you know what? I didn't explain the
fields of fire clearly enough for you.

77
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,760
I'm sorry, I'll fix it. Machine
gunner engages on non hostile target.

78
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,010
Then the leader says,
Hey,

79
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,300
I should have given you better
training on target identification.

80
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,570
We will go back and fix that.

81
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,070
Or the machine gunners, a weapon goes
down. It means that I, as the leader,

82
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:32,190
you know what? I should've done
a better job inspecting weapons.

83
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,290
I should have explained how important
the maintenance was. That's my fault.

84
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,610
I won't let it happen again.

85
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,670
So even in these instances where it's
real easy to blame the, the individual,

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,120
all good leader instead of blaming the
individual will take ownership of the

87
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:54,720
problem. That's what you do.
And that's what's going on.

88
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:57,270
In this case, you got a coworker
that's not on board and,

89
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,900
and just gets defensive and turns it into
everyone else's problem. That's right.

90
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,550
Grab ownership of those problems.
And by the way, the subordinate,

91
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:06,630
that's not taking ownership.

92
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,970
That's your fault as a leader and the way
that you get someone to take ownership

93
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:14,940
isn't by saying, Hey, don't get defensive.

94
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,440
You need to take
ownership of this problem.

95
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,220
It's your problem that doesn't
make people take ownership.

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,970
Here's the tricky part.
Here's the black belt situation.

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,050
The black belt situation is if I want
you to take ownership instead of blaming

98
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:30,630
you, I'm going to take, I'm going
to take ownership of the problem.

99
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,570
I'm going to relieve you of that and now
you're going to go way out. No, no, no,

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,870
no. I should be able to fix that.
I'm sorry boss. I'm sorry Jocko.

101
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,420
I shouldn't have shot my, I shouldn't
have shot outside the field of fire.

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,970
I need to pay better attention during
the brief if I don't know what it was.

103
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,140
I'm going to ask questions next
time. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

104
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,810
Please let me get it fixed.

105
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,280
And that is how you get
someone to take ownership.

106
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,370
You don't get people to take ownership
by them to take ownership of things.

107
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,650
And there's a little dichotomy here too,
because if it's a plan,

108
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,800
then the way I get you to take
ownership of it is by saying, hey, echo,

109
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,920
come up with a plan. Like we talked about
standard operating procedures earlier.

110
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,710
If I come up with the standard operating
procedures myself and then I forced

111
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,920
them on to you. You don't take ownership
of those. Yeah, those are mine.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,250
So I have to give you ownership,
but when it's a negative,

113
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,800
it's when it's a positive thing, I give
it to you. When it's a negative thing,

114
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,723
I take it,

115
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,600
I take it positive thing.
Give it,

116
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,910
cause people want that positive thing.
Yeah. When it's a negative thing,

117
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:40,200
they don't want it. You take
it from them and by the way,

118
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,730
when it's a positive thing
and you give it to them,

119
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:44,490
guess what they want to do with it? They
want to share it. They want to do it.

120
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,920
Yeah. When it's a negative
thing and you forced on them,

121
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,270
they want to get rid of it.

122
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,620
So there you go.

123
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm glad that this person's in the game
and now they know how to handle this

124
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:59,070
coworker and make it
into a good situation.
