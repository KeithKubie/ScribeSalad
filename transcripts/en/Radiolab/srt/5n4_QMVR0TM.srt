1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,870
You are listening to radiolab
radio from W N Y s C.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,000
Yup. Hi,

3
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,190
I'm Robert Krulwich and I'm Latif Nasser.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,910
This is Radiolab and today we're going
to do something completely upside down

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,870
and inside out. Yes, it's,
it's a sport story sort of,

6
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:23,160
but like none you've ever heard.

7
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:26,700
And therefore we found a reporter
who is a sports reporter. Like none.

8
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,430
You've ever heard. Yeah, I've
been to a gym lately. Mike Peskov.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,190
He's the host of the just podcasts
put up by slate, formerly of NPR,

10
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:39,780
still sometimes roots fan br. And now
he's here telling the story to us.

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,780
Yeah know. How did you even first
hear about this? Were you covering it?

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,170
Oh yeah. Yeah. So

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,970
this is morning edition from
NPR news. I'm her name on tape.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,720
I was covering the 2012 Olympics
for NPR. Good morning. Hello.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,200
And I declare open the Games of London,

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,430
the stories of the Olympics. Um,

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,710
you try to find your own stories that
are obscured, but if there's a big story,

18
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:04,450
you chase it. So in those Olympics.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,181
So for you,

20
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:08,330
what were the most notable achievements
in the first week of the Games?

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,250
Well, it's history of the base con.
Microsoft's breaking the all time record.

22
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,110
Obviously over a hundred years,

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,740
nobody's won as many medals at the
Olympic Games and everyone knew that

24
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,650
bolt and his record set inquest
in a hundred would be you.

25
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,770
Oh, he's returned to tied with the
most empathetic way. Brilliant,

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,550
brilliant fun. [inaudible]

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,000
can this badminton story pops up

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,940
and everyone rushes to figure out what
the heck's going on with badminton.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,953
[inaudible]

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,690
[inaudible]

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,040
because the 2012 London
Olympics, badminton tournament,

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,390
just,

33
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,390
it took this somewhat obscure sport and
it morphed it into this bizarro thought

34
00:01:56,511 --> 00:02:01,511
experiment about competition and
integrity and what it means to win.

35
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,340
Okay. But mostly I think that
the, although to be fair, Mike,

36
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,450
he jumped on this story
for very personal reasons.

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,380
As a New Yorker,

38
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:16,070
I say a lot of words and
they're mispronounced in the
NPR audience with jump on

39
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,760
them. But I always can say the Anand
badminton and get a lot of plots.

40
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:23,870
So I'm attracted to badminton. But
what's the wrong way to say badminton?

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,760
Most people say badminton bad. Ben,

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,480
like you're talking to some
hands where winter time I'm like,

43
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:33,070
you're chastising a playful
cat, right magnet. And I see.

44
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,320
And then also, um, you know, you,

45
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,640
you and I probably think of
badminton as this backyard fun,

46
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,920
silly game. But

47
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,080
[inaudible]

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,220
according to Mike, no,

49
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,300
this is anything but it has nothing to
do with the badminton you play in your

50
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,134
backyard.

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,970
It's much faster than you think it would
possibly look. You get these player,

52
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,680
I want a shot flying all over the
court, stretching, reaching, diving.

53
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,510
The skill of the competitors
is, you know, readily apparent.

54
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,120
This is pulsating badminton.

55
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,250
Shuttlecock is a funny thing and perhaps
not as impressive a thing as a tennis

56
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,490
ball, but it looks, you know, a lot
like tennis and there was a lot of

57
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,800
tension.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
So to be a fresher and there's a lot
of grunting and it totally seems like

59
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,870
every bit of a legitimate
and highly skilled sports.

60
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,020
Wait, I'm going to start. Okay. So,

61
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,540
so Robert [inaudible] so
you haven't seen this yet,

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,650
but I would like to show
you something. Okay.

63
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,870
This is an ad.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,020
Yeah. This, okay.

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,360
This is the game that is at the
center of this whole story. Oh Man.

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,280
These doubles group. I patient
a women's doubles. Badminton.

67
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,270
It is not a metal round. It's
in the group place stage.

68
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,270
There's a huge crowd here.
Like the place is packed. Yeah.

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,960
Please welcome a representative
of the People's Republic of China.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,360
Why don't you show me you're young.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,480
So these two teams come out. Uh,

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,580
you got China yellow when red
uniforms, the oceans. So here,

73
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,480
comm

74
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,810
versus Korea. Purple and white. Yeah.

75
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,630
And let's just skip ahead here.

76
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,380
Yeah. All right. So here we go. Game on.

77
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,760
This is the first surf [inaudible]

78
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,190
Korean serve. So the Korean
player flicks her wrist.

79
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,470
The shuttlecock goes over the net.

80
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,360
China return [inaudible] right
into the net. But that was it.

81
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,520
That was the whole thing. Oh,
that was just a, alright. Um,

82
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,160
so Korea and second serve

83
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,320
and Chinese return and same
thing. You know that again? Yeah.

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,480
So that

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,250
service has turned over and now the
Chinese are surfing China, Korea,

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,113
China.

87
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,270
It doesn't matter if you can, uh, yeah,

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,950
this is not exactly scintillating.
I just gotta tell you,

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,440
I think you're welcome.
Watch this next point.

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,460
So the Korean player serves it. Yeah,

91
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,990
it's sales over the net and then
it goes, goes, goes, goes, goes.

92
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:22,850
And the Chinese player clearly
is right there. She has it.

93
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,390
She then winds up just a
slight bit like you could see,

94
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:30,260
it's like she has this deep ingrained
muscle memory from years of doing this.

95
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,540
She winds up, she's about to
hit it and then she's stops.

96
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,130
And the Charlotte Cock just plunks under
the floor inbounds point to Korea and

97
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,460
then tellingly she looks, yeah,

98
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,220
back at the back corner of the
court where her coach's sitting. Uh,

99
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,370
they both are. Yeah, yeah. This is a
fix. They're fixing this. Well this is,

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,000
yes.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,420
But there been plenty of occasions where
one side wants to lose and it ain't

102
00:05:56,421 --> 00:06:00,050
hard to, and the more important thing is
that it ain't hard to get away with it.

103
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,540
Usually you wouldn't
even notice it. You know,

104
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,190
it's the difference between a
couple of serves over the line,

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,450
a couple balls into the net, but
in this case, as the match goes on,

106
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,800
you start to realize

107
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,140
that's a very lethargic Scott come back.

108
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,690
Korean players seem to be trying to
lose too. The cervic faults. Yes,

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,780
that's it's a rally of course everybody
we tried to lose like both sides.

110
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,700
Well it's actually a strategy because
the way the tournament is laid out,

111
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,420
both these teams are going to be
moving on to the metal rounds,

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,480
but whoever wins this game is going
to have to play another Chinese team,

113
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,790
a really strong team. I see.

114
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,740
And whoever loses is gonna
play a way easier Danish team.

115
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,450
So both teams are hoping to lose. Yeah.

116
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,540
And it is the rare instance where you
have both sides incentivized to lose that.

117
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:01,040
You get something that should
be scored by Spike Jones.

118
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,650
It's a little bit of a prisoner's
dilemma, right? Either side could lose,

119
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:10,630
but when both want to lose, it becomes
this surreal waiting game. Right.

120
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,780
You know who's going to crack first and
score a point and so you got the best

121
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:21,070
players in the world who just start
hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds,

122
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,160
see fault after fault,
faulting on purpose,

123
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,780
and we'll just take the
bull straight in the net.

124
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,450
You're hitting the shuttlecock
into the net. I'm sorry.

125
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,670
You know it's blindingly
obvious what's going on.

126
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,470
And you know that both tried to lose.

127
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:36,400
Sometimes they hit it below the
net and that is unforgivable.

128
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,180
They're hitting it straight into the
ground or by tripping over their own

129
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,720
shoelaces purposefully until what you
get is serve up all into the next point

130
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,050
after point of just hearable badminton.

131
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:54,370
And it just devolved into
this absurd repetitive,

132
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,880
crazy making lose the thought.

133
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,010
This is not to displace. Yes,

134
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,100
the lame, I mean this is
not, this is not sport this,

135
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:11,180
but it is kind of a sport because,
and this is why I really love it.

136
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,530
At a certain point,

137
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:17,531
these two teams have to start
competing with each other to lose what,

138
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,940
let me play you this point. So
China serves it. Korea hits it back,

139
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,510
but it's going way out of bounds
now. Now, in a normal world,

140
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:29,360
China would obviously let that fall
so that they could take the point,

141
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:33,860
but they lunge to save it, right?
And they're hitting it back.

142
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,890
No Korea, then they are like,
no, no, no. You know what?

143
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,120
We're pretty sure we
want it out of bounds.

144
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,840
They hit it in the opposite
direction, even further out of bounds.

145
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,290
So now China goes to save it once
again, but they don't get there in time.

146
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,210
So the point goes to China, which
China actually didn't want. Um, and,

147
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,780
and the Koreans wanted the whole time.
So what are you saying then as well?

148
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,070
It's like, it's like we
invented whole new sport,

149
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,750
which is the exact opposite of
badminton. It is, it is photo negative.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,833
[inaudible]

151
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,580
[inaudible]

152
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,200
then towards the end of the first,

153
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,840
that woman referee has
been pretty quick outcomes.

154
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,360
The referee since the birth.

155
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,360
Hello, Torsten speaking. Hi,

156
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,080
how Torsten Baron was the head Olympic
badminton referee who got that call.

157
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,600
And I also heard the spectators
Buzo. I went to watch it.

158
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,980
It looked pretty awful.
This was not [inaudible]

159
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,090
right. [inaudible] is
the planners together

160
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,980
and uh, told them that they were
not playing seriously and uh,

161
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,480
they were making a very serious mistake
and uh, they played stupid and said no,

162
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,340
we playing and we're trying our best

163
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,260
needed told me also

164
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,130
[inaudible] we were actually able to
get in touch with, what's her name?

165
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,100
You most of us three of the four players
in that match. Both Korean players

166
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,400
[inaudible] John can earn
and they're going the chemo.

167
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,680
And I knew that Kim Hannah and also one
of the Chinese players [inaudible] how

168
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,070
was [inaudible] and

169
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,080
[inaudible] [inaudible] told me they
were trying to lose in that match.

170
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,320
But what do we did in the
expected south career?

171
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,700
What the do the same thing has a male
sound, our whole, and as for the Koreans,

172
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,870
junk young urn said that they too were
trying to lose at least during certain

173
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,800
moments in the game.

174
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,220
But when the crowds hurted Abou
[inaudible] the run and the ref came out,

175
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,450
her partner, Kim Ha na said that. So
I was surprised and I'm embarrassed.

176
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,790
We're just much about loggers on scared.

177
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:37,310
We just wanting to get out of the court
as soon as possible. Got To [inaudible].

178
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,190
So Torsten walks off the court,
they window in court again.

179
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,690
And then the second serve after
Torsten walks out the court.

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,370
Nothing but net. So for
the next few points,

181
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,090
it does not get much better. No, it
didn't look like world class back.

182
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,343
Mm.

183
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,550
So the set comes to an end.

184
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,970
Korea wins the set and while the
players are waiting on [inaudible]

185
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,340
sidelines who comes to the
tournament referee, again,

186
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,350
Torsten comes back onto the court,

187
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,250
you walks up to the players and he pulls
out of his pocket almost subtly and

188
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:16,810
shows to the players this
black car, the black car,

189
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,640
which means discord, vacation.

190
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,360
This is absolutely extraordinary.

191
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,910
He has given both teams

192
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,850
a black card or has he
threatened them with a bat card?

193
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,800
I'm really not terribly short. The
players have returned to court.

194
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,440
It was now that they should
play or they would be in deep.

195
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,250
Sorry, maybe I shouldn't say the black,

196
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,480
the black card that says that the
car, the car was out and I was,

197
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,530
I told them in very clear words and
very seriously that in order to help

198
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,370
themselves, they better play now.

199
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,180
Can they then can they [inaudible]

200
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,450
the Korean player Junkie on
the [inaudible] said that
she turned to her party

201
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,740
and I told her there are them and we
are we so come give your, hit you. Okay,

202
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,110
let's just play and do our best.

203
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,950
The second set starts and pretty good.

204
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,650
[inaudible] China's
[inaudible] Lee told me,

205
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,210
so you see both sides changed a little
bit instead of just serving into the net,

206
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,800
things started to get better. Oh Raleigh.

207
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,730
They would get the rally going but
then as the points kept coming,

208
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,220
you started to notice like
they were playing very slowly.

209
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,240
Six still really off here. They were
not hitting the border very hard.

210
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,810
[inaudible] yeah, the Korean
team wouldn't admit this,

211
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:41,170
but once ya Lee said that both teams,

212
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,760
you then changed the basic fact
gabion and we're still trying to lose,

213
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,980
which I have to say is exactly what
it looks like when you watch it.

214
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,460
Because for the rest of the match, you
get a bunch of these points where like,

215
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,930
where just they'll lob, it's super
high, you know, as if to say, hey,

216
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,900
smash it down on us. Take your
point. Or they will, uh, you know,

217
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,280
hit it out of bounds and then
face palm just, you know,

218
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:10,540
practice their swing after they missed
one just to, to see, say, Oh, you know,

219
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,920
my mechanics are off. I just gotta
just practices a few more times. Um,

220
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,480
because it's like we've entered a whole
third iteration of this game where it's

221
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,460
like they're not just trying to lose,

222
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,450
they're trying to cover up the admin
cover up badminton. You're trying to lose,

223
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,980
but you're trying to look
like you're trying to win.

224
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,710
I don't think. No.

225
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,760
So finally, after 20 long,
the minutes of this, uh,

226
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,970
the Korean team loses
the match by winning it

227
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,290
tonight has left me with a
very nasty taste in the mouth.

228
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,990
Tonight is not sport. It
was a disgrace. Good night.

229
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:05,090
[inaudible] so all four players walked
off the court and Kim Ha na told him he

230
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,110
was not a pleasant winning at all and the
parents were in the audience that day.

231
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,750
And afterwards they
asked her what happened,

232
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,740
what happened and why,

233
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,700
why do you have to get the booze
from the audiences and et cetera.

234
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,620
And I was, I was sad
and feel, felt defeated.

235
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,970
So I didn't even want to talk to my
mom. So I remember I was just going,

236
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,300
went to the hotel and had, had
arrested [inaudible] killed,

237
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,360
know, and uh, the next morning at
eight o'clock or four pairs, in fact,

238
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,340
we're disqualified according to the
disciplinary regulations of, uh,

239
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,940
the badminton world federation,

240
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,480
which has a rule on the books that you
can be disqualified for failing to use

241
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:49,380
your best effort.

242
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,890
And the same evening
they, on the plane home,

243
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,600
they were just thrown out of the Olympics.

244
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,480
The scandal at the Olympics [inaudible]
this whole to do about the badminton

245
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,560
players. Everyone was talking about some
losers shuffle colts were going out.

246
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,400
[inaudible] the shuttle coke into the
net like a five year old in the backyard

247
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,080
picnic. It was downright
humiliating post. Just sad

248
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,983
that uh,

249
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,610
they were committing suicide in
that tournament can usually be job

250
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,150
[inaudible] it's a bad time. The
punishment hits me quite hard.

251
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,560
I was very sad and I felt helpless.

252
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,183
[inaudible]

253
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,650
[inaudible] I was perplexed
and didn't know what happened.

254
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,860
We just cried.

255
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,760
This doesn't sound like it's getting any
better. No, but there's still more, uh,

256
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,920
after the break. Okay.

257
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,590

I'm former US attorney Preet Bharara
and my new podcast is called stay tuned.

262
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,250
If you look at areas
where he is unconstrained,

263
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,660
his behavior is pretty consistently
awful. It's about the human side of power.

264
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,540
Those who do not study history
are doomed to repeat it.

265
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,330
And those who study policing.
No, we don't study history.

266
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,820
And it's about justice,
fairness and democracy.

267
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,890

We're back. I'm Robert Krulwich and
I'm lots of Nasr. This is radio lab.

271
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,730
And when we left off,

272
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:52,230
the Korean and Chinese women's badminton
teams had just been disqualified,

273
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,210
kicked out of the Olympics. So what,

274
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:57,750
so then what happened to the [inaudible]
players? Like what happened them? Well,

275
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:02,040
all four of them did keep playing
badminton professionally after this, uh,

276
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,910
junk young earn from Korea even
went on to win a bronze in Rio.

277
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,950
But at the time this was a brutal
punishment for all of them.

278
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,930
Well, but you know, they, they did
something wrong. This wasn't right. Right.

279
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,920
I, you know, I don't even, I
questioned whether it's even unethical.

280
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,730
I think it's ethical in a way. What
they did, really, what the players did.

281
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,130
I do, I think it's an
ethical how so, okay.

282
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,350
So is the definition of
ethics in sports two two wins.

283
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,970
Sure. Without cheating. Yes.

284
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,340
Does that mean to win every
point? No, not necessarily.

285
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:42,300
You know, in baseball there's the
thing called the intentional walker.

286
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,351
In football,

287
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:47,970
a team will take a safety
instead of punting and letting
the other teams score a

288
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,720
touchdown.

289
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,720
So this a calculation where our point
here or there is not as important as the

290
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:57,210
hole and the hole is the game.
So, okay, let's move back.

291
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:01,260
Let's pan out a little more. I think
an individual game is often lost. Look,

292
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:02,940
we're not going to put
our good starter here.

293
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,440
We're going to manage the lineup because
the goal is to win the championship.

294
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,470
And the thing to remember about these
players is if what we want is players who

295
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:15,690
are hyper competitive and
actually want to win at all costs,

296
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,400
that's exactly why they were losing so
badly because they wanted to win the

297
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:23,190
overall championship at all costs.

298
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,050
And the badminton federation had a set
of rules that all bug guarantee that this

299
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:28,430
would happen.

300
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,840
Well. Yeah, I mean it's stupid to have
an event where people are trying to lose.

301
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,520
If that event is a sporting
event, especially at the apex of,

302
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,190
you know, the only time people care
about bad news it seems really good.

303
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,170
So this is chuck Klosterman,

304
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,850
we called him in because he writes a lot
about sports and also because he wrote

305
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,420
the ethicist column for The
New York Times magazine.

306
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,660
Now is this a, uh, some kind
of tragedy will, it's not,

307
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,260
I guess in less bad mittens really
important to you than it probably is

308
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,531
in this case.

309
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:03,400
I think the thing that people got really
upset about is this is this idea of the

310
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,330
Olympic ideal.

311
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,880
All the context to I promise that we
shall take part in the Olympic Games

312
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,010
athletes both

313
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,100
in the true spirit of sportsmanship for
the glory of the sport and the honor of

314
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,184
our teams

315
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,770
to transcend the in the way that as a
super athlete you're transcending your

316
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:26,630
humanity but then also as like this
representative of your country and I think

317
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:31,250
it did poke a lot of people like a lot
of people did seemingly get kind of upset

318
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,084
about Oh

319
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,711
yeah.

320
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:37,711
I mean for some reason it is disturbing
to see athletes failing on purpose that

321
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:42,700
just, it seems to Kinda
like tap into some,

322
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,740
I like morals somehow

323
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,800
tonight has left me with
a very nasty tasting.

324
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,950
Yes. Like, like,

325
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:53,330
like I don't know if not trying in a
sporting event is a moral question,

326
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:55,130
but it feels that way
when you see it happen.

327
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,823
Yes.

328
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,581
Here again,

329
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,700
one of the interesting thing about sports
is that we watch these adults playing

330
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,230
multimillion dollar games,

331
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,620
but they're the same games that like a
six year old or seven year old plays.

332
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,600
So when you have a seven year old kid,

333
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,270
you would say it doesn't
matter if you win or lose.

334
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:14,690
It doesn't matter what happens, just
play hard. You don't have to succeed.

335
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,070
It's the trying that matters.

336
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,300
So when you see people at the
eyes level not trying, there's,

337
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
it's almost,

338
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,360
it's sort of wrecks the entire idea of
why we play sports at all. You know why?

339
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:29,870
If you're at a playground in two kids
race across the playground to see who can

340
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:33,260
get to the swing faster or whatever,
like that's like a biological thing.

341
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:35,390
Maybe we are biologically
driven to compete,

342
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,330
so that's the baseline
expectation of what we have.

343
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,580
Have these bad been players
that they will try to compete.

344
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,840
It seems to me there's an opportunity
here for true athleticism and a kind of

345
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,000
topsy turvy little bit and reversed and
reversed it and see if you can do that

346
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:53,350
as well as you do the other way. I
mean sports only work one way though.

347
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,800
They don't work both
ways. I mean it would,

348
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,070
it would be be like going to
your wife and saying like, okay,

349
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,480
you say you really love me.

350
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,560
Prove it by hating me in a creative way.

351
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,960
Or to go to a great piano
player and say like,

352
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,970
if you're so awesome at playing piano,

353
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,580
Bang your fist against the keys
in a way that I will be, you know,

354
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,070
I will be sickened by it,

355
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,320
but every ticket out of the out of matters
of the heart and put it back on the

356
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:20,950
field,

357
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,950
what would be the most radical solution
that you could imagine if your desire

358
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:30,350
was to convincingly and astonishingly
athletically lose weight?

359
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,580
I suppose if they were both trying to do
it in the most convincing way it would

360
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:40,780
be, that was not really the case here.
I can say they never confronted it.

361
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:44,860
How do you lose on purpose if the other
side's also trying to lose on purpose?

362
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:48,100
And I'm trying to think, there
are some sports. So in football,

363
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,090
let's say in American football, let's
say both sides want it to lose. Well,

364
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,230
here's how the sport would go. You
can't make the other team score.

365
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,300
But you can score a safety on yourself.

366
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,930
So the quarterback would get the ball
and start running towards the zone end

367
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:02,470
zone,

368
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,530
and then there'd be a gel break by the
defense to tackle the quarterback before

369
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,260
he got [inaudible]. Baseball is hard.
You could hit the batter. That would be,

370
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,760
that would be an interesting game.

371
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,430
What about darts instead
of aiming at the dartboard,

372
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:19,120
just turning around and aiming it
your opponent. So that's like the,

373
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,880
that's like the baseball
strategy for the bodybuilding.

374
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,410
Think about the implications

375
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,160
[inaudible] where do I think I would win?

376
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,030
I see like a will Ferrell
movie out of this thinking.

377
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,510
We get to a point, our team,
all right, this is what we need.

378
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,120
You've got to go out there and go and
then there's a loser on the other.

379
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,920
It's also, and then I lose

380
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,660
[inaudible].

381
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,310
You can hear more of Mike Tesco on
his podcast and the just more of Chuck

382
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,280
Klosterman and his latest
book. But what if we're wrong?

383
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,390
Big thanks to all the players who talk
to us and to those who helped us get

384
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:07,110
those interviews and joy.
Lee Lee McCune, Kim uniquer,

385
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,520
Tika thanks to opponent and Charla who
came in and helped us puzzle this whole

386
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,380
match out. And in addition,

387
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,440
a special thanks to Gracie a Polly Gracie
was on the Indonesian badminton team

388
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:22,950
in those same Olympics and an hour
after the match, we featured, uh,

389
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,180
she face off against a
different Korean team. Uh,

390
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,480
all four players in that match were also
disqualified for not using their best

391
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:34,350
efforts to win. Uh, she
really helped us, uh,

392
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,650
understand what it was like
to be in that situation.

393

This story was produced by Matt Kielty

394
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,510
I remember Krulwich and I'm of Vassar
and I guess that ends the game at this

395
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,214
point.

396
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,100
Go to the next minute. Hi, it's
Mike. I'm going to do this.

397
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,250
It's possible that even though this is
the fifth time I've said David Gabel

398
00:23:59,251 --> 00:23:59,670
wrong,

399
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,820
but I'm going to do it once and I'm got
to do it with an intro of myself and

400
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,050

410
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,090
and this message,

411
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,920
here's an idea I have. There was an
old brittle, then it goes like this.

412
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,830
A king talks to his Tucson's
two princes and he says,

413
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,810
here's what we're going to do. Get
those horses out of the stable.

414
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,771
Here's what I want you to do.

415
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:54,080
I want you to jump on your
horses and ride to the city gate,

416
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,360
which ever horse gets the city gate
last. Your going to inherit the fortune.

417
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:03,080
Maybe it's a crazy king. So the
two princes look at each other.

418
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,850
They both think and then they jump on the
horses and they ride fast as they can.

419
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,103
Why?

420
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,690
To to reign in their wishes at the very
last minute. Jump off of wishes and say,

421
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:18,920
Whoa, and then wait until the
other one. I don't know. Are they,

422
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:20,520
are they planning on just just,

423
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,470
just removing a section of the gate and
then just smashing it up against the

424
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:28,340
other horse? Yeah. No, that's terrible.

425
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,350
Like the answer, what is the answer?
They jumped on each other's horse.

426
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,330
They dropped on the other brother's
horse. Maybe. Let me just think about

427
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,270
other sports. Of course. He said whichever
horse gets her last, so how that.
