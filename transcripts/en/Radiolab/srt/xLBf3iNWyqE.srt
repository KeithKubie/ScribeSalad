1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,450
I'm Kelly. Can you hear me?
Yeah. Okay, good. All right.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,520
So we're just doing this because,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,440
because that article you wrote with one
of the most amazing things that we've

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,860
ever read. Oh, I thank you. Okay.
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,100
Radiolab and today a story about a
decision about a decision that we as human

6
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:24,510
beings, we've only recently begun
to consider. Yeah, sure. There are,

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,950
there are stories like this elsewhere,
but somehow not too many. No,

8
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,000
maybe not know. So we're going to devote
the entire hour to just this one story,

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,770
which I think is the
first for us think it is.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,280
And the story comes to us from a
woman named Kelly Behnam. Okay.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,100
She's a reporter for the
Tampa Bay Times in Florida.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,940
Maybe the way to do this as
chronologically, just sort of across time,

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,130
where were you and who,

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,940
what did you want to do when I
decided to have a baby? Yeah. Well,

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,850
you one of those people who,
who ever since you were young,

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,150
you knew that you would be a mom.
Yeah, I did, but I wasn't like, um,

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,980
I didn't play with a lot
of dolls or babysit. I bet.

18
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:06,981
I always just kind of had this weird
certainty that I might have a daughter and

19
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,100
a daughter and not a son, maybe
a son too, but I don't know.

20
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:13,800
I think I always thought I would have a
daughter and I sort of had this image of

21
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:17,970
her in my head. And what was
the image like? Really Feisty,

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,710
mischievous, dark hair. Um, dirty face.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,050
Okay. We've, we've left princess
land, not a princess at all.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,310
Like a tree climber and a dog chaser.
I really wanted to have a baby.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,200
I wanted one very badly,

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,640
but I just couldn't see how it
made sense for me to be the father.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,200
That's Tom French,

28
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:44,400
also a journalist at the Tampa Bay Times
or he was at the time he and Kelly had

29
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,430
been dating for a few years, but he
was a good 10 years older than her.

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,900
I had two kids,

31
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,650
sons approaching the end of college and
I was ready to travel. I wanted to see,

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,050
yes. Spain and Greece and
the world tour on the,

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,320
on the cruise ship where you get
to be the, you know, poker master,

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,163
whatever you interested.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,420
The only world tour I would have
been insured with Springsteen,

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,300
Springsteen following
Springsteen around Europe.

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,370
I'd made up my mind no more kids,
but she was insistent. I stuck to it.

38
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,010
She saw our daughter
very clearly. Oh yeah,

39
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:18,060
I saw that I was destined to
be that little girl's father.

40
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,500
And was that a happy gentle disagreement
or the other kind? Oh, it was brutal.

41
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,440
Broke up. And when we
worked at the same place,

42
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,480
there was kind of an
invisible line in the,

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,990
in the newsroom that neither of us
would cross. The line was the mailboxes.

44
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,670
There really wasn't one. Wow. It was a
horrible time. We call it the dark era.

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,060
The dark period. What turned you? Uh,

46
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,200
it was the, uh, it was the
Halloween section of target. I,

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,910
my sons and I have
loved Halloween forever.

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,330
I love it when I was a little kid and,
uh, I just wanted to see what they had,

49
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,520
if they had anything new,
cause I had, you know,

50
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:58,380
I usually check out their gargoyles and
their stuff and so I just was kind of

51
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:01,270
walking through the section
browsing and then something

52
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:03,610
[inaudible]

53
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,310
just stop me in my
tracks. Apparently it was,

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,090
it was really like kind of a lightning
bolt epiphany. And I just said,

55
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,850
wait a minute, maybe you are not
thinking about this straight,

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,980
you're acting as though you're 80.

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
And then it hit me that nobody knows how
much time they have to have a child is

58
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,970
to embrace a future
that you can't control.

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,650
Remember those words.

60
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,210
[inaudible]

61
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,690
so I, I, you know, I had this
come to Jesus meeting with

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,680
myself among the gargoyles and that was
when I realized I need to just take a

63
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,900
step back and try to restart the
conversation with Kelly. And so then he,

64
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,830
you know, went home and wrote
me this long letter and I just,

65
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,960
I was over and by that point I
was like, I wasn't looking back.

66
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,510
So, you know, over a few months, took
a little while, they patch things up,

67
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,390
eventually got married and
started trying to make a baby.

68
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,040
We thought that this would just happen
right away. And then of course it didn't

69
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,613
[inaudible]

70
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,910
after trying and trying the regular way,

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,440
she took drugs that make you drop a
bunch of eggs at one time. After that,

72
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:13,610
the Turkey based or method,

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,360
there's like kind of a process that they
walk you through after Turkey Beyster

74
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,640
IVF test to stuff. Yeah,

75
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,910
and I never thought that
it would get that far,

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,870
but it would go farther because after
trying IVF three times, that didn't work.

77
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,030
So they said, well you can
try it with an egg donor.

78
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,910
Meaning you get a friend who'd be
willing to donate the egg, take the egg,

79
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:34,640
put it in a dish, forcibly
impregnated with Tom Sperm.

80
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,570
Then you insert the egg into your womb
and that's kind of the magic bullet it

81
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,860
seems in fertility.

82
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,440
It's kind of like if you don't
know what's wrong with your car,

83
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:43,790
you just replaced the whole engine.

84
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,360
Kelly asked a good friend
to be an egg donor.

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,060
They've been planted the egg and
shortly after she took a pregnancy test,

86
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,750
I tested away too early. Um, and
so the line was super, super faint.

87
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,790
Wasn't even sure I could see it at all.

88
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,030
So I took a photograph of the pregnancy
test and I put it into Photoshop and I

89
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,000
actually had to dial up
the contrast to make the,

90
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,520
the line up here.

91
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,440
That is everything about this
is so high tech. Right. Wow.

92
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,590
Did you see what you wanted to see?
Yeah, and I was like, oh my God,

93
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:23,330
I think there's two lines there. So I
waited and I, and I did it a second time.

94
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,870
Um, and then I, then I told Tom

95
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,040
and did you go into like the
expectant parent mode and Oh yeah,

96
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,390
they touched up to paint. You know, I
patched the little holes in the wall.

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,050
Everything was perfect.

98
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:47,051
Everything was absolutely
perfect until it wasn't

99
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,160
five months into her pregnancy, 20 weeks,

100
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,530
which is just about halfway
cause the full term is 40.

101
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,680
Kelly was at a park
playing with her dog and

102
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,701
I just,

103
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:03,701
I felt a little bit weird and just
started to bleed like not a lot,

104
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,810
but any amount of blood
is not a good thing.

105
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,620
And I called the doctor's office
and they didn't seem too concerned.

106
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,161
They were like, yeah,

107
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,470
you probably want to go to the
hospital and get that checked.

108
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,970
And I went to pick her up then

109
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,220
[inaudible]

110
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,920
by the time we got to the
hospital, she was in a lot of pain,

111
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,830
cramping, cramping, cramping. I knew
something was really, really wrong.

112
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,740
They got me into one of those wheelchairs
and they wheeled me into the, um,

113
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,580
sort of triage room. And by that point,
like blood was just coming out of me,

114
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,420
chunks of blood coming out
of me and I didn't know,

115
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:42,590
I thought it was baby parts
like falling out and I thought,

116
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm having a miscarriage. Like the
babies kind of drop out on the floor.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,080
I was throwing up and then the
doctor came in and he looked scared.

118
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,880
There's the doctor say
something or what happened?

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,400
Um, the doctor

120
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,821
explained to me quietly,

121
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,090
there was something that was making
it difficult to stop Kelly's bleeding.

122
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,150
And if they couldn't
stop it, we might lose.

123
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:11,110
Kelly and Kelly heard the doctor
say this, and I need to tell you,

124
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,440
Kelly is the toughest, most
fearless person I've ever known.

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,660
But she grabbed my arm as hard as
anyone who's ever grabbed my arm.

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,320
And I remember just asking
him, don't let me die.

127
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,340
Please don't let me die. It
was terrifying. And then, um,

128
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,810
at some point they,

129
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,470
they brought in an ultrasound machine to
see what was going on with the baby and

130
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,150
I assume the baby was long dead. I mean,

131
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,070
I thought they were baby parts
on the floor. I didn't know.

132
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,640
And they hooked up this machine and
they were moving their on and around and

133
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:45,900
around and trying to pick up a heartbeat
and there was nothing. And, um,

134
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,820
I was apologizing to Tom,
I'm sorry, like, you know,

135
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:55,050
I just knew the baby was
gone. Then all of a sudden

136
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,460
[inaudible]

137
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,180
there, it was just as hard.

138
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,310
[inaudible]

139
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,140
this is sound. She
recorded on her cell phone.

140
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:12,980
[inaudible]

141
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,610
baby's heartbeat. Super, super fast. So
it sounds like a rabbit or something.

142
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,710
You just hear it on the Sonogram. Yeah,

143
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:23,180
this heartbeat pops up and then there's
the baby and you can see and she looks

144
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,870
fine. She's totally oblivious.
She's just right there.

145
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,220
So now I thought, oh my God,
I'm going to watch her die

146
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,610
when going watch her die
in front of me. And um,

147
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,690
then they started just pumping me
full of drugs to try to get this labor

148
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,524
stopped.

149
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,160
There's this drug called magnesium
sulfate and one of the effects of it is it

150
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,490
just makes you kind of
boil from the inside.

151
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,180
But eventually they got the contraction
stop. They got the bleeding stopped,

152
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:02,181
they put me in a hospital room and they
said get to 24 weeks because that's,

153
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:07,230
that's the limit. So
four more weeks. Yeah.

154
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,210
It was almost like they
drawn a line in the sand.

155
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,680
Like you must get to 24 or
there's no hope. And why 24?

156
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,860
What's special about that? That
number they told me that um,

157
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,050
24 weeks is kind of the loose
definition of viability.

158
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,410
[inaudible]

159
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,690
that sort of grew out of when
they were fighting out Roe v Wade

160
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,120
in Fondren birth at state for example,

161
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:35,840
the court rule that a woman who commits
an abortion on herself is guilty of no

162
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,674
crime. Okay,

163
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,240
okay, so here's the story as I understand
it Robert. Okay. In Roe v Wade,

164
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,820
the supreme court was trying
to strike this balance.

165
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:45,550
They wanted to protect a woman's
right to choose as we know, right?

166
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,160
But they also wanted to say that
there are limits to that, right,

167
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,550
that there is some moment
in the development of the
fetus in the course of this

168
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:52,384
pregnancy,

169
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,410
we crossed this line and suddenly it's
no longer just about the woman's rights.

170
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:59,110
Now you have to think about the
state's interest in the [inaudible]

171
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,740
born child. The problem of course,
it's weird you draw that line

172
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,410
now that is the million dollar
question. This is neither pharaoh honey.

173
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:11,360
She's a law professor at Duke University.

174
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,420
So the kind of best gas at that point,

175
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:18,620
the best medical objective standard
that the justices could come up with.

176
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,710
And this is in 1973 was viability and
Norton viable in this case means can it

177
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:29,240
survive on its own? Yes, outside of
the woman's womb. In other words,

178
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,120
when a fetus is developed enough that
you can take it out of the mother's room

179
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,560
and it can still survive.

180
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,300
That the court suggested is the point
when it is no longer okay to have an

181
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:42,620
abortion because of cross that
line, a fetus is quote viable.

182
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,220
So then the question was, when
does a fetus cross that line?

183
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,760
When can it survive on its own?

184
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,370
Well,

185
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,370
we begin Mr. Justice in our brief with
the development of the human embryo.

186
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,690
And here's where you get
to the 24 week thing.

187
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,680
What ended up happening was that the court
considered what was known about fetal

188
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:06,580
development. And there are charts that
show this, um, go like this. Three weeks,

189
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:09,430
the fetus was brain and heart begin
to develop eight weeks, nerve fibers,

190
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,850
13 to 16 weeks, the fetus begins
to move and then kick at 23 weeks.

191
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:17,380
Some fetuses respond to familiar, sounds
like a mother's voice and at 24 weeks

192
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:18,910
[inaudible]

193
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,100
air sacks form in the lungs.

194
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
And the thinking was
maybe that's the point,

195
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,360
the minimum point where the fetus is
viable because perhaps it could breathe on

196
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:35,050
its own. But this was
just a theoretical idea.

197
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,580
No one was testing it.

198
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,690
No one was trying to take the fetus out
of a mother at 24 weeks to see if it

199
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:44,440
would survive. In fact, throughout
the 70s and eighties most hospitals,

200
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:49,360
according to Kelly drew the line of
viability back a little bit farther at 28

201
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:49,900
weeks.

202
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,850
And that is because somewhere
around the 28th week of gestation,

203
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,330
the lungs start to produce
a fluid called surfactant,

204
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,920
which prevents the lungs from collapsing
and sticking together between breaths.

205
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,190
So that's a really important
thing. So for a long time,

206
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:10,600
the actual viability line, not
the theoretical one was 28 weeks,

207
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,640
but then in the late seventies someone
invented an artificial lung surfactant.

208
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,040
It's kind of a slippery white stuff
that they shoot down the ventilator tube

209
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,900
when the baby's born. And that
combined with Ivy Nutrition,

210
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,960
new super small ventilators moved the
line of viability back to around where it

211
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:33,350
is now. Where it is now is
generally around 24 but uh,

212
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,710
here's the thing, depending
on what hospital you're in,

213
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,630
even what doctor is on call,

214
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:42,631
sometimes it can be 23 or 25 or in some
cases 22 so given modern technology,

215
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,510
you could imagine, so there's need a
one day the line could jump way back,

216
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,610
which will make things really tricky.

217
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,830
If for example,

218
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:56,730
we get to the point where modern science
is able to develop an artificial womb.

219
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,520
Yeah. Does viability start at the
point of a fertilized egg? You know,

220
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,060
if the standard is the point at which
the developing child can actually survive

221
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:09,420
outside of the womb using any
technological intervention possible,

222
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,910
that is a slippery line. Indeed.

223
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,630
They said get to 24 weeks
because that's the limit,

224
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,900
which meant that the doctors
have to pump Kelly full of drugs,

225
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,190
keep her feet elevated for
at least another four weeks.

226
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,220
But I just kept going into labor in
and out of it and they felt like they

227
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:35,220
couldn't hold it off anymore.
And at 23 weeks and four days,

228
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,580
a doctor tells her that there's
nothing more they can do.

229
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:42,270
The baby is gonna come
in a day, maybe two.

230
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,680
The guy comes in and um, he, he,

231
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,280
he seems a little uncomfortable like
this, that was not pleasant for him.

232
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,211
He said, you know,

233
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:56,211
your baby's probably coming in 24 to 48
hours and we know how hard you work to

234
00:13:56,671 --> 00:14:00,300
have this baby and we know how much you
want this baby and we assume that you

235
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:04,260
want everything done. What does that
mean? We had no idea. So we said,

236
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,370
we're not sure if we do want everything
done. Paint the picture for us doctor.

237
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,100
And he said, you know,

238
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:15,270
there's about a 53% chance that the
baby will die no matter what we do.

239
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,230
53. Yeah. Whatever we do, whatever we do,

240
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,890
there was a small chance that she
could be fine. What were those chances?

241
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,570
About 20

242
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,670
[inaudible]

243
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,340
I felt like, like 20%
you know, it's not an,

244
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,760
it's not an impossibility. It
seems like a like a reasonable,

245
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,310
it seems like worth a gamble until you
really think about what the 80% means.

246
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:43,670
I mean, she could be on a
ventilator for the rest of her life.

247
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,780
She could have a massive bleed in her
brain and it was like eat holes in her

248
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:52,781
brain and affect her ability
to think or talk or walk.

249
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,330
She could pretty good chance
she could be blind or deaf.

250
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,420
And there was no way for
the doctors to predict.

251
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,950
But with the doctors didn't know is
that when the baby came into the world,

252
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,110
it would need a ton of medical support.
It may even need to be revived.

253
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:14,410
And so the question for the [inaudible]

254
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,540
for Tom and Kelly was, do they
want the doctors to do that?

255
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:22,680
Do they want them to pursue
every measure possible or no,

256
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,520
and just let nature take its
course? And he said it would be,

257
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,840
we should decide before the baby
came because once the baby came,

258
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,710
if we saw the baby, it would be
really hard to say no. So if,

259
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:38,850
if no was going to be the answer, we
needed to say that before the baby came.

260
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,010
Yeah, it's the worst night ever

261
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,490
and you're trying to make up your
mind about what's what's right.

262
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,690
Like would we be torturing
this baby for nothing?

263
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,280
We didn't want her to be born and have a
life that she would hate us for having.

264
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,650
There have been instances where children
with birth defects or genetic diseases

265
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,380
have filed wrongful life suits,

266
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,170
essentially claiming that they
should have never been born.

267
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,980
We had to really debate what
was in her best interests.

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,020
What would she want?

269
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,030
I started to really struggle
with whether I was being selfish,

270
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,040
whether I had already pushed too far
and this was like God or the universe

271
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,610
pushing back. Well, think we
went into pleasing our house.

272
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,320
Our marriage might break up.

273
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,160
We would lose our ability to
try again for another child.

274
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,960
I felt like I might get a baby,
but I would lose everything else.

275
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,500
And I think I got pretty close to no

276
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:46,690
[inaudible]

277
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,050
all night as we're talking
this through and yeah.

278
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,350
[inaudible]

279
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,880
crying and trying to figure it out.

280
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,210
[inaudible]

281
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,130
ah, we could hear the baby's
heartbeat through the Monitor.

282
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:00,800
[inaudible]

283
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,580
baby was letting us know all
night. I'm right here, right here.

284
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,670
[inaudible]

285
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,360
but there must've been a moment where
you had to say yes or no out loud.

286
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,840
I um, we asked for a second
opinion or not a second opinion,

287
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:25,980
but another console.

288
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,840
We had some more questions and a nurse
practitioner from the NICU came to the

289
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,830
room. Yes. My name is Diane Leisel.
I'm a neonatal nurse practitioner.

290
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,890
This is the next day had asked to speak
to someone again and set up just citing

291
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:44,820
numbers and statistics. I don't give
numbers. It's different for each baby.

292
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,700
She kinda started to paint a
picture. This is what I've seen.

293
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,400
I've been doing this 30
years. But more importantly,

294
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,520
I also told them that it
wasn't a yes or no decision.

295
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,300
[inaudible]

296
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,580
she said, you know, you don't
have to decide right now.

297
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,930
They could have the baby. The
baby came out crying and active,

298
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,400
then we should do everything we can
for the baby. But if the baby came out,

299
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,100
blue and limp intervened,
tricolor hemorrhage

300
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,870
[inaudible]

301
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,350
we could stop. We didn't
have to keep going.

302
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,600
If something goes horribly wrong,

303
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,840
we can withdraw the support and then
you could hold your baby until it dies.

304
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,380
But you can give your baby a chance
and see how it goes. In other words,

305
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,020
in a very real way, they could
give this decision to the baby.

306
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,860
That same night I was feeling
like I'm just uncomfortable.

307
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,380
A couple hours later,
discomfort turns to pain.

308
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,620
Finally a doctor came in and
was like, yeah, your labor,

309
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:50,490
we have to go right now. So then
it was like super, super quick. Oh,

310
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,290
our light shot in the spine,
cutting me open and then,

311
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,810
oh my God, there's a
third person in this room.

312
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:05,880
[inaudible]

313
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,470
but not really. Not Quite,
almost. I mean, she was so,

314
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,310
so early. And what did she look like? Um,

315
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,960
well I didn't see her then. Um,

316
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,140
I just saw like her kind of Whiz by in
an incubator and she just looked like a

317
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,000
little dark smear in a hat.

318
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,720
And did you make it to 24 weeks?
So we were one day shy of 24

319
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,430
[inaudible]

320
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,680
23 weeks and six days.

321
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,190
[inaudible]

322
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,630
we'll be back in just a moment.

323
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,560
Hi, this is Kelly friends. Tom French

324
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,394

330
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,100
I hosted esoterical talk show in
Egypt after the Arab spring until the

331
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,810
government tried to throw me in jail.

So now I live in America and I host the
podcast three made in America presented

by cafe where I interview all kinds
of outsiders from comedian Maz.

334
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:27,730
Do you run to journalist Maria in a
wholesale and filmmakers here in view?

335
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,200
And I try to use those conversations
to figure out my new country,

337
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,270
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab.

338
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:49,540
Today we're spending entire
hour on a single story,

339
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,150
which we saw in the Tampa
Bay Times. Kelly Behnam,

340
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,180
a journalist published an unbelievably
wonderful set of articles about her and

341
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,550
her husband Tom Fringe,
who was also a journalist.

342
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,490
They had a baby except their
baby came very, very early.

343
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,860
So full term, as we've
mentioned, is 40 weeks.

344
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:11,100
Their daughter arrived
23 weeks and six days,

345
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:13,960
which works out to be just a
little bit over halfway. No,

346
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:15,250
just to put that in context,

347
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,530
if a baby is born before 22 weeks,

348
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:23,100
it's generally considered a miscarriage
and pretty much no doctor is gonna

349
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,980
intervene. If a baby
is born after 25 weeks.

350
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,820
There've been all kinds of studies which
show that doctors then feel morally

351
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,120
obliged to save that life no
matter what the parents say.

352
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,950
So before 22 and after 25
things are pretty clear,

353
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,450
but between 22 and 25, you
land in this gray zone,

354
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,380
this strange little liminal
space between life and death.

355
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,190
We have to answer some really tough
questions like should my baby live at what

356
00:21:56,101 --> 00:22:00,870
cost and who gets to decide. And
ultimately when does life begin?

357
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,330
And she has shown us that
so many Kelly and Tom,

358
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:06,840
like many parents who land in this zone
decided that for the hardest question,

359
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,220
ultimately it's up to the baby.

360
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,880
The baby will tell them whether it's
going to stay or whether it's going to go.

361
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,650
So they delivered by c-section. And uh,

362
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,800
their daughter with that
point didn't have a name,

363
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:20,640
was whisked off to the neonatal
intensive care unit or the NICU.

364
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,950
And eventually they went to see her
and they incubator for the first time.

365
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,690
And she was, um, like,

366
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,380
like weirdly perfect.

367
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,543
[inaudible]

368
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,410
if she had all the parts,

369
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,210
these long fingers and long feet,

370
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,290
delicate little nose and she had hair and
fingernails and eyebrows and you know,

371
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:55,310
all the things that they're supposed
to have. But she was translucent.

372
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,940
You could just see right through her.

373
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:02,150
You could see all the veins running under
her skin and you could see her heart

374
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,940
thumping in her chest. Um,

375
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,460
and her eyes were sealed
shut like a puppy. And um,

376
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,950
she was like beat up.

377
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,690
Like she had bruises all over her body
and she had a black eye just from the,

378
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,210
you know, they were very careful
with them when they're born,

379
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:23,450
but just that very delicate handling, um,

380
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,860
kind of batters these babies
because they're so fragile. I mean,

381
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:30,950
it was like weird. Like I didn't
know how I supposed to feel.

382
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,180
I mean, you want to believe that the,
the minute you meet your daughter,

383
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:41,750
there's going to be like
butterflies, you know,

384
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,990
or like Unicorns or something. It's
supposed to be the best moment of your,

385
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,040
but there was so much
terror inside that moment.

386
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,690
I was terrified because
I love being a father.

387
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,720
My relationship with my sons is extremely
important to me and I was really

388
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:03,200
terrified that she would be so alien
having been born at 23 weeks, six days,

389
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,360
that I wouldn't recognize
her as my daughter and that
I wouldn't bond with her,

390
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:13,361
that I was now that thought was filled
me with a real dread and I went up to see

391
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:18,440
her. I could see that she was

392
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,070
only a half finished, barely a
pound at that point. So tiny.

393
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:28,160
My brain couldn't even
process how small she was.

394
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,560
And the nurse Gwen, um, she said,
well, you can touch her, you know,

395
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,370
and I was stunned because I didn't think
I would be able to. And so she had me,

396
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,440
I had already washed and sterilized my
hands once and she had me do it again.

397
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,770
She showed me how to reach in through
this little round porthole into the

398
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:49,150
incubator and explained
how to touch her. You,

399
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:52,310
you don't rub the skin because the
skin will come off if you do that.

400
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:55,400
When they're born that early
you, you just press gently.

401
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,390
And so the baby was lying
there, not with her fists,

402
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:03,290
but with her arms extended
with their palms open.

403
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,190
So her right palm was right there.
When I reached my left hand,

404
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,830
Dan and I just put my,

405
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,100
my left finger gently into her
poem and she just grabbed on tight.

406
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,143
Mm.

407
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,900
And in that moment, um,

408
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,290
[inaudible]

409
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,670
all my fears about not being able
to bond with her washed away.

410
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,540
And um,

411
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,380
hi. Uh, what, what got to me was

412
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,763
how

413
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,950
I could be so afraid.

414
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,930
Oh, when she was so strong and

415
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:58,110
at that point I just,

416
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:02,670
she was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen and I told her,

417
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,370
hey, peanut daddy.

418
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,610
So that's why my daughter, yeah.

419
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
When a baby is this early,

420
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,050
the parents and the doctors are watching
it very carefully trying to guess,

421
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:25,030
is this baby ready to be out in the world?
Is it going to make it? And Tom says,

422
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:28,450
when she grabbed his finger,
that wasn't just them bonding,

423
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:31,510
he felt like she was saying something.

424
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,090
She made her will very, very clear.

425
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,150
Baby declared itself like
declared its will to live.

426
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,240
And that was a phrase we
heard again and again.

427
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,980
Some babies will for can use the term
to declare themselves over the first few

428
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,950
hours and days of their
life. That's a neonatologist.

429
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:48,330
We spoke to Keith Barrington,

430
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,500
you get a gut feeling and that's Diane
Lez elegant and the nurse practitioner.

431
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:58,070
After meeting the baby that this one
looks very fragile or this one can do it,

432
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,160
the baby's declared itself. Now
there's a real question as to like,

433
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,840
what does that mean?

434
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,380
What are you seeing when something that
prematurely declares itself and here we

435
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,350
ran into a real difference.

436
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:15,351
Parents will often see will in a credible
will and resolve doctors and nurses.

437
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,070
No, not so much. That sounds
a bit too mystical for me.

438
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,020
I wouldn't take it as there's a voice
inside the baby saying I'm going to be a

439
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:29,160
fighter. I'm not one is sick enough
not to be able to fight and one isn't.

440
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,010
Can you see a spirit in it in a kid?

441
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,060
Can I think you can see for
some fight, I call it spunk.

442
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,900
A lot of times that is Tracey
Hollet. I'm a registered nurse.

443
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,590
She was Kelly and Tom's primary nurse
at all children's hospital and like

444
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:46,470
everyone we spoke to on the hospital
side, when it comes to this issue,

445
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,180
she chooses her words very carefully.

446
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,740
I maybe try to keep things a little bit
more neutral than talking about their

447
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:53,730
will to live.

448
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,810
Because you know a baby at 23 weeks
barely has folds on the outside of its

449
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:00,030
brain. Its brain is still
smooth for the most part.

450
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,510
So who knows what it's capable
of thinking or feeling? Oh,

451
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:04,890
that's a difficult question.

452
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,990
And the truth is things like fight
spunk may just boil down to physiology.

453
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,050
Maybe that baby had a few
more lung buds to start with.

454
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,410
Maybe it had an easier time and utero
may have nothing to do with will.

455
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:20,220
In fact the baby grasping
the finger of the parent,

456
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,290
it's actually a reflex

457
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,180
[inaudible]

458
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,130
that the babies have a grasp reflex.

459
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,120
I never tell a parent that because they
think it's an intentional movement.

460
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,490
Because you know, putting
yourself in the parent's head,

461
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:35,130
if you've gotta decide how
much am I going to push,

462
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,190
how much of my heart am I going
to pour into this little creature?

463
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,660
Maybe if you can see something like
will or something like intention,

464
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,840
if you see, oh, that's a person in
there. Or maybe if you don't see it,

465
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,970
maybe it's the only way you got to
make this decision. Yes. My wife,

466
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,800
the professional ethicists often says,

467
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,690
we don't make important decisions in our
life for rational reasons. Very often,

468
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,710
no. Keith and his wife, Annie,

469
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,690
John VA have done a huge amount of
research into the ethics of extremely

470
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:03,620
premature births.

471
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,960
But one of the primary reasons we wanted
to talk to him is that in addition to

472
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:12,590
being a neonatologist and a guy who
publishes a lot of stuff in this area,

473
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,950
he and his wife recently had a baby girl
who was born at 24 weeks and five days

474
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,900
[inaudible] 20 grams, one
and a half pounds. And, uh,

475
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,140
she was actually in my
own and ICU. Oh Wow.

476
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,140
I was actually the director
of the unit where she was

477
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,000
[inaudible].

478
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,500
So he was in his unit into the place
where he usually worked. He saw babies,

479
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,450
make it not make it,

480
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:41,770
and now suddenly he
was a parent that place

481
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,960
and several weeks after his
baby was born, there was a very,

482
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:51,670
very big complication. She actually
didn't move at all for about 36 hours.

483
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,030
How many thought maybe it was a
little and maybe it's time. Yeah,

484
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,590
so they decided he and
his wife to let her go.

485
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,250
Yeah,

486
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,060
peacefully.

487
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,410
But I went back into the en ICU
to see ya in something happened.

488
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:13,240
He looked down and he saw her lips move.

489
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,540
[inaudible]

490
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,570
barely just thought he was sucking on
a suitor that the nurse had put in her

491
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:21,230
mouth. She was sucking on a
pacifier and it was just a reflex.

492
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,860
The most basic baby reflex, the
sucking reflex. He knew that,

493
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,710
but just that movement
to slicking on the Sioux,

494
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:32,210
that changed his mind completely.
I went and bank to Manny and said,

495
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,610
we can't stop. A really neat to, to
continuing and give her the chance.

496
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,140
But you knew that some of the
sucking responses and not,

497
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,430
that's a fairly deep brain.
Yes. It's a very basic,

498
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,310
it's just the brainstem is not, you know,

499
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,250
you and you need a lot more than be
able to suck to, to, um, to do well.

500
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,930
But as I say, I was trying
to be the parent there or
not then in etiologist. Oh,

501
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,650
could you remember if the doctor in
you was surprised at the father in you?

502
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,550
Yeah, I think I was
actually a little, yeah.

503
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:09,551
I think if I had to have
been more evidence based
and rational and scientific,

504
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,450
um, I, I could have gone either
way, but just as a father,

505
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:16,220
I couldn't at that point let it go.

506
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,230
I just didn't really
know how to process it.

507
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,800
I felt like she was,

508
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,590
I just had this very acute sense that
she had just been like violently ripped

509
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:33,730
out of my body and I could feel
where they had cut her out,

510
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,260
you know?

511
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,260
And like I just wanted to put
her back and make her safe,

512
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,750
you know? Yeah. And I had had all
these questions going through my head,

513
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,590
like, you know,

514
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,510
like how long does she have to live for
us to get a birth certificate for this

515
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:55,670
to be real. Like I felt
like she might die and, and,

516
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,650
and like, it wouldn't count and
I, and I wouldn't be a mother,

517
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,000
you know what I mean? And,
and like what if she died?

518
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:07,850
Like what would happen? Like
what do we have a funeral?

519
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,440
They make caskets the size of shoe
boxes. I mean, all, he's like,

520
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,740
it's so screwed up that that's
the stuff you think about,

521
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:18,980
but your brain goes places you
just can't control or predict.

522
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,490
Um, and if she, I want
her to like, if she knew,

523
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,160
was she really aware that
I was even standing there?

524
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:30,380
Like was it just a reflex that made her,

525
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:34,130
grabbed my finger and when she grabbed
it, did she know that you know,

526
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:37,400
I was there and if she didn't know I was
there, did she wonder where I had gone?

527
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,150
Hmm.

528
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,230
Did she feel alone? And then she's scared.

529
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,380
Oh, she could really do at that
point, we'll sit with those questions.

530
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,840
And it just became this waiting game.

531
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,820
A

532
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,600
[inaudible] [inaudible]
continuing about moment.

533
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,000
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

534
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,690
This is radio lab and we are spending
the whole hour with Tampa Bay Times

535
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:37,680
reporter at Kelly Bennom and her husband
Tom French and the story that they're

536
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:42,681
telling us to bet this limbo a space
that's literally between life and death.

537
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,390
We have to tackle some
really big questions. Yeah.
Oh the, here's an easy one.

538
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,470
Tom, when did you decide to name your
daughter? Juniper [inaudible]? About

539
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,860
about five days after she was
born. No, in those five days,

540
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:01,050
pretty much everything
in their lives changed.

541
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,690
I mean on the most superficial level,

542
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:06,470
they began their hospital stay
days zero in the maternity ward,

543
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,280
which had butterflies on the
walls and images of roses opening.

544
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,783
And um,

545
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,740
everyone's really good looking like in
an er sort of way or like in a Grey's

546
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,500
anatomy kind of way. We had
like one super hot nurse,

547
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,250
we called her cupcake and she had
this like glossy hair and you know,

548
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,520
people would visit me. They'd be
like, Hey, is cupcake here with,

549
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:33,560
is cupcake? Come on by. And so that's
where their hospital journey began.

550
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:37,010
But five days later everything had
changed and they find themselves on a

551
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:42,011
different floor of the hospital stranded
in this unit that is perhaps more than

552
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:46,160
any other place on earth. The
physical embodiment of this limbo,

553
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,080
the neonatal intensive care unit,

554
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:53,110
the NICU where they just have to wait and
hope that that will or whatever it was

555
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:57,000
they saw in juniper takes hold.

556
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,450
We had been like yanked out of our
lives and out of everything that we

557
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:08,000
recognized, you know,

558
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,420
out of our jobs at our
house and we just been

559
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,670
okay

560
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,640
dropped into this like science fiction,

561
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,800
nothing was recognizable babies
that even look like babies,

562
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,300
you know there was one baby that had
his intestines be outside of his body,

563
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,240
like piled up on his
belly like in this back

564
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,560
and everyone's wearing uniform,
don't know who anyone is

565
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,980
and everything like

566
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,330
beeping and humming and

567
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,080
you don't know how long you're going to
be there and you don't have any sense of

568
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:50,580
time. Like day and night don't
mean anything. And you know,

569
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,660
we're sort of dimly aware of the Sun
rising and setting out the window.

570
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,560
But other than that, it's just,

571
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,410
it's just like minute
to minute, hour to hour.

572
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,090
You're afraid to leave even for you for
an hour to get some lunch because the

573
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,170
baby could die.

574
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,870
You know, if we went home to get
some sleep, would she, would she die?

575
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,820
I mean is that critical? And

576
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,170
she had roughly five, six
days that went pretty well.

577
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,370
And then that next weekend

578
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,880
blew a hole on our intestines.

579
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,960
That was the real beginning
of a lot of problems.

580
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,160
And her belly turned dark
and got real distended.

581
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:39,190
They were inserting drains in the belly
to try to drain away the stool and gunk.

582
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,970
And she just had this little straw
sticking out of her belly and then they

583
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,770
couldn't maintain her blood pressure.

584
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,330
So I was thinking of
everything I could do,

585
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,700
cause you don't want to feel
powerless in a situation like that.

586
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:56,530
You want to feel like
there's something you can do.

587
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,570
So in quiet moments with Tom would do
chapter one, the boy who lived his,

588
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:06,190
he would stand over juniper incubator
and he would read her Harry Potter,

589
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,920
Mr and Mrs Dursley of
number four privet drive.

590
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,610
We're proud to say that they were
perfectly normal. Thank you very much.

591
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,510
They were the last people you'd expect
to be involved in anything strange or

592
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:20,230
mysterious. As I started reading
to her and as the days went on,

593
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,820
she has no idea what I'm reading.
Right. But there is something there that

594
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,130
she responded to. I wanted
to say she liked because her,

595
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,670
her sat number would go high
at that point. Her sat number,

596
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,970
what is it like her oxygen, the
saturation of oxygen in our blood. Ah,

597
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,270
Tim says that number on the monitor was
one of the only ways that they could get

598
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:42,660
feedback about how she was doing. Because
you know, her eyes were still closed.

599
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,750
There'd be times when she wasn't moving
around a lot. The higher the number,

600
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:48,870
the better. And he says
when he would read to her,

601
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,420
her numbers would go up. Not
just slowly but instantly.

602
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,190
But then when I got deeper into the story,

603
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,060
I read in Haggard's voice
buyout it, professor Dumbledore,

604
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:07,061
Sir said the giant climbing carefully
off the motorcycle as he spoke and she

605
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:09,650
decided instantly

606
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,970
and the alarms are just going off and
going off and Kelly hit me and she said,

607
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:15,960
you're scaring the baby.

608
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,410
And I'm like, what do you,

609
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:22,530
what you could see even before her eyes
opened that she was really responding to

610
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:29,230
what we were doing. She didn't know a
chapter is, but she was in her own way,

611
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,880
very eagerly waiting for the
next chapter and I don't know,

612
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:35,800
a better way to describe to be alive.

613
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,080
Then you want to find out what
happens next. Unfortunately,

614
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,610
what happens next is that one night at
around two o'clock in the morning on a

615
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:47,770
rear, NYPA Bay actually
went to sleep at home.

616
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,060
They get a call from their doctor in his
first question was how far do you live

617
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:54,690
from the hospital? And yeah,

618
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:57,040
that's not a question you want to
hear from your child's doctor. Leave,

619
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,420
like rushed to the hospital.
And, um, when they get there,

620
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,540
they were told that she did it
again. She got another hole,

621
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,680
neither hold her intestines and
she started to really spiral

622
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,870
[inaudible]

623
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,090
I it really go downhill. Her blood
pressure and oxygen levels were crashing.

624
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,520
She was on a hundred percent oxygen.

625
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:21,280
The ventilator settings were turned up
as high as they could go and she was

626
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,290
still struggling and
faltering and you know,

627
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:25,510
once they are giving your
baby a hundred percent oxygen,

628
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:27,850
they can't give her any
more. At that point,

629
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,430
I had done everything
that I could possibly do.

630
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,300
This is Fauzia Shaquille neonatologist
at all children's hospital.

631
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,920
She was Juniper's doctor at the time.

632
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:38,680
She said she'd given juniper everything
she could think of, blood pressure,

633
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:41,410
medicine, antibiotics. She'd
put a drain in her abdomen,

634
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,860
but obviously it was not enough. If
something was wrong, instead of be wrong,

635
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,210
we might lose her at any second.

636
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,320
The only option left to take her to
the operating room with car open,

637
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,840
clear the intestines,
relieve the pressure.

638
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,230
How do you do a surgery on a one
pound baby? Seems no, exactly.

639
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,380
I mean you don't, she was so
extremely premature, so fragile,

640
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,590
so tiny. That operating
seemed kind of crazy.

641
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,590
And Dr Shaquille began to really
consider the idea that maybe this was,

642
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:15,260
it had at that point. Um,

643
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,370
I was at bedside looking at her, um,

644
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,270
trying to figure out what
to do and all of a sudden

645
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,630
[inaudible]

646
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,650
she opened her eyes.

647
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,500
Really?

648
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,360
Yeah. She opened her eyes.
Why? And she looked at us,

649
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,940
her eyes were like wide open and she
was looking right at the doctor directly

650
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,010
staring at her hard. And uh,
it was a very powerful moment.

651
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:49,570
[inaudible]

652
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,110
Dr Shaquille says she decided right then
and there. Well, going into surgery,

653
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,160
I think she deserves a chance to tell me
more about why you made that decision.

654
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:58,970
Oh, well,

655
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,970
typically babies who are that critical
or they're totally unresponsive.

656
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,180
Yeah.

657
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Because they're just fighting for every
breath and the ability to just open her

658
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:14,480
eyes at that stage in her life when
she had no blood pressure that I could

659
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,800
barely record when she had hardly any
oxygen for her to just open her eyes and

660
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:22,400
look at us. It was a very powerful
statement that I'm still here.

661
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:28,030
I'm here, I am still here, don't
give up. So Dr Shaquille Summon,

662
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,820
the pediatric surgeon told her they
want to move forward with the operation,

663
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,220
but the surgeon, no

664
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,680
[inaudible]

665
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,750
the surgeon was adamant that she did
not want to do it. She said it's Eh,

666
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,730
it's few title and it's um, she,

667
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:47,630
her blood pressure's so unstable that
she will not make it out of the Er.

668
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,630
And the surgeon told her, yeah,

669
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,000
even if I can open her up and do the job,

670
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,810
her skin is so papery that I might
not be able to set her back up.

671
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,670
There are guidelines that medical
industries have even basic things like the

672
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:03,700
hippocratic oath do no harm. That's
law professor and emphasis. Nita,

673
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,710
Farrah honey. Again,

674
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:09,710
many physicians legitimately believe
that if you have a preterm and fence and

675
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,080
that infant is in serious
peril of spending a life of
suffering and pain and the

676
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:21,330
only way to do no harm and fulfill
your oath is not to do the surgery.

677
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,690
But she says, if you ask
the courts, you know,

678
00:42:24,691 --> 00:42:27,900
right now the law favors life.

679
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,040
The courts have seen very few cases
that involve disputes like this,

680
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,660
but in every one so far,

681
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:38,190
she says they've supported the person
who's arguing to keep the child alive.

682
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,170
I never, there's life. There's hope.
So this is our window. We should do it.

683
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:44,850
Now for Dr Shaquille,

684
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:48,360
the argument that ultimately
won the day was simply this.

685
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,720
Basically what I told her was that
if you think she's going to die,

686
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,980
well he is dying right now
as we speak in the unit.

687
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,370
So we can either do nothing and she
definitely dies or we can do something and

688
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:03,150
she probably dies. But you never
know. There is a slim chance.

689
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,740
So they're wheeling the incubator with
the baby in it and I'm holding her little

690
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:09,570
hand and she's getting
ready to go into surgery.

691
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:14,520
And she was looking right at me.
And she hadn't done that before.

692
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:14,881
I mean,

693
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:19,230
it really seemed like she was aware that
I was there very clearly and she was

694
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:22,380
locked on my face. So I, we know her.

695
00:43:22,381 --> 00:43:26,310
I gave her a little kiss on her forehead
and Tom did the same thing and then

696
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:30,690
they wheeled her away. How
long was the operation?

697
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,030
It was, we, they,

698
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,750
they co they paged us much more
quickly than we expect it to come back.

699
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,750
So we knew something was wrong.

700
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,690
The nurse assured Tom and
Kelly into a separate room,

701
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,400
this little windowless conference room
and the surgeon came in and she said,

702
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:51,630
you know, I, um,

703
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,470
she was supposed to go in
and clean everything out
and rinse everything off and

704
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:57,900
find the hole and patch it
and, and do all these things.

705
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,740
And she said when she cut the baby open
and touched the baby's intestines with

706
00:44:04,651 --> 00:44:08,130
her, a little probe, she's, the way she
described it was everything fell apart.

707
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:12,990
It was just falling apart and falling
apart. And you're hearing this. Yeah,

708
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,490
juniper had survived the
operation, but barely.

709
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,160
So we're thinking like, okay,

710
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:24,780
this was an incredibly risky surgery and
we just put her through it for nothing

711
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,060
either. I thought there was no way
that bay was gonna live til morning.

712
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,290
I had been really

713
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:36,760
working hard to avoid thinking about all
the bad things that were possibly going

714
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:39,130
to happen here. Just trying
to hold on, you know,

715
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,300
and I sort of thought it was my job
to do that and I'm just kind of funny,

716
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,310
kind of stereotypically male of me. Um,

717
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,550
and uh,

718
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,790
and Tom says they were in the car
around the time of the surgery as we're

719
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:59,440
driving, you know, by that time Junebug
and I were about two thirds of the way.

720
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:04,150
So the first book and this
thought just snuck in on me,

721
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:04,984
which was,

722
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,310
what if I don't get to
finish reading her this book?

723
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,770
What if she doesn't
get to hear the ending?

724
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,363
Okay.

725
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,860
And you know, she never finds out.
You know, what happens to Harry,

726
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,003
Hermione and Ron

727
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,880
that thought led in all the other flats,

728
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,210
very difficult thoughts about all the
things we wouldn't get to do with her.

729
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:36,890
She wouldn't ever get to know.

730
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,740
And I had this terrible thought that,
you know, she was in this incubator,

731
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:44,660
this isolated this plastic box.

732
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:48,620
And I had this terrible thought that
she was just going to go from one box to

733
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,454
another.

734
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,153
Hmm.

735
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,560
And I had to pull over, you
know, cause I just lost it. And

736
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:02,250
at that point I wasn't maintaining
anymore. There was no holding back.

737
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:05,390
This flood of, uh, of,
of what was happening.

738
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,420
And we had a rural Kelly and I, which is
that only one of us got to lose it at,

739
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,690
at a time. And you know,
that was my turn to lose it.

740
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,960
We're in a very unnatural situation
of neonatal intensive care,

741
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:21,910
which is so recent in the developed world
and still doesn't exist in much of the

742
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:26,830
world. And we're working so
hard to save babies is very new

743
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,240
neonatologist, Keith, Barrington
and evolutionary history.

744
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:35,650
Newborn babies very frequently
died. And most parents who have a,

745
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,790
any significant number of children
had lost one or two or three or more.

746
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:45,340
And in order to be able to carry on with
your life and to provide for the rest

747
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:48,550
of your family, we had to be able
to adapt to the death of babies.

748
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:52,360
And now that has become much
less common to lose a baby,

749
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,430
even no miscarriages and stillbirths,

750
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,320
to now we realizing how much
that hurts. And in the past,

751
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:01,390
maybe we've hidden some
of that from ourselves.

752
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,230
No way that bay was going
to live til morning.

753
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,570
But what happened was really strange.

754
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,740
She continued to just not die

755
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:20,530
[inaudible]

756
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,260
and the next day she, you
know, she was still there.

757
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:26,750
Okay.

758
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:31,330
The surgeon was surprised and
no one can quite explain it.

759
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,830
The more I thought about it,

760
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:37,150
the more I found it like surprising
and interesting, you know,

761
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:42,010
because she doesn't know
that there's a better place,

762
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,750
you know that she's
just in this box. Yeah.

763
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,520
And she's gotten needles
coming out of every which way,

764
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,440
and tube down her throat.

765
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,970
She has no idea that one day, you know,

766
00:47:55,330 --> 00:48:00,330
she'll just be held and rocked and then
we'll take her out for ice cream and

767
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,950
she'll play with the dog.

768
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,110
And I just wondered like
what is she fighting for?

769
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:15,480
[inaudible]

770
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,610
and so that became, you know, our job,

771
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,010
the best that we can articulate it
was to try to give her some sense of

772
00:48:26,011 --> 00:48:27,510
something beyond that place.

773
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,580
After the surgery, things
did not get easier.

774
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,460
She would stop breathing many times a day.

775
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,640
Teams would rush into the state, come
on g, but come back, come back. I just,

776
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,650
I remember the room spinning and then
she started to swell for like weeks and

777
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,400
weeks, but she continued to not
die and she began to gain weight.

778
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,650
And you know, nurses are very
superstitious. A lot of them,

779
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,780
they won't say the word at home

780
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,660
for some reason. When the baby's here,
that word is Tracey. Hold it again.

781
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,460
Primary nurse, they get sick and we
just, it's a superstition obviously,

782
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:10,440
but something happens and
sometimes it can be devastating.

783
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,970
So what do you say instead?

784
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,800
We'll say that place that the baby's
going to go when they leave here. Wow.

785
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,370
I got so tortured. Sometimes we spell
it, which makes no sense at all.

786
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Um, after about four and
a half months, Diane,

787
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:28,850
that nurse Practitioner told us that we
might want to think about buying a car

788
00:49:28,851 --> 00:49:31,940
seat. That was the first

789
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:37,460
inclination that we might be
able to take her out of there.

790
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,060
That's the first time I've ever imagined
a choir of angels singing around

791
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,600
mention of Carthy. Carseats
right. But when you're,

792
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,360
when you want to have a baby really bad
and everybody else has a baby but you

793
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:48,440
and you can't have a baby.

794
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,820
Things like shopping for car seats
become like fantasies, you know, like,

795
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,620
and finally, you know,

796
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:59,621
the doctor gave the all clear and we
took the monitors off of her and she was

797
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,710
completely free and untethered,
not hooked to anything.

798
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:11,120
And we strapped her into this car seat
and I put a little pair of sunglasses on

799
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:11,954
her

800
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,220
cause I didn't know if her eyes
would be okay in the sunlight.

801
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,100
She'd never seen the sun. Wow.

802
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,240
And we all kind of walked out. And um,

803
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:28,220
Tracy's is really not a hugger, but we
like grabbed her, hugged her and cried

804
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,840
and all over her shirt.

805
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,110
And then we put the baby in the
car and we went to chick-fil-a.

806
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,990
Yeah, that was totally
before the gay thing,

807
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:42,080
before I stopped going
into filet and all in all,

808
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:45,260
how long were you in the hospital
for? Six and a half months.

809
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,350
I was 196 days.

810
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,140
How is your super now what? What is, can
you give us a snapshot of her morning?

811
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,553
Sure.

812
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,420
Actually Tom and Kelly
were nice enough to, uh,

813
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,940
allow us to send a reporter to their house

814
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,700
to meet her cousin.
She's two years old now.

815
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,130
[inaudible] hi, June book.

816
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:22,290
That's Jennifer [inaudible] say hi.

817
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:28,300
When we got there, she was still, she
was still in bed. It was just waking up.

818
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:32,290
She's not being very cuddly
this morning. Snippy.

819
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,480
But then she just sprung up,

820
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,540
jumped out of bed and took off.

821
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,080
Huh? Yeah. You went to Daddy.

822
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,580
Isn't that funny? Hoses.

823
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,080
Come on, show me where the kitty is.

824
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:10,810
I know you want to give
the kitty a hug. She is,

825
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:14,980
he don't look nice.

826
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:21,760
She's kind of your typical two
year old. [inaudible] Chantal.

827
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,340
And because we were their juniper,

828
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,240
it felt it was kind of important that
we see some tricks. She's learned.

829
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,853
Oh,

830
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,180
is radio. So they have no idea what
you just did. Even somersaults,

831
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,660
you know, it's, it's interesting
because as journalists again, we,

832
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:55,860
we spend a lot of time chronicling
sometimes very terrible things.

833
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,713
And uh,

834
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,250
what's interesting is that through
the chair yesterday morning,

835
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,550
by journalistic standards,
nothing happened, you know,

836
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:10,110
we need to do is change your
name. It was, it was, it was,

837
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,350
wouldn't even be on journalistic way doc.

838
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:17,040
Oh Huh. But what, you know,

839
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,450
as a parent comes in, especially after
you've been through what we went through,

840
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,160
if you come and see Mommy, I'm
on kiss. You was everything.

841
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:28,963
Come on Kesha.

842
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,950
Nothing you can do about
it either. We ready one.

843
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,220
Everything happened yesterday
in those couple of hours,

844
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,590
the entire world was contained
inside that morning. Okay.

845
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,960
Of Eskimo kisses and all of her

846
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,930
[inaudible] now all the blank chapters
of her life were inside that morning

847
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,040
waiting to be written. Huh?

848
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:57,040
Which, what you want this
book to me and it's called.

849
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,970
Oh. And do you feel like you're
out of the woods? Well, um,

850
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,910
both Tom and Kelly said no way.

851
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:08,690
And then Tom told us about these
flu shots that juniper gets.

852
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,200
They're not just flu shots.
They're like, um, flu shots,

853
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:13,760
like super flu shots and they,

854
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:18,710
there's four shots you get and I swear
to God that costs $14,000 for those four

855
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:23,470
shots. And that is, that's a real number.
You just said that's a fact. That's,

856
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,760
yes, they are designed to
help protect her from a RSV,

857
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:32,660
which is a virus that in most people
just presents as a common cold.

858
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,590
But you know,

859
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:37,610
her lungs are still recovering and
are still developing and RSV can be

860
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:42,080
devastating and there are
some other concerns that
could still creep in down the

861
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:45,890
road. Some studies have shown that
kids who were born prematurely, uh,

862
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,890
struggle more in school
with reading and math.

863
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,630
That's often they're more susceptible
to depression and anxiety.

864
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,220
But I will say that, um,

865
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:01,610
we took her to visit a preschool the other
day and we took her there and sat her

866
00:55:01,611 --> 00:55:06,611
down and she just took off and like went
up to these giant children and started

867
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:13,280
taking their toys and they were seeing
the wheels on the bus and you could see

868
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:13,761
it in her eyes.

869
00:55:13,761 --> 00:55:18,761
I know that song and she didn't
care about Tom or I one bit,

870
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,551
you know,

871
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:24,551
she was totally there with those kids
and she was so ready and I thought,

872
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,940
wow, she might be okay.

873
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,293
She is okay.

874
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:42,160
[inaudible]

875
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,780
and now for an update, um,

876
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:49,620
we originally aired this story in 2013
when juniper was to here's tape from just

877
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:51,210
a few months ago.

878
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:55,600
Right. How old are you?
Huh? Four. Oh my gosh.

879
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,570
You're about to turn five
in April and do that.

880
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:04,390
What's going to happen when
you turn five? Oh, lable Oh,

881
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:08,230
Earl Jones. [inaudible] wow.

882
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,550
Juniper is about to start
kindergarten and um,

883
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,520
her and Tom and Kelly live in Indiana now.

884
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,120
We're Tom and Kelly teach journalism
at the Indiana University media school.

885
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,120
I actually happened to be
in Indiana just yesterday,

886
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:23,770
so I hooked with Tom and Kelly.

887
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:28,390
We stood on the side of a busy street
in downtown Bloomington and they gave me

888
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:31,720
an update and they told me that in the
nearly three years since we heard this

889
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,500
story,

890
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,290
and this is generally not what you would
expect from a baby born that early.

891
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,890
Um, physically we have had

892
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,810
shockingly few problems.
Like she, she hasn't had any,

893
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,980
I gotta knock on some wood
somewhere. She never had like a,

894
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:52,940
a horrible bout of the flu or was
never back in the hospital. Um,

895
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:58,310
her kidneys are a little bit small
and they're watching that, but

896
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,490
there's a savagery to her.
It's true. That is amazing.

897
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:08,150
They told me that she's
this extremely headstrong,

898
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:12,720
active child really into climbing
trees. How did you get up there?

899
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:17,780
You climb, but you're so high up.

900
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,670
Sh like she goes horseback
riding. She does gymnastics.

901
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,110
Does she have some awareness
of the incredible journey
she went through just to

902
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:29,950
be four and a half? Do you guys
talk about it with her each night?

903
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,680
We talk about it because
every night she asks, Oh,

904
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,230
tell me the story about when I was
a widow, tiny baby in the hospital.

905
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,930
Tell me about when I was sick. Tell me
about when I had the hole in my tummy.

906
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:49,210
So you know, for a long time I would just
tell her the story. When you're born,

907
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:51,520
you're born very early,

908
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,460
a lot more early than you
were supposed to be born.

909
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,820
We just super extra small or her.

910
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,930
I called the hospital over
the summer and I said, hey,

911
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:05,410
like every night we were talking
about this, can I show her the NICU?

912
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,270
Like would you let me just show her the
space and what an incubator looks like.

913
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,530
And they were amazing about it.

914
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:15,670
And so they set up an incubator in an
empty room and they let her come in and

915
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:16,600
just play in the room.

916
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,780
And she took her a little doll baby
that I ordered for her on Primi doll,

917
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:27,880
baby.com or whatever that's like the size
and weight that she was when she was a

918
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:30,360
baby. Oh, is that a real thing?
It's a real thing, you know?

919
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,240
So I got her the stall that's so she
could get an idea of how small she was.

920
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,590
I don't know. I thought it
would be useful someday.

921
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,690
So she took it to the NICU and she put
it in the incubator and we showed her how

922
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:44,680
we would reach our hands through the
little portholes and hold her hand.

923
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:47,530
And she reached in and held her
little babies, little cloth hand.

924
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,310
And then because she's juniper
and of course she would do this,

925
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:56,311
she climbed into the freaking incubator
and laid down and asked Tracy the nurse

926
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:59,860
to close the lid. Whoa. Yeah.

927
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,150
Well like she, what was that
like for you? Was that like,

928
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,230
was that like traumatic flashback
or was that like really cool?

929
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,950
And she said at one point during the
visit, this woman walked by the room

930
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:15,050
and she kinda stuck her head in the
doorway and her eyes were all red and she

931
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:15,980
had that look about her.

932
00:59:15,981 --> 00:59:20,981
Like she was a couple
days postpartum and I was,

933
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,460
I thought, Oh God, you know, Tracy
kind of whisper in her ear. Then Tracy,

934
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:28,790
the nurse and um, she looked
at Jennifer and she said,

935
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,790
oh my God, she's so beautiful.

936
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:37,790
And then she told us that she had just
had a baby if few days before that was

937
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,890
born at 23 weeks and six days.

938
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,640
[inaudible] hi, hey baby. Hey

939
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,223
Baby.

940
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,700
Now speaking of that, a specific
chunk of time, 23 weeks, six days,

941
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,840
we ended up checking back in with
Nita ferry honney professor of law and

942
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:02,570
philosophy at Duke University about
that whole viability question,

943
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:06,980
like that line of when a
preterm infant comes viable,

944
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,450
which at the time we did the story
seemed to be roughly around 24 weeks on

945
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:13,130
average. Has that changed at all?

946
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,880
And she pointed us to a study that was
done in 2015 which did sort of a big

947
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:21,881
survey of outcomes for preterm infants
and it basically argued that we might

948
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:24,050
want to push that line back even further.

949
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:28,950
The study author believes that 22 weeks
is the new standard for viability and

950
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:32,910
that 23 weeks and 23 weeks and
six days that that's too late.

951
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:37,800
She says, this is now the new
conversation, 22 weeks, not 24.

952
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:38,781
Um, you know,

953
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:43,400
this is something that physicians and
hospitals were being educated about and

954
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:48,140
look at. We're already at 22 weeks, um,
you know, and, and it's just been, what,

955
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:52,230
two years since we last talked about
this? Yeah. Three years at most, right?

956
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:56,270
I mean, so in three years, if
we've moved back two weeks, um,

957
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:58,270
then talk to me in another way,

958
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,670
a quarter of a century and
we'll be at the beginning,

959
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,230
she thinks it's just a matter of time
before we get to that artificial womb.

960
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,150
Maybe case Lessing I'll say by way of
updates is that Tom and Kelly are about to

961
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:13,060
release a book about their
experience. It's called juniper.

962
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,810
And normally I'm not one to Gush,
but this book is something else.

963
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:21,520
Like we got into this story because of
some really haunting articles that Kelly

964
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:24,040
had written for the Tampa Bay Times. Uh,

965
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:27,370
and this book takes those articles so
much farther goes into way more detail

966
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:31,750
than we could ever get into a it is,
yeah, it's totally worth reading.

967
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,630
