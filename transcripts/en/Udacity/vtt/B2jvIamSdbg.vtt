00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is if you give the ball some initial velocity,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
it will go farther in that first second of travel.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay. But how much farther is always the question in physics.

00:00:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
How much? Let's quantify.
