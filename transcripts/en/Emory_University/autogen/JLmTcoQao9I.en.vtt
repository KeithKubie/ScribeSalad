University

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610
 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.449
we were interested in looking at how

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459
we were interested in looking at how
 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.609
we were interested in looking at how
much added sugars were being consumed in

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:14.619
much added sugars were being consumed in
 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.560
much added sugars were being consumed in
the United States because we had

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570
the United States because we had
 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.510
the United States because we had
recently done a couple studies where we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520
recently done a couple studies where we
 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.179
recently done a couple studies where we
looked at the association's of added

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189
looked at the association's of added
 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.790
looked at the association's of added
sugars with markers of cardiovascular

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800
sugars with markers of cardiovascular
 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.760
sugars with markers of cardiovascular
disease risk and in those days we had

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770
disease risk and in those days we had
 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.069
disease risk and in those days we had
found that the more added sugars people

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079
found that the more added sugars people
 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.049
found that the more added sugars people
consume the worse their cardiovascular

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059
consume the worse their cardiovascular
 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.330
consume the worse their cardiovascular
disease risk and that was true in adults

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340
disease risk and that was true in adults
 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.540
disease risk and that was true in adults
and in children but over the last decade

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550
and in children but over the last decade
 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.340
and in children but over the last decade
especially there's been a lot of public

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350
especially there's been a lot of public
 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.560
especially there's been a lot of public
health awareness and I think people are

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570
health awareness and I think people are
 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.480
health awareness and I think people are
starting to get the message about sugars

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490
starting to get the message about sugars
 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.670
starting to get the message about sugars
so we were interested to look and see if

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680
so we were interested to look and see if
 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.040
so we were interested to look and see if
we could understand where the sugars

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050
we could understand where the sugars
 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.540
we could understand where the sugars
were coming from and whether these

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550
were coming from and whether these
 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.270
were coming from and whether these
sources were getting better or whether

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280
sources were getting better or whether
 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.490
sources were getting better or whether
we were consuming more over time as a

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500
we were consuming more over time as a
 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.120
we were consuming more over time as a
society we actually found some what I

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130
society we actually found some what I
 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.850
society we actually found some what I
think is good news so added sugars as a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860
think is good news so added sugars as a
 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.280
think is good news so added sugars as a
whole consumed by people in the united

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290
whole consumed by people in the united
 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.889
whole consumed by people in the united
states are going down so we're consuming

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899
states are going down so we're consuming
 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.910
states are going down so we're consuming
less now than we did 10 years ago there

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
less now than we did 10 years ago there
 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.100
less now than we did 10 years ago there
and that was actually true in every age

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110
and that was actually true in every age
 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.270
and that was actually true in every age
group which I thought was pretty

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280
group which I thought was pretty
 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.680
group which I thought was pretty
exciting the biggest source for added

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690
exciting the biggest source for added
 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.740
exciting the biggest source for added
sugars in our culture it was sodas and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750
sugars in our culture it was sodas and
 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.899
sugars in our culture it was sodas and
that sort that's actually where the main

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909
that sort that's actually where the main
 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.330
that sort that's actually where the main
change was and unfortunately I don't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340
change was and unfortunately I don't
 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.340
change was and unfortunately I don't
think it's enough yet we were definitely

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350
think it's enough yet we were definitely
 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.890
think it's enough yet we were definitely
going the right direction the American

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900
going the right direction the American
 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.930
going the right direction the American
Heart Association recommended that we

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940
Heart Association recommended that we
 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.940
Heart Association recommended that we
get about five percent of our calories

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950
get about five percent of our calories
 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.120
get about five percent of our calories
from added sugars and in our study we

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130
from added sugars and in our study we
 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.700
from added sugars and in our study we
found that people had the original in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710
found that people had the original in
 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.789
found that people had the original in
the 1999-2000 dataset people were

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799
the 1999-2000 dataset people were
 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.530
the 1999-2000 dataset people were
consuming about eighteen percent of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540
consuming about eighteen percent of
 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.929
consuming about eighteen percent of
their calories rented sugar and over the

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939
their calories rented sugar and over the
 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.719
their calories rented sugar and over the
ten years it decreased to 14 and a half

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729
ten years it decreased to 14 and a half
 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.719
ten years it decreased to 14 and a half
which is much better but clearly 14 and

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729
which is much better but clearly 14 and
 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.580
which is much better but clearly 14 and
a half is still about three times more

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590
a half is still about three times more
 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.940
a half is still about three times more
than what would be a healthy amount

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950
