00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:12.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How many of you know
a boy or girl here at school

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.026
who gets picked on and
left out and never included

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:17.296
and laughed at all the time?

00:00:17.296 --> 00:00:19.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: School can be
a mean and dangerous place.

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:21.056
&gt;&gt;Raise your hands high, high.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:24.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Evidenced by
headline grabbing tragedies

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:25.786
and subtle daily slights.

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:27.836
&gt;&gt;Gina, why don't you shut up?

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:28.826
&gt;&gt;Who cares what you think?

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:31.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fortunately,
there is growing consensus

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.916
that teaching social
and emotional skills

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:35.536
in school can make a difference.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:38.496
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're gonna use it as
a tool to help us solve problems.

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:40.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And there
are a number of programs,

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:43.906
like Resolution Conflict
Creatively, that teach those schools.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:44.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: -- to the room and said,

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:47.006
"You're gonna wear those
old rages to school?"

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:51.216
&gt;&gt;Linda: We are talking about a whole
new vision of education that says

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:54.986
that educating the heart is as
important as educating the mind.

00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:58.036
And so it's about equipping
young people with the kinds

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:01.806
of skills they need to both
identify and manage their emotions,

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:04.626
to communicate those
emotions effectively,

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.686
and to resolve conflict nonviolently.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:08.406
&gt;&gt;It's mine.

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:09.666
&gt;&gt;No, it's mine.

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:11.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As part of
a school wide effort

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:14.126
to create a positive
environment, fourth graders

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:17.856
at Brooklyn's PS Twenty
Four act as peace helpers,

00:01:18.026 --> 00:01:20.866
teaching younger students
how to handle conflicts.

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:23.796
&gt;&gt;Alexus: When the peace helpers
were helping solve the conflict,

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.136
what did you see the
peace helpers do?

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:32.436
&gt;&gt;I'm still learning, 'cause if
I go into sixth grade next year,

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:34.846
I need to learn how
to control my anger,

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:38.386
'cause I have a serious
temper problem.

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:42.746
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Emotional intelligence
is just a key human skill,

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:46.126
but it also turns out that
kids who are better able

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:47.896
to manage their emotions,
for example,

00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:49.306
actually can pay attention better,

00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:52.626
can take in information
better, can remember better.

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:54.276
In other words, it
helps you learn better.

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:58.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Benefits of social
emotional learning programs include

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:01.816
improved academic performance
and attitudes towards school,

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:05.906
a reduction in violence, bullying
and other negative behaviors,

00:02:06.086 --> 00:02:09.536
and an improved school
environment for children and adults.

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:12.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're just
seeing great behavior, so--

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:15.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As part of a district
wide mandate, schools in Anchorage,

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:18.866
Alaska, have adopted comprehensive
social emotional learning

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.246
curriculum standards.

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:21.906
&gt;&gt;Vickie: I'm a curriculum
coordinator,

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:26.106
so I am seen in the same office
as the language arts coordinator,

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:28.406
the math coordinator, the
health coordinator, et cetera,

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:30.786
to show just visually,
politically, everything else,

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.996
that we are gonna value this like
we value any of our other curricula.

00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:38.236
A lot of my job is to look at the
already adopted curriculum and say,

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:41.696
"Okay, here's a place where, if I
was teaching this reading lesson,

00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:43.886
I could also hit this social
emotional learning center

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:44.616
at the same time."

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:48.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What are some of the
cool headed thoughts he could have?

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.876
&gt;&gt;Michael: We're all under the
gun to improve our test results,

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:55.896
the academics, but it's a whole
lot more fun to start focusing

00:02:56.056 --> 00:02:57.456
on that connection with kids

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:59.586
and helping people feel
good about where they are.

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:00.736
The other will follow.

00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:02.996
Our teachers, I think,
are much happier.

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:04.126
They like their kids.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:04.946
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good job, kiddo.

00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:05.636
Excellent.

00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:08.086
Practice being cool
headed this weekend.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:12.526
&gt;&gt;Vickie: There's research out
now that shows that kids involved

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.836
in intentional social emotional
programs, like we're trying

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:17.396
to do right here, scored on
average ten percent higher

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:18.996
on their standardized tests.

00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:20.816
So what are we giving up?

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:23.466
We're giving up, you
know, higher referrals,

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:25.296
we're giving up violence
in our schools.

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:26.716
What are we getting?

00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:28.656
Kids who come to school because
they wanna come to school,

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:31.646
and kids who know how to act
when they get into the schools.

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:34.186
And hopefully, kids who
will go into their futures

00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:34.976
with a better chance at success.

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:37.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Gina, I would like
to keep on being friends.

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:42.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And freeze,
all right, yeah.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:43.216
Nice job. [applause]
