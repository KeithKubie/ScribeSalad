00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.660
Let's take 63 and
divide it by 35.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.320
So the first thing
that we might say

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.970
is, OK, well, 35
doesn't go into 6.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.205
It does go into 63.

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:16.850
It goes into 63 one time,
because 2 times 35 is 70,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.020
so that's too big.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.710
So it goes one time.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.010
So let me write that.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.720
1 times 35 is 35.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.610
And then if we were to subtract
and we can regroup up here,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.860
we can take a 10 from the
60, so it becomes a 50,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.336
give that 10 to the
3, so it becomes a 13.

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.120
13 minus 5 is 8.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.790
5 minus 3 is 2.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.050
So you could just say,
hey, 63 divided by 35--

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.800
let me write this.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.530
You could say 63 divided by
35 is equal to 1 remainder 28.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.389
But this isn't so satisfying.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:56.930
We know that the
real answer is going

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.097
to be one point something,
something, something.

00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:00.680
So what I want to
do is keep dividing.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.013
I want to divide this thing
completely and see what type

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:05.110
of a decimal I actually get.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.820
And to do that, I
essentially have

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.450
to add a decimal here and
then just keep bringing down

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.110
decimal places to the
right of the decimal.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.630
So 63 is the exact
same thing as 63.0,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.740
and I could add as many zeroes
as I might want to add here.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.450
So what we could do
is we just make sure

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510
that this decimals
right over there,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.500
and we can now bring down a
zero from the tenths place

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.570
right over here.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.820
And you bring down that zero,
and now we ask ourselves,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.696
how many times does
35 go into 280?

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:35.820
And, as always, this is a
bit of an art when you're

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.680
dividing a two-digit number
into a three-digit number.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.138
So let's see, it's
definitely going

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:45.930
to be-- if I were to say-- so
40 goes into 280 seven times.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.010
30 goes into 280
about nine times.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.000
It's going to be between
7 and 9, so let's try 8.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.230
So, let's see what
35 times 8 is.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.140
35 times 8.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.230
5 times 8 is 40, 3 times
8 is 24, plus 4 is 28.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.210
So it actually
works out perfectly.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.030
So 35 goes into 280
exactly eight times.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.470
8 times 5, we already
figured it out.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.745
8 times 35 is exactly 280, and
we don't have any remainder

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.540
now, so we don't have to bring
down any more of these zeroes.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.880
So now we know exactly
that 63 divided by 35

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.860
is equal to exactly 1.8.
