00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:03.699
- I would do my best to
try to convince people,

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:04.980
as much as possible.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.811
I think the more we yell at each other,

00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:10.931
the more we try to shame each other,

00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:13.326
the more resistance we get from those

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.084
who we're trying to influence

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:17.834
and I just think, in this regard,

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.541
for the sake of our
country we need to do this

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:24.516
because our politics has
deteriorated to a very low point

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:27.267
and it's one of the things that
really keeps me up at night

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:30.542
because throughout the
world I think we've seen

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:34.153
how this deterioration
and social decay can end

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:36.986
and it never ends in a good place.

00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.125
Look, the truth is, that the system set up

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.323
by our founding fathers
is not meant to act fast.

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:46.183
Paul Ryan had a great line the other day.

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:50.017
He said, "I run a coalition government

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:53.329
without the efficiencies
of a parliamentary system."

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.847
For a comparative politics class,

00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:57.361
but that's what we have
and we have two chambers.

00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:02.065
This huge board of directors
split in half, 435 and 100.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.202
It's difficult and a lot of this work

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:07.459
has to be done one by
one and that's how I work

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:09.510
with my colleagues, one by one.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.733
I sit with them and I say,
"Look, this is what's happening,

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.885
this is the group we formed,
this is the purpose of it.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:18.223
There are no surprises here.

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:20.384
We're gonna try to
everything by consensus.

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:23.263
We want you to bring your ideas."

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:26.930
And that's how we've
gotten from zero to 62.

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:30.962
And we've just gotta keep climbing.
