As we touched on earlier in this class,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.670
rendering pages quickly is super important.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.670
Let's think about this for a moment.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.580
Because if you can request data asynchronously you open up

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.030
a new range of ways for making fast page loads.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.740
Let's think about this Facebook for food app over here.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.110
Where I've got my favorite cereal, favorite pasta, favorite meal, and

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.270
how I like my eggs.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.020
It's displaying custom content based on me being the user.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.030
Take a look at some possible steps for rendering this app.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.270
In what order could we run these steps to get the first pixels on

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.060
the screen over here as fast as possible?

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.369
Just to be clear, generic refers to HTML that would be the same for all users.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.930
That would be the HTML for

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.190
let's say favorite cereal, favorite pasta, it can also even be CSS for,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.650
you know, how to style this image and how to style all this text.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.040
Unique HTML refers to things like the strings for

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.470
my name, the strings for all my favorite foods.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.700
Because this is unique to me specifically.
