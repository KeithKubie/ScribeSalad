that is certainly more important to
 

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.560
that is certainly more important to
global security than the type of

global security than the type of
geopolitical calm competition that

geopolitical calm competition that

geopolitical calm competition that
Brzezinski contemplated a little over a

summer in the distant future we're going
 

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.210
summer in the distant future we're going
to see a growing need for a security

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.220
to see a growing need for a security
 

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.540

I would argue is some major conflict
 

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.049
I would argue is some major conflict
between Pakistan and India one that

between Pakistan and India one that
 

00:17:05.059 --> 00:17:07.079

Afghanistan but would extend us to

of an explosion the Fergana Valley an

of an explosion the Fergana Valley an

of an explosion the Fergana Valley an
explosion that clearly would have

explosion that clearly would have

serious consequences for the three

serious consequences for the three

serious consequences for the three

countries that occupy that Valley but

countries that occupy that Valley but
also serious consequences for Russian

also serious consequences for Russian

also serious consequences for Russian

in Afghanistan what the consequences

in Afghanistan what the consequences
 

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.940
in Afghanistan what the consequences
would be of an explosion there for the

the reaction would be of the other major

powers in the region so to sum up I
 

00:18:00.769 --> 00:18:02.620
powers in the region so to sum up I
think it's very difficult to make an

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:02.630
think it's very difficult to make an
 

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.200
think it's very difficult to make an
argument that Central Asia itself is

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.210
argument that Central Asia itself is
 

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.899
argument that Central Asia itself is
central to Europeans or to international

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:07.909
central to Europeans or to international
 

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:11.680
central to Europeans or to international
security but you combine South Asia with

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:11.690
security but you combine South Asia with
 

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.659
security but you combine South Asia with
Central Asia and I think you have a

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:13.669
Central Asia and I think you have a
 

00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:15.820
Central Asia and I think you have a
powerful argument that this is going to

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:15.830
powerful argument that this is going to
 

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.210
powerful argument that this is going to
be central to the international security

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:19.220
be central to the international security
 

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.389

over the next decade and beyond in this

over the next decade and beyond in this
 

00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:24.639
over the next decade and beyond in this
regard makes sense that the State

regard makes sense that the State
 

00:18:24.649 --> 00:18:26.919

Department is combined South Asia and

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:26.929
Department is combined South Asia and
 

00:18:26.929 --> 00:18:30.549
Department is combined South Asia and
Central Asia in a single Department in a

Central Asia in a single Department in a
 

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.379
Central Asia in a single Department in a
single Bureau at the Department I think

00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:32.389
single Bureau at the Department I think
 

00:18:32.389 --> 00:18:34.299
single Bureau at the Department I think
that's forward-looking in the way we

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:34.309
that's forward-looking in the way we
 

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:36.039
that's forward-looking in the way we
think about it the geopolitical

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:36.049
think about it the geopolitical
 

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:39.100
think about it the geopolitical
challenges we need but what's missing is

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:39.110
challenges we need but what's missing is
 

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.310
challenges we need but what's missing is
still a comprehensive coherent strategy

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320
still a comprehensive coherent strategy
 

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.529
still a comprehensive coherent strategy
for Central and South Asia what's

00:18:44.529 --> 00:18:44.539
for Central and South Asia what's
 

00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:47.440
for Central and South Asia what's
missing is something that will put in

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:47.450
missing is something that will put in
 

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.440
missing is something that will put in
place an adequate security structure to

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:50.450
place an adequate security structure to
 

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.779
place an adequate security structure to
manage the relations in that part of the

00:18:52.779 --> 00:18:52.789
manage the relations in that part of the
 

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:55.299
manage the relations in that part of the
world now and over the next decade and

world now and over the next decade and
 

00:18:55.309 --> 00:18:57.789
world now and over the next decade and
beyond and absent that structure I would

00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799
beyond and absent that structure I would
 

00:18:57.799 --> 00:19:00.190
beyond and absent that structure I would
argue we're going to see an increase in

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200
argue we're going to see an increase in
 

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.100
argue we're going to see an increase in
the risk of major conflict between and

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.110
the risk of major conflict between and
 

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.249
the risk of major conflict between and
among the great powers in the future

00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:06.259
among the great powers in the future
 

00:19:06.259 --> 00:19:08.649
among the great powers in the future
perhaps not so much in this decade but

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:08.659
perhaps not so much in this decade but
 

00:19:08.659 --> 00:19:10.899
perhaps not so much in this decade but
if we think beyond that certainly a

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:10.909
if we think beyond that certainly a
 

00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:13.570
if we think beyond that certainly a
possibility and in that regard because

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:13.580
possibility and in that regard because
 

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.430
possibility and in that regard because
of that danger I think you can make a

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440
of that danger I think you can make a
 

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.440
of that danger I think you can make a
persuasive argument that the US

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:17.450
persuasive argument that the US
 

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.749
persuasive argument that the US
government and other major powers should

00:19:19.749 --> 00:19:19.759
government and other major powers should
 

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:22.299
government and other major powers should
be devoting more resources and time to

00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:22.309
be devoting more resources and time to
 

00:19:22.309 --> 00:19:25.180
be devoting more resources and time to
thinking hard about Central Asia and its

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.190
thinking hard about Central Asia and its
 

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.499
thinking hard about Central Asia and its
future role in the international

thanks very much so I'm gonna bring a
 

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.900
thanks very much so I'm gonna bring a
more scholarly perspective to some of

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:42.910
more scholarly perspective to some of
 

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.290
more scholarly perspective to some of
the issues that tom has been talking

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:46.300
the issues that tom has been talking
 

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.330
the issues that tom has been talking
about my own particular a kind of

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:48.340
about my own particular a kind of
 

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.810
about my own particular a kind of
theoretical sort of approach to sort of

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:51.820
theoretical sort of approach to sort of
 

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.150
theoretical sort of approach to sort of
working these things out and and and I

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160
working these things out and and and I
 

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.490
working these things out and and and I
think underlying some of the points Tom

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:56.500
think underlying some of the points Tom
 

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.370
think underlying some of the points Tom
is making perhaps differing in a couple

00:19:59.370 --> 00:19:59.380
is making perhaps differing in a couple
 

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.530
is making perhaps differing in a couple
of places I think tom is absolutely

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:01.540
of places I think tom is absolutely
 

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.360
of places I think tom is absolutely
right in terms of setting the bar high

looking at the International Security

looking at the International Security
 

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.250
looking at the International Security
importance of Central Asia think the

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:08.260
importance of Central Asia think the
 

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.560
importance of Central Asia think the
question and and and generally I agree

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:10.570
question and and and generally I agree
 

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.000
question and and and generally I agree
with them the question becomes a little

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.010
with them the question becomes a little
 

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.080
with them the question becomes a little
more complicated when we think about

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.090
more complicated when we think about
 

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.090
more complicated when we think about
what are the security dynamics within

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:15.100
what are the security dynamics within
 

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.730
what are the security dynamics within
Central Asia itself right what are the

Central Asia itself right what are the
 

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.010
Central Asia itself right what are the
main security objectives of what I call

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.020
main security objectives of what I call

triangle and this is a difficult

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.090
triangle and this is a difficult
 

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.290
triangle and this is a difficult
question to answer in part because both

also to the more subtle kind of color

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180
also to the more subtle kind of color
 

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.510
also to the more subtle kind of color
revolutions to pre-2005 era I think

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520
revolutions to pre-2005 era I think
 

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.210
revolutions to pre-2005 era I think
we're seeing that those levers have very

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220
we're seeing that those levers have very
 

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.130
we're seeing that those levers have very
very little influence on these

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140
very little influence on these
 

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.750
very little influence on these
particular countries actually in Central

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760
particular countries actually in Central
 

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.160
particular countries actually in Central
Asia actually sees Central Asian states

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:40.170
Asia actually sees Central Asian states
 

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.470
Asia actually sees Central Asian states
as much more resilient than I think most

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480
as much more resilient than I think most
 

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.600
as much more resilient than I think most
people would I think their leaders have

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:44.610
people would I think their leaders have
 

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.940
people would I think their leaders have
made effective use of their strategic

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:46.950
made effective use of their strategic
 

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.070
made effective use of their strategic
levers and their particular leverage

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:49.080
levers and their particular leverage
 

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.960
levers and their particular leverage
over the United States over Russia in

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:50.970
over the United States over Russia in
 

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.110
over the United States over Russia in
this region I think that they have acted

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:54.120
this region I think that they have acted
 

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.270
this region I think that they have acted
in some senses made very good use of

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280
in some senses made very good use of
 

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.510
in some senses made very good use of
their weakness as a form of strength in

00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520
their weakness as a form of strength in
 

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.010
their weakness as a form of strength in
their bargaining relationships with the

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020
their bargaining relationships with the
 

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.320
their bargaining relationships with the
great powers in the region and where I

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:03.330
great powers in the region and where I
 

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.790
great powers in the region and where I
see that the deepest threat to the

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800
see that the deepest threat to the
 

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.230
see that the deepest threat to the
region right now is actually not in

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240
region right now is actually not in
 

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.210
region right now is actually not in
insurgent violence it's actually in

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220
insurgent violence it's actually in
 

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.870
insurgent violence it's actually in
corruption

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880
corruption
 

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.090
corruption
I think corruption right now within the

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:11.100
I think corruption right now within the
 

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.040
I think corruption right now within the
center of five former Soviet republics

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.050
center of five former Soviet republics
 

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.900
center of five former Soviet republics
as well as within Afghanistan it's

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:14.910
as well as within Afghanistan it's
 

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.190
as well as within Afghanistan it's
probably the number one issue right now

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200
probably the number one issue right now
 

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.810
probably the number one issue right now
it's also one of the hardest issues to

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820
it's also one of the hardest issues to
 

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.090
it's also one of the hardest issues to
deal with in the region and I think

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:20.100
deal with in the region and I think
 

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.320
deal with in the region and I think
these sort of threat of Islamic

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:21.330
these sort of threat of Islamic
 

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.970
these sort of threat of Islamic
fundamentalism and particularly of a

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980
fundamentalism and particularly of a
 

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.070
fundamentalism and particularly of a
united bloc or United groups moving

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:25.080
united bloc or United groups moving
 

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.660
united bloc or United groups moving
across this region is really overplayed

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:26.670
across this region is really overplayed
 

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.820
across this region is really overplayed
and so what I'd like to do is begin in

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:28.830
and so what I'd like to do is begin in
 

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.650
and so what I'd like to do is begin in
Afghanistan which I do agree with the

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660
Afghanistan which I do agree with the
 

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.450
Afghanistan which I do agree with the
panelists I think that is the epicenter

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460
panelists I think that is the epicenter
 

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.590
panelists I think that is the epicenter
I think that is why the United States

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:33.600
I think that is why the United States
 

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.150
I think that is why the United States
cares I think that some ways that's why

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160
cares I think that some ways that's why
 

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.040
cares I think that some ways that's why
we're here today because it does matter

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.050
we're here today because it does matter
 

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.170
we're here today because it does matter
and then I'd like to just move out in a

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180
and then I'd like to just move out in a
 

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.120
and then I'd like to just move out in a
concentric circle to what the impact of

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.130
concentric circle to what the impact of
 

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.950
concentric circle to what the impact of
Afghanistan is on the Central Asian

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960
Afghanistan is on the Central Asian
 

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.780
Afghanistan is on the Central Asian
Republics that are neighbouring and then

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:44.790
Republics that are neighbouring and then
 

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.280
Republics that are neighbouring and then
I'm gonna take a two minute detour to

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:46.290
I'm gonna take a two minute detour to
 

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.380
I'm gonna take a two minute detour to
the Northern Caucasus which has many of

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:48.390
the Northern Caucasus which has many of
 

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.990
the Northern Caucasus which has many of
the same elements that Afghanistan does

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000
the same elements that Afghanistan does
 

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.880
the same elements that Afghanistan does
the United States it does for Russia too

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:52.890
the United States it does for Russia too
 

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:54.590
the United States it does for Russia too
including the limits of a lot of the

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:54.600
including the limits of a lot of the
 

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.810
including the limits of a lot of the
levers of influence now we can spend a

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820
levers of influence now we can spend a
 

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.680
levers of influence now we can spend a
lot of time talking about Afghanistan

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:57.690
lot of time talking about Afghanistan
 

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.540
lot of time talking about Afghanistan
and and the nature of the conflict and

00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.550
and and the nature of the conflict and
 

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.250
and and the nature of the conflict and
the dynamics of it I assume most people

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260
the dynamics of it I assume most people
 

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.260
the dynamics of it I assume most people
are familiar with the nature of it it's

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:03.270
are familiar with the nature of it it's
 

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.120
are familiar with the nature of it it's
obviously a very complicated case but I

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.130
obviously a very complicated case but I
 

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.620
obviously a very complicated case but I
want to just point out a few things that

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:06.630
want to just point out a few things that
 

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.580
want to just point out a few things that
I think are really important about

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:07.590
I think are really important about
 

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.560
I think are really important about
understanding it one is that the United

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:09.570
understanding it one is that the United
 

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.600
understanding it one is that the United
States has essentially tied its fortunes

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:11.610
States has essentially tied its fortunes
 

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.580
States has essentially tied its fortunes
in Afghanistan to what it looks like a

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:13.590
in Afghanistan to what it looks like a
 

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.170
in Afghanistan to what it looks like a
seemingly weak

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180
seemingly weak
 

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.080
seemingly weak
as Karzai administration in Kabul and

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.090
as Karzai administration in Kabul and
 

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.970
as Karzai administration in Kabul and
has very very few levers of influence

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980
has very very few levers of influence
 

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.850
has very very few levers of influence
over this particular regime and I think

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:22.860
over this particular regime and I think
 

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.380
over this particular regime and I think
this is actually something despite the

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:24.390
this is actually something despite the
 

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.520
this is actually something despite the
United States all its leverage this

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:25.530
United States all its leverage this
 

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.710
United States all its leverage this
military power to economic might it has

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720
military power to economic might it has
 

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.450
military power to economic might it has
a hard time forcing Karzai to do

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460
a hard time forcing Karzai to do
 

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.070
a hard time forcing Karzai to do
anything I think this is a broader

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.080
anything I think this is a broader
 

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.050
anything I think this is a broader
pattern actually of the interaction

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060
pattern actually of the interaction
 

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.310
pattern actually of the interaction
between the great powers and so-called

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320
between the great powers and so-called
 

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.440
between the great powers and so-called
weaker States in the region it's really

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:36.450
weaker States in the region it's really
 

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.760
weaker States in the region it's really
that these leaders are actually much

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:37.770
that these leaders are actually much
 

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.770
that these leaders are actually much
more harder to budge than we think they

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780
more harder to budge than we think they
 

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.330
more harder to budge than we think they
are and so this notion of the weak

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:41.340
are and so this notion of the weak
 

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.830
are and so this notion of the weak
Central Asian states I think needs to be

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:42.840
Central Asian states I think needs to be
 

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.540
Central Asian states I think needs to be
recast because the leaders have a lot of

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:44.550
recast because the leaders have a lot of
 

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.030
recast because the leaders have a lot of
levers of influence the other thing that

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040
levers of influence the other thing that
 

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.190
levers of influence the other thing that
Afghanistan shows us is the limits of

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200
Afghanistan shows us is the limits of
 

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.660
Afghanistan shows us is the limits of
the toolkit that the great powers have

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:50.670
the toolkit that the great powers have
 

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.460
the toolkit that the great powers have
to actually shape events in this given

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:52.470
to actually shape events in this given
 

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.200
to actually shape events in this given
region the military power and we could

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:54.210
region the military power and we could
 

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.730
region the military power and we could
talk about the ineffectiveness or

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740
talk about the ineffectiveness or
 

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.130
talk about the ineffectiveness or
seemingly ineffectiveness 9 years now to

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140
seemingly ineffectiveness 9 years now to
 

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.720
seemingly ineffectiveness 9 years now to
trying to defeat the Taliban

00:37:59.720 --> 00:37:59.730
trying to defeat the Taliban
 

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.520
trying to defeat the Taliban
and sort of the limits of what you can

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:01.530
and sort of the limits of what you can
 

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.930
and sort of the limits of what you can
achieve a military power but I actually

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940
achieve a military power but I actually
 

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.190
achieve a military power but I actually
thought these more interesting talk

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200
thought these more interesting talk
 

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.750
thought these more interesting talk
about the limits of what you can do with

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760
about the limits of what you can do with
 

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.420
about the limits of what you can do with
economic aid and development aid in this

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:08.430
economic aid and development aid in this
 

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.040
economic aid and development aid in this
region because I think that carries deep

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:10.050
region because I think that carries deep
 

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.600
region because I think that carries deep
consequences for the other countries

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:11.610
consequences for the other countries
 

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.010
consequences for the other countries
because there's part of the strategy

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.020
because there's part of the strategy
 

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.840
because there's part of the strategy
that we're using in Afghanistan through

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:14.850
that we're using in Afghanistan through
 

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.340
that we're using in Afghanistan through
development aid is now being writ large

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:16.350
development aid is now being writ large
 

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.750
development aid is now being writ large
to the northern distribution network

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760
to the northern distribution network
 

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.970
to the northern distribution network
into the other Central Asian Republics

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980
into the other Central Asian Republics

effect of these strategies so what's the

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940
effect of these strategies so what's the
 

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.570
effect of these strategies so what's the
problem with aid in Afghanistan one of

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:50.580
problem with aid in Afghanistan one of
 

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.160
problem with aid in Afghanistan one of
the things is simply that it generates a

the things is simply that it generates a
 

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.370

among Karzai's administration this is
 

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.540
among Karzai's administration this is
where we typically look but it bleeds

the effectiveness of aid is generating
 

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.560
the effectiveness of aid is generating
wild amounts of corruption and is

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:21.570
wild amounts of corruption and is
 

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.120
wild amounts of corruption and is
bleeding away the legitimacy of the

okay it's also generating hmm

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:28.430
okay it's also generating hmm

let me give you an example just a small

policy in Afghanistan is building roads

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:37.370
policy in Afghanistan is building roads
 

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.400
policy in Afghanistan is building roads
this should sound familiar because it's

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:39.410
this should sound familiar because it's
 

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.270
this should sound familiar because it's
what we're doing with the northern

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280
what we're doing with the northern
 

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.650
what we're doing with the northern
distribution network as well but

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:41.660
distribution network as well but
 

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.290
distribution network as well but
Afghanistan was sort of the example of

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:44.300
Afghanistan was sort of the example of
 

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.640
Afghanistan was sort of the example of
building roads it will bring people

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:45.650
building roads it will bring people
 

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.230
building roads it will bring people
together it will generate an internal

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240
together it will generate an internal
 

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.760
together it will generate an internal
market people can bring their goods and

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:48.770
market people can bring their goods and
 

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.740
market people can bring their goods and
services to bear we will create an

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:50.750
services to bear we will create an
 

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.420
services to bear we will create an
internal market and we will therefore

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:52.430
internal market and we will therefore
 

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.010
internal market and we will therefore
restore the legitimacy of the government

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:54.020
restore the legitimacy of the government
 

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.120
restore the legitimacy of the government
because people get back to work and

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.130
because people get back to work and
 

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.280
because people get back to work and
unemployed men are not shooting anymore

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:57.290
unemployed men are not shooting anymore

at US soldiers what we're finding out

00:39:59.560 --> 00:39:59.570
at US soldiers what we're finding out
 

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.750
at US soldiers what we're finding out
now is as we build roads we generate

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760
now is as we build roads we generate
 

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.540
now is as we build roads we generate
more violence why because the people who

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:04.550
more violence why because the people who
 

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.370
more violence why because the people who
did not get the contracts to build the

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:06.380
did not get the contracts to build the
 

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.990
did not get the contracts to build the
road now begin shooting at the people

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000
road now begin shooting at the people
 

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.640
road now begin shooting at the people
who did get the contracts for the road

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:09.650
who did get the contracts for the road
 

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:12.970
who did get the contracts for the road
ok what else does it do it allows the

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:12.980
ok what else does it do it allows the
 

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.650
ok what else does it do it allows the
insurgents to move much more freely in

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:14.660
insurgents to move much more freely in
 

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.170
insurgents to move much more freely in
the conflict space they too can use the

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:17.180
the conflict space they too can use the
 

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.660
the conflict space they too can use the
roads the third thing that it does and

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:19.670
roads the third thing that it does and
 

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.890
roads the third thing that it does and
this is something we're going to see I

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:20.900
this is something we're going to see I
 

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.270
this is something we're going to see I
think as we extend the northern

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280
think as we extend the northern
 

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.340
think as we extend the northern
distribution network outward it is

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:24.350
distribution network outward it is
 

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:26.680
distribution network outward it is
unique and it takes a public good which

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:26.690
unique and it takes a public good which
 

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.000
unique and it takes a public good which
is the road system and makes it a

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.010
is the road system and makes it a
 

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.550
is the road system and makes it a
private bill a private good why because

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560
private bill a private good why because
 

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.210
private bill a private good why because
it allows insurgents but also police

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:33.220
it allows insurgents but also police
 

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.030
it allows insurgents but also police
militia groups to cut the road and put

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040
militia groups to cut the road and put
 

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.640
militia groups to cut the road and put
tolls and transit routes up so that they

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:39.650
tolls and transit routes up so that they
 

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.870
tolls and transit routes up so that they
can fund their phone particular

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880
can fund their phone particular
 

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.150
can fund their phone particular
activities we can not police along these

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.160
activities we can not police along these
 

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.680
activities we can not police along these
road systems anywhere near and the

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:44.690
road systems anywhere near and the
 

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.990
road systems anywhere near and the
depths that we would need and so what

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000
depths that we would need and so what
 

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.090
depths that we would need and so what
happens is we are fueling criminal gangs

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:49.100
happens is we are fueling criminal gangs
 

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.610
happens is we are fueling criminal gangs
and insurgencies because we create the

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:51.620
and insurgencies because we create the
 

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.470
and insurgencies because we create the
road system that they then selectively

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480
road system that they then selectively
 

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.360
road system that they then selectively
turn on and off and we can't catch them

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:55.370
turn on and off and we can't catch them
 

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.370
turn on and off and we can't catch them
before they do it tremendous amount of

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:57.380
before they do it tremendous amount of
 

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.740
before they do it tremendous amount of
the money from the Taliban is not is

00:40:59.740 --> 00:40:59.750
the money from the Taliban is not is
 

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.690
the money from the Taliban is not is
part of it it's drug money but a lot of

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:01.700
part of it it's drug money but a lot of
 

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.420
part of it it's drug money but a lot of
it is revenues being extracted roadside

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:04.430
it is revenues being extracted roadside
 

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.050
it is revenues being extracted roadside
in flying tariffs and tolls ok so what

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:08.060
in flying tariffs and tolls ok so what
 

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.400
in flying tariffs and tolls ok so what
happens is if you have an AIDS strategy

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:09.410
happens is if you have an AIDS strategy
 

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.770
happens is if you have an AIDS strategy
that's designed to move in quickly

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:11.780
that's designed to move in quickly
 

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.480
that's designed to move in quickly
generate quick results and it does not

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:13.490
generate quick results and it does not
 

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.950
generate quick results and it does not
have a proper accounting system which is

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960
have a proper accounting system which is
 

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.020
have a proper accounting system which is
a story in Afghanistan you will generate

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.030
a story in Afghanistan you will generate
 

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.000
a story in Afghanistan you will generate
more amounts of corruption you will

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.010
more amounts of corruption you will
 

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.890
more amounts of corruption you will
generate more amounts of violence rather

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:20.900
generate more amounts of violence rather
 

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.450
generate more amounts of violence rather
than exactly the opposite which is what

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:22.460
than exactly the opposite which is what
 

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.420
than exactly the opposite which is what
you're intending to do this is I think

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:25.430
you're intending to do this is I think
 

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.210
you're intending to do this is I think
an important example for what we may see

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.930
happen is that as we move into this
region we upset that particular

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:34.940
region we upset that particular
 

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.850
region we upset that particular
equilibrium and we allow for more

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:36.860
equilibrium and we allow for more
 

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.870
equilibrium and we allow for more
corruption and generate more social

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880
corruption and generate more social
 

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.100
corruption and generate more social
oppressed against the particular states

oppressed against the particular states
 

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.280
oppressed against the particular states
so in this particular area we may see

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:45.290
so in this particular area we may see
 

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.010
so in this particular area we may see
Afghanistan spreading north the violence

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:48.020
Afghanistan spreading north the violence
 

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.630
Afghanistan spreading north the violence
spreading north not because of

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640
spreading north not because of
 

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.190
spreading north not because of
connections between the insurgent groups

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200
connections between the insurgent groups
 

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.830
connections between the insurgent groups
but because of localized responses to

but because of localized responses to
 

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.050
but because of localized responses to
various aid strategies and development

strategies that are being employed by
 

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:58.750
strategies that are being employed by
the different great powers in this

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760
the different great powers in this
 

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.060
the different great powers in this
region this is not to say that the

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:01.070
region this is not to say that the
 

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.980
region this is not to say that the
violence will be automatic is that it's

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:02.990
violence will be automatic is that it's
 

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:06.040
violence will be automatic is that it's

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:06.050
a function a byproduct of US and Russian
 

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.840
a function a byproduct of US and Russian
in some cases Russian strategies in

in some cases Russian strategies in
 

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:11.740
in some cases Russian strategies in
these particular areas as well finally

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:11.750
these particular areas as well finally
 

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.020
these particular areas as well finally
just to shift a little bit to the to the

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:14.030
just to shift a little bit to the to the
 

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.410
just to shift a little bit to the to the
West with Russia we see the same kinds

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:17.420
West with Russia we see the same kinds
 

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.070
West with Russia we see the same kinds
of issues with strong leaders low levels

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:21.080
of issues with strong leaders low levels
 

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.440
of issues with strong leaders low levels
or ineffective levers of power over

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:23.450
or ineffective levers of power over
 

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.230
or ineffective levers of power over
leaders we see localized responses to

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240
leaders we see localized responses to
 

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.080
leaders we see localized responses to
state brutality in Chechnya and in the

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:29.090
state brutality in Chechnya and in the
 

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.850
state brutality in Chechnya and in the
broader Northern Caucasus now as well

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:30.860
broader Northern Caucasus now as well
 

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.590
broader Northern Caucasus now as well
and one of the things that's most

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:32.600
and one of the things that's most
 

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.800
and one of the things that's most
worrisome in the Caucasus is really the

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:35.810
worrisome in the Caucasus is really the
 

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.540
worrisome in the Caucasus is really the
spread of violence outside of its

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:37.550
spread of violence outside of its
 

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.150
spread of violence outside of its
epicenter in Chechnya as well okay and

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160
epicenter in Chechnya as well okay and
 

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.800
epicenter in Chechnya as well okay and
this is something we've seen actually

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:41.810
this is something we've seen actually
 

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.720
this is something we've seen actually
mirrors Afghanistan which we had low

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:43.730
mirrors Afghanistan which we had low
 

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:44.980
mirrors Afghanistan which we had low
levels of violence and then began to

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:44.990
levels of violence and then began to
 

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.560
levels of violence and then began to
spread this really is true two of the

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:47.570
spread this really is true two of the
 

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.420
spread this really is true two of the
caucuses in which Russian strategy in

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:49.430
caucuses in which Russian strategy in
 

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.660
caucuses in which Russian strategy in
many ways marginalized brutalized the

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:52.670
many ways marginalized brutalized the
 

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.620
many ways marginalized brutalized the
people and we led it led to an increased

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:55.630
people and we led it led to an increased
 

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.870
people and we led it led to an increased
insurgent response and so in this area

00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880
insurgent response and so in this area
 

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.200
insurgent response and so in this area
we see local leaders such as the leaders

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:02.210
we see local leaders such as the leaders
 

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:04.450
we see local leaders such as the leaders
of Chechnya for example who can exert

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:04.460
of Chechnya for example who can exert
 

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.250
of Chechnya for example who can exert
tremendous leverage over the Kremlin

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:06.260
tremendous leverage over the Kremlin
 

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.380
tremendous leverage over the Kremlin
strategy the crime

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:07.390
strategy the crime
 

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:09.359
strategy the crime
largely lost control I would argue of

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:09.369
largely lost control I would argue of
 

00:46:09.369 --> 00:46:12.329
largely lost control I would argue of
the Northern Caucasus its strategies of

00:46:12.329 --> 00:46:12.339
the Northern Caucasus its strategies of
 

00:46:12.339 --> 00:46:14.309
the Northern Caucasus its strategies of
military power as being a coercive

00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319
military power as being a coercive
 

00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:17.039
military power as being a coercive
apparatus have largely failed its form

00:46:17.039 --> 00:46:17.049
apparatus have largely failed its form
 

00:46:17.049 --> 00:46:19.079
apparatus have largely failed its form
of economic assistance has had exactly

00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:19.089
of economic assistance has had exactly
 

00:46:19.089 --> 00:46:20.849
of economic assistance has had exactly
the same effect that US assistance in

00:46:20.849 --> 00:46:20.859
the same effect that US assistance in
 

00:46:20.859 --> 00:46:22.890
the same effect that US assistance in
Afghanistan has which is to generate

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:22.900
Afghanistan has which is to generate
 

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.109
Afghanistan has which is to generate
large amounts of corruption which to

00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119
large amounts of corruption which to
 

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:26.880
large amounts of corruption which to
generate new rent-seeking actors who

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:26.890
generate new rent-seeking actors who
 

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.160
generate new rent-seeking actors who
have come into power and to violence in

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.170
have come into power and to violence in
 

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.079
have come into power and to violence in
order to capture some of these rents and

00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:31.089
order to capture some of these rents and
 

00:46:31.089 --> 00:46:33.480
order to capture some of these rents and
so we've seen a spreading of it because

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:33.490
so we've seen a spreading of it because
 

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.150
so we've seen a spreading of it because
these groups are rising to capture the

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160
these groups are rising to capture the
 

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.549
these groups are rising to capture the
aid and the revenue we've seen

00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559
aid and the revenue we've seen
 

00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:41.009
aid and the revenue we've seen
spectacular levels of corruption come

00:46:41.009 --> 00:46:41.019
spectacular levels of corruption come
 

00:46:41.019 --> 00:46:44.430
spectacular levels of corruption come
out of this region as well we've seen

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440
out of this region as well we've seen
 

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.589
out of this region as well we've seen
rival actors now emerge who are

00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599
rival actors now emerge who are
 

00:46:46.599 --> 00:46:49.289
rival actors now emerge who are
exercising governance other than the

00:46:49.289 --> 00:46:49.299
exercising governance other than the
 

00:46:49.299 --> 00:46:51.359
exercising governance other than the
state in these particular areas or large

00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:51.369
state in these particular areas or large
 

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:52.890
state in these particular areas or large
swaths of Afghanistan that are now

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:52.900
swaths of Afghanistan that are now
 

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.839
swaths of Afghanistan that are now
outside Kabul control that's actually

00:46:54.839 --> 00:46:54.849
outside Kabul control that's actually
 

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:56.490
outside Kabul control that's actually
true of the Northern Caucasus still to a

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:56.500
true of the Northern Caucasus still to a
 

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.289
true of the Northern Caucasus still to a
lesser extent there are areas in which

00:46:58.289 --> 00:46:58.299
lesser extent there are areas in which
 

00:46:58.299 --> 00:46:59.910
lesser extent there are areas in which
the state but the rid of the state no

00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920
the state but the rid of the state no
 

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.569
the state but the rid of the state no
longer reads and so but it has a

00:47:03.569 --> 00:47:03.579
longer reads and so but it has a
 

00:47:03.579 --> 00:47:05.940
longer reads and so but it has a
localized dynamic and this is one of the

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:05.950
localized dynamic and this is one of the
 

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.920
localized dynamic and this is one of the
things I hope we take away from this is

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:07.930
things I hope we take away from this is
 

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.650
things I hope we take away from this is
that the we tend to care about Central

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:10.660
that the we tend to care about Central
 

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.509
that the we tend to care about Central
Asia because of Afghanistan and we tend

00:47:12.509 --> 00:47:12.519
Asia because of Afghanistan and we tend
 

00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:14.069
Asia because of Afghanistan and we tend
to care about Afghanistan because of the

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079
to care about Afghanistan because of the
 

00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:15.779
to care about Afghanistan because of the
threat of Islamic transnational

00:47:15.779 --> 00:47:15.789
threat of Islamic transnational
 

00:47:15.789 --> 00:47:17.730
threat of Islamic transnational
terrorism and I think there's a tendency

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:17.740
terrorism and I think there's a tendency
 

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.470
terrorism and I think there's a tendency
to paint with a very broad brush all of

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480
to paint with a very broad brush all of
 

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.569
to paint with a very broad brush all of
these groups as of the same kind and

00:47:21.569 --> 00:47:21.579
these groups as of the same kind and
 

00:47:21.579 --> 00:47:23.759
these groups as of the same kind and
working together and I think this is a

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:23.769
working together and I think this is a
 

00:47:23.769 --> 00:47:24.779
working together and I think this is a
misnomer

00:47:24.779 --> 00:47:24.789
misnomer
 

00:47:24.789 --> 00:47:27.539
misnomer
I think the groups are largely localized

00:47:27.539 --> 00:47:27.549
I think the groups are largely localized
 

00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:29.430
I think the groups are largely localized
reaction to the various policies of the

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440
reaction to the various policies of the
 

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.109
reaction to the various policies of the
great powers I think there's very little

00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119
great powers I think there's very little
 

00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:32.609
great powers I think there's very little
connection between the Northern Caucasus

00:47:32.609 --> 00:47:32.619
connection between the Northern Caucasus
 

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:35.220
connection between the Northern Caucasus
and Afghanistan for example or for the

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:35.230
and Afghanistan for example or for the
 

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.289
and Afghanistan for example or for the
various groups that are so operating in

00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:37.299
various groups that are so operating in
 

00:47:37.299 --> 00:47:39.420
various groups that are so operating in
Central Asian Republics as well they

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:39.430
Central Asian Republics as well they
 

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.490
Central Asian Republics as well they
require much more nuanced response than

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:41.500
require much more nuanced response than
 

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.740
require much more nuanced response than
painting them all of the same caste and

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:43.750
painting them all of the same caste and
 

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.420
painting them all of the same caste and
I think this is one of the dangers is

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:45.430
I think this is one of the dangers is
 

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.910
I think this is one of the dangers is
that as we interface with these Central

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920
that as we interface with these Central
 

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.920
that as we interface with these Central
Asian Republics one of the key cards is

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:49.930
Asian Republics one of the key cards is
 

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:51.329
Asian Republics one of the key cards is
to say back to us that they're fighting

00:47:51.329 --> 00:47:51.339
to say back to us that they're fighting
 

00:47:51.339 --> 00:47:52.620
to say back to us that they're fighting
Islamic terrorism they're fighting

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:52.630
Islamic terrorism they're fighting
 

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.630
Islamic terrorism they're fighting
transnational terrorism and they can use

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640
transnational terrorism and they can use
 

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.400
transnational terrorism and they can use
that as a calling card to sort of

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:56.410
that as a calling card to sort of
 

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.259
that as a calling card to sort of
whitewash their particular human rights

00:47:58.259 --> 00:47:58.269
whitewash their particular human rights
 

00:47:58.269 --> 00:48:00.630

some cases and so well I think this is a
 

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.730
some cases and so well I think this is a

the most pressing foreign policy issue I

00:48:20.819 --> 00:48:20.829
the most pressing foreign policy issue I
 

00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:21.390
the most pressing foreign policy issue I
would

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400

well and I think part of the problem
 

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.810
well and I think part of the problem
with this region is that there are

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:30.820

but there's also very little effective

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:34.120
but there's also very little effective
 

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.000

just this year which means that they are

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:51.770
just this year which means that they are
 

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:53.500
just this year which means that they are
going to continue to prioritize foreign

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:53.510

to seek and in today's climate get more

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:00.260
to seek and in today's climate get more
 

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.870
to seek and in today's climate get more
and more authority to provide more and

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:01.880
and more authority to provide more and
 

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.070
and more authority to provide more and
more aid so this trend is going to

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:03.080
more aid so this trend is going to
 

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.930
more aid so this trend is going to
continue this trend of the DoD being

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:04.940
continue this trend of the DoD being

where the great powers will end up on
 

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.760
where the great powers will end up on
opposite sides so perhaps there are

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:27.770
opposite sides so perhaps there are
 

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.160

just on the security architecture thing
 

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:02.990
just on the security architecture thing
I mean it seems like this is a little

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000
I mean it seems like this is a little
 

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.090
I mean it seems like this is a little
bit of a cart in the horse right because

bit of a cart in the horse right because
 

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.380
bit of a cart in the horse right because
it's hard to build the architecture if

least in the near term
and so it's not clear to me what would

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:30.150
and so it's not clear to me what would
 

01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:31.430
and so it's not clear to me what would
the what's the problem that the

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440
the what's the problem that the
 

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.870
the what's the problem that the
architecture is trying to solve and in

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880
architecture is trying to solve and in
 

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.280
architecture is trying to solve and in
some ways Central Asia is a story of

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:34.290
some ways Central Asia is a story of
 

01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:36.380
some ways Central Asia is a story of
everybody's got a security architecture

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:36.390
everybody's got a security architecture
 

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:37.910
everybody's got a security architecture
that's the problem there's like I mean

01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920
that's the problem there's like I mean
 

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.840
that's the problem there's like I mean
you know this better than any way

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:38.850
you know this better than any way
 

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:41.540
you know this better than any way
there's five of them and or four and so

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:41.550
there's five of them and or four and so
 

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:43.640
there's five of them and or four and so
this is me it's kind of like why isn't

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:43.650
this is me it's kind of like why isn't
 

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:44.990
this is me it's kind of like why isn't
there a better security architecture and

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000
there a better security architecture and
 

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.370
there a better security architecture and
I guess the aunt the answer to me is

01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380
I guess the aunt the answer to me is
 

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:47.990
I guess the aunt the answer to me is
what's the what's the problem we're

01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000
what's the what's the problem we're
 

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.570
what's the what's the problem we're
trying to solve and and do we need a new

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580
trying to solve and and do we need a new
 

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.970
trying to solve and and do we need a new
architecture and and and maybe we do

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980
architecture and and and maybe we do
 

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.590
architecture and and and maybe we do
maybe we need to scrap all this it also

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600
maybe we need to scrap all this it also
 

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.060
maybe we need to scrap all this it also
seems that the the great powers want

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:56.070
seems that the the great powers want
 

01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.960
seems that the the great powers want
different things with their different

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:56.970
different things with their different
 

01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.400
different things with their different
institutions and so I think this is

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:58.410
institutions and so I think this is
 

01:14:58.410 --> 01:14:59.870
institutions and so I think this is
exactly why you don't have a more

01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880
exactly why you don't have a more
 

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.070
exactly why you don't have a more
effective architecture because they all

01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080
effective architecture because they all
 

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.930
effective architecture because they all
want to use it for their own so if your

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940
want to use it for their own so if your
 

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.190
want to use it for their own so if your
power reasons until there's something

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:04.200
power reasons until there's something
 

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.140
power reasons until there's something
really pressing I don't think you're

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:06.150
really pressing I don't think you're
 

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:07.550
really pressing I don't think you're
gonna see an effective architecture now

01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560
gonna see an effective architecture now
 

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.260
gonna see an effective architecture now
to my thinking and this is to rope in

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:09.270
to my thinking and this is to rope in
 

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:11.000
to my thinking and this is to rope in
the Islamic fundamentalism question

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:11.010
the Islamic fundamentalism question
 

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:11.990
the Islamic fundamentalism question
which I thought was really just as a

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000
which I thought was really just as a
 

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.310
which I thought was really just as a
gray I was really I didn't notice that

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320
gray I was really I didn't notice that
 

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.290
gray I was really I didn't notice that
we didn't really talk about that much to

01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300
we didn't really talk about that much to
 

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.580
we didn't really talk about that much to
me that would have been one hook that

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:16.590
me that would have been one hook that
 

01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:18.470
me that would have been one hook that
everybody would agree on right now in

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480
everybody would agree on right now in
 

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.180
everybody would agree on right now in
some ways but but that hasn't been able

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:20.190
some ways but but that hasn't been able
 

01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:22.580
some ways but but that hasn't been able
to spark any kind of real sustained

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:22.590
to spark any kind of real sustained
 

01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:24.350
to spark any kind of real sustained
cooperation I mean there are some is you

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360
cooperation I mean there are some is you
 

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.330
cooperation I mean there are some is you
know some collective exercise is there

01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340
know some collective exercise is there
 

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.310
know some collective exercise is there
is some collective architecture but I

01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320
is some collective architecture but I
 

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.230
is some collective architecture but I
think everybody just say they disagree

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:30.240
think everybody just say they disagree
 

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.550
think everybody just say they disagree
on what the nature of the threat is I

01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560
on what the nature of the threat is I
 

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.020
on what the nature of the threat is I
think too and so and they have very

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:33.030
think too and so and they have very
 

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:34.280
think too and so and they have very
different views on what Afghanistan

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:34.290
different views on what Afghanistan
 

01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:36.740
different views on what Afghanistan
means you know the Russia has a very

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:36.750
means you know the Russia has a very
 

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.360
means you know the Russia has a very
different view towards what the Afghan

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:38.370
different view towards what the Afghan
 

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:40.160
different view towards what the Afghan
problem is the United States does as

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:40.170
problem is the United States does as
 

01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:41.960
problem is the United States does as
does China and so again that doesn't

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:41.970
does China and so again that doesn't
 

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.610
does China and so again that doesn't
seem to be enough common leverage to a

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620
seem to be enough common leverage to a
 

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.710
seem to be enough common leverage to a
common ground to create an architecture

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:45.720
common ground to create an architecture
 

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.900
common ground to create an architecture
and if you can have that as a security

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:47.910
and if you can have that as a security
 

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.220
and if you can have that as a security
threat to build it I just not sure what

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:49.230
threat to build it I just not sure what
 

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:52.310
threat to build it I just not sure what
the architecture would look like and

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320
the architecture would look like and
 

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.590
the architecture would look like and
just finally the the question of the

01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600
just finally the the question of the
 

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.000
just finally the the question of the
counterfactual te I think it's a really

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:56.010
counterfactual te I think it's a really
 

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:57.710
counterfactual te I think it's a really
really interesting one I'm not sure I

01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:57.720
really interesting one I'm not sure I
 

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.090
really interesting one I'm not sure I
have a very good answer detecting oh

01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100
have a very good answer detecting oh
 

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.070
have a very good answer detecting oh
yeah you know other than to say I think

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080
yeah you know other than to say I think
 

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.500
yeah you know other than to say I think
the counterfactual is is not no aid

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:03.510
the counterfactual is is not no aid
 

01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:05.930
the counterfactual is is not no aid
right it's a different kind of aid and I

01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:05.940
right it's a different kind of aid and I
 

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.970
right it's a different kind of aid and I
think this is the the problem with

01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:07.980
think this is the the problem with
 

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.340
think this is the the problem with
Afghanistan now and I think it might be

01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:10.350
Afghanistan now and I think it might be
 

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:11.780
Afghanistan now and I think it might be
a problem writ large across the region

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:11.790
a problem writ large across the region
 

01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:14.150
a problem writ large across the region
as your study shows there's a lot of

01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:14.160
as your study shows there's a lot of
 

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.740
as your study shows there's a lot of
different aid projects all running at

don't typically look at what the effects

don't typically look at what the effects
are and in fact now to some of the work

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440
are and in fact now to some of the work

that I've seen being done in Afghanistan

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:36.490
that I've seen being done in Afghanistan

I'm doing myself we're only now starting

I'm doing myself we're only now starting
 

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:39.990
I'm doing myself we're only now starting
to think of what do measures of

01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000
to think of what do measures of
 

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.550
to think of what do measures of
effectiveness actually look like for aid

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560
effectiveness actually look like for aid
 

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.140

and this is nine years into the conflict

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:43.150
and this is nine years into the conflict
 

01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:44.970
and this is nine years into the conflict
and I think billions of dollars have

01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:44.980
and I think billions of dollars have
 

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.260
and I think billions of dollars have
been spent and we're not clear what's

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:46.270
been spent and we're not clear what's
 

01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:48.030
been spent and we're not clear what's
going on so I don't think the answer is

01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:48.040
going on so I don't think the answer is
 

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.280
going on so I don't think the answer is
no aid I think it may be a of a

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:50.290
no aid I think it may be a of a
 

01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:52.070
no aid I think it may be a of a
