00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.400
- [Instructor] Let's say, for some reason,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.510
you had lent the government $1,000,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.240
and so the government has given you

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.370
a formally issued piece
of paper that says,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.440
"Hey, we, the government, owe you $1,000."

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.000
This is issued by the Treasury.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.992
This could be a Treasury bond.

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:18.920
It could be a T-Bill of some kind.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.870
And let's say that the Federal Reserve,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.640
the central bank is interested

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.460
in inserting money into our system.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.300
So let's say this is the
Federal Reserve right over here.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.140
Federal Reserve.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.720
And so what they do is they create

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.040
$1,000 of Federal Reserve Notes,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.090
what we associate as paper money,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.150
and they pay it to you
and they buy the Treasury,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.880
so the Treasury goes to the
Federal Reserve from you.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.490
And so, in an exchange, you
get this newly created money

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.210
that the Federal Reserve just created.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.620
So, there you go.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.460
You have, this is $1,000.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.300
Now, what would you likely
do with that $1,000?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.270
Well, it might not be
safe to walk around town

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.030
with your pockets bulging like that,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.890
so a lot of folks would
deposit it into a bank.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.320
So let's think about what would happen

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.340
to the bank's balance sheet.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.170
So, you go to the Bank A

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.890
and I'm just gonna think about
what was the balance sheet,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.570
the pre-existing balance
sheet for the bank,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.880
but let's just think about
what happens to its assets

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.360
and its liabilities when
you make the deposit.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.870
A for assets, L for liabilities.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.810
If you deposit those thousand dollars,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.320
then your assets for the bank

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.840
is going to get $1,000 in reserves,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.240
but you didn't just give them the money.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.870
They have a liability to you.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.610
You should have a checkable
deposit account now,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.020
so we could say checking account.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.810
So now, you have a $1,000 checking account

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.240
which you would use an asset for yourself

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.450
but it's a liability for the bank.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.400
At any time, you could come

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.190
and ask for that thousand dollars.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.620
$1,000 checking account

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.060
and this would be for you.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.790
Now, we've already spent several videos

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.090
talking about fractional-reserve lending

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.480
and there's two ways
we can conceptualize it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.000
as we've seen in those videos

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.090
but I'm gonna go with the simpler version

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.450
of fractional-reserve lending.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.250
And so this bank says,
"Look, we are in a world

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.440
"where our reserve requirement,"

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.942
I will do a reserve requirement.

00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:28.440
This actually is a typical
reserve requirement.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.890
The reserve requirement

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.050
in this country is 10%,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.760
which says that the bank

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.020
only has to keep 10%
of these cash reserves

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.090
and then it could loan out
the rest, and so it does that.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.010
That's its business model

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.800
or a significant part
of its business model.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.740
And so, what it does

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.660
is instead of having $1,000 in reserves,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.440
it keeps 10%, so it keeps $100,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.800
and it loans out the rest.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.830
And so, it loans out $900.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.740
So, it's loaning out now
$900 to someone else,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.290
hopefully someone who
is good for the money,

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.925
who maybe they're gonna
invest it into their business

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.990
or they're going to buy a
house, or whatever else.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.070
Now once again, the bank just
didn't give them the money.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.720
In exchange, they get an asset,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.300
which is an IOU from that person.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.570
That person owes the bank money.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.520
They owe them $900.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.540
So, we could say that in exchange
for giving 'em that cash,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.808
they're going to have a $900 loan

00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:34.070
on their balance sheet as an asset.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.510
Now once again, the person
that they lent the money to,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.980
the loan would be a
liability, they owe the money,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.300
but for the bank, that's an asset.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.350
"Hey, someone owes me, the bank, $900."

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.120
But then what's this person going to do?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.953
Well once again,

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:48.770
their pocket's are gonna
bulge quite as much

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.450
but they still might not
wanna walk around town

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.500
with $900 in their pocket,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.530
so they are likely to deposit in a bank

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.510
and they could deposit it in Bank A

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.720
or they could deposit it in another bank.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.070
Let's call it very creatively,
Bank B, all right (chuckles).

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.210
So, Bank B, same exercise.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.910
I think you might see where this is going,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.610
so its assets, its liabilities.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.210
And so they go and they deposit this $900,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.950
so you have $900 right over there.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.230
And the corresponding liability,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.430
that person then give
the money to the bank,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.450
that person can demand that money

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.860
at any point from the bank,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.860
and so you have a $900 checking account,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.600
checking account.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.730
And that person would drop
on that checking account

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.760
to buy the machinery for their
business or whatever else.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.990
But once again, we have a
10% reserve requirement,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.960
which says that the bank
only has to keep 10% of that,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.160
and so their business model
is they do only keep 10% of it

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.500
and then the rest of it, they loan out.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.430
So, they loan out $810.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.610
It could be a loan or it could
be multiple loans altogether.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.730
And I think you see where this is going.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.940
So, this is lent out to someone else,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.150
so now we have $810,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.710
which can then be deposited
in another bank, Bank C.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.180
They can lend out 90% of that

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.570
and that process keeps going
on and on and on and on.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.100
So, an interesting question

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.630
is given this infusion
of a thousand dollars

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.860
and given this reserve requirement,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.870
how much total money has been created?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.710
Well, in one other videos,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.760
we talk about the multiple
measures of the money supply.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.200
When the Federal Reserve put this $1,000,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.600
a Federal Reserve Notes into circulation,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.140
they increased the
monetary base by $1,000,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.410
but one measure of the monetary supply

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.030
is, well, what are the Federal
Reserve Notes, the coins,

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:52.630
and the paper money that's in circulation,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.740
plus the amount of checkable deposits,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.110
and we talk about that
in other videos as M1.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.920
And so, our M1 over
here, what's it gonna be?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.220
Well, this person has a thousand
dollar checking account,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.080
$1,000 checking out, they
think they have $1,000

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.770
that they can write checks
against and they do.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.740
And this person has a
$900 checking account,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.110
$900 checking out.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.720
And then this person right over here

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.920
that when they deposit their money,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.040
they're gonna think they have
an $810 checking account.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.873
They have that.

00:06:23.873 --> 00:06:25.900
And then that process, they're gonna go on

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.410
and on and on and on.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.080
Someone else, when this
$810 gets deposited,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.800
the bank's gonna lend out 90% of that.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.040
That person's gonna think they
have that amount of money.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.930
And so what we do

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.290
is we're just multiplying
by .9 every time.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.470
We're multiplying by one

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.140
minus the reserve requirement every time.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.360
And we've done the mathematics
on this multiple times.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.470
This is going to be equal to $1,000,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.821
the initial amount that was
put into the monetary base,

00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:56.610
times one over

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.120
one minus 0.9

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.090
and that is just going to
be equal to $1,000 times

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.250
one over 0.1

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.013
or you could just view this

00:07:09.013 --> 00:07:13.220
as one over the reserve requirement.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.100
It just happened to be
0.1 in this example.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.500
Reserve requirement.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.810
And you could do the math
on what that's going to be.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.090
One divided by 1/10 is going to be 10,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.380
and so our M1 money supply

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.990
that has been created in
this very simple example

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.170
is going to be equal to

00:07:32.142 --> 00:07:34.270
10 times the thousand dollars,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.970
so it's gonna be equal to $10,000.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.160
So, big picture.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.610
When the monetary base is
increased by a certain amount,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.600
if you know the reserve requirement

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.590
and if you assume that all the banks

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.700
minimize their reserves,
that they keep only the 10%,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.850
they don't keep 11% or 12% or 20%,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.800
then what this calculation
is gonna show you

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.020
is what is going to be
the maximum effect on M1

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.600
given that infusion
into the monetary base.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.370
And all it is is the
amount that was infused

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.100
times one over the reserve requirement.
