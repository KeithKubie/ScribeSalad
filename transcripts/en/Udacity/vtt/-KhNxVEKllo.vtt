00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.660
As I said, there are lots
of different color spaces.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.750
Here's a nice picture of
all these different ways of

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.370
representing these things.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.530
By the way, notice the one
here at the bottom left, red,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.140
blue, green, red, green, blue.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.890
We'll talk about that one in a minute.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.625
All right, but
let me show you what my favorite.

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.940
In fact I'll put up two of them.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.970
So which one's my favorite?

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.820
Well, I think I already gave it away.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.130
I told you that the problem
with this one here,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.620
is that the entire top surface is white.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.410
And so, here's the question.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.650
How much can I change the color
of something that's white?

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.190
Answer, not at all.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.780
White is white is white.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.310
So that's why I like this idea of
having this peak on the top, so

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.530
that is you can't get far away from it.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.720
Likewise, same as, as on the black.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.251
And you spin around,
the double cone gives you the, the hue.

00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:51.708
And as you get further out,
they call it chroma.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:53.882
I actually like calling
it saturation better.

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:56.030
It, it doesn't really matter too much.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.260
But the idea is,
I tend to think of it as a cone.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.820
And what's important is when
you realize that it's a cone,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.410
you realize that if you're comparing,
and we'll get to this in a minute,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.660
if you're comparing the hue
of two different patches,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.170
if they're very dark,
the hue doesn't mean anything.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.180
If they're very bright,
the hue doesn't mean anything.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.930
And that's very hard to see on
this cylinder representation, but

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.480
it's very easy to see,
see on the, on the cone.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.019
Now of course, what is the color
space that we all know and love,

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:29.292
or at least know?

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.060
All right?
Which is the one we know best?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.070
Well, it's the RGB space, right,
where basically, you've got a cube,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.460
where in sort of a back corner where
things are 0, 0, or everything's black.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.530
If you move down the red axis,
it turns red.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.880
If you move to the green axis,
it turns green.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490
Add them together,
what's red and green make?

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.600
Yellow.
Why?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.120
Cones.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.130
And if you bring the whole thing up,
it looks white.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.510
And what's cool is if you take
that cube, and you sort of

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.450
pull the white corner to the top and
the black corner to the bottom, right?

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.660
So in fact I have a sort of picture,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.700
just think about that,
it would be almost like a double cone.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.508
Not quite, it would be kind of
a lumpy double cone with sharp points.

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:09.395
But the idea is,

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.381
white would be at a point on the top,
black would be at a point on the bottom,

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:16.500
right, and then you would have
chroma as you went around.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.760
And that's why my preference
is the double cone.
