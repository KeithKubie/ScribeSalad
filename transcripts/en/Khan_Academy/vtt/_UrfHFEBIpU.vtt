00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.070
I will now introduce you to
the concept of tension.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.390
So tension is really just the
force that exists either

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.760
within or applied by
a string or wire.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.280
It's usually lifting something
or pulling on something.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.040
So let's say I had a weight.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.080
Let's say I have
a weight here.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.450
And let's say it's
100 Newtons.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.575
And it's suspended from this
wire, which is right here.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.920
Let's say it's attached to
the ceiling right there.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.010
Well we already know that the
force-- if we're on this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.390
planet that this weight is being
pull down by gravity.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.370
So we already know that there's
a downward force on

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.730
this weight, which is
a force of gravity.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.130
And that equals 100 Newtons.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.090
But we also know that this
weight isn't accelerating,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.850
it's actually stationary.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.040
It also has no velocity.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.570
But the important thing is
it's not accelerating.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.080
But given that, we know that the
net force on it must be 0

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.950
by Newton's laws.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.820
So what is the counteracting
force?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.840
You didn't have to know about
tension to say well, the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.300
string's pulling on it.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.490
The string is what's keeping
the weight from falling.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.920
So the force that the string or
this wire applies on this

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.460
weight you can view as
the force of tension.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.400
Another way to think about it
is that's also the force

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.350
that's within the wire.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.320
And that is going to exactly
offset the force of gravity on

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.700
this weight.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.190
And that's what keeps this point
right here stationery

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.800
and keeps it from
accelerating.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.040
That's pretty straightforward.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.640
Tension, it's just the
force of a string.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.270
And just so you can
conceptualize it, on a guitar,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.830
the more you pull on some of
those higher-- what was it?

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.820
The really thin strings that
sound higher pitched.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.040
The more you pull on it,
the higher the tension.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.780
It actually creates a
higher pitched note.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.210
So you've dealt with
tension a lot.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.260
I think actually when they sell
wires or strings they'll

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.730
probably tell you the tension
that that wire or string can

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.650
support, which is important if
you're going to build a bridge

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.980
or a swing or something.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.170
So tension is something that
should be hopefully, a little

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.600
bit intuitive to you.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.710
So let's, with that fairly
simple example done, let's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.980
create a slightly more
complicated example.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.900
So let's take the same weight.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.720
Instead of making the
ceiling here, let's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.510
add two more strings.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.660
Let's add this green string.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.010
Green string there.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.610
And it's attached to the
ceiling up here.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.970
That's the ceiling now.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.530
And let's see.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.630
This is the wall.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.710
And let's say there's another
string right here

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.240
attached to the wall.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.600
So my question to you is, what
is the tension in these two

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.620
strings So let's call
this T1 and T2.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.470
Well like the first problem,
this point right here, this

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.430
red point, is stationary.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.820
It's not accelerating in
either the left/right

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.570
directions and it's not
accelerating in the up/down

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.260
directions.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.400
So we know that the net forces
in both the x and y

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.560
dimensions must be 0.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.950
My second question to
you is, what is

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.950
going to be the offset?

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.770
Because we know already that
at this point right here,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.330
there's going to be a downward
force, which is the force of

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.270
gravity again.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.220
The weight of this
whole thing.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.490
We can assume that the wires
have no weight for simplicity.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.300
So we know that there's going
to be a downward force here,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.920
this is the force of
gravity, right?

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.560
The whole weight of this entire
object of weight plus

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.200
wire is pulling down.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.470
So what is going to be the
upward force here?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.880
Well let's look at each
of the wires.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.200
This second wire, T2, or we
could call it w2, I guess.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.070
The second wire is just
pulling to the left.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.335
It has no y components.

00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:08.680
It's not lifting up at all.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.590
So it's just pulling
to the left.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.910
So all of the upward lifting,
all of that's going to occur

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.500
from this first wire, from T1.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.430
So we know that the y component
of T1, so let's

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.395
call-- so if we say that
this vector here.

00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:28.510
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.470
Because I know when I draw these
diagrams it starts to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.720
get confusing.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.940
Let me actually use
the line tool.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.480
So I have this.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.920
Let me make a thicker line.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.120
So we have this vector
here, which is T1.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.070
And we would need to figure
out what that is.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.200
And then we have the other
vector, which is its y

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.890
component, and I'll draw
that like here.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.890
This is its y component.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.900
We could call this T1 sub y.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.920
And then of course, it has an
x component too, and I'll do

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.360
that in-- let's see.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.160
I'll do that in red.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.170
Once again, this is just
breaking up a force into its

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.250
component vectors like we've--
a vector force into its x and

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.350
y components like we've been
doing in the last several

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.100
problems. And these are just
trigonometry problems, right?

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.920
We could actually now, visually
see that this is T

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.620
sub 1 x and this is
T sub 1 sub y.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.130
Oh, and I forgot to give you an
important property of this

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.780
problem that you needed to
know before solving it.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.820
Is that the angle that the
first wire forms with the

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.370
ceiling, this is 30 degrees.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:58.470
So if that is 30 degrees, we
also know that this is a

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.240
parallel line to this.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.880
So if this is 30 degrees,
this is also

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.290
going to be 30 degrees.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.240
So this angle right here is also
going to be 30 degrees.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.370
And that's from our-- you know,
we know about parallel

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.690
lines and alternate
interior angles.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.870
We could have done
it the other way.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.745
We could have said that if this
angle is 30 degrees, this

00:06:21.745 --> 00:06:22.900
angle is 60 degrees.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.620
This is a right angle,
so this is also 30.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.620
But that's just review
of geometry

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.290
that you already know.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.280
But anyway, we know that this
angle is 30 degrees, so what's

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.600
its y component?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.460
Well the y component,
let's see.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.090
What involves the hypotenuse
and the opposite side?

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.640
Let me write soh cah toa at the
top because this is really

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.920
just trigonometry.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.670
soh cah toa in blood red.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.730
So what involves the opposite
and the hypotenuse?

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.770
So opposite over hypotenuse.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:55.310
So that we know the sine-- let
me switch to the sine of 30

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:05.630
degrees is equal to T1 sub y
over the tension in the string

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.610
going in this direction.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:15.730
So if we solve for T1 sub y we
get T1 sine of 30 degrees is

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.870
equal to T1 sub y.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.210
And what did we just say
before we kind of

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.990
dived into the math?

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:30.600
We said all of the lifting on
this point is being done by

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.550
the y component of T1.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.310
Because T2 is not doing any
lifting up or down, it's only

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.920
pulling to the left.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.590
So the entire component that's
keeping this object up,

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.770
keeping it from falling
is the y component of

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.040
this tension vector.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.930
So that has to equal the force
of gravity pulling down.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.840
This has to equal the
force of gravity.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.710
That has to equal this
or this point.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.260
So that's 100 Newtons.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.185
And I really want to hit this
point home because it might be

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:06.140
a little confusing to you.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.810
We just said, this point
is stationery.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.000
It's not moving up or down.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.720
It's not accelerating
up or down.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.540
And so we know that there's a
downward force of 100 Newtons,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.480
so there must be an upward force
that's being provided by

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.800
these two wires.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.150
This wire is providing
no upward force.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.140
So all of the upward force must
be the y component or the

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.350
upward component of this force
vector on the first wire.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.309
So given that, we can now solve
for the tension in this

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:39.409
first wire because we have
T1-- what's sine of 30?

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.050
Sine of 30 degrees, in case you
haven't memorized it, sine

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.990
of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:52.640
So T1 times 1/2 is equal
to 100 Newtons.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.200
Divide both sides by 1/2
and you get T1 is

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:03.350
equal to 200 Newtons.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.800
So now we've got to figure out
what the tension in this

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.870
second wire is.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.790
And we also, there's
another clue here.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.640
This point isn't moving left
or right, it's stationary.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.970
So we know that whatever the
tension in this wire must be,

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.120
it must be being offset by a
tension or some other force in

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.260
the opposite direction.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.150
And that force in the opposite
direction is the x component

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.220
of the first wire's tension.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.140
So it's this.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.200
So T2 is equal to the
x component of the

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.990
first wire's tension.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.410
And what's the x component?

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.520
Well, it's going to be the
tension in the first wire, 200

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.250
Newtons times the cosine
of 30 degrees.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.900
It's adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.320
And that's square root
of 3 over 2.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.410
So it's 200 times the square
root of 3 over 2, which equals

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.590
100 square root of 3.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.940
So the tension in this wire is
100 square root of 3, which

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.590
completely offsets to the left
and the x component of this

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.540
wire is 100 square root of
3 Newtons to the right.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.446
Hopefully I didn't
confuse you.

00:10:17.446 --> 00:10:19.250
See you in the next video.
