00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.820
- All right.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.610
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.490
Thanks for this great
introduction, but let's

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.860
do it systematically, OK?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.460
That's my family.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.040
And when I told Laura,
who you see in the middle,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.470
that I got this
phone call from Judy,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.720
she said, oh, we
have a big problem.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.050
And I thought, she's nixing
the idea of my coming here.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.930
She said, you may have to
buy a button-down shirt,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.670
and wear it too.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.290
So this is it.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.570
You're looking at it.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.735
I owe her big.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.960
So the fellow Fellows in whose
company I spent this year

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.310
are truly amazing.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.960
I really don't think I've
ever been in the company--

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.520
such a rarefied company, so
that's really quite an honor.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:07.280
And, of course, all of this
mountain of applications

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.460
that we created, somebody
had to read that stuff.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.820
And such a valiant act
of selflessness cannot go

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.300
unrecognized.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.980
So I really thank Liz,
Judy, and everybody

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.320
at Radcliffe for making
such a great place to work.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.840
Similarly, in the Center
for the Environment,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.800
the two co-directors made
me at home pretty much

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.130
from the beginning.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.900
And finally, my collaborators
at the Chan School

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.740
of Public Health.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.550
So I really thank all of
them, and you, for coming.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.200
And let's get going.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.140
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.930
Once I hit the deck, I got
acquainted with these two

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.600
Harvard College pals.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.140
And we meet once a week, they
tell me what needs to be done,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.360
then they tell me how
they are doing it,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.370
and then we meet
the following week

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.160
and they show me
how it was done.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.009
So, I mean, I taught at
the University of Chicago

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.630
for almost a decade.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.600
I've never seen
anything like these two,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.160
so I feel very fortunate.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.290
So the plan for
today is as follows.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290
I'll start by
introducing the problem

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.240
heuristically, the problem
that I'm interested in.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.840
I'll highlight some
geophysical and societal costs

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.930
of agriculture that
motivate this work.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.940
Then I'll take you
on a short personal

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.290
aside that kind of
augments a little

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.040
bit the story that Judy
told a few minutes ago.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.440
And then I'll share
key results that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.290
will be the crux of the talk,
and some concluding musings.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.290
And then it'll be your turn.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.800
So that's the idea.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.060
Now, what is rethinking
the American diet?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.520
So here are two meals that
I would be likely to eat,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.230
kind of betraying my
Middle Eastern origin.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.160
And here is
something a bit more,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.970
let's say, American or European.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.650
The essence of my work, and
the essence of the talk that I

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.680
prepared today, is to show
you how if you know it or you

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.520
don't.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.140
When you make a choice
between one of those meals,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.920
or between any two competing
ingredients, or any two

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.100
competing meals,
you're making, really,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.970
a whole cascade of
important choices

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.380
that you may or may
not be aware of.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.250
So for example,
in that choice you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.830
determine very much the
nature of rural communities.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.670
How they are structured, how
densely populated they are,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.690
et cetera.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.470
You certainly-- those
choices have a lot

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.130
to say about greenhouse
gas emissions that

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.000
are done on your behalf.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.430
And you also get to take sides
in things that we don't often

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.680
think about, that are kind
of like societal strifes.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.490
So here's an example.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.060
This article discusses
this long picket line

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.820
that farmers in the Klamath
Basin in Oregon formed,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.680
because for the
first time, they were

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.870
told that the US
is actually going

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.530
to honor its treaty
with the Klamath tribe,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.310
and share the water
between alfalfa growers--

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.030
who got 100% of the
water up until now--

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.660
and the Klamath tribe.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.410
And they didn't like it one bit.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.370
You also get to make important
contributions, large or small,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.030
to water pollution on
land, like creeks, ponds,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.240
even as far up as
the Great Lakes.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.580
Lake Erie, every
10 years it seems

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.740
that Lake Erie-- Lake Erie's
obituary appears in The New

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.300
York Times, and then it
comes back to life ever

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.500
so fleetingly.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.770
That has a lot to
do with choices

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.000
such as choosing between
either of these or this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.240
And it has a coastal
oceanic counterpart,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.620
which seems a lot
more devastating,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.200
but it happens with
great regularity

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.690
every summer the entire northern
part of the Gulf of Mexico

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.550
is dead to the world.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.850
But dead, I mean literally
dead, like that dead.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.175
And that is because
of dietary choices,

00:05:58.175 --> 00:05:59.690
as I'll describe later.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.560
And finally, you also get
to decide, if by the time

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.580
you are 82, you're going to
be able-- like this pal, right

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.900
here, at 82-- to ride
across Canada, from Nova

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.000
Scotia to British
Columbia, or you

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.620
will be warming the
rocking chair on the porch.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.670
Those alternatives also have
a lot to do with the choices

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.230
that you're making.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.110
So let's look a
little bit at how

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.240
geophysics and food and
dietary choices are related.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.230
This is actually a
farm, the closest thing

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.840
to heaven on earth.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.420
It's right near my house.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.760
And this is what it looks like.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.080
When I bike from
my home to work,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.220
this is the kind of
landscape that I traverse.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.290
But, of course, not all
agricultural communities

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.750
are quite that beautiful.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.470
So here's an
interesting example.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.750
There's a million
dimension to this problem,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.970
and I don't have time
to describe them all.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.460
I'll just cherry pick a few, OK?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.420
So one of them is this
burgeoning field of geophysics

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.450
called hydrobio-geochemistry.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.250
So it is what it sounds like.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.540
It's concatenating four
different sciences into one.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.550
Now, geochemistry-- of course,
geology and chemistry--

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.000
that concatenation happened
half a century ago.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.970
So now we think of
it as a discipline.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.990
But now a lot of the
reactions that it addresses

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.820
are mediated by life.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.410
So naturally, we appended
bio to that as a prefix.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.000
And finally, all of that is
done as aqueous chemistry,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.020
so hydrology is the
next obvious addition.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.700
So hydrobio-geochemistry
is actually a thing.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:12.530
And it determines the confluence
of hydrology, biology,

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.150
geochemistry of the
Earth's surface.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.880
Now, farmers do
a bunch of things

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.950
to the surface to have
an impact on the rate

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.210
at which hydrobio-geochemical
processes occur.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.800
So first of all, they fertilize.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.770
That just adds a larger source.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.299
Normally, the atmosphere,
which is 80% nitrogen,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:45.560
just deposits roughly half dry,
half wet nitrogen on the land,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.820
or on the ocean, on the surface.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.460
And that's what the biosphere
has to contend with.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.320
Fertilization makes
that that much larger.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.870
Tilling and so on
aerate the soil, which

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.570
is very important because
then the percolation

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.170
of meteoric water in--
meteoric water means rain,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.530
or snow, any kind
of precipitation.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.860
So aeration of
the soil basically

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.550
makes the percolation
of this water

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.630
that much faster
into the subsurface.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.370
Now, they also do
something that's

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.920
called tiling, not
tilling-- they do that,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.030
and that belongs here--
but they do tiling.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.430
It's a little known
fact, but basically

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.210
most agricultural provinces,
such as the Midwest,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.560
have about six feet
below the surface-- it

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.390
used to be literally tiles.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:48.590
It isn't tiles anymore, it's
just perforated plastic pipes.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.510
But the purpose of
that is basically

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.990
to keep root systems
from being submerged.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.270
That's the kiss of
death for crops.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.530
So, whereas it is well-known
that farmers, let's say, pray

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.800
for rain-- but the
minute rain arrives,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.320
they become unhappy,
because now they

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.460
see the root systems
gradually becoming submerged.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.390
That's where tiling
comes in, and it totally

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.880
alters-- as I will show you
momentarily-- the hydrology.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.260
And then they also degrade, by
chemical and physical means,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.580
the soil biota.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.820
And soil biota are extremely
important in taking

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:35.540
any kind of reactive compound
brought down from the surface,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.070
and processing it
and rendering it

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.850
benign, environmentally benign.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.240
So when you degrade soil
biota, you basically

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.170
diminish the ecosystem's
ability to render

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:58.340
those otherwise dangerous--
or potentially dangerous--

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.060
compounds harmless.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.310
So all of this,
like I said, happens

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.770
in an aqueous environment.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.860
So this is, over
here, discharge,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.030
and over here you have
days after a rain event.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.310
Zero is when the rain occurs.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.680
And what we're seeing here are
two-- the discharge response

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.760
to rain of two different,
but otherwise very

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.280
similar in composition,
small drainage basins.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.340
One is highly
impervious, so it's

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.130
like, you can think
about it like pavement.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.150
But tiling is very much
taking a natural surface

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.840
and rendering it
highly impervious.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.520
And the other is natural.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.080
And you see that what happens
is that the modified one,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.510
the modified basin, has an
extremely rapid response.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:02.120
And it is equally rapidly
decaying once the rain is over.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:08.240
So you can now picture on
the natural environment,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.720
the water comes down
in a stately manner,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.050
it is kind of assimilated
into the soil,

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.170
and the soil biota
begins to handle it,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.720
et cetera, and gradually
percolates down.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.740
And over maybe a
week, order a week,

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.680
it makes its way downstream.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:34.850
Conversely, in this case, the
highly-modified one, 12 hours

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.950
and it's gone.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:44.270
So because soil biota
have a limiting kinetics--

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.060
in other words,
there's only that much

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.580
that they can handle
per unit time--

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:56.250
the amount of time that the
aqueous solutions are resident

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.900
over in that soil is extremely
important to the soil biota's

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.200
ability to process that.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.060
Well, if you hasten
that to such an extent,

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.960
you basically make that
soil biota really unable

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.620
to handle it, or
able very partially.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.170
And the end result,
you can see right here,

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.230
this is the mouth of the
Mississippi right here,

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.430
and this is the northern
part of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.470
The contours right here--
you see right here,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:37.590
that's bottom water dissolved
oxygen in milligrams per liter.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.590
And these are the
numerical values.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:45.160
So the point is,
natural upper-level sea

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.880
waters will have, let's say,
order 10 to 100 in those units.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.840
So these waters are
severely depleted

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.960
in oxygen. Essentially,
just like if you

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.650
leave a head of lettuce in the
fridge and forget about it.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.090
It'll decay, decompose,
and it will consume oxygen

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.886
because decomposition is the
opposite of photosynthesis,

00:14:08.886 --> 00:14:10.890
so it'll consume oxygen.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.980
In the fridge there is
no limitation on oxygen,

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.010
but in the bottom waters
of the Gulf of Mexico

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.770
there's only that much
oxygen to go around.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:25.410
If you invest all that oxygen
in decomposing dead algae,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.110
you have none left for the fish.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:33.480
And that's the result, are those
dead fish that we saw earlier.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.690
Another aspect of the dietary
choices described earlier,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:45.240
really is impacting, very
strongly, the radiative balance

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.700
of the Earth's surface.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:52.680
It's a zeroth order attribute of
the Earth, the degree to which

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.890
it receives solar
radiation from the star it

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:01.320
orbits-- that's the sun-- and
then gets rid of it to space.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.850
That's a fundamental attribute
of any particular planet,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:11.260
and ours is strongly modified
by the presence of agriculture.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.920
For example, since we are
in North America right now,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.500
let's focus on North America.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.200
What we are looking
at is MODIS data.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:24.360
MODIS is a piece of hardware
that NASA put in orbit,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.600
and it has cameras
looking down on Earth

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.385
in various wavelengths.

00:15:29.385 --> 00:15:33.600
And in this particular
case, you see the degree

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.860
to which the vegetation--
anthropogenic vegetation--

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.480
changes modified the
Earth's reflectivity.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.930
So all of the eastern
part of the US

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:51.810
increased between 2% to 5%.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.760
Now, that sounds, perhaps, not
that dramatic, but remember

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.770
that the entire planetary mean
of that is something like 30%.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.130
2% to 5% is a very
large perturbation.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.840
And sure enough, if you
ask what does it correspond

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.460
to-- the fact that I took
all of this part of the US,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.720
devoted it to crops,
and thereby made

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.050
it that much more reflective
to solar radiation--

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.800
what does that do?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.850
Well, here you see it in terms
of the net downward surface

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.990
radiation, and you see
that that part is somewhere

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.400
in the range of 2 to
10 watts per meter

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.610
squared-- that's the currency of
global warming, watts per meter

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.270
squared.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:44.190
So between 2 and 10 watts
per meter squared less

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.010
are warming the
eastern part of the US,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.820
exclusively because
of food production.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.930
And that is something you
can-- I know that most of you

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.150
don't think in watts
per meter squared,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.190
so let me help you here.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:05.040
The entire anthropogenic
perturbation

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.000
to the planetary heat balance
that we have created by,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.750
in the longwave part
of the spectrum,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.560
so-called global warming
is one and a half watts

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.800
per meter squared.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.109
This is significantly
larger than that, locally.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.890
That one and a half applies
to the planetary mean,

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.569
this only applies locally.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.560
But still, these are
large, large provinces.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.300
Another one is
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:41.690
So in the US, agriculture is
about 10% of all emissions.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.060
Putting food on our
tables is about 25%.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.400
So, in other words, that
9%, 10% is roughly doubled,

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.250
or a little more than
that with all the things

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.920
that happen post-production.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.970
Packaging, shipping,
cooking, all of that stuff.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.970
So that's not
enormously important,

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.746
but every little bit helps.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.610
Now, agriculture is, of
course, a huge land user.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.670
So, again, let's
focus on the US.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:24.010
In the US, 47% of the
total national surface area

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.795
is devoted to food production.

00:18:25.795 --> 00:18:26.295
48%.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.530
And it's broken down.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.950
In terms of crops,
corn and hay dominate,

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.010
and other crops kind
of trail this bit

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.600
to the tune of about 19% of
the natural surface area.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.545
And pasture range
and forested graze

00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:51.570
land, that's a third of the
entire national surface area.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.750
And these two together work
out to just under half.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.400
Now, just to give you a
yardstick again, all the things

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.640
that we actually eat
that are enumerated here,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.130
that's under half a percent.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.340
That's this green
bar right here.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.660
So how amazing is that, that all
the stuff that we actually eat

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.280
is like a minuscule fraction
of the total, but all of this

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.000
is basically entirely
devoted to animals?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.670
Of course, we eat those
animals, ultimately,

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.800
but as I'll show
you momentarily,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.950
it's not a particularly
efficient metabolic pathway.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.380
Now, it's important because
the environmental costs

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.060
of diets scale roughly
as the land surface used.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.390
So one example is biodiversity.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.190
So the European, especially
in the Netherlands,

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.310
they care a lot about
their songbirds, I guess.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.310
And they spent a
lot of money trying

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:59.070
to preserve on farm songbirds,
only to realize this paper

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.270
was supposed to be the
triumphant enumeration of tax

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.980
money well-spent in
saving those birds.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.820
Instead, they concluded that
all that money, and still 50%

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.390
to 90% of all
species are steadily

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:20.520
declining despite all
of that hand-holding.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.560
Back in North America,
it's about 100,000 coyotes

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.410
that are killed in
the name of sparing

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:33.180
ranchers the inconvenience
called coyotes.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.520
100,000 a year.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.710
I mean, try to picture
100,000 dead German Shepherds.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.180
That's what we're talking about.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.260
It's not a pretty sight.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:54.000
Now, this piece that
aired on NPR in 2014

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.160
put forth the statistics that
ranchers all but wiped out

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.970
the Mexican Gray Wolf, the
most endangered wolf species

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.100
in the world, in the US.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:11.360
And, of course, that
is to protect ranching.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:18.770
Now, one thing that the beef
industry-- the beef industry

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.550
is employing exactly
the same methodology

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:27.410
that ExxonMobil employs, and
that The Heartland Institute,

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:33.260
and all of those-- this kind of
a front series of organizations

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.160
that are in the business of
spewing this information.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.380
The beef industry is
very much in that milieu,

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.480
and they always tell you,
oh, but graze land out west

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.040
is a great means by which
we further biodiversity.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.900
Really?

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.690
Let's look at that a
little bit critically.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:59.090
So here is a paper
from PNAS in 2011

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:05.600
that scaled natural range-land
species abundance to be one.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.970
And then they progress down
the gradient of increasing

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.620
human intervention.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.690
And what did they see?

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.190
By the time you get to
moderately used or intensively

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.370
used, you lost about a
half of all the species.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.060
By the time you got to this,
which they unfortunately

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.640
named man-made grasslands, you
lost 70% of all the species.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.130
That doesn't look,
to me, like grazing

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:39.320
is a great means by which
we will further biodiversity

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.630
in the semi-arid west.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.420
And so much so,
that this paper that

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.630
came out just a few
weeks ago-- this guy

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.940
is the king of something
that ecologists called

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.160
[? exclusia, ?] which is
basically take a landscape,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.880
exclude from it all the
ungulates, and wait 25 years,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.760
come back and write a
paper about what happened.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.300
And that's what they do,
paper after paper after paper.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.050
These guys better
enjoy longevity,

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.536
or else their number
of papers is limited.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.600
So they just concluded,
very clearly,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.330
that biodiversity
conservation key

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.520
is reducing meat consumption.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.330
Therefore, it follows that
eating land-cheap food is one

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.980
of the callings of our time.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:38.380
And that is added to
non-geophysical issues raised

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.690
by food production.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:45.640
For example-- this is from
the Times just the other day,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.760
a couple weeks
ago-- showing how,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.130
in the Salinas
Valley in California,

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.210
just southeast of
Santa Cruz, you

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.660
have all of this
production of broccoli,

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.260
and arugula, and all of
the great green stuff

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.110
everywhere except on
the table of those

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.680
who actually farm these fields.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.790
They can't afford that.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.910
So that said, that's not really
my department, I do geophysics.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.110
But I'm certainly
acutely aware of

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.690
and mindful of these aspects.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.310
Now it's time to define my work.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.250
This is, by the way, our forest.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.500
The backyard of our house.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.620
And here I am
beginning to prepare

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.530
firewood for the winter.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.100
I come from geophysics,
that's where I'm comfortable,

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.590
and this is what I know best.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.220
Climate, meteorology, land
atmosphere interactions.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.380
This I wouldn't call myself
an expert on, but I use it.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.620
That's my comfort zone.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.600
Now, there's the
societal issues.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.650
I will definitely not
manufacture new information,

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.210
new knowledge, in this.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:05.770
I will just be aware
of what's going on.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.340
Agricultural tax
and water policies,

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.670
farm wages and conditions,
immigration, et cetera.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.360
Everything that affects farming.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.330
Crop science is
extremely important.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:24.810
What can be-- I am condensing
crop sizes to a simple,

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.270
to question a synopsis--
what can be grown where,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.130
and at what cost?

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.860
Hugely important for my work.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.180
Nutritional science.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:40.420
Again, a whole body of
centuries-old discipline

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.460
that I condense into
what extends or shortens

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.500
healthy lives.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.410
Culture, cuisines,
preferences, all of that stuff

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:57.010
that impact our dietary choices.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:01.060
So my work really conflates
all of those things,

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.730
and the way it does
that is formally,

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:08.020
not by hand-waving,
but formally.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.090
This is the objective.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.390
Devise diets and
agricultural policies

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.870
that simultaneously minimize
environmental impacts

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.230
and maximize health outcomes.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.760
That's the idea.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.700
And the actual-- when
I say a solution,

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.960
I mean a vector,
comprising x1 grams

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.200
of eggplant, x2 grams of
lentils, blah blah blah,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.920
like that.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.820
All of those masses
of individual foods

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.260
that they can only
be positive and real,

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.720
so that's what this is saying.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.210
Finding a solution like
that, that's what I do.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:59.020
But it is subject
to these conditions.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.060
It must minimize
the cost function.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.270
This is the linear term,
which is very simple.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.820
It's just-- suppose my cost
is greenhouse gas emissions.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:15.340
So eggplant emits that much,
and squash emits that much.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.430
I sum them up, and that's
this term, right here.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.910
Some other things are better
described quadratically,

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.130
and this is what is shown here.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.020
It's not really super important.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.140
The point is that it's
an optimization problem,

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.340
minimizing the cost,
however defined.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.490
And you can add to
this-- I mean, typically

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.710
in a real problem, you will have
numerous terms, not just one.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.840
You will have
multiple linear terms

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.270
and numerous quadratic terms
in the most general cases.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.660
This basically
says that this diet

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.020
must satisfy a series
of constraints,

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.420
as I will show you momentarily.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.790
And, of course, everything has
to be positive semi-definite.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:08.160
You can't have a negative
amount of pork, let's say.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.330
So let me give you kind of
a heuristic explanation,

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.120
in the simplest possible
way, what's going on.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.040
Suppose I want to devise a diet
that cares about two things.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:27.030
Not exceeding that amount of
fat, so this is maximum fat,

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.780
and this axis here is
grams of fat in the diet.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.980
And not going below
minimum amount of protein,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.100
shown by the
vertical dashed line.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.920
As long as I'm in this
quadrant, all is well.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.260
I have more protein
than the minimum,

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.985
I have less fat
than the maximum.

00:28:44.985 --> 00:28:47.740
I'm good to go.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.570
Suppose I'm trying to
do that with two foods.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.610
Let's start with tofu,
always a good idea.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.220
And what is shown
right here, this

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.190
is the arrow of
increasing mass of tofu.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.700
But because tofu has
more protein than fat,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.680
it's kind of oblique.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.700
It adds little fat, while
adding a whole lot of protein.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.690
However, there is
a third dimension

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.880
to this problem,
kind of emanating

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.550
from the board toward you.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.930
And that is mass.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.320
You can't expect the gal to
sit down and put away two

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.220
pounds of tofu in one sitting.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.300
So think about this
as just lurking

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.330
above this surface,
the glass ceiling

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.830
that Hillary almost shattered.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.340
Now, we realize that by the
time we hit the ceiling,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.140
we're still short of
the feasible region.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.540
In other words, we maxed out on
the amount of tofu permitted,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.570
and we are not in the
feasible space yet.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.070
Not good, not good.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:00.780
But avocados to the rescue.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.710
So here we are, we
add, now, avocado.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.870
We back off a little
bit, so you see

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.210
that this arrow is a
little shorter than this,

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.930
so as to go down relative
to the glass ceiling

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:18.030
and allow the avocados
some mass to work with.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:26.610
And just by simple kind of
high school vector addition,

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.330
we get to, with the
ample amount of avocado,

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.880
we get inside the
feasible region.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.240
But you see that
I can be anywhere

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.690
between this line and this.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.270
So the problem is
underdetermined.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:46.740
The indeterminacy
is exactly my chance

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:51.360
to minimize, or maximize,
whatever the hell I want.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.540
So for example, you
see the shading,

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.330
as this is showing right
here, is simply monetary cost.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.080
Obviously, the more tofu I
buy, the more I'll pay, right?

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.670
So the shading gets darker
as you go to the upper right.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.750
Now, as soon as we
added avocado, now

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:15.180
the cost field is bent
that way, because now it's

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.200
avocado that is
calling the shots.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.080
But it's still doing
the same thing.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.240
And if I were to simply
minimize monetary costs,

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.530
this will be my
solution right here.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.130
There is a beautiful
theorem that

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.980
tells us the solution is
always on one of the vertices.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.370
So we need not look
in the entire space,

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:41.280
we only need to go vertex after
vertex, and we're good to go.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.870
Now, on the other hand,
if monetary cost was not

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.100
the only thing, but
suppose, for example,

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.470
we wanted to maximize intake
of some protective fatty

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:56.700
acid of which avocado
provides a whole lot of.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.810
Then, we would want to have
as much avocado as possible.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.450
So we will actually be here.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.090
Because we can't go
any further than this,

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.760
because then we will
have too much fat.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.910
But we can be there, and
that will maximize the intake

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.580
of that protective fatty acid.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.930
That's the-- in a nutshell--
a highly truncated,

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.860
simplified version of the
kind of optimization problems

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.560
that I'm discussing.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.470
Now, here is the personal bit.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.560
And I get asked this a
million times a week, now

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.970
is a good time to answer.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.970
I always shrug my
shoulders, but today I

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.470
think I'm going to answer it.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.440
So let me show you this.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.070
This is my father, right there.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.290
And he was a seaman.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:51.550
I mean, when I was
born, he was a mate,

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.890
and then he became a captain.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.955
And here he is leading
our ship into the Corinth

00:32:57.955 --> 00:33:04.000
Canal separating Greece
proper from the Peloponnese.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.320
And when he met my mother
and they became an item,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.550
and shortly thereafter, my
sister and I came along,

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:13.900
we kept on sailing.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.510
And this is how I
grew up, on ships.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.600
I never went to
school to speak of,

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.990
except whatever my mother kind
of squeezed in between storms.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.120
And that's what it looked like.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:35.350
Now, I had this particular
spot on the right side

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.610
of the bridge.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:40.060
On ships they call it
the starboard side.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.550
And that's where I
would sit and worry

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.960
if we're going to make it
up the next wave or not.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.330
It was a great
childhood, and it took us

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.160
to all kinds of nice places.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.170
This is Western Africa.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.510
We spent the better
part of a year

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.080
there, and met somebody
smaller than us,

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.440
which was uncharacteristic.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.520
But when my sister
was a teen and she

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.440
had to go to the
military, I really

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.889
didn't want to continue
doing that by myself, just

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.360
with my parents.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:20.080
And so both my parents
were born in Kibbutzim,

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.150
and they continued sailing.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:25.510
I basically struck it on my own.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:29.020
I was 13, and I went to
live in this kibbutz,

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.570
and that's when I
first met cattle.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.260
And it was love at
first sight, and I still

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:43.060
very much love cows, very much.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.969
So this was dairy.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.580
And, you see, in '76 I
went to the military,

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.670
then I biked around the
world for several years.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.300
All kinds of good stuff.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.350
But then I came back
to Israel in '82.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.840
There was a war, that's
what brought me there,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.100
to reserve service.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.400
But then after that, I stayed.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.800
And I said, what is
it that I want to do?

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.200
Really, cattle is
what I love best.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.700
Let me raise cattle.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.820
So the mothers were living
in the Golan Heights,

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.380
you see right here.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.880
They would give birth to calves,
they were all synchronized,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.150
all the mothers are
synchronized so it's based

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.190
on the availability of grass.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:28.000
So they would all give birth
to a calf, sometimes two,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.330
between late September
and early November, when

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:36.340
the grass is actually green and
not this bleak yellow that it

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.570
now is.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.490
And then they would
be brought over

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.710
here to this place
called [INAUDIBLE],

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:47.530
and that's where they would
gain about a kilogram, sometimes

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:52.810
a kilogram and a half
per day eating like that.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.560
During that time, I
availed myself of something

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.480
that Israel, because of
its socialist past, had,

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.700
which was a free-- you can
think about this, essentially,

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:12.070
like an undergraduate major
from Cornell in animal science.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.200
But it's not academic.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.470
It's meant for herd
managers, and that is what

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.570
I suppose I was at that time.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.410
And I started and
graduated in this--

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.350
it kind of looks like
a kibbutz, really,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.040
but it's sort of a
pseudo-academic place.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.150
And it was extremely rigorous
and very, very wonderful.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:40.360
And finally, as Judy said, then
I switched to math and physics,

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.980
I liked it, et cetera.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.430
And then I started the
Ph.D. This guy, Mark Cane,

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.830
is my thesis advisor.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.660
He's a professor of
applied math at Columbia,

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.620
and now a good friend.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.000
So here is the answer.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.810
That's the end of the aside.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:00.250
So how do you get there?

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.730
Well, I think that maybe
early life dominated by ocean,

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:07.180
atmosphere, and cattle.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.002
Having no K-12 schooling
always helps, I think.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.860
And so basically if
you learn anything,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.170
it's not because your
teachers nag you,

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.980
but it's because
you saw something

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.820
and you want to understand
what the heck is going on.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:30.140
That's a very good motivation,
at least in my experience.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:34.840
And then once I stopped being
a bum and became serious,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.540
I enjoyed really
superb training,

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.065
both courtesy of the
Israeli Ministry of Ag,

00:37:41.065 --> 00:37:43.650
and then in geophysics
with Mark Cane.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.540
And then I was a
post-doc, actually,

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.810
across the common at
the Department of Earth

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.870
and Planetary Phys--
then, it was called

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.160
Earth and Planetary Physics.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.300
So it sort of makes
sense, I don't know.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.230
If it doesn't to you,
oh well, what can I say.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:05.130
Let's do some homework here, OK?

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:10.330
So this is a paper
in which we took

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:13.350
the mean American
diet, which comprised--

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:17.430
it has 3,800 kilocalories
per person, per day.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:22.200
That much from plant, and
all the rest is from animals.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.680
And we ask, what happens
if those calories,

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.970
about 1,000 calories a
day from animal sources,

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.120
what if it obeys
a certain pattern?

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.110
For example, lacto-ovo
vegetarian, or purely

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:41.730
red meat diet, or only
poultry, et cetera.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:44.330
The diets ended up
stacking up like this.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.190
Vegan was the least
greenhouse gas intensive,

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.080
red meat was the most.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.480
MAD is-- I'm very
proud of this--

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.690
it's the mean American diet.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.360
Very aptly acronym.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.590
And this was taken up by
pretty much every news

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.780
outlet in existence.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:10.500
It was my first introduction
to this sort of-- the mad house

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.580
that science coverage
in the media is.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.020
But this is the upshot.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.100
If you take two Americans eating
the same number of calories

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.570
and the same quality of diet,
but one only from plants,

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.060
and the other like the
mean American diet,

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.630
the difference between
those two is 1,500 kilograms

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.970
of CO2 emitted per person,
per day-- per year, excuse me.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.030
Now, being that
each one of us now

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:43.850
is responsible for 21
metric tons per year,

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:47.970
that's 7% of the total that
can be eliminated by switching

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:50.640
from the MAD to
plant-based diet,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.590
and that's maybe why it caught
the attention of those media

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.610
outlets.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:00.240
If you recall, that
7% is the lion's share

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.960
of what I showed
you earlier, the 9%.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.250
Remember the 9%?

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.530
It's this.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.130
This.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.620
So almost all of
it-- let me speed

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.130
this up a little bit--
almost all of this

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:22.920
can actually be eliminated
by that dietary transition.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.520
Well, that was
pretty interesting.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.530
But then I realized,
well, I mean,

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.352
if you're looking at
something that's, at most, 9%,

00:40:32.352 --> 00:40:33.810
that's not really
that interesting.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:37.140
Let's look at something
that actually dominates.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:43.080
And that is land use, over
here, and reactive nitrogen.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.590
NR is reactive nitrogen. Think
about this as contributions

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.870
to water pollution.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:54.280
So here, this is something
called a Monte Carlo solution,

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.050
which means you kind of
randomly envision people

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:01.530
eating in various
idiosyncratic ways.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:06.660
And there are 2,000 people
eating the mixed diets,

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.050
like the mean American
diet, and 2,000 people

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:11.940
eating plant-based diets.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.080
Never mind the
difference between those,

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.440
that's optimization
or no optimization.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.080
It's not really
supremely important.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:25.470
What is important is that we
devise 4,000 diets, half mixed,

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.000
half pure plant.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.990
And we see, now, the difference
in terms of-- over here,

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.870
in the vertical-- the
contribution to water

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.390
pollution, and over
here, the contribution

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.570
to demand for land, cropland.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:46.200
And we see the national scale
difference between those two.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.120
And by the way, there is nothing
in the way the problem is posed

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:57.750
that will make these clouds,
and these clouds, mutually

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.150
exclusive, non-overlapping.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.960
They could have overlap
if they so chose,

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.640
but they chose not to.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.120
And that is because of the
stark, stark difference

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.720
in land consumption
and in contributions

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.980
to water pollution.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.450
So here's the upshot.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.780
In terms of land,
you-- excuse me,

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:26.160
in terms of, yes, land, which
is this distance right here--

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.800
you save something
like 130 million acres.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.520
National cropland
is just over 400.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.660
So that's somewhere
between a quarter

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:45.400
and a third of the total,
is saved by these choices.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.740
Now, in terms of contributions
to water pollution,

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:56.070
you save 7 million metric tons
out of a total national of 11.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.400
Again, a very
significant difference.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:03.690
Now, let me speed
up here, because we

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.700
don't have that much time left.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.260
So let me just introduce you to
this guy, who I've been working

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:14.090
with for a number of years now.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:18.600
It's really an honor, almost
comparable to the honor

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.830
that I feel being part
of the Radcliffe crew,

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:26.220
but let me take you to the paper
that we're about to submit,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.870
and I'll wrap this up because
I am running out of time.

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:36.720
So if you think switching from
whatever you're eating now

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.620
to plants is very hard,
this calculation asks,

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.100
what happens if we
only replace beef?

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:49.050
Beef contributes only about
65 grams per person, per day.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:49.770
That's it.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:53.190
But it claims, depending
on the resource

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:57.870
that you're looking at, 80%
or 90% of the total national.

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.150
So it contributes
almost nothing,

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.600
and it uses almost everything.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.610
So for example, here, if
you just switch from beef

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:15.270
to poultry, this is the
amount of concentrated feed

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:17.940
and processed
roughage and pasture

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.590
that are going into beef.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.470
This we treat as entirely free.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:27.150
So not contributing anything,
because chickens can't graze,

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.650
they are monogastric.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.420
So this is just free.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:35.850
And these two, if you reallocate
them to producing poultry,

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:41.500
you will be able to increase
the output calories five-fold.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:47.160
520% more calories
will be available

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.450
if you just made that simple
switch from beef to poultry.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:53.820
And how many-- check
this out-- how many

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:59.760
more Americans will be fully
sustained on that addition?

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:05.090
116 million out of a
320 million nation.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.410
Now, this is in energy.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.030
What about in protein?

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.900
You will have four-fold
more output protein

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.450
in this substitution.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:16.820
Look at how much
smaller the losses are.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:22.250
This red is the loss in
the beef route, this one.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:28.220
This is the lost protein
in the poultry route.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.800
And it's, of course,
dramatically smaller.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.200
And it will add 140 million
additional Americans.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.740
When you look at results
like that, you say, really?

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:46.490
You have to eat beef, no matter
those 140 additional million

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.290
Americans that could
have been sustained

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:52.040
on the same resources,
just because you think

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.530
their beef is indispensable?

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:58.280
That just doesn't make sense.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:04.210
This paper refutes a commonly
repeated, but never correct,

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.780
assertion that grass-fed
beef is somehow superior.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.390
I will skip that.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:19.310
And finally, this paper is now
working its way through review.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:22.900
The way we put it, nature
has not yet rejected it.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.870
So this is what we're saying.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.940
We're asking, OK, people,
you want your beef, fine.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:36.230
You want sustainable beef,
how much can we have?

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:39.643
But, of course, what
is sustainable beef?

00:46:39.643 --> 00:46:43.550
No two Jane and John
will define it similarly,

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.890
and I don't claim
that our definition is

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:50.030
by no means unique
or definitive,

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.860
but here's how we defined it.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.460
We said, there are two
things that beef currently

00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:00.050
eat that really have
no alternative use.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:04.310
And that is industrial
by-product, and pasture.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:07.580
No other-- well, I
mean, lamb can graze,

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.180
but that's a minuscule amount.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.970
Forget lamb.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.500
So but other than
lamb, it's cattle.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:19.400
So fine, let's allocate the
entire pastureland currently

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.700
used for beef, still
for beef, and all the

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.430
by-products-- you know
what I mean by by-products?

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:31.940
For example, you squeeze
citrus for orange juice,

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:37.760
the peel that's left is very
high-quality cattle feed.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.060
So that's an
industrial by-product.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:48.980
Mills, you make flour, it's
the results-- well, other

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.950
than the flour, the
weakling, all the other is

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:55.100
very high-quality cattle feed.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:59.240
So we allocate all the
by-products currently

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.950
used for beef, still for beef,
and that's shown right here.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:05.660
I'll explain this in a minute.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:13.190
And increasing fraction of the
total current pastureland used.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:17.840
So this left-hand
means no grazing

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.490
at all, only by-products.

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:25.850
This means the full 670
million acres currently grazed

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:29.000
by beef, still grazed by beef.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.230
And this is the percent
of today's beef supply

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:36.740
we can have with
those conditions.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.230
By-products alone
only give us something

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.020
under 5%, almost nothing.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.410
But then when you start
adding pastureland,

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:49.400
and you get to some
non-vanishingly small amount.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.680
By the time you get
to, let's say, half,

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:55.610
you get to-- over here,
it's somewhere like 35%--

00:48:55.610 --> 00:49:00.020
if you go from half of the
pastureland to full-- remember,

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:05.510
this is a vast area-- going from
half to full is an enormously

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:06.310
large area.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:10.700
300 million acres of land.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:15.950
You only add-- you only go
from 35% to 39%, that's it.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:20.930
So it really seems like, if
in a sensible kind of resource

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.730
allocation, you
will say, you know

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:25.250
what, let me be
somewhere around here,

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:29.510
claim the prime
pastureland for beef, fine.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:30.410
Let's do that.

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:34.650
But let's not eke out every
last morsel of pasture

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.710
at great environmental cost.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:41.030
For example, to riparian
buffers out west, or whatever.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:47.190
All the things that grazing
cattle does so much damage to.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:53.480
And you get oodles
more of nutrients.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:57.810
For example, right here, this
is alternative protein delivery.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:03.500
So for example, if you take
the 93 million acres of fine,

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.090
high-quality cropland.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:08.420
Forget pastureland, that
we gave to the beef.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:13.070
But only high-quality
cropland that is currently

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:15.800
used for feed for beef.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.910
And you plant in it, let's
say, wheat, or spelt.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.370
How much more
protein will you get?

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:26.750
Well, you will get
somewhere around nine times

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.860
the supply of protein
beef currently delivers.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.620
Nine times.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.620
And what about nutrition?

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.640
Let's skip-- this is the
environmental savings,

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.590
and they are enormous.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:46.730
But let's look-- I don't
know, let's pick one.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.650
Soluble fiber.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:49.430
Look at this.

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:52.490
What this means, for
example, is if I took those

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:57.620
93 million acres, and planted
them soybeans end-to-end,

00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:06.210
I will have gotten for each
one of us four and a half times

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:11.820
the additional soluble fiber
than the entire soluble fiber

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.780
delivery by your entire diet.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:21.960
That's what it means, and
it goes on and on in terms

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.550
of protective nutrients.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.510
I don't want to
beat a dead horse,

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:32.040
so let's just get to the crux
of it and I'll let you go.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.113
So here we go.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.900
Now I'm going to do something
the scientists do not do,

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.580
and that is I'm
actually going to read.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:45.090
Eating is a personal,
cultural, culinary, social act.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.280
That we all know.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.210
We also know that it determines
your health-span as powerfully

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:54.360
as genetics, or
exercise, or whatever.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.720
My work adds a
dimension to this,

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.270
showing that in making
dietary choices,

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.990
you get to tip the scale of
environmental, social, and

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:06.640
political contests,
that right now,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.100
good luck if you think we
can tip any of those scales.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.830
For example, who wins?

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:18.530
A hay farmer enabling growing
Chinese panache for beef--

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.520
that's an allusion to
the Klamath Basin--

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.570
or salmon that depend on
these contested waters,

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:30.640
and the native populations
that depend on them?

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.310
Who wins?

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:35.780
A Mississippi shrimper,
or the Iowa farmer

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.620
who's nitrogen-rich
effluent kills her catch?

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.380
It's our choice.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.230
Is what's on your plate
furthering your health,

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.720
or that of Archer Daniels?

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.780
Again, that's our choice.

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:54.990
Importantly, health,
environmental, and societal

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:58.470
considerations often,
but not always,

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:02.150
lead in similar directions.

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:05.540
It gets hairy, I'll
grant you that.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.880
All right, thanks much.
