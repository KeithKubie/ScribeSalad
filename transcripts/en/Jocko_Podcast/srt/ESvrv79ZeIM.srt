1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,870
You talk about playing the
game, quote unquote, to win,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,240
but what about people that play the
game to win for themselves and how do I

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:13,800
defeat there? That's a good,
good question. And it hit me.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,060
Yeah, when I saw that question. Ooh,
that's a good point. And that's a good,

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:21,210
there's a very important distinction
there because I'm always saying play the

6
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,320
game. Yeah. Or, Hey, you can't
play the game. You got up,

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,570
you got to build the
relationships with the boss.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,700
You've got to learn what they like.
And you kind of told the party line,

9
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:31,920
you kind of do the little things.
You got to support the,

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,080
the corporate headquarters or
the boss or the man, right?

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:41,340
Or whatever entity is
up in that ivory tower.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,290
I want you to play the game,
get them on your side.

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,890
And the reason I saved to do those things
is that so you can get more controls

14
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:57,851
so that people ask your opinion so that
you get listened to so that perhaps you

15
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,260
get promoted,
which is good.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,700
But the reason you're
doing all those things,

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,810
the reason that you're playing the game
is to help your team accomplish the

18
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:13,644
mission.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,950
That's what you are trying to do is to
help your team accomplish the mission.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,870
Now the, the other side of that
is what this question is about.

21
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,150
People that are playing
the game for personal gain,

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,940
they, they play the game so that they can
get listened to so they can drive their

23
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:40,941
personal agenda so they so vague can get
promoted and they want to get promoted

24
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,840
so that they can abuse their power.
And maybe that abuse of power is just,

25
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,330
is just working less. Maybe it's
making other people do the crap jobs,

26
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,560
whatever the,
whatever the case may be.

27
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:55,020
But they've got an agenda and they're
going to try and get promoted so they can

28
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,730
take care of themselves.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,870
And that is not why I
tell you to play the game.

30
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,790
And that's not why I played the game.

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,190
And I definitely played the
game and I played to win,

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,490
but I played because I wanted my my
squad or my platoon or my task unit or my

33
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:15,660
training command to be able to
better accomplish our mission.

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,320
That's why I played the game.
Now

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,940
there is a secondary benefit of playing
the game and that is that you could

36
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,410
possibly get promoted earlier.

37
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:32,670
You could get praise from the boss that
looks good on your record and and all

38
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:34,800
those things can happen when
you're playing the game.

39
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,720
But that's just like collateral
sort of fringe benefits.

40
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,310
But that's not why
you're playing the game.

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,960
You play the game to help the
team win and when the team wins,

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,100
you win,
which also makes the team win again.

43
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:53,190
So it's like a positive cycle because
you start developing a good reputation.

44
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,890
Now you get more leeway from the Boston
and more leeway you get from the boss.

45
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,250
The more you have the ability to
make maneuvers on the battlefield,

46
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:00,670
the more you can maneuver
on the battlefield, the
more offensive you can be,

47
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,320
the more offensive you can be,
the more you win,

48
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,950
and then you get more ability to move
more because your boss has given you even

49
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:09,490
more room to maneuver. So it's a, it's
a cycle. It's a good positive cycle.

50
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,220
Now when you have someone that's on
the team that's playing the game for

51
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,890
themselves, first of all, no
one likes that person, right?

52
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,680
Everyone can see that person. Yeah. No
one likes them and there's, believe me,

53
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,514
the military,

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,170
the military has unbelievable people
that play the game for the best possible

55
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:32,380
reasons to help their platoon and
help the mission and help us succeed.

56
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,800
There's also plenty of people
in the military and in every,

57
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,280
every different line vinyl work.

58
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,250
There's plenty of people that play the
game because they want to. They want them.

59
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,090
They were looking out for themselves.
Yeah. Looking out for number one right?

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,760
Isn't that the expression they're
looking out for? Number one,

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
there's plenty of people and I dealt
with people like that all that time

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,833
and what did I do?

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,840
I used it to my advantage and I'll tell
you what I would get in their head and

64
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,841
what I would do is I would make them think
that the best way for them to win for

65
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,810
themselves personally
was for the team to win.

66
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,940
That I would get that into their head
because they'll tell a lot of times they

67
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:14,740
miss that point.
They're looking out for themselves,

68
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,640
they're not worried about the team.

69
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,990
And I would get them thinking that
they're going to look the best if the team

70
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,180
wins. Hey, if you really
want to look good,

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,720
the best way you can get promoted
as if we look good. You know,

72
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,960
if the team does great, if you get
us the gear, we want the equipment,

73
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,250
we want the training that we need,

74
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,310
that's the best way you're going to look
awesome cause we're going to succeed

75
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,530
more and that's going to
make you look good. And I'm,

76
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:38,530
of course I'm going to be more tactful
than, I'm not saying it like that,

77
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,880
but I'm saying it right.
Right.

78
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,670
Get get those word and getting
them to get the messaging is there.

79
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,160
You want me to be saying
things like, hey, you know,

80
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:49,310
our boss doesn't like our boss doesn't
like leaders that complain. Right.

81
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,820
[inaudible] you can tell the boss
he doesn't like complainer's.

82
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,770
You know what I mean? Little things
like that, right? Yeah. Hey, the boss,

83
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,300
the boss likes to hear the truth
about stuff he wants to know.

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,040
You know what I mean? Little
things like that and you know,

85
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,090
here's the thing, that person, that
person might get the promotion.

86
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,940
Okay.

87
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,210
Because what you've done is you've
helped them act correctly actually,

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,360
and there's a chance,
a decent chance,

89
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,600
a good chance even that they carry
that forward. They realize that, hey,

90
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,820
the best way to play the
game is to help the team.

91
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,180
And the best way to look good is to help.

92
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,620
That is to make the team good
and succeed at the mission.

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,593
Hmm.

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,440
And it's really one of the classic cases.

95
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,560
Then we'll know we'll get
into ownership a little bit,

96
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,290
but if something goes wrong,
right,

97
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,480
the person that's looking out for
themselves blames everyone else.

98
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,420
And so that's a challenge, right?
Because once you start blaming,

99
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,960
once that ball starts blaming everyone,

100
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:51,640
then the whole team starts blaming each
other. So how do you fix that? Well, it's,

101
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:54,700
we've talked about this a million
times. You, you step up and say, hey,

102
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,770
you don't bosses my fault and lost
cause that's right. It's your fault.

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,553
And there's a,

104
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,370
there's a good chance that they
recognize how positive that is.

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,020
And it may take a while and it may never
happen because some people are just

106
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,670
savages, right? Some people are just
complete. They only care about themselves.

107
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,590
They only care about the next promotion
and getting the next award and getting

108
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:26,120
the next bit of recognition.
There's people like that,
there's, they're horrible,

109
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,190
they're horrible, they exist. But
they're pretty small. Most people,

110
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,370
if they see, hey this, this
is working for this guy,

111
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,820
it can work for me too.
And that starts to spread.

112
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,850
And the other thing that happens
I think is if someone's obese,

113
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,370
just a flagrant self promoter,

114
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,490
that you might get them one promotion
because you were there to kind of make

115
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:54,400
them look good, but the next time
around they're going to get seen.

116
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,990
They're going to get found out,
they're gonna.

117
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,880
People are gonna realize what kind
of person they are and that's,

118
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,000
that's where it catches up with them.

119
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,160
So you keep playing the game,
you keep, you keep working hard,

120
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,580
don't worry about them and actually
do your best to help them out.

121
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,220
The person that's like self promoting,
do your best to help them out.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,550
They're the boss. Make them look good.
I always want to make my boss look good.

123
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,880
Yup. It's going to help you in the long
run. It hurts sometimes it's hard to do.

124
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:27,010
Sometimes our ego gets in the way.

125
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:30,250
Sometimes God put that ego in check
because what's more important?

126
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,330
Because if you're my boss Echo and you're
doing this just to make yourself look

127
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:38,200
good,
if I then undermine you will.

128
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,390
And now we don't accomplish
the mission as well.

129
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,840
I'm actually a bad person because I didn't
do my best to accomplish the mission.

130
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,470
Right. We didn't look good. Yeah.
I'm not worried about how we look,

131
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:48,630
but we failed in our mission.
Well,

132
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,890
we didn't do our mission to
the best of our ability. So No,

133
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,860
I'm not going to let that happen.
You want to look great. Cool.

134
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,830
I want to make you look great because I
want us to look great doing our mission

135
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:58,180
because that's what's important to me.

136
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,570
And if so some of the collateral damage
of that is that you look great even

137
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,710
though you're a jerk
and I get you promoted,

138
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,680
that's okay because eventually you're
going to get found out or you're going to

139
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:13,270
learn to be a better person and to
support the team and that's how you got

140
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,220
promoted and you're gonna realize
that and you'll become a good leader.

141
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,510
Yeah. Yeah, I agree with that one.

142
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,500
Like I always have where people
can see that too. You know,

143
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:30,501
they can see like if your boss is like
a self promoter or whatever and you have

144
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:32,940
it in your head.
I understand.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,210
I understand this cause I did it in
a situation where I'm like, shoot,

146
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,530
I kind of feel inside,

147
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:41,070
like I don't want to like go
make an effort to make them
look good kind of thing.

148
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:45,380
Cause it's like he doesn't deserve
it and a thing and what? Like what?

149
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:47,790
I'm going to make them look good and now
everyone's going to think that he looks

150
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,430
good kind of thing. But then when you
really think about it another not,

151
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
they see that. Yeah, you're right.

152
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,900
And the goes though for you. Like
if you, if you're like to, you know,

153
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,650
if you're just focusing on
the positive stuff, you know,

154
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,010
you know how like what do they say if
you don't have anything nice to say,

155
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,880
don't say it at all. If you're really
doing that, like people notice that too.

156
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,840
They'll be like, man that
guy is like really positive
focusing on this, you know,

157
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:16,410
kind of thing. Like people see it and
this doesn't mean you're just Mr Positive,

158
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,860
sugarcoating everything. And I don't know,
it's not, we're to talking about that,

159
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,350
but you are not focusing on the negative.
Instead of saying,

160
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,480
oh, we're horrible at this.
You say, you know what,

161
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:31,080
we've got some deficiencies here. Here's
what I'm gonna do to fix them. Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,170
How simple is that? Better? Yeah, no,
the point is people they see, they see,

163
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,560
don't think that, you know, like
you're going to help, you know,

164
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,190
make this guy look good
in there and just get it.

165
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,100
They're going to not see it and then
they're just going to fall further.

166
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,850
He is trick or something bad. They see
that most of the time. Most of the time.

167
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,000
That example that you said about, um,
uh, playing to their ego or whatever,

168
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,510
where you're like, hey, you should,

169
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,310
you're going to look really good if
you've ever seen the movie Milana,

170
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,620
I saw three minutes on it. Oh, see,
there you go. She does a, so the guy,

171
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:08,040
the main guy name the demigod who's
name is Molly and played by the Rock,

172
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,000
by the way, 20 Johnson.
Great movie by the way. Um,

173
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,230
she does him like that. She's like, Hey,
let's, they got to go do this mission,

174
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,320
you know, for restore the heart, you
know, whenever it's a long story, but,

175
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,980
and he's like, you know, whatever
reluctant. And he's like, she's like, hey,

176
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:27,690
you'll be a hero again. And he's like,
I'm already a hero. She's like, well,

177
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,990
no, not for a while. You know,
you haven't done anything lately,

178
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,010
but if you do this and you'll be
the hero to everyone. And Yeah. Any,

179
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,080
and of course he does it of course. But
yeah, man, it's good example. It works.

180
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,940
There it is. Proof on, on Maulana.
