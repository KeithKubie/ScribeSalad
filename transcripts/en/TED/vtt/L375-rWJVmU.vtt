00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.680
So, I don't like to boast,

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.256
but I am very good at finding things
to be annoyed about.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.376
It is a real specialty of mine.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.296
I can hear 100 compliments
and a single insult,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.816
and what do I remember?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.216
The insult.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.936
And according to
the research, I'm not alone.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.496
Unfortunately, the human brain
is wired to focus on the negative.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.856
Now, this might have been helpful
when we were cave people,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.736
trying to avoid predators,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.456
but now it's a terrible way
to go through life.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.936
It is a real major component
of anxiety and depression.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.016
So how can we fight
the brain's negative bias?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.360
According to a lot of research,
one of the best weapons is gratitude.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.096
So knowing this, I started a new tradition
in our house a couple of years ago.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.576
Before a meal with my wife and kids,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.440
I would say a prayer of thanksgiving.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.376
Prayer is not quite the right word.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.096
I'm agnostic, so instead of thanking God,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.456
I would thank some of the people
who helped make my food a reality.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.816
I'd say, "I'd like to thank the farmer
who grew these tomatoes,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.536
and the trucker who drove
these tomatoes to the store,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.416
and the cashier
who rang these tomatoes up."

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.040
And I thought it was going
pretty well, this tradition.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.576
Then one day, my 10-year-old son said,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.936
"You know, Dad, those people
aren't in our apartment.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.176
They can't hear you.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.256
If you really cared, you would go
and thank them in person."

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.456
And I thought, "Hmm.
That's an interesting idea."

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.776
(Laughter)

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.856
Now I'm a writer, and for my books
I like to go on adventures.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.296
Go on quests.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.376
So I decided I'm going to take
my son up on his challenge.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.096
It seemed simple enough.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.976
And to make it even simpler,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.496
I decided to focus on just one item.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.336
An item I can't live without:

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.000
my morning cup of coffee.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.056
Well, it turned out
to be not so simple at all.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.096
(Laughter)

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.735
This quest took me months.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.216
It took me around the world.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.696
Because I discovered
that my coffee would not be possible

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.776
without hundreds of people
I take for granted.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.696
So I would thank the trucker

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.416
who drove the coffee beans
to the coffee shop.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.736
But he couldn't have done his job
without the road.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.656
So I would thank the people
who paved the road.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.776
(Laughter)

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.816
And then I would thank the people
who made the asphalt for the pavement.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.896
And I came to realize that my coffee,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.976
like so much else in the world,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.496
requires the combined work

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.096
of a shocking number of people
from all walks of life.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.896
Architects, biologists,
designers, miners, goat herds,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.416
you name it.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.696
I decided to call my project

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.696
"Thanks a Thousand."

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.480
Because I ended up
thanking over a thousand people.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.976
And it was overwhelming,
but it was also wonderful.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.256
Because it allowed me to focus

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.616
on the hundreds of things
that go right every day,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.376
as opposed to the three
or four that go wrong.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.616
And it reminded me of the astounding
interconnectedness or our world.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.496
I learned dozens of lessons
during this project,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.416
but let me just focus on five today.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.336
The first is: look up.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.376
I started my trail of gratitude

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.696
by thanking the barista
at my local coffee shop,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.376
Joe Coffee in New York.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.096
Her name is Chung,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.856
and Chung is one of the most
upbeat people you will ever meet.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.216
Big smiler, enthusiastic hugger.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.736
But even for Chung,
being a barista is hard.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.656
And that's because you are encountering
people in a very dangerous state.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.936
(Laughter)

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.696
You know what it is -- precaffeination.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.856
(Laughter)

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.616
So, Chung has had people
yell at her until she cried,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.656
including a nine-year-old girl,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.936
who didn't like the whipped cream design
that Chung did on her hot chocolate.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.856
So I thanked Chung,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.055
and she thanked me for thanking her.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:35.336
I cut it off there.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.776
I didn't want to go
into an infinite thanking loop.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.376
(Laughter)

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.136
But Chung said that the hardest part

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.656
is when people don't even treat her
like a human being.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.536
They treat her like a vending machine.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.056
So, they'll hand her their credit card

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.896
without even looking up from their phone.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.736
And while she's saying this,
I'm realizing I've done that.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.616
I've been that a-hole.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.576
And at that moment, I pledged:

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.896
when dealing with people,
I'm going to take those two seconds

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.776
and look at them, make eye contact.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.656
Because it reminds you,
you're dealing with a human being

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.416
who has family and aspirations

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.016
and embarrassing high school memories.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.096
And that little moment of connection

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.816
is so important to both people's
humanity and happiness.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.616
Alright, second lesson was:

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.376
smell the roses. And the dirt.
And the fertilizer.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.136
After Chung, I thanked this man.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.016
This is Ed Kaufmann.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.576
And Ed is the one who chooses which coffee
they serve at my local coffee shop.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.256
He goes around the world,
to South America, to Africa,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.096
finding the best coffee beans.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.536
So I thanked Ed.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.336
And in return, Ed showed me
how to taste coffee like a pro.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.296
And it is quite a ritual.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.576
You take your spoon
and you dip it in the coffee

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.376
and then you take a big, loud slurp.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.336
Almost cartoonishly loud.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.656
This is because you want
to spray the coffee all over your mouth.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.816
You have taste buds
in the side of your cheeks,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.256
in the roof of your mouth,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.816
you've got to get them all.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.576
So Ed would do this

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.096
and he would --

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.816
his face would light up and he would say,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.816
"This coffee tastes of Honeycrisp apple

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.376
and notes of soil and maple syrup."

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.016
And I would take a sip and I'd say,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.776
"I'm picking up coffee.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.616
(Laughter)

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.496
It tastes to me like coffee."

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.536
(Laughter)

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.496
But inspired by Ed, I decided to really

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.656
let the coffee sit on my tongue
for five seconds --

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.896
we're all busy,
but I could spare five seconds,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.456
and really think about the texture
and the acidity and the sweetness.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.816
And I started to do it with other foods.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.496
And this idea of savoring
is so important to gratitude.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.856
Psychologists talk about how gratitude

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.216
is about taking a moment
and holding on to it as long as possible.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.896
And slowing down time.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.696
So that life doesn't go by
in one big blur, as it often does.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.176
Number three is:

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.176
find the hidden masterpieces
all around you.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.096
Now, one of my favorite
conversations during this year

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.576
was with the guy who invented
my coffee cup lid.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.256
And until this point,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.456
I had given approximately
zero thought to coffee cup lids.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.736
But I loved talking
to this inventor, Doug Fleming,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.616
because he was so passionate.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.616
And the blood and sweat and tears
he put into this lid,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.936
and that I had never even considered.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.816
He says a bad lid can ruin your coffee.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.776
That it can block the aroma,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.056
which is so important to the experience.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.616
So he -- he's very innovative.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.696
He's like the Elon Musk of coffee lids.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.736
(Laughter)

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.976
So he designed this lid
that's got an upside-down hexagon

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.976
so you can get your nose right in there
and get maximum aroma.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.656
And so I was delighted talking to him,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.296
and it made me realize there are
hundreds of masterpieces all around us

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.056
that we totally take for granted.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:29.536
Like the on-off switch on my desk lamp
has a little indentation for my thumb

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.336
that perfectly fits my thumb.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.576
And when something is done well,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.856
the process behind it
is largely invisible.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.096
But paying attention to it

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.336
can tap into that sense of wonder
and enrich our lives.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.336
Number four is: fake it till you feel it.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.296
By the end of the project,
I was just in a thanking frenzy.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.496
So I was -- I would get up
and spend a couple hours,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.376
I'd write emails, send notes,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.936
make phone calls, visit people

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.136
to thank them for their role in my coffee.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.416
And some of them, quite honestly --

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.296
not that into it.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.576
They would be like, "What is this?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.760
Is this a pyramid scheme,
what do you want, what are you selling?"

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.816
But most people were surprisingly moved.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.616
I remember, I called the woman
who does the pest control

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.816
for the warehouse
where my coffee is served --

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.416
I'm sorry -- where my coffee is stored.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.896
And I said,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.416
"This may sound strange,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.816
but I want to thank you
for keeping the bugs out of my coffee."

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.456
And she said, "Well,
that does sound strange,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.576
but you just made my day."

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.176
And it was like an anti-crank phone call.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.576
And it didn't just affect her,
it affected me.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.576
Because I would wake up every morning
in my default mood, which is grumpiness,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.856
but I would force myself
to write a thank-you note

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.976
and then another and then another.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.816
And what I found was
that if you act as if you're grateful,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.856
you eventually become grateful for real.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.776
The power of our actions
to change our mind is astounding.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.856
So, often we think
that thought changes behavior,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.080
but behavior very often
changes our thought.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.176
And finally, the last lesson
I want to tell you about is:

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.616
practice six degrees of gratitude.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.216
And every place, every stop
on this gratitude trail

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.136
would give birth to 100 other people
that I could thank.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.416
So I went down to Colombia to thank
the farmers who grow my coffee beans.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.656
And it was in a small mountain town,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.856
and I was driven there
along these curvy, cliffside roads.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.616
And every time
we went around a hairpin turn

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.296
the driver would do the sign of the cross.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.176
And I was like, "Thank you for that.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.016
(Laughter)

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.856
But can you do that
while keeping your hands on the wheel?

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.456
Because I am terrified."

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.696
But we made it.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.216
And I met the farmers,
the Guarnizo brothers.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.496
It's a small farm, they make great coffee,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.416
they're paid above
fair-trade prices for it.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.456
And they showed me
how the coffee is grown.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.056
The bean is actually inside
this fruit called the coffee cherry.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.256
And I thanked them.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.496
And they said,
"Well, we couldn't do our job

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.736
without 100 other people."

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.616
The machine that depulps the fruit
is made in Brazil,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.696
and the pickup truck
they drive around the farm,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.136
that is made from parts
from all over the world.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.256
In fact, the US exports steel to Colombia.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.256
So I went to Indiana,
and I thanked the steel makers.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.416
And it just drove home

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.016
that it doesn't take a village
to make a cup of coffee.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.176
It takes the world
to make a cup of coffee.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.296
And this global economy,
this globalization,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.136
it does have downsides.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.616
But I believe the long-term
upsides are far greater,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.216
that progress is real.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.656
We have made improvements
in the last 50 years,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.376
poverty worldwide has gone down.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.656
And that we should resist the temptation

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.696
to retreat into our silos.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.776
And we should resist this upsurge

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.336
in isolationism and jingoism.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.736
Which brings me to my final point.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.360
Which is my hope that we use gratitude
as a spark to action.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.096
Some people worry
that gratitude has a downside.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.936
That we'll be so grateful,
that we'll be complacent.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.616
We'll be so, "Oh, everything's
wonderful, I'm so grateful."

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.240
Well, it turns out, the opposite is true.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.416
The research shows

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.096
that the more grateful you are,
the more likely you are to help others.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.176
When you're in a bad state,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.776
you're often more focused
on your own needs.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.016
But gratitude makes you
want to pay it forward.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.456
And I experienced this personally.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.176
I mean, I'm not Mother Teresa,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.656
I'm still a selfish bastard
a huge amount of the time.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.656
But I'm better than I was
before this project.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.416
And that's because it made me aware

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.016
of the exploitation on the supply chain.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.976
It reminded me
that what I take for granted

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.776
is not available to millions
of people around the world.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.056
Like water.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.376
Coffee is 98.8 percent water.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.936
So I figured I should go and thank
the people at the New York reservoir,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.576
hundreds of them, who provide me water,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.696
and this miracle that I can
turn a lever and get safe water.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.296
And that millions of people
around the world don't have this luxury

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.296
and have to walk hours to get safe water.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.016
It inspired me to see what I could do
to help people get more access,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.096
and I did research
and found a wonderful group

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.776
called Dispensers for Safe Water.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.136
And I got involved.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.936
And I'm not expecting
the Nobel Prize committee

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.216
to knock down my door,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.536
but it's a baby step,
it's a little something.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.376
And it's all because of gratitude.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.936
And it's why I encourage
people, friends, family,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.936
to follow gratitude trails of their own.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.776
Because it's a
life-transforming experience.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.416
And it doesn't have to be coffee.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.656
It could be anything.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.216
It could be a pair of socks,
it could be a light bulb.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.816
And you don't have to go around the world,
you can just do a little gesture,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.976
like make eye contact or send a note
to the designer of a logo you love.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.976
It's more about a mindset.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.480
Being aware of the thousands of people
involved in every little thing we do.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.976
Remembering that
there's someone in a factory

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.216
who made the fabric for the chairs
you're sitting in right now.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.376
That someone went into a mine
and got the copper for this microphone

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.976
so that I could say my final thank you,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.856
which is to thank you.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.760
Thank you a thousand
for listening to my story.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.616
(Applause)

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.360
(Cheering)
