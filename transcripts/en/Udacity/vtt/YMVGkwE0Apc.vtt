00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.650
So, let's take a closer look at our input data.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.920
Remember that each mapper processes a portion of the input data.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.890
And, each one will be given a line at a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.750
time. The lines look like this. The mapper needs to take

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.650
that line, and extract the information it needs. Often, when

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.650
we're dealing with text, it's pretty free-form. So we'd use something

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.560
like a regular expression. But in this case, it's regular, it's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.680
tab limited. So we can split the line on tab and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.420
extract the values. In this example, they're date,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.800
time, store name, product type, cost, and method

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.440
of payment. Let's say you've been asked to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.030
find the total sales per store. How would you

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.440
choose an intermediate key and value? Could it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.970
be the time and the store name? Or the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.250
cost of the item and the store name? Or rather the store name as a key and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.840
the cost? Or the store name and the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.780
product type. Remember that our line looks like this.
