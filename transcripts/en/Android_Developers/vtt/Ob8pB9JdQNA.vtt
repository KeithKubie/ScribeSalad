JONATHAN BADEEN:
So first off, I'd

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.472
like to thank Google
for having us,

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.680
throwing this awesome event--

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.130
I got to do the London one last
year, and it was a lot of fun--

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.020
and for making a
platform allowing

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.460
us to do all of this great stuff
and make money, which I know we

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.560
all like.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.230
So anyway, I'm Jonathan Badeen.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.280
I'm cofounder and chief
strategy officer of Tinder.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.700
I am, I guess,
known a little bit

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.440
for making that
"swipe right" thing,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.960
so just trying to do better.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
It's not going to
happen probably.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.400
But today, Jeff and I would
like to share our success story

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.660
with going Gold, our latest
subscription offering, and how

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.940
we got to that.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.070
And I think to do that, you need
to see where we started from

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.620
and how we got to
that point and the way

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.610
we think about these things.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.069
So Tinder was launched in 2012.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.090
We were really trying to help
people meet people around them.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.220
You've got your phone now.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.710
Everybody's looking
down at it at that time.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.320
They're not really interacting
with the people around them.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.180
We wanted to change that.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.370
So we launched in 2012.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.640
Today we're now
in 196 countries,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.820
1.6 billion swipes per day.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.140
That results in about 26
million daily matches.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.740
That comes out to over 20
billion matches so far.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.160
And that comes to--

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.630
what really matters--

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.670
1.5 million dates a week.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.050
But to achieve all of that,
we had to craft an ecosystem.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.650
And we looked at the things
that existed prior to us.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.210
Most of these things came
from the desktop world.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.270
And we looked at what we
felt could be improved upon

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.950
in addition to just doing
a mobile-first platform.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.460
So we had quite a few goals for
the platform and the ecosystem.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.060
But a few of them
stick out specifically

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.180
for how they relate to
our monetization later on.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.650
So we really
focused on location.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.190
It turns out that location is
this pretty important thing

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.380
when you're trying to match two
people up to physically meet

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.784
in the real world.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:31.700
So we focused on that.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.440
A lot of the things
before us had

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.280
allowed the user to search for
whatever or put where they were

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.270
and all.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.390
But we made it require that
you use location services

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.107
from the app, the GPS.

00:02:43.107 --> 00:02:44.690
That was the only
way you could do it.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.523
So you could only see
the people around you.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.170
The next is that we had
noticed that a lot of people,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.120
especially women, were
getting tons of messages.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.870
And it created a lot of noise.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.327
So you had too many.

00:03:03.327 --> 00:03:04.910
You got all these
messages from people

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.430
you didn't want to
be interacting with.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.680
And then you couldn't
find the people

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.970
that you were interested in.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.180
So it was pretty overwhelming,
especially for women,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.420
to go through these
previous products.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.730
The next couple
are pretty crucial.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.380
We were trying to reduce
feelings of rejection

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.130
on the flip side.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.713
And this kind of goes actually
hand-in-hand with the filtering

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:32.580
of noisy messages.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.060
So you've now got
a system previously

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.060
where you're sending a whole
bunch of messages, hopefully

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.700
meaningful and lengthy
ones to try to stick out.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.310
But you had this outbox
or this sent messages

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.640
list that was basically
just your rejection list.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.220
So we really were
trying to solve that.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.950
And in addition to
solve that, we actually

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.790
did one thing that
solved both the noisiness

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.770
and the rejection.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.390
We added the double
opt-in, or what

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.560
we call the "double opt-in."

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.410
So only two people who
swipe right on each other

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.410
are allowed to
message each other.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.660
That kept you from
getting unwanted messages.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.660
And it kept others from
spending too much time

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.700
on a single user that
they weren't going

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.710
to get a response back from.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.210
To reduce the
feelings of rejection,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.810
we also did a
couple other things.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.950
We decided you can't go back.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.156
You can't dwell on a user.

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:36.030
Once you see them,
they're gone, because it's

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.571
kind of hard to feel rejected
by somebody you can't remember.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.170
Alcohol works, too.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.100
So we also wanted
it to be anonymous.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.420
You don't feel quite as rejected
if the other person doesn't

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.925
know that you're out there.

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:57.800
The worst thing is
putting yourself out there

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.630
and then hearing no.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.450
So nobody would know
whether you liked them

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.875
or not unless they
also like you.

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:10.910
And the last thing
we did was we tried

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.660
to create something
that's fun and simple.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.630
That comes through in the
lightweight, game-like

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.150
interactions, the swipe itself.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.560
And this gets us
to the point where

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.202
about two years after
launching, we're

00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:28.660
now trying to figure out how
are we going to make money off

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.072
of this thing.

00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:32.500
It's costing us a lot
of money to run this.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.890
And we started to think of
how we wanted to do that.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.230
And we decided that we
wanted to accomplish this

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.030
by adjusting the--

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.330
we needed to adjust some of
the rules of the game which

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:50.020
we felt we had learned from
from some unforeseen behaviors.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.210
But we also wanted
to perhaps let

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.710
people break our initial rules.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.220
So in 2015, we
launched Tinder Plus.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.290
We launched it with
three different features.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.990
And we did price
testing, which showed us

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.860
that we would start out
with a $9.99 price point.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.560
Those features
included Passport.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.170
Passport allowed you to break
the location rule so you

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.590
didn't have to go off the GPS.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.990
And you could virtually
travel anywhere in the world.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.650
Then we also had
Rewind, which allowed

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.780
you to go back, spend
a little bit more

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.470
time, maybe change your
mind on which way you

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.480
swiped for somebody.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.940
Now, the next feature
was paired with a change

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.990
to the overall game.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.270
We hadn't really expected
this when we created Tinder.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.681
Whether with your finger
or a piece of meat,

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.180
what you're really
doing is creating

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.555
a lot of noise,
one of the things

00:06:58.555 --> 00:07:01.190
that we were really
trying to get away from.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.480
You didn't have these
earnest matches.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.650
And so what we decided
to do was to limit

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.620
the number of right
swipes that you

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.120
could do per day to hopefully
make people think a little bit

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.740
more about their choices.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.170
But because we like money
and because we thought maybe

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.110
there are reasons for you to be
able to have a little bit more,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.780
we gave you unlimited
right swipes.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.950
And this concludes
the first feature

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.170
set that we had launched.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.650
But as time went on,
we added a few more

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.020
that included Super
Like and Boost.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.260
Super Like allowed you to
break the anonymity rule.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.620
It would allow you to express
interest in somebody, which

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.880
in turn actually I guess
maybe displays confidence

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.172
and makes it more likely
that that person is going

00:07:55.172 --> 00:07:57.380
to swipe right on you-- them
knowing that you already

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.060
liked them.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.790
And then we gave Boost.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.450
Everybody has to stand in line.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.430
That's only fair.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.490
But Boost allows you to
cut in line a little bit

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.880
for a temporary amount of time.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.870
We also added a slew
of other features.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.060
I won't really go into them.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.780
But what I think the
real point here is

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.300
we had a whole
bunch of features,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.792
and our price point
stayed the same.

00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:25.250
So we're giving you that much
more value than we originally

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.800
did with Tinder Plus.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.809
So now that you kind of know
how we got to all of this

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.419
and where we were at
this point and how

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.500
it ties into our ecosystem
to the point of before making

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.140
Gold, I think it's time for
Jeff to share with us how

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.350
he went about doing that.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.700
JEFF MORRIS: Sure.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.885
Thank you guys.

00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:50.760
Thanks to the Google
team, I had the pleasure

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.300
of traveling to Asia last year
with a whole bunch of you guys.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.220
So it's really nice
to be here again.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.090
So Jonathan just went through
how he created Tinder.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.680
And I'm going to show
you how I broke Tinder

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.170
because that's what I do.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.060
But I'm Jeff Morris.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.820
I'm the director of
product and revenue,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.520
responsible for
Tinder Gold, and also

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.010
built Boost and a
few other things.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.720
So this is the team I work with.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.867
It's about 18 people.

00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:20.450
I'm showing you this
slide just so you

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.290
know to build a
global business, you

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.620
don't need this massive team.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.034
So if you're sitting in
your office thinking,

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.450
that's great that
Tinder did that,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.370
but I probably can't
do that, you can.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:37.150
You just need the right
road map and set of ideas.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.260
So as mentioned, Jonathan
just showed you all the rules

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.364
that he created.

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:44.280
My job when I walk in
the office every morning

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.650
is to think of what
rules we can break

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.445
and what features we can
give some subset of customers

00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:52.320
but not everybody,
because it would literally

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.830
break the game of Tinder.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.455
So if you think of
Boost as an example,

00:09:55.455 --> 00:09:58.014
if everyone's Boosting
at the same time,

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.430
the whole world
would be Boosting.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.122
And the game would just break.

00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:03.330
And so I'm thinking of things
that we can give people

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
in limited cohorts
that will make

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.030
the game more efficient or fun.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.249
And the key thing here is if
you think that any rule that you

00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:15.790
build in your product-- so all
those rules that Jonathan just

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.367
showed you--

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:17.950
if you think those
are sacred, and you

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.930
walk into work every
day, and you're like,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.680
we can never do that, your
job is to challenge that.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.870
So go to work every day.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.360
Think of what's in your
game, your application

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:34.310
that you can unlock for a
certain subset of people.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.630
So if there's any two
things to take away today,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.210
it's these two.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.580
This is how I think
about monetization.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.880
It's access and exposure.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.000
And you can read all sorts
of books on game theory

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.560
and how you design games.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.526
But if you just have
those two things in mind,

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.150
you can probably go
to work and come up

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.316
with some pretty cool ideas.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.970
And this is a newspaper
article from the 1800s.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.600
I show you this because
you don't always

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.720
need to invent something new.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.990
What you can do is
make it a lot better.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.210
So this is an ad.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.740
A male paid $0.25 for
this, which is $4.50 now.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.860
He took out an ad saying he's
an honorable gentleman waiting

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.992
for the right woman.

00:11:21.992 --> 00:11:23.700
Tinder is obviously
a lot more efficient,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.890
but we're not always
inventing new things.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.180
And if you look at some
of the features we built,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.610
you can probably find
something historically

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.680
that did something similar.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.080
But our job is to
make them 10x better.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.140
And so speaking of history,
this is what we built last year,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.330
2017.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.010
It's a feature called
Likes You, which

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.050
we package within Tinder Gold.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.206
And I'm going to show you
the crazy development.

00:11:51.206 --> 00:11:52.580
I've never showed
this, actually,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.621
so we'll see how it goes.

00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:57.150
I'll show you the development
process that went into this.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.140
We made some really
bad decisions

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.140
and some good decisions.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.220
But ultimately, really
happy where we landed.

00:12:06.095 --> 00:12:07.970
And feel free to make
noise if you think this

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.650
is a good idea or bad idea.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.470
But this was the first
version of Likes You,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.640
which was the main feature.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.350
So I broke one of Jonathan's
rules, which was I

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.740
want to show you who likes
you before you swipe.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.850
We kept the double
opt-in, so you both need

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.820
to like each other to message.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.350
But I really thought
that the game

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.580
could be more efficient if
I just knew who liked me.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.530
And so ignore these
prices, by the way.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.320
This is a designer who
clearly doesn't know how

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.070
to price things.

00:12:41.016 --> 00:12:46.190
Our average price was
anywhere from $9.99 to $19.99.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.870
We had this very
dense feature set.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.960
So you saw that list of
items, probably 10 features,

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.740
that we had already
packaged within Tinder Plus.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.670
And the debate we had
on the product team

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.010
was we're unlocking
what's probably

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.220
the most valuable thing we could
ever give away on Tinder, which

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.852
is showing you who likes you.

00:13:02.852 --> 00:13:04.310
And now we're just
going to give it

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.130
to everyone within Tinder Plus.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.596
That didn't seem
like a good idea.

00:13:08.596 --> 00:13:10.220
And so we went back
and forth, and this

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.230
was the original design.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.200
Again, we were going to
package it within Tinder Plus.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.530
And so one day, one
of us came to work.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.039
Actually, we were
text messaging.

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:21.830
And we said, what if
we just allowed people

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.630
to have multiple subscriptions?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.760
You can literally
have two different--

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.860
you could have Tinder Plus and
Tinder Gold at the same time,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.000
which we had seen games do.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.449
And it seemed like
a really cool idea.

00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:35.990
And then I met with our finance
team and our accounting team,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.760
and they thought it
was a terrible idea.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.259
And then we just talked more
about the customer journey

00:13:41.259 --> 00:13:43.550
and what it might feel like
to have two different tiers

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.340
at the same time.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.910
That would get pretty confusing.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.350
We have seen games do this.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.690
And it's kind of
a cool model which

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.950
I could see becoming a thing
one day, but not quite yet.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.740
And then V3, where
we landed on, which

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.100
I'm really happy we discovered,
is a simpler version.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.230
So it was a Tinder Plus upgrade.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.390
Now we created Tinder Gold.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.810
One key thing is we spent a
lot of time on the branding.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.260
So we didn't just want to
call this Tinder Plus Plus.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.290
We thought about what's
actually cool, fun,

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.180
what's going to get
people's attention.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.190
So one of the things
which we didn't show here

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.460
is when you tilt the phone,
the gold tilts with you.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.580
And it has this shiny
animation effect.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.142
All of our paywalls have crazy
animations and fun things,

00:14:30.142 --> 00:14:31.850
probably inspired by
people like Jonathan

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.020
who are product
perfectionists slash nerds.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.470
Sorry, Jonathan.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.200
We spend a lot of time
making our paywalls better,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.700
which seems crazy.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.787
But we geek out on that stuff as
much as we do the core product.

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:49.370
But basically, what
you're seeing here

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.780
is this is the upgrade flow.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.880
So as you see here, you can
upgrade for $9.99 a month.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.200
So at $19.99, you're basically
paying $29.99 a month.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.552
If you're on the $9.99
tier, you're paying $14.99.

00:15:04.552 --> 00:15:06.260
We still felt like
that was probably low,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.010
but we thought $9.99 felt
like a good place to start.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.050
And one of our concerns was--

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.404
I'm sure you're
sitting here saying,

00:15:15.404 --> 00:15:17.070
you read articles
about different people

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.090
raising their prices.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:23.295
And customers revolt. And
we definitely had that fear.

00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:25.360
Would customers
think this is fair?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.600
I'm paying for Tinder Plus.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.730
Now I have to upgrade?

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.230
Would they think
it's too expensive?

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.150
Would they find enough
value in one feature

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.010
to justify an upgrade?

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.690
And we definitely were worried
about all these questions.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.710
Ultimately, we solved
everything through testing.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:46.260
So our older cohorts
showed us that they

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.610
were willing to upgrade.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.670
And we proved that through
very limited tests.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.600
But if you're scared
about customers revolting,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.060
definitely a great concern.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.790
But I would challenge
you to run tests

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.620
to see if that's the truth.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:07.540
Also, as was mentioned, we
have a shorter life cycle.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.360
So we have cohorts
coming in and out.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.820
So hopefully there
aren't people who

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.720
have been on Tinder for five
years who are sitting at home

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.680
really upset about this, because
we have new customers coming

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.280
in every day and people leaving
because hopefully they found

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.720
somebody that they really like.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.020
I'll just show you a breakdown.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.267
This isn't anything that
appears in the application.

00:16:31.267 --> 00:16:32.850
But if you really
look at what we did,

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.830
we created a new tier
off of one feature.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.570
So if you have one thing you're
thinking about unlocking,

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.410
you can possibly create a new
tier just off one feature.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.410
This would be a very
boring thing to see in-app.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.210
It kind of looks like a
[? SaaS ?] billing page.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.230
The key thing to see here
is we have this rich feature

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.900
set, which is Tinder Plus.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.490
And we just tweaked it a little
bit and created Tinder Gold.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.050
One of the challenges
we've run into

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:08.240
and we're still figuring out is,
how do you sell multiple tiers?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.550
And so we had this
baby we created.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.260
It's Tinder Plus.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.270
Business is going really well.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.440
Stock price is doing well.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.129
The company is really
comfortable and happy.

00:17:18.129 --> 00:17:19.920
And now we're going to
release Tinder Gold.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.829
So how do we sell
two things at once

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:25.490
within this small real estate
that's your mobile phone?

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.640
Ultimately, we were very
conservative, actually.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.980
So we probably have
dozens of entry points

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.720
to paywalls within our app.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.220
But we really only
sold Tinder Gold

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.880
from two places, one being your
match list, which we had never

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.350
monetized before.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.600
So if you tap on
that, that 10 says

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.800
this person has 10-plus
people who like them.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.300
Or you can go to
your Settings page.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.190
And we started to
emphasize Tinder Gold

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.110
more than Tinder Plus.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.780
Again, people who
worked on Tinder Plus--

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.315
it's kind of like
telling them their baby

00:17:56.315 --> 00:17:59.670
is no longer the focus
of our attention.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.946
We're not moving on, but we're
willing to try something new

00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:04.070
and focus on something new.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.920
And that was definitely
a concern internally.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.130
But again, we tested.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.350
Also, certain cohorts
we emphasize Tinder Gold

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.380
to more than others.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.370
So if there are
price-sensitive customers,

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:20.610
maybe you do want to get them
hooked on the intro package.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.350
Again, you'll have
to test this a lot.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:27.660
But merchandising definitely
becomes a challenge.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.237
So we're about a year
into Tinder Gold.

00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:32.070
We're just starting.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:37.290
So if you think of the game pad
on Tinder, things like rewind,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.024
things like running
out of likes,

00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:41.190
we weren't even letting you
subscribe to Tinder Gold

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.930
until about a week ago
from those paywalls.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.410
And the big concern there
is, what if conversion

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.840
flops from your main paywalls?

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.850
And then you're
suddenly in a world

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:58.680
where you're trying to revert
back to your old model.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.900
We also considered
a tabbed version.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.452
Again, like that [? SaaS ?]
page that I showed you,

00:19:04.452 --> 00:19:05.910
we don't want our
paywalls to start

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.650
feeling like there are so
many different choices that I

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.930
have to make.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.060
So right now we have a
single entry point option,

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:17.460
which is you can only buy Tinder
Gold from our core paywalls.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.830
One cool thing that we saw--
and I think for any revenue

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.330
feature you build, you want to
build complementary features.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.370
So rather than having things
that cannibalize other paid

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.350
features, we made Boost
more valuable as an example.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.000
So here's a user who's sitting
in their likes lists boosting.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.480
And they're collecting
more likes in real time--

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.180
so a very powerful
way to augment what

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.074
was already a great
feature with Boost.

00:19:42.074 --> 00:19:43.740
So just as you're
building new features,

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.156
just think about how they'll
interact with your other paid

00:19:46.156 --> 00:19:47.370
features.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.250
And if you're designing a game
or anything that's social,

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.860
hopefully they'll make
that feature better.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.080
Here's the results.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.480
So proud to say we were number
one in Google Play last year.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.020
I'm not sure where we
finished-- this is January.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.490
We finished the
year in number two

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.610
behind Netflix for
non-gaming apps.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.140
There were many
ways we got here,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.230
but the Tinder
Gold tweak was what

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.050
really pushed us over the top.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.750
We nearly doubled
subscribers, more than doubled

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.530
our revenue, 3.1
million average subs,

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.530
which was an
increase of 544,000.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.160
And then again,
second-highest grossing app.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.889
This is kind of the hockey
stick that we like to see.

00:20:35.889 --> 00:20:38.180
Again, I'm not going to give
Tinder Gold all the credit

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.600
in the world because other
people from Match Group

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.340
might be here and might beat
me up in the alley afterwards.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:50.810
But again, we saw this great
result in the public markets.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.660
Our stock price
more than doubled.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.630
And again, there were
many ways we got here,

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:01.480
but we were happy this happened.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.280
One other result--
we're always searching

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.500
for features at Tinder that will
appeal to women subscribers.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.520
The honest truth is
in the dating space,

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.760
men are far more likely to
pay for features than women.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.160
It's just how our
vertical happens to work.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.171
This was actually
a tweet yesterday.

00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:25.420
It said "a few people convinced
me to try Tinder Gold,

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.711
and honestly, the quality of
my conversations and dates

00:21:27.711 --> 00:21:29.170
went up a lot."

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.980
We did see an increase
for female subs of 7.4%

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.200
when we released
Tinder Gold, which

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.450
we're really excited about.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.350
"GQ" said it's more
lady-friendly, which

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.060
is good news for everyone.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.275
I'm not sure what's
going on here,

00:21:46.275 --> 00:21:47.890
but we were happy
about this article.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.500
So if I want to leave
you with any rule,

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.680
it's go back to your
office after today.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.570
Go to people like
Jonathan and say that you

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.220
want to break your own rules.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.270
That's how you monetize.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.240
And go forth.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.290
[APPLAUSE]
