00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.660
The graph of the line
2y plus 3x equals

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.560
7 is given right over here.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.109
Determine its x-intercept.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.770
The x-intercept is the x
value when y is equal to 0,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.640
or it's the x value
where our graph actually

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.550
intersects the x-axis.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.740
Notice right over here
our y value is exactly 0.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.170
We're sitting on the x-axis.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.820
So let's think about what
this x value must be.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.520
Well, just trying to
eyeball a little bit,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.870
it's a little over 2.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.765
It's between 2 and 3.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.450
It looks like it's
less than 2 and 1/2.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.910
But we don't know
the exact value.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.590
So let's go turn to the equation
to figure out the exact value.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.020
We essentially
have to figure out

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.890
what x value, when
y is equal to 0,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830
will have this equation be true.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.300
So we could just say 2 times
0 plus 3x is equal to 7.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.950
Well, 2 times 0 is
just going to be 0,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.170
so we have 3x is equal to 7.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.080
Then we can divide both
sides by 3 to solve for x,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.670
and we get x is equal to 7/3.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.860
Does that look like 7/3?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.790
Well, we just have
to remind ourselves

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.190
that 7/3 is the same
thing as 6/3 plus 1/3.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.640
And 6/3 is 2.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.232
So this is the same
thing as 2 and 1/3.

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:20.940
Another way you could
think about it is 3

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.680
goes into 7 two times, and
then you have a remainder of 1.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.600
So you've still got
to divide that 1 by 3.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.490
It's 2 full times
and then a 1/3,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.720
so this looks like 2 and 1/3.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.140
And so that's its
x-intercept, 7/3.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.700
If I was doing this on the
exercise on Khan Academy,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.330
it's always a little easier to
type in the improper fraction,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.991
so I would put in 7/3.
