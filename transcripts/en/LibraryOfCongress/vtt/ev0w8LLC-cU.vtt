00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:22.650
[ Silence ]

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.810
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good
afternoon, everyone,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.200
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.720
I'm John Cole, I'm the director
of the Center for the Book

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.810
in the Library of Congress, which
is the arm that promotes books

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.910
and reading around the country

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.220
through affiliated state
centers for the book.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.800
And we also do programming here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.730
We are deeply involved in
the National Book Festival.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.220
And I hope some of you have
visited the National Book Festival

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.520
in the past.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.170
This year, we are still in the
Washington Convention Center,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.000
but we've managed to snag a
late Saturday in September.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.960
This year, it's going to be not

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.600
on Labor Day Saturday,
but September 24th.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.560
However, I have to
say, with the crowds

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.900
on Labor Day Saturday's
turned out to be pretty good

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.960
in the Convention Center.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.180
The Books and Beyond Program that
you're joining us for today is part

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.000
of the center's programming
here at the Library.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.380
We feature new books that
have some relationship

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.390
to the Library of Congress.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.460
Often, it is a -- excuse me --
it is the use of the collections.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.580
Often, it is a project
that has been developed

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.830
by the Library of Congress.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.590
And sometimes it's kind of a
special occasion to talk to people

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.060
that otherwise would not
have come to the Library

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.200
to see them and have meetings.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.870
So it's really worked out
to be a wonderful program.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.680
All of these programs are filmed.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.090
And with -- on the website
later, you'll be able

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.460
to see the talk from today.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.530
We have around 350 of these
talks available on the website,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.440
and they all started in 1996.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.600
So actually, along with the talks
from the National Book Festival,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.810
which are also available on
the website, we have captured

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.650
since 1996, and since the
book festival started in 2001,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.270
a fair sampling of speakers and
books that relate to all aspects

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.350
of not only the collections
of the Library of Congress,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.850
but events both current
and historical.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.550 position:56%
And I do love to point out, finally,
that we tried to have books,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.300
as I said earlier, that have
a relationship to libraries,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.490
and especially the
Library of Congress.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.610
And that is the case today.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.630
To introduce our speaker, however,
we have the chief of the Library

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.750
of Congress's manuscript division.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.690
James Hutson, Jim Hutson received
a PhD in history from Yale in 1964.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.970
He has worked in the Yale History
Department and also William

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.810
and Mary, prior to
-- and after he --

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.690
well actually some of Jim's
work related to the topic

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.040
of today's talk occurred after he
came to the Library of Congress.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.160
And I discovered that in
addition to several books,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.480
Jim also is the author of a
couple of articles that relate

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.430
to the Federal Constitutional
Convention in 1787.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.630
And so he is an especially
appropriate

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.230
and knowledgeable introducer
of today's speaker.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.680
And let's give Jim Hutson a hand.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.110
Jim.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.040
[ Background Sounds ]

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.340
Thanks a lot.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.580
I -- we were a little bit
worried about an audience today,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.900
because Professor Bilder
was here a few weeks ago

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.420
at the great tumultuous day in
which the metro was shut down.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.930
So I assume perhaps some of
you couldn't make it that day.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.830
And you'll be here, and we'll have
a real treat listening to her.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.130
There was an old joke
about law office history,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.070
that it's completely unreliable.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.370
And there are also jokes

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.580
about lawyers being
unable to write history.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.120
She's an exception, certainly.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.290
Professor Bilder is the founders
professor of law at Boston College.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.040
And she has a law degree from
Harvard, but also a PhD in history,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.490
or history of American civilization
-- in history from Harvard.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.510
And this gives her a rare
combination of skills,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.380
which she has put to
very good account.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.660
This is your second
book, right; yes.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.480
And this is [inaudible] prize
this year, Madison's hand revising

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.880
of the Constitution Convention.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.970
It was published by the Harvard
-- Constitutional Convention,

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.030
published by the Harvard
University Press.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.590 position:56%
She's going to talk today, she tells
me, more about the technological --

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.220
or the processes of
studying Madison's notes,

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.140
which we have here, his draft.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:34.300
It's one of the Library's top
treasures, not often seen.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.900
And it's down in the Conservation.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.670
In other words, you can't -- if you
walk into the Manuscript Division

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.500
and want to see it, you
won't be able to do that.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.680
It is now -- however, there's a
pretty good digital copy of it,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.450
since we have it online, so that
if your interests are stimulated

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.060
by her talk, you can
find the notes online.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:13.350
She's kind of joined an old fray
about the authenticity or integrity

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.910
of the notes, which began
a long time ago I think

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.650
with when Hamilton's
children accused Madison more

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.870
or less revising the notes to fit
his current political beliefs.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.010
And that debate has
gone on for a long time.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.300
And but I think she's not
going talk so much about that

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.420
as about her research, really,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.890
as to how she acquired the
information to write the book.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.500
Okay; Professor Bilder.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.300

&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Thank you very
much to John Cole, and Anne Boney

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.920
from the Center for the History
of the Book for inviting me,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.870
and to Jim Hutson for that
wonderful introduction.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.520
Jim's work was very
helpful in this project,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.260
and so it's particularly nice
to have him introduce me.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.560
Can everyone hear me?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.110
I never know if these -- I have
such a loud voice naturally

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.520
that I'm not sure always
when I speak.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.460
My book, "Madison's Hand: Revising
the Constitutional Convention",

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.800
is a biography of Madison's notes

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.190
on the Constitutional
Convention of 1787.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.970
And it's a story about how
Madison originally wrote,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.070
and then revised his notes as
he changed his understanding

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.700
of the Convention, the
Constitution, and his own role.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.150
It's a book that argues
that Madison wrote only part

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.480
of his iconic notes
in the summer of 1787.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.600
I argue he finished
them two years later

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.400
when Thomas Jefferson
returned from France.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.170
And he then continued to revise
them throughout his life.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:09.600
It's a book that argues Madison
even replaced some key speeches

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.130
to better accord with Jefferson's
new Republican politics.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.300
It's not the book I
set out to write.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.470
And so today, I will tell the story
behind the book, and the mysteries,

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.260
investigations, and questions.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.710
I began the book in 2008

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:34.410
and I unfortunately repressed how
difficult I found it to write.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.830
I recently reread some
emails I wrote to people

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.340
who serve as coaches and critics.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.680
"Am I going to be seen as a nut?

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.300
I can't figure out how
to arrange the material.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.620
I bump into puzzles at every turn.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.790
A snappy subtitle escapes me.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.130
I have no idea who will
possibly read this.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:04.830 position:56%
And my editor is forcing me to spend
the weekend shaving 7,000 words

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.700
out of the evidence section,
and she is completely right."

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.340
But one thing I have always
remembered is the extraordinary

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.620
assistance given to me by the
outstanding staff of the Library.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.600 position:56%
And one page of the acknowledgements
include the names of curators,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.930
librarians, and archivists,
both here and elsewhere

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.300
in the United States, who
made this book possible.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.540
And so I want to thank Julie
Miller, Elmery Anugent, Mary Houty,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.470
Barbara Baref, Mel Franck,
and Bonnie Coles [phonetic],

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.010
as well as the staff
of the Reading Room.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.880
And I hope that the professionals
in the audience realize

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.800
that their assistance
is indispensable

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.940
to projects such as this one.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:54.310 position:56%
But I confess that I had not planned
to meet so many wonderful people.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.330
In 2008, with two then
very young daughters --

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.130
and these are my daughters at the
Bancroft ceremony on the completion

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.200
of the book eight years after I
started, so they were quite little

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.750
at the beginning; I
decided to write a book

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.740
that would require no
research trips at all.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.040
That was the plan.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.730
I had written on Madison
as a law student,

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.730
and I noticed that no one had
written an interpretive account

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.980
of his famous notes of the
Constitutional Convention.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.500
His notes are the only set
of notes that cover every day

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.260
of the Convention,
beginning on May 14th,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.440
and ending on September 17th, 1787.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.020
Every history rely on the notes to
tell the story of the Convention.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:46.100
But no book interpreted his notes
as if it were a literary text.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.960 position:56%
So to do this, I needed to first
figure out what the notes had looked

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.060
like when Madison wrote
them in the summer of 1787.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:11:00.650
And answering that question took me
seven years, and in an abandonment

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.980 position:56%
of the original no research part of
the plan, and a growing appreciation

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.090
for the notes manuscript
as an artifact.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.850
So the book is a study of the
notes manuscript as a text,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.880
and also as a historical
object and artifact.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.760
And the goal became to meld the
story of the notes as a text

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.970
with that of the notes
as an artifact.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.610
American historians have viewed
the notes like many writings

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.530 position:56%
of the framing generation as a text,

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.510
a piece of writing
to be interpreted.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.810
And it is.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.260
But the notes manuscript's also an
artifact, that is a physical object

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.200
with a particular history
of composition.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.440
Now, an artifact's something
different than a relic.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.320
The papers of the framers were
actually originally collected

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.710
as relics.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.130
Letters were taken out of
the historical context,

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.480
and they were placed in
collections, for example,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.080
the signers of the Constitution.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.500
And this practice resulted
in many papers

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.230
of the framing generation
being saved,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.010
but often destroying
their providence.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.730
Now, the marble Madison statue
in this building's foyer looks

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.360
like it symbolizes
the relic approach.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.070
That's what we tend to think
of when we see marble statues.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.080
But it interestingly actually
emphasizes the artifact approach.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.210
Sculptor Walter Hancock
depicted Madison as he looked

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.830
in the early 1780s, just
before the Convention.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.780
And Madison holds a volume of
the encyclopedia [inaudible].

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.170
It appeared on Madison's list
for the Congressional Library;

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.880
and I think it was
volume number one.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.240
But the book itself is
an artifact with a story.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.310
Jefferson had sent the book
from France to Madison.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.290 position:56%
And as I discuss in my book, Madison
used it to study the problems

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.740
of ancient confederacies.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.710
So the statue tells us
that books are to be used,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.900
and Madison actually has his
finger holding a place in the book.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.400
Books and papers tell
stories as artifacts.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.990
And my book was only
possible because archivist

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.040
after archivist made
the crucial decision

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.360
that Madison's papers were
artifacts, not relics,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.420 position:56%
and that they could be investigated.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:17.430
Now, the notes are particularly
intriguing as a text and artifact.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.030
They've always been
known to be revised.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.090
Madison made a comment
to that effect

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.860
on the last page of the manuscript.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.080
In 1840, Henry Gilpin, the
editor of the print edition,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.820
noted that they'd been
revised by Mrs. Madison.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.020 position:56%
And the notes even contained signals
that they were used by others.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.520
Madison wrote in one section that
this section had not been copied

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.820
by Mr. Epps for Thomas Jefferson.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.180
And so the notes have
always been a text that hint

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.190
of their importance as an artifact.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:56.450
And you can see I use PowerPoint
the way people use picture books,

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.230
so you just have to kind of look
at the images while I'm talking,

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.230
because they kind of
show everything.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:07.050
The book implicitly considers
the classic historical question,

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.620
"How do we figure out how people
in the past saw their world?"

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.380
And the difficulty of seeing
the world from the view

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.890
of the framing generation appears
in cartoons about the founders.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.000
The cartoons hint at the
unreliability of the paper left

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.020
by the framing generation.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.190
My book focuses on how impossible
it is to escape the distance

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.860
between events and
contemporary recording of events,

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.340
and how important it is for
the historian to recognize

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.720
and consider that distance.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.990
In particular, the framers
had the opportunity --

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.480
or their widows and their
descendants had the opportunity,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.630
to curate and revise
their papers years later.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.030
Now, this is a particular
problem with Madison.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.710
He left the only seemingly set
of notes of the Convention.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.510 position:56%
He also outlived every other member.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.780
This was actually not surprising,
his mom died at age 97 in 1829,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.920
shortly before his
own death in 1836.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.910
And as the other framers died,
Madison kept track of their deaths,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:22.120 position:56%
and with the rest gone, he got the
final word what historian Drew McCoy

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.110 position:56%
nicely termed "Last of the Fathers".

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.120
So in 2008, I tried to find an
edition that showed Madison's notes

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.800
as they existed in
the summer of 1787.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.920
I actually thought this
would be relatively easy.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.260
But modern editions -- and those
are all images of modern editions,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.290 position:56%
regardless of what they said,
turned out largely to be the version

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.440
that had been published
by the government in 1840.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.540 position:56%
This edition, prepared by Gilpin,
was based on the transcript prepared

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.750
by James Madison, and
left at his death.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.220
And various editions included,
at best, selected revisions.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:10.040
And you can see the transcript up
there and then the Gilpin edition.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.310
Fortunately, the Department
of State,

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.560
where the manuscript was
housed in the 19th Century,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.930
had printed an extraordinary
version of the note,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.600
largely forgotten for
the last century.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.940
For this edition, begun in 1897
and printed in 1900, the Department

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:33.010
of State tried to show Madison's
notes with all of the revisions.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.490
In fact, a young staff member, John
Weisenhaagen [assumed spelling],

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.980
actually detached the slips
from the original manuscript

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.280
to prepare the edition.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.930
And he noted in red ink on news
slips inserted in the notes

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.820
where they'd been attached.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.520
Now, there are some small
errors in this transcript,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.030
but it remains the best edition
of Madison's notes as it appears.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.500
In 1914, the government
recommended against reprinting it,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.080
noting that there were
many sets still unsold.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.340
But you can -- and I actually
was able to acquire like four

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.310
for almost no money when
I started this project,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.100
you can now find it online.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.750
But the edition did not show
the pagination or layout.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:20.300 position:56%
And so for that, I originally used
the microphone that was done in 1964

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.200
of the notes, and that's now
digitized on the Library's website.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.800
But it quickly became apparent
that digital images were needed.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.180
So the manuscript's in
the Library in a vault.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.760
It's been disassembled, and is
now in archival storage boxes.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.330
The Library sent images of,

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.010
I think what was a
preservation copy apparently taken

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.780
with a Nikon camera, in 2003.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.070
And the images were
labeled "Top Treasure",

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.010
and you can see that on the label.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.310
[ Silence ]

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:59.650
The manuscript's 136 and a half
sheets of paper, folded in half,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.470
four pages of writing each sheet.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.460
That's over 500 pages.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.380
So it was actually a lot of images.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:14.040
But technology was moving so
fast that by 2008, the resolution

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.160
on these images was
less than desirable.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.860
Today, current phones shoot at
about five times the resolution

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.160
of the images.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.870
But digital photography,

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.070
even at that resolution,
made this book possible.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.140 position:56%
An extraordinary group of
curators, librarians, and archivists

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.690
across the United States took
or helped me take photographs

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.530
of Madison's manuscripts.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:40.050
And so as I began to
read the transcript now

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.140
with the digital images, I
realize there were mysteries

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.440
about the manuscript.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.800
And so let me mention just a few.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.790
There were visible revisions on the
first 98 sheets in the manuscript,

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:55.970
but not very many on the last
34 sheets after August 22nd.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.550
The revisions often were
in the official language

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.820
of the Convention Journal.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.640 position:56%
But on the last sheets, the official
language already had been integrated

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.940
into the text.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.480
Why? Slips only appeared attached

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.750
in the first two-thirds
of the manuscript.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.520
And similarly, for the first
two-thirds, Madison had written

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.360
"Mr. M", and then later
inserted "Addison".

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.070 position:56%
But in the last third, he originally
wrote his name out, "Madison".

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.810
There were blank pages in
strange places, like August 22nd.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.950
One page, September 8th, ended
abruptly partway down the page.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:40.770 position:56%
And material had been missing when
Jefferson had the manuscript copied.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.420
There were also mysteries
noted by earlier scholars.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.710
People had noticed odd
things over the years,

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.230
but they weren't sure
what the reason was.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.410
For example, when Jefferson
had a copy made in the 1790s,

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.960
three and a half weeks in
June and July were omitted.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.950
And Madison even went
so far as to note

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.700
in the margin they
had never been copied.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.170
And the early editor, Max
Ferrand, realized Madison made

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.070
over 50 insertions
from a set of notes

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.530
by Robert Yates, published in 1821.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.900
This was odd, because Madison
had openly criticize these notes,

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.370
particularly Yates' claim

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.560
that Madison had suggested
the states might have less

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.140
than full sovereignty.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.090
But Madison had nonetheless
used them,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.380
and had actually paraphrased
the insertions

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.380
as if disguising their
place of origin.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.850
So faced with these puzzles, I
decided to compare the manuscripts

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.690
that Madison and others created.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.000
And so let me explain
what sources exist.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.570
Madison was not the only
note-taker at the Convention.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.770
Notes exist from ten
other note-takers.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.070
Many may have problems
similar to those

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.850
that I describe in Madison's notes.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.380
And Madison criticized some of
these during his own lifetime.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.280
Historians have tended to
favor Madison's version.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.520
I try to be more agnostic.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.970
An official record of the
Convention was compiled

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.260
by its secretary, William Jackson.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.210
It included a journal and
a series of vote tallies.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.040
And the image shows you the
vote tally on the final day

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.370
when the Constitution was adopted.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.090
At the end of the Convention,

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.070
this official journal was
given to George Washington.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.340
And only in 1796 did he deposit it
publicly with the State Department,

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.910
and only in 1819 was
it finally published.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:33.850
And Madison actually then used
it to further revise his text.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.970
But Madison had a secret
copy of that journal.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.200
In the fall of 1789,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.540
Madison acquired the official
journal from George Washington.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.120
Washington's diary is
missing for the dates during

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.750
which Madison would have
borrowed the journal.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:56.120
And so we don't know how or why
Washington decided to lend it.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.910
Madison nonetheless made a copy.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.960
This is not my discovery.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.310
In 1930, Charles Keller and
George Pierson wrote a wonderful,

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.690
quite speculative at the time,
article about this journal copy,

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.660
which then was at Yale
where it still is.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.000
They argued that Madison had copied
the official journal in the fall

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.540
of 1789, and he had then
used it to revise the notes

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.280
by including official language
on slips and insertions.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.330
In 1937, Farand ignored the
implications of this discovery,

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.290
and chose to reprint
his 1911 edition.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:38.910
And so Keller and Pierson's
article was largely forgotten.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.340
Yale permitted me to take photos
-- there is no microfilm available,

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.480
and these photos were critical.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.060 position:56%
There turned out to be small
notations in Madison's journal copy,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.560
and the notes that suggested that
at one time, Madison had imagined

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.940
that the two manuscripts
would be read together.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.980
And it was also apparent
that the front page

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.590
of the journal copy wasn't actually
the first page Madison had copied.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:10.040
Instead, it seemed, he started
with Monday, August 20th, 1787;

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.750
and that's the image you
can see on the screen.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.410
That's not the front page of the
manuscript, but it's the page

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.560
that has the title as
if it's the first page.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.150
Why?

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.440
[ Silence ]

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.830
Thomas Jefferson was responsible
for two other copies of the notes.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.090
Jefferson had a young man
studying with him, John Epps,

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:37.100
make a partial copy of
Madison's notes in 1791 to 1793,

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.790
and also a very partial duplicate
press copy that you can see here;

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.220 position:56%
it's at the New York Public Library.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.920
But Jefferson's copy had
actually additional puzzles.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.150
Many pages were replaced.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.560
After Madison's death,
Judith Reeves,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.860
wife of Senator William
Cabell Rives,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.710
had helped turn the Jefferson copy
into another one for Dolley Madison

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.200
to use for foreign publication.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.320
And many pages were
altered to match the notes

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.260
as they stood at Madison's death.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.380
The untouched press copy, however,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.060
showed what the Jefferson copy had
looked like in its original state.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.060
But there were, again,
puzzles upon puzzles.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.690
Jefferson's copy reflected
an odd division in the notes

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.940 position:56%
between August 21st and August 22nd.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.580
Epps had never been given the
notes from mid-June to July.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.900 position:56%
Epps had even noticed that there was
a page missing from the manuscript.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.260
And the link the account that now
stands in Madison's manuscript

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.810
of the final days seemed too
long to fit on the three pages

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:48.780
that the press copy suggested had
originally been the only final days

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.830
of the notes.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:56.220
Now, we know that the transcript
looked like after Madison's death,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.450
because Madison left
a transcript copied

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.240 position:56%
by his brother-in-law John C. Payne,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.300
that was begun basically
after 1818-1819.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:11.370
So I began to try and create what
the notes looked like originally.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.780
Now, I tried originally to
do this high-tech computers,

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.660
and that was a total failure.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.530
And so I resorted to the
old-fashioned technique

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:24.850 position:56%
of using colored pencils; [laughter]
something to be said for that.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.530
I marked the material
copied literally

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.250
from Madison's journal copy;
that's his secret journal.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:36.750
I marked what existed when Epps
had copied it in the early 1790s.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.580
I marked what seemed to have
been revised afterwards.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.260
And what emerged, obviously
imperfectly,

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.000
was the notes from 1787.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.080
Two Madison comments intrigued me.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.480
First, in late August 1789, Madison
had written to Edmund Randolph

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:04.280
to make up his opening speech for
Madison; because Madison explained,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.780
"My notes do not do
justice to the substance."

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.630
Randolph refused.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:14.080
He wrote, "He would mingle
inadvertently what I have heard

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.140 position:56%
since without being able to separate
it from what occurred then."

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.660
And so Madison and Randolph
instead sent his original notes,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.430
and Madison inserted them.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:27.090
But why was Madison
comfortable having Randolph write

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.050
up his speech two years later?

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:35.220
And second, as an elderly man
in the 1830s, Madison reflected

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:41.080
that his writings during 1790s
might have been too often tinged

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.750
with the party's spirit
of the times.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:48.100
And by "party spirit", he didn't
mean party in the sense of fun

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.910
and games; although if you go see
"Hamilton", which I haven't seen,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.490
I think it suggests some of
the fun parts of the 1790s.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.380
At the same time, he wrote an
editorial note discussing the

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.960
controversial Pinckney Plan
that had been published

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.260
in the official journal.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.490
Madison had long thought that
the Pinckney Plan was not the

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.790
original one.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.780
And for years he'd actually
obsessively been trying

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.080
to prove that.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.170
And that's part of what you see
on the far right of the screen.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.020
But in the 1830s, Madison
became forgiving.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.640
He explained Pinckney might have
used a rough draft with revisions

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.810
that was confounded
with the original text.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.160
And the revisions might
have been confounded also

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.650
in the memory of the author.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.070
So was Madison talking
about himself also?

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.520
Might the notes not date entirely
from the summer of 1787; and if so,

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.050
how had Madison actually
composed them?

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:47.020 position:56%
These questions led me to reconsider
assumptions about the manuscript.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.690
People have used the notes as if
they were contemporaneous copy.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:55.640
But had Madison written every day
in the summer of 1787, and if so,

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.150
why did he always start
with a summary sentence?

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.350
Why did he refer to decisions
that didn't yet happen?

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:05.370
And why were Saturday speeches
always mysteriously the longest?

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.200
I recall that Madison wrote his
correspondence twice a week,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.800
and suddenly the pattern appeared.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.590
In the summer of 1787, twice a
week on Wednesdays and Sundays,

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.810
Madison probably wrote his
rough notes up into a fair copy.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.750
And if so, how did he
originally take his rough notes?

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.720
He was limited by available
technologies,

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.510
the quilt pen and steel eraser.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.380
He didn't know shorthand.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.450
And so he probably used
abbreviations, such as up here

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.890
in a few of his extant papers.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.200 position:56%
This would have meant that similar
words, like "judicial", "judiciary",

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.980
and "judge", would have been
hard to figure out afterwards.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.670
Writing from a rough copy explained
the strongest stylistic aspect

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.970
of the notes.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.320
Madison summarizes the point
of the speech at the outset.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.760
He created a first sentence that
always summarized the position

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.510
of the speaker or the proposal.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:59.090
And so consistent is the style
that you can read the notes

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:03.070
by reading the first
sentence of every speech.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.700
It explained why the longest
notes appeared on Saturday;

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.100
not because they were most
important, but because a Sunday

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.110
without any meetings gave Madison
time to decipher his rough notes.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.870
And so when we wrote about
events on Monday and Thursday,

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.000
he knew what the Convention
had gone to decide.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.710
These days were always
written with hindsight.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.130
So there was always distance,
even in the original notes

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.110
between what Madison
wrote and the Convention.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:31.510
From the very first day, he
was revising his understanding.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:35.390 position:56%
For myself, it is this
contemporaneous revising that summer

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:39.880
that is as important as
any of the other revisions.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.150
Now, a second assumption
needed to be revisited.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.830
Although referred to as
"notes", they'd been relied on as

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.320
if they had been taken by a
court reporter or a stenographer

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.490
for the Congressional record.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.460
But drawing on work on
British Parliamentary diaries,

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.160
I realize they belong to the
genre of legislative diaries.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.880 position:56%
Legislative proceedings were closed,
and what the public had a right

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.900
to was the final product,
the legislation

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.200
and the journal of motions.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.180
And indeed, the House of
Representatives opens its doors

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.050
in 1789, but the Senate
remains closed until 1795.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.970
So without published
accounts of the base,

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.360
legislators relied
on private diaries.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.910
Madison's earlier legislative
diaries are

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.690
in the Library of Congress.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.340
They're political diaries, and he's
interestingly also revived those.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.790
And someone could do a
great article on those.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:31.750
There's almost nothing written on
them, and also on the Maclay diary,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.800
which over time has begun to be
seen as surprisingly objective.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.710
The notes reflected Madison's
political ideas, his strategies,

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.140
the positions of allies
and of [inaudible].

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.110
The original Convention notes
therefore showed what he cared

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:50.010
about, and they omitted what
he did not find interesting.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.560
And so they were about
who he found interesting.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.020
In this sense, the
notes were a biography

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.120
of his view of the Convention.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.320
They recorded Madison's
convention, not "the" Convention.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.180
As I reconstructed the original
notes, I found a different Madison,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.180
a man who desperately wanted
proportional representation

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.780
in both Houses, and wanted to limit
the role in power of the states,

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.990
a man who was frustrated by
the small state's concern

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.740
about Virginia's political power,
a man who left Philadelphia,

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.640
disappointed at the
Convention's failure

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.050
to completely control the states.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.670
And I found a man who
initiated the dynamic that led

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.870
to the Three-Fifths Compromise.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:37.210
Madison repeatedly hinted at a
sectional divide between northern

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.740
and southern states over slavery,

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:44.140
and he even proposed a bicameral
Congress based on the division.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.160
Enslaved African-Americans,
of course, would not vote.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.500
And so Madison's plan would
have given voting power

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.420
to states that legalized slavery.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.190
Virginia, by this calculation,
benefited the most

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.820
as it held nearly 300,000
people enslaved,

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.040
nearly half the enslaved
population in the United States.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.790
And although after leaving the
Convention, Madison would come

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.630
to blame South Carolina
and Georgia for what seemed

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.250
as an inevitable compromise
over slavery,

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.430
Madison was equally at fault.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.470
His willingness to embrace slavery
reflected his personal compromise

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:22.910
over slavery.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.830
He believed it to be against the
principles of the revolution,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.480
but he could not imagine a
multiracial American nation.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.210
He freed no one at his death.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:37.480
And indeed, his will left the
profits from the sale of the notes

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.010
to the American Colonization
Society, a group dedicated

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.160
to sending freed African-Americans
to Africa.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:51.910
I found a man who was emotional and
aggravated because of his losses,

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:55.490
but after August 6th, began
to acquire a new role.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.330 position:56%
And the book argues that by copying
the August 6th draft into the notes,

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.660
Madison grasped the structure.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.880
So then, a need to reconsider a
final assumption became apparent.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.800
Who was the audience?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.440
Was it us?

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.660
Was it posterity?

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.330
Before the Convention, Madison
had shared his legislative diary

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.840
and Congress with Jefferson.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.610
And on July 18th, 1787, Madison
wrote Jefferson in Paris,

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.170
"As soon as I am at
liberty, I will endeavor

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.850
to make amends for my silence.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:30.580
I have taken lengthy notes, and
mean to go on with a drudgery

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.810
if no disposition obliges
me to discontinue it."

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:38.840 position:56%
I argue the notes were taken largely
as a political diary for Madison

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.550 position:56%
and Jefferson, and that they're part
of the histories told of Madison

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.010
and Jefferson as collaborators.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.570
[ Silence ]

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.790
With this, the boundary of the
original notes began to shift.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.130
Madison's integration of
large sections of text

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.660
from the journal copy
in the latter section

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.380
of the notes raised the possibility

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.740
that Madison had written
this section after 1789.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:06.760
Could the manuscript
offer additional evidence?

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.310
Watermarks have long been
a story of the Convention.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.010
Watermarks were used to prove

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.950
that the Charles Pinckney Plan was
not written in the summer of 1787.

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:20.730
And watermarks were used
to disprove a contention

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.850
by Professor William Crosskey
of the University of Chicago

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.750
that Madison wrote
sections in the 1820s.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.050
Now, it's important to realized

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.460
that watermarks are only
corroborating evidence.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.650
Nothing in the book
exclusively relies on them;

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.690
because their presence has
an almost infinite number

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.410
of alternative explanations.

00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:44.750
But here they reinforce
the textual evidence.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.530
Older technology made it difficult

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.810
to obtain enough images
to study differences.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:53.140
And so the Library generously
took photographs of watermarks.

00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.240
I classified them in the Library,

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.170
put the notes on a light
table for us to check.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.780
Madison was interestingly
consistent.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:08.210
Between May 1787 and August 21st,
the paper's almost entirely paper

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.960
with marks associated
with James Whatman.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.560 position:56%
And this paper matches precisely the
letters Madison wrote this summer.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.990
But it appears in the notes
after August 21st only

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:27.170
in the plan appended to the
manuscript written about Hamilton.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.460
Decidedly different
Whatman paper was used

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.330
for the section begging
with August 22nd.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:39.430
This paper does not match any
extant letter from the summer.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.660
Other evidence corroborates
the division.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:47.060
The holes used to sew the
August 22nd section differ,

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.030
the division matches the
division that was there

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:53.930
in the Jefferson copy,
it corresponds roughly

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.320
to where Madison began
his secret journal copy,

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.850
and it matches precisely the
shift from the later insertion

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.870
of journal language in the notes

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.830
to original integration
of that language.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:11.510
And this is the watermark -- two
of the crucial Whatman watermarks.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.140
[ Silence ]

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.720
The book therefore,
argues that the notes

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.960
after August 21st represent
an unconformity,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.120
a missing section of time.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.790
The evidence from the text
and artifact tell a new story

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.270
about Madison and the Convention.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.350
Madison became sick that week,

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.150
something that he was
susceptible to under stress.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.690 position:56%
And the delegates sent controversial
issues to the committee.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.910
And for the first time,
Madison served

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.510
on the three-most important
committees.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:43.100
He was too involved in drafting to
bother writing up his rough notes.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.010
And it may have been impossible
for him to disentangle decisions

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.670
and committees from those
on the Convention floors.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.490
So at the very moment that
the Convention decided many

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:55.600
of the issues we debate
today, congressional powers,

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.470
presidential powers,
impeachment, the electoral college,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.920
the notes are the most unreliable.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.370
But the collapse of
the notes represents

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:08.660
and reflects the contemporary
inability of the delegates

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.600
to see the final Constitution

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.470
in the sense we mistakenly
imagine they could.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:17.930
Between 1787 and 1789,
the Convention's relevance

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.330
and Madison's understanding
of it changed.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.390
He wrote the federalist essays.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:25.490
He made arguments in the
Virginia Ratification Convention.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:30.510
He understood the textual ambiguity
of the Constitution when we served

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.150
in the first Congress,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.420
and he proposed amendments
to the Constitution.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.260
Madison wanted the
amendments interwoven

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.830
with the original Constitution.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:45.310
But Roger Sherman insisted
that they be supplemental.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:48.560
Sherman spoke of a
sacred Constitution

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.670
to which the amendments should
be added, and Congress agreed.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:57.390
And so only with that decision
in 1789, did it become clear

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:00.120
that the text of the Constitution,

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.540
and the work of the Convention
would remain forever intact.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:09.330
And so now, suddenly, Madison's
notes had a new potentially

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:12.910
significant relevance.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.540
With Jefferson about to return,

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.210
Madison completes his
incomplete notes.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.060
He makes the copy of
the official journal.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.600
He uses it to make sense of
whatever rough notes he still had,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.270
far more than the original
sections of the notes.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.810
The post-August 21st notes
focused on textual changes

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.540 position:56%
to the Constitution and the reasons.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.630
Now, there were undoubtedly
other changes

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.990
that are impossible to
know with precision.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.430
How had Madison's perspective
changed over two years?

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:46.610
I speculate in the book about
whether he spoke the statements

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:50.430
against slavery on August 25th
that he attributes to himself.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:55.250
No one else ever recorded him
saying anything against slavery.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:59.920
And his words bear a marked
resemblance to those he recorded

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.330
of Luther Martin on August 21st.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.630
Was it coincidence?

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.740
Did he have remaining rough notes
containing his remarks, or in 1789,

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.350
1790, did he decide to ensure

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:17.820 position:56%
that the notes reflected what he
now understood surely must have been

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.120
his position?

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.250
The book suggests that in the years
immediately after the Convention,

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:29.090 position:56%
Madison also likely replaced several
sheets containing his speeches

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.960
as his perspective changed.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.660
In some respects, this
is not surprising.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:37.650
One cannot take notes
of one's self speaking.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:42.280
And so Madison's own speeches,
even those he wrote down in 1787,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.460
are the most contested
in terms of reliability.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.890
And he may therefore have been
the most comfortable altering them

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:55.530
as his understanding of what he
had been attempting to say changed.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.830
These sheets were identified

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.530
because the watermarks do not
match the surrounding pages,

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:02.660
and there was corroborating
textual evidence.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.240
Once that relates to June 6th
through 8th, and it fits the story

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.180 position:56%
about Madison's initial difficulties
in taking notes, and the chronology

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.080
around federalist [inaudible].

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.390
A second set relates to Jefferson.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:20.040
Jefferson returned from
Paris in the fall of 1789.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.860
The "Hamilton" musical has
that song, "What Did I Miss,"

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.750
which pretty much sums
up the whole thing.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.510
[Laughter] And he saw the
world through the lens

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.710 position:56%
of the French Revolution; supporters

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.340
of Republican government,
versus monarchists.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.820 position:56%
And he became obsessed with the idea

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:40.570 position:56%
that Alexander Hamilton was a secret
monarchist, in part based on reading

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.420
about Hamilton's June
speech in Madison's notes.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.640 position:56%
Four sheets in the manuscript appear
related to Jefferson's promotion

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.440
of Republican government.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.300
And one finds this phrase
more prevalent on these pages.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:59.260
A related replaced sheet relates to
a vote by the Virginia delegation

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:04.950
in favor of an executive
with life tenure,

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.500
the president on life tenure,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.960 position:56%
a position that after the Convention
looked suspiciously like a monarch,

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.860
and had become aligned
with Hamilton.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.160
The sheets containing
this first speech,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:23.270
and the final Virginia vote
match precisely the section

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.260
that Jefferson never
was able to copy.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.620
And so I suggest that
Madison was working

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.950
on replacing these
sheets in the 1790s.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.700
Now, I didn't have sufficient
evidence precisely date

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.210
and explain two other
sets of replaced sets.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.640
Madison was not happy with
something on September 7th or 8th.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.940
He replaced that sheet.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.400
He messed something
up in replacing it.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:50.350
Perhaps notices there's something
missing, Madison subsequently adds

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:54.580
that material in an awkward
way back into the manuscript.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.250
And similarly, I speculate
that the final two days

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.270
of the Convention might
have been written

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.770
at a slightly different time,

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.810 position:56%
and they may have replaced a
shorter original conclusion that was

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:08.600
in place when Jefferson's
copy was made.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.280
But I'm not at all certain of this.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.010 position:56%
History should be about
interpretation and reinterpretation.

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:18.890
And so I put the evidence
in a set of appendices,

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.040
the evidence that discusses the
manuscripts and includes a list

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.470
of the sheets and slips with
the watermark information

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.330
as I was able to develop it.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.930
And I'm sure my book will
not be the last word.

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:34.690
By 1796, the final sheets
were likely in place.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.230
And in December 1796,

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.900
Madison announced his
retirement from politics.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.920
And that same month, Jefferson
became vice president.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.040
Jefferson viewed the notes as
part of his political agenda,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.950
and he urged publication, arguing,

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:55.790
"The Constitution will then
receive a different explanation."

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.420
Jefferson believed publication

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.760
of the notes would undermine
the Adams administration.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.010
Madison demurred.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.870
He worried that Jefferson had
not read the entire notes;

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.230
and he might have been
right about that.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.990
And he worried that the notes
would not support Jefferson's

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:17.470
interpretation, and worse, that
other reports would perhaps be made

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.480
out in muster, and they
would not necessarily confirm

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.780
Madison's version.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.520
He worried, "What turn might
be giving the impression

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.380
on the public mind?"

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.910
Nothing in the notes would
damage Jefferson's reputation,

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:34.330
but for Madison, the expediency of
publication weighed differently.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:37.630
Madison's concerns triumphed;
the notes were never published.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:41.550 position:56%
And Jefferson moved onto a different
interpretation of the Constitution,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:46.320 position:56%
one in which was a compact among
the states, and perhaps with relief,

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.430
Madison put the notes away.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:54.220
After retiring from the presidency
in 1817, Madison continued

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.600
to revise the notes to increase the
appearance of comprehensiveness.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.250
He added revisions from
the official journal.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.920
He inserted missing sections
of speeches that he paraphrased

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.890
from Yates' notes, and then he

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:11.500
and his brother-in-law created a
transcript with selected letters

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.300
to explain the larger context.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.950
But though he repeatedly flirted
with publication, he refrained.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:23.550
I believe he continually
worried about other accounts.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:30.850
Not until 1827-1828 did the other
three significant note-takers,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.200
Rufus King of Massachusetts,
John Lansing of New York,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.670
and the Secretary William
Jackson die.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.490
Only in 1829 was Madison
the only living member left.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:47.940
And by that point, he settled
on postromous publication.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.430
Madison's will left the
notes to Dolley Madison.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:57.880
And Congress finally agreed
to buy the papers for $30,000.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.410
In 1840, Madison's
notes were published

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:02.780
in a three-volume collection
of his papers.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:08.330
Now, in the introduction, a single
description of Madison's writing

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:13.280
of the notes reassured readers
of the contemporaneous accuracy.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.820
And this description's been
repeated by countless historians.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.600
But intriguingly, Madison
never wrote in his own hand;

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.990
that the notes in their entirety
had been written that summer.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:30.970
I tracked down the original
version of that introduction.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:33.790
And the sentence breaks,

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:37.160
and the final assertion
is in Dolly's handwriting.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.520
And you can see that
there with Dolly's --

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:47.100
the introduction sentence with the
italics being Dolly's handwriting.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.950 position:56%
Madison may have consented to the
edition, for his handwriting appears

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:58.920
as an insertion on the sheet; but
he never actually wrote it himself.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.640
He had never settled on
a precise explanation

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.690
of the notes' relationship
to the Convention.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:10.330 position:56%
Madison understood his revisions as
repeated efforts to create a record,

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:14.660
his record of what he saw
significant in the Convention.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.910
Yet each revision, small and large,

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:21.930
increased the distance
from the summer of 1787.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:26.260
Over the years and decades, words,
concepts, compromises, shifted

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.950
and took on new political meanings.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.800
And motivations were
disputed, and context was lost.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.970
The Convention could not see the
Constitution until the final days,

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:40.610 position:56%
and from the moment the Constitution
became visible, it was contested.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.630
I believe that the
revisions do not detract,

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:47.960
but rather enhance the
manuscript's significance.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.750
The story of Madison's composition

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.560
of the notes emphasizes
his inability and that

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.240
of his fellow delegates to
perceive the extraordinary document

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.330
that the Constitution would become.

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:04.950 position:56%
And so tracing Madison's composition
of the notes guides us back

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.250
to a moment when the
substance and fate

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.310
of the Constitution
remained uncertain.

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.310
Madison's narrative in
the notes was always

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:16.030
that of James Madison, a member.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.850
Beginning in 1787 and
continuing for a half century,

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:23.590
he struggled to understand
what had happened that summer,

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.900
a struggle that continues
into our own day.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.360
It's been a great privilege
to speak here today.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.510
Thank you very much.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.170
[ Applause ]

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:39.430
And this is my final revised slide.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.880
[Laughter] It took me
a long time to figure

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.680
out how to revise the cartoon.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.070
[ Laughter ]

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:53.870
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We have time
for questions; [inaudible].

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.170
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Sir.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:56.970
&gt;&gt; I still hold onto
the notes [inaudible]

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.590
and fell in love with them.

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:01.910
I really look forward
to reading the book.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.560
I don't want to take us

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.000
down a rabbit hole away
from the [inaudible].

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.360 position:56%
The question of the ambiguity of his
position on slavery is a big one.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.070
I recall years ago when they
first reopened [inaudible],

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:21.100
the only place I've seen them
deal with the house slaves,

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.300
it strikes me [inaudible] he
took to Philadelphia with him,

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:30.520
the assertion made
[inaudible] that he sold the man

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.590
to a Philadelphia resident
in the knowledge

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.810
that under Pennsylvania
law the man [inaudible]

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:41.420
and the implication is that,
you know, he's in that sort

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.190
of an ambiguous situation, he
can't make the jump himself,

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:48.630
he's a man of his own
time and place.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:49.930
But is -- there's --

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.380
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Mary, could
you summarize the question?

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Yes;
so the question is sort

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:57.190
of about Madison's
position on slavery.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:01.830
For myself, I find that Madison
has been given a pass that's quite

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.650
interesting compared to
other people like Jefferson,

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:09.070
who I personally think he agreed
with much more than we realize.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.530
Montpelier does a wonderful
job talking about slavery,

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:16.020
and they actually have a wonderful
room there when you visit.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.280
For most of Madison's -- certainly

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.560
in his later life an
African-American man named Paul

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.880
Jennings was an enslaved man
who spent most of his life with

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.450
and wrote actually an
autobiography about that.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.360
And in the dining room, they
have an image of Paul Jennings.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.890
And they ask you to imagine what
was it like to be Paul Jennings,

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:39.100
while everybody came and went,
and talked about slavery,

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.820
and the American colonization
side, and you were just there.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.570
The book actually talks
about Madison's --

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.980
Madison writes a letter actually
from when he's in Congress

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:54.700
about a person who is enslaved who
he doesn't bring back with him.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.250
And the letter's actually
interesting because part

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.160
of the letter writes about, "Oh,

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.890
he's a person he must
value slavery."

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:05.570
And the other part of the letter
writes about the man as a property.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:08.680
"He would not be worth anything,"
and everything like that.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:13.120
And so in some ways, I think it
very much symbolizes Madison's

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.430
fundamental ambiguity.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:18.730
But he freed no one and this was
actually so shocking to the man

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.910
who had worked for many
years with him as a secretary

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.870
that he originally thought
that Madison's will was forged.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:30.500 position:56%
And so but Madison actually -- other
than being against the slave trade,

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:35.160
which he is against when it becomes
clear that everybody's against it,

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:40.750 position:56%
I think he was not -- I don't know
why he's given such a pass about it.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:46.180
And in the Virginia Ratification
Convention, he goes out of his way

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:50.370
to reassure the people
who held people

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:53.140
in slavery that they be protected.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.260
[ Silence ]

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.560
Yes, sir.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:01.130
&gt;&gt; So I read an article a while
back about how there were a number

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.430
of different [inaudible];

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:06.310
that a number of them have
gotten lost over the years.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.100
And how did that fit
into [inaudible]?

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder:
Yes; so I mean,

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.730
I don't think I can flip
back here to the thing.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:15.280
There are some lost notes,
and if you found them,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.070
that would be awesome, and you'd
probably make the front page

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.080
of the New York Times
as a discovery.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.070
There's contention
about whether some

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:27.990
of those lost notes ever existed or
not, because if you think about --

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:30.270
for example, I think particularly
if you read a wonderful book

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:37.270
by Joanne Freeman on the 1790s, you
realize how much this was a period

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:40.150
where people made assertions,
and then wanted to claim

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.860
that they had paper to back it up.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.650
So, you know, who knows how
much the notes are about that.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:48.730
But there are notes
that we know exist

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:53.200
that are missing the original Yates
notes are much of Lansing's copy

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.950
of those have never been found.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:01.550
Jim Hutson found a very
crucial part of that I guess

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.950
about 30 years ago now for that.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:08.450
So we're dealing with
multiple conflicting accounts.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.830
One thing that I think
my book disagrees

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.480
with is what people have taken

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.250 position:56%
as they've made Madison's notes
always the stable objective account.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:21.120
And then every time that Madison's
version, particularly of himself,

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:25.090
disagreed with anybody
else, they picked Madison.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:28.970
My book tries to argue that
on a couple of the issues

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.820
that people disagreed with, there
were reasons why Madison later

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.380
on wanted to say that he
hadn't said those things.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.430
And I'm more agnostic.

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:40.600
Madison was very close to
Hamilton during the Convention.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.690
And when Jefferson comes back,

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:46.670
Jefferson does not think
Hamilton is a good guy,

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.070
and Madison distances himself.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.410
And so the book tries
to tell the notes

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.320
and the multiple accounts
out of that history.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.620
[ Silence ]

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.920
Yes, sir,

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:00.090
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] are
there any other issues

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:05.460 position:56%
that have come before modern supreme
courts that would have been --

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.310
might have been affected
by [inaudible]?

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Yes, yes, yes.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:12.930
So I'm very careful not
to answer that question,

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.890
[laughter] because one of the
things I've loved is that people

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.570
of many political persuasions have
really enjoyed reading the book,

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:20.960
and like the book.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.810
So, you know, that's a
good position for me.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:28.080
The Supreme Court, in terms of its
majority opinions in recent years,

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:34.490
has been very careful to keep
distanced from the notes.

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:37.450
This isn't so true of the late
19th Century Supreme Court,

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:41.520
so there are cases involving
legal tender and things like that

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.760
that actually cite
to Madison's notes.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.950
The people who cite to Madison's
notes explicitly these days involve

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.500
people like Justice Thomas,
and they're mostly in dissents.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:54.200
So it doesn't matter that
much in that respect,

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.220
in terms of pure citation.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:00.450
I think the place that the book
will give people some difficulty is

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:06.020
that even though they're not
cited, many of the understandings

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:10.340 position:56%
that the Court has held with respect
to the Constitution recently rely

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:15.100
on a belief that in Philadelphia
in August and September,

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.720
the people who wrote the
Constitution understood the

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:22.000
Constitution in all the
complicated ways that we do.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.880
And my book sort of argues
they didn't; that they were

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.190
so busy drafting it and
trying to put it together

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.670
that they understood
the basic structures,

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.600
but the very fine-tuned
way that the Court has come

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.990
to read the Constitution
makes sense 225 years later,

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.610
but it might not have
made sense to them.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.470
But the Court's very
tricky about that.

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:47.770
Yes, sir?

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:59.860
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask another
moot point [phonetic].

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:07.110
Would he have agreed with
Senator Steven Douglas,

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:13.450
and Governor Sam Houston asserting
the union, or would he have agreed

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:18.780
that Virginia should leave the
union after the [inaudible]?

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Yes; so --

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.380
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Summarize it.

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Yes;
so the question involves

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.400
where would Madison
have been in 1864?

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:32.520
Yes, 1864 is sort of right
when Fort Sumter happened.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:38.790
So in the 1830s -- and Drew McCoy's
wonderful book on Madison talks

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:43.970
about this, all sorts
of nullification --

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:48.440
young nullification people
from South Carolina come

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.870
and visit Madison and Virginia.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:53.620
And they all say, "Madison,
you were really on our side.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.920
Vouch for us."

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.670
And Madison's like, "No," you
know, like, "It was different.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:58.610
Yes; I did the states
thing with Jefferson,

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:00.220 position:56%
but we're not the same as you guys."

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.350
And he actually gets quite
worried about that piece.

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:05.470
And I personally believe that
he was a nationalist above

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:07.610
and beyond anything else.

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:12.430
I think that was particularly
true at Philadelphia.

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:16.050
I think it was then
particularly true again

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:17.930
after serving as president.

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.110
And if you ever read -- Garry
Wills has a wonderful little book

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:22.710
on Madison as president.

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:27.170
And one of the things that I
think Wills does very well is talk

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:30.660
about how we don't give
Madison enough credit

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:35.230
for successfully navigating
through the War of 1812.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:38.200
And I think in that
sense, he's a nationalist.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.340
In that sense, right, Jefferson
we know makes the same --

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.640
you know, it's one thing
before you're president,

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.940
and then it's another thing
after you're president.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.240
So I think he would not have --

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.540 position:56%
how he would have done that would he
have been a constitutional unionist,

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:47.840
who knows?

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.140
But personally, I would have
put him on the union side.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.440
He would have had to move to West
Virginia, though, in order to --

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.740
[laughter] maybe wouldn't
have left Montpelier.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.040
Any other questions?

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.340
[ Silence ]

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.640
Well, thank you -- oh, yes, ma'am.

00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:02.460
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]; but
I'm just curious,

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:07.520
with regard to the
correspondence, I mean,

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:13.490
I always envision people before the
mid -- the 20th Century, you know,

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:18.720
writing almost daily,
little notes with whoever.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.240
And so talking about losses,
I mean, there were only

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.640
about a half dozen people

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.940
that listed [inaudible]
contemporaneous notes

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.240
or reported contemporaneous.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.770
But since there were more than
that at the Convention, I mean,

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:37.390
what remains of anybody
else's personal correspondence

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:40.480
where they might have described
events to their spouses,

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.770
adult children, other
close friends that --

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:47.780
I mean, I can't believe that
those are the only [inaudible].

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Yes.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.860
Yes; so basically those sets
of notes refer to people

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.340
who wrote enough to constitute what
I could call "legislative diaries"

00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.010
of some type or the other.

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.900
There's also an extensive body

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:02.010
of personal papers
related to the Convention.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:06.780
Those were published actually
in the documentary history.

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:10.630
The State Department
published a lot of them.

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:15.320
Max Furan's Third volume
has a lot of them;

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.190
Jim Hutson's fourth
volume has a lot of them.

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:20.580
I'm actually working
on a piece of this.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:23.570
One thing that's interesting
is there are no letters

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:24.870
to women in all of them.

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:29.090
So like did nobody write their
wives about what's happening,

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:31.310
or has no one looked for
letters to women, okay,

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:35.100
which if you do women's
history, might be like, "Oh,

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.650
maybe no one's gone looking."

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:45.390 position:56%
So there's actually a lot of
correspondence about the Convention.

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:51.000
The Convention said it was
secret or confidential,

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:57.830
and they actually meant -- were
really meaning confidential.

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:01.650
So people write things
that are illusions

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:06.810
to what's going to happen at best.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:12.460 position:56%
And so we have -- other than these
sort of private legislative diaries,

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.960
we don't have a lot
of correspondents

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.870
that explicitly says the
day-to-day accounts the way we do

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:22.470
for the first Congress where
things became more open.

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:25.140
&gt;&gt; Were the wives, would
their descendants have sort

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.980
of maybe burned the letters because
they thought they were worthless?

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Well, yes.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.100
&gt;&gt; Would they have kept
them secret in the manner

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.090
like they [inaudible]
history's perception,

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:36.690
their husbands' reputations,
or maybe it was interwoven

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.790
with personal matters that
they didn't [overlapping] --

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:42.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Sarah Bilder: Yes; no
it's a really interesting --

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:46.450
I think what gets destroyed is
a very interesting question.

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:51.040
And we don't know what's destroyed.

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.860
We know that Dolley Madison's
niece destroys some things.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:58.150
She was told she was supposed
to destroy some things.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:01.350
So we know -- I think
particularly descendants --

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:05.080
particularly I think interesting
wives and daughters did do some

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.380
of that in concern with reputation.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.680 position:56%
People -- some of Madison's notes --

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.980
there are several letters that
Madison writes that summer

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.280
that we know about,
because recipients say,

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.580
"Thanks for your letter," and
those letters are missing,

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.880
and it may be that those were
letters particularly to one

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.180
of the Virginia delegates who left
Madison's letters in the scene,

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.480
and it may be that Madison
was like, "I'd better not look

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.780
like I was writing people
what happened that summer."

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.080
So it may be that people destroyed
some letters that suggested

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.570
that you hadn't taken the
confidentiality as seriously.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:20.870
Some delegates brought
their wives with them

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:22.170
so they didn't have that problem.

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:23.820
Thank you very much.
