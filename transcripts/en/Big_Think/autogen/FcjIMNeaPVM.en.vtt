we know one thing about education and

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060
we know one thing about education and
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.760
we know one thing about education and
what we know many things about education

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770
what we know many things about education
 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.920
what we know many things about education
but one thing we know is that one-on-one

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
but one thing we know is that one-on-one
 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.230
but one thing we know is that one-on-one
tutor is actually much better than a

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
tutor is actually much better than a
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.629
tutor is actually much better than a
lecture hall there is there's a famous

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
lecture hall there is there's a famous
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.049
lecture hall there is there's a famous
study called a to Sigma study where and

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
study called a to Sigma study where and
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.880
study called a to Sigma study where and
it's been replicated in in many

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890
it's been replicated in in many
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.370
it's been replicated in in many
different disciplines but the idea is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
different disciplines but the idea is
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.769
different disciplines but the idea is
the following they you compare people

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
the following they you compare people
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.009
the following they you compare people
who are taking a class from a classroom

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
who are taking a class from a classroom
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.349
who are taking a class from a classroom
you know 30 people 50 people or whatever

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
you know 30 people 50 people or whatever
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.000
you know 30 people 50 people or whatever
in a classroom you compare their

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
in a classroom you compare their
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070
in a classroom you compare their
performance against somebody who is

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
performance against somebody who is
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.540
performance against somebody who is
who's being tutored one-on-one and it is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
who's being tutored one-on-one and it is
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.220
who's being tutored one-on-one and it is
always the case that the people that are

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
always the case that the people that are
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280
always the case that the people that are
tutored one-on-one perform to standard

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
tutored one-on-one perform to standard
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.770
tutored one-on-one perform to standard
deviations higher than the people that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
deviations higher than the people that
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.250
deviations higher than the people that
are that are in a classroom that that's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
are that are in a classroom that that's
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049
are that are in a classroom that that's
why to Sigma that's to Sigma two

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
why to Sigma that's to Sigma two
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299
why to Sigma that's to Sigma two
standard deviations and that but that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
standard deviations and that but that
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.470
standard deviations and that but that
what that means is that they are in the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
what that means is that they are in the
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049
what that means is that they are in the
98th percentile of over the performance

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
98th percentile of over the performance
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.880
98th percentile of over the performance
so people who are in a one-on-one tutor

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
so people who are in a one-on-one tutor
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.060
so people who are in a one-on-one tutor
are perform in the 98th percentile that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
are perform in the 98th percentile that
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.220
are perform in the 98th percentile that
means it really is better to have a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
means it really is better to have a
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.229
means it really is better to have a
one-on-one tutor than then a teacher and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
one-on-one tutor than then a teacher and
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.149
one-on-one tutor than then a teacher and
and it makes sense because if you're in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
and it makes sense because if you're in
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.980
and it makes sense because if you're in
a classroom you know of size 30 or

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
a classroom you know of size 30 or
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.950
a classroom you know of size 30 or
whatever the teacher can teach they have

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
whatever the teacher can teach they have
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690
whatever the teacher can teach they have
multiple choices and one of them is to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
multiple choices and one of them is to
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550
multiple choices and one of them is to
teach to the lowest student kind of the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
teach to the lowest student kind of the
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890
teach to the lowest student kind of the
one that but then it's very inefficient

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
one that but then it's very inefficient
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.859
one that but then it's very inefficient
to the other to the all others or the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
to the other to the all others or the
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.149
to the other to the all others or the
teacher can teach to the middle for

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
teacher can teach to the middle for
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.499
teacher can teach to the middle for
example then what happens is it's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
example then what happens is it's
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.850
example then what happens is it's
inefficient to everybody above the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
inefficient to everybody above the
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.320
inefficient to everybody above the
middle and the ones below the middle

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
middle and the ones below the middle
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.630
middle and the ones below the middle
don't understand anything so if there's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
don't understand anything so if there's
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700
don't understand anything so if there's
no great way to do it in a classroom and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
no great way to do it in a classroom and
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.649
no great way to do it in a classroom and
and this is why you know one-on-one

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
and this is why you know one-on-one
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149
and this is why you know one-on-one
tutors are much better because they

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
tutors are much better because they
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.569
tutors are much better because they
completely adapt to your personal needs

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579
completely adapt to your personal needs
 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.749
completely adapt to your personal needs
however we can't have one-on-one tutors

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
however we can't have one-on-one tutors
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.460
however we can't have one-on-one tutors
for everybody because then that would

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
for everybody because then that would
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230
for everybody because then that would
require having as many teachers as there

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
require having as many teachers as there
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.179
require having as many teachers as there
are students and that's just not not

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
are students and that's just not not
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490
are students and that's just not not
scalable so what I would like to do and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
scalable so what I would like to do and
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.780
scalable so what I would like to do and
this is one of the one of the stated

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
this is one of the one of the stated
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.399
this is one of the one of the stated

duolingo is as good as a classroom we

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
duolingo is as good as a classroom we
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330
duolingo is as good as a classroom we
have studies that show that we are as

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
have studies that show that we are as
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190
have studies that show that we are as
good as a classroom that's great but I

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
good as a classroom that's great but I
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.899
good as a classroom that's great but I
think in the future we can be as good as

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
think in the future we can be as good as

and and and there's a good reason for
 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.200
and and and there's a good reason for
that it has to do also with with the the

that it has to do also with with the the

it would charge of course you know tens
of thousands of dollars to do this so if

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
of thousands of dollars to do this so if
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.790
of thousands of dollars to do this so if
you had a lot of money you had access to
