00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
&gt;&gt; No.
I don't think that China itself can pull the

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.280
whole world economy out of
this economic crisis, as the crisis began

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.820
at the developed countries.
So I guess it will take more of international

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.080
collaboration, and it
will take more responsibility from the industrial

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.480
countries rather than
trying to put all the pressure onto one country,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
even as large as
China.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.140
Now, I think China really has to go a long
way until it can become

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.970
responsible for the whole globe, global economy.
