Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Now what, what's the deal with marijuana in the [inaudible] MMA much legal now? Um, the, they don't in season, out of season. Yeah. It's fine. They just, they, they've lowered the um, acceptable level or the they've raised it rather like what you could have in your bloodstream. You basically just can't be high the day. Yeah. Yeah. And that's another interesting one. I mean that acts, especially THC acts on a lot of these mtor pathways, you know, that's, that's the same thing with a lot of these anti aging compounds, right? Like wrap a myosin or you know, metformin to a lesser extent acts on that mtor pathway and inhibits it. Right. But again, it's, it's short term with something like marijuana and you also get this pain killing effect. And there was, I forget if this was a study or if it was, if it was like anecdotal, but it's almost like a higher thrill seeking effect.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Like the endocannabinoid system when stimulated shuts down some of your, your, your sense of fear when it comes to experiencing a new adventure. Really. And so you actually, you actually go adventure seeking more. And when you look at like ultra runners, um, anybody who's competing in a, a non, a complex activity in which they might have already developed the ability to be able to be in the zone, right? They've put in their 10,000 hours of practice and they're able to just kind of check out and go into automatic mode. When you combine that with the pain qualling effects of something like uh, you know, in most cases like a THC CBD Combo is what a lot of ultra runners are using. I'm not sure what what they'd use in, in MMA right now, but ultimately you get a good effect. But, but the loss of reaction time and the loss of the ability to be able to perform complex tasks, which they proven like flight simulation studies dictates that it's still not that great of a drug if you are going to be doing complex tasks.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Question though, when they're talking about reacts and Studies, are they talking about reactions studies for people that are acclimated to taking marijuana? Are they talking about it with people where they take a, someone who's a sober person and they introduce him to marijuana and there's this overwhelming effect of it because one of the things that happens to people that aren't accustomed to THC is the freak out effect where they're just like, oh, they're not comfortable with the experience. After a while, the way it's described, and again this is all anecdotal, but by people that are accustomed to it, they say you just get good at being high and see the reaction time thing. I don't buy, because a lot of strikers, a lot of a kickboxers they train while they're on marijuana. It's very common. A lot of in reaction time was done on pilots and there's, there's a few more blinky lights in the cockpit than, than a mat.

Speaker 1:          02:45          So sure, that might been more going on for sure. But, but that's the, the question is, are they experienced stoners or people that are freaking out and maybe the reaction time is they're spacing out and they don't know what the fuck this experience is like. And there they might have because of it. You know, there's a lot of uh, really overwhelming sensations that come with that marijuana high and a lot of them, you know, you call paranoia or over sensitivity and sometimes you get paralysis by analysis when you're under the influence of those things where all the acute versus chronic effect. But you Jitsu personally, my personal experience would you do to in marijuana is, it's an enhancer and I've argued this that I think it's a performance enhancing with, with CBD CBD, no, just marijuana. That's what, that's what a lot of endurance athletes are.

Speaker 1:          03:31          You know, like, like folks in the ultra running community and now like they'll use like a trace amount of THC combined with CBD, like four to one to attend to one CBD to THC ratio. And I think, you know, now with the farm bill and increasingly gallery, I think this idea of developing sports performance supplements for athletes who aren't competing in sports, whether that is band are going to be steered in the direction of like high CBD. And then some of these other novel molecules are like CBG or CBN. These, what are those? Yeah, there's, there's all these different I that but not just turpines. Yes, CBG, CBN or cannabinoids. THC eight is an anti inflammatory that's totally different than THC nine [inaudible] he's from orally ingesting in are from smoking it or vaporizing. They actually are now isolating these in labs almost like organic chemistry and you, you, you can take hemp or marijuana and and you can actually isolate specific compounds and then combine them.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So you can take like you could take like CBG CBD, combine that with other terpenes from like whatever. Let's say lavender and Valerian and camomile and make like a, like a es de stress relaxation type of compound. Or You could do like a, like a THC but a the eight instead of a THC nine and combine that with like cinnamon and peppermint. Maybe some caffeine or creatine or something like that to make like more of a pick me up type of compound. But I think that's, that's the wave of the future when it comes to a lot of these, these marijuana companies that are developing stuff for specific goals. I know a lot of folks that are trying to CBD that use it for inflammation, especially athletes like it with a little bit of Thc, they seem to think it's more effective. You know, there's some sort of a combined effect of the THC with the CVD.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Yeah. Yeah. They call that the a, the entourage effect, you know, when you have all the different turpines and the endocannabinoids, which one's turtle? Yeah. Which one's the turtle has no clue. So, um, there's hundreds of different, different cannabinoids, right? I don't think there's hundreds. Well, I think there's at least dozens. I don't know about hundreds. How many of them, I mean, if you, if you look at a chart of the different endocannabinoid they've actually discovered, if you were to just Google on a 300 hundred 13. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a lot. It's a lot of fucking could have noise. I wonder. Yeah. I wonder if they'll be able to like design something that gives you the high without the paranoia or gives you the, you know, the various effects without spacing out. Yeah. Yeah.
