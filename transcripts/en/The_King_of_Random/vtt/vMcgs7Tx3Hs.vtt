00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.760
Hey guys I brought you back out to the mountains today

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.380
Because I want to show you another cool way

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.380
You can start a survival fire using a sandwich baggy

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.920
Now over the years I've shown you how you can use water to start a fire

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.540
Using things like bottles, lightbulbs, saran wrap and even your pee

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.600
But I wanted to focus on using a snack bag today

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.240
Because there's a good chance you'll have one of these if you ever get lost while you're camping or hiking

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.660
Now perhaps one of the most important things in starting a fire is your tinder

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.180
The type of tinder that you use. We want to find something extremely dry

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.640
And I'm gonna be using some bark, I'm gonna crush this up into a powder

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.440
Cause contrary to my other videos would have you believe using paper to light a fire's not very easy

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.000
What we're gonna do is use these big rocks and smash that up into a little powder

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.480
Because the finer we can get this the easier it will light off with the rays of the sun

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.660
So after crushing this bark between rocks for a couple minutes

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.100
You can see it's been reduced to a really fine dust like a really fine saw dust

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.180
And the darker the wood color the better because it's gonna absorb more heat

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.460
and now that we've got this stuff we can move onto

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.320
our final few preparations before we actually light it up

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.180
A nice flat piece of bark like this would be good for a base plate

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.120
Then once we've got that in place we can just transfer the dust over into it

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.440
and form a little pile

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.020
and it's a good idea to have a backup

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.060
because as the embers and coals start building

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.160
you're gonna want to have some extra dust to sprinkle on there and build it up a little quicker

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.020
Now I got my little buddy out here helping me today

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.740
He's going to be gathering some of the twigs that we're going to use for our kindling

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.060
You can see that the ground is covered with all kinds of little twigs

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.760
and we want the thinnest ones possible

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.540
because that's what we're gonna transfer our embers to once we get a flame going

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.740
Trees are a great resource for kindling as well as they've got these

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.520
old, dead branches that are super thin, super fine

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.720
Within a matter of seconds you can get a whole handful of tinder

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.380
that'll just be great for when a flame starts growing

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.540
Now the last thing that's going to be really helpful in building a tinder bundle

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540
is some kind of dead grass like this yellowish stuff down there

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.400
If you dig down underneath and pull it out

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.880
you can get enough of it to fold it over and build a nest

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.860
and our little sticks and twigs should nestle down nicely right inside of that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.720
Alright guys, so I've been scavenging in the forest

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.120
for all the different materials that we'll need

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.960
then we got them laid out here in order

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.120
I'll be starting with this little tinder pile here

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.100
Once we ignite that with the sunlight I've got a little bit

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.500
coarser bark that I've ground up that we'll sprinkle over the top

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.440
Once that's smoking pretty good

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.260
we've got some dead grass that I can form into a little nest or tinder bundle

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.400
and once that catches fire, we've got little tiny twigs that'll help sustain that flame

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.180
and then hopefully that'll be enough

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.620
to catch these on fire

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.620
Once there's enough heat to ignite these things

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.680
our fire should be pretty well self-sufficient at that point

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.940
Now the trick to using a sandwich bag or a snack bag

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.200
to starting a fire

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.480
is first you gotta make sure it's empty

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.960
then you gotta fill it up with water

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.200
Now you're gonna want to fill your bag up about half full of water

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.000
and you can use water from a creek like I'm doing here

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.180
or water from your bottle

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.720
or in extreme emergencies you can even use your urine

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.140
The first thing you're gonna want to do

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.480
is tilt your baggie to the side so it makes a diamond shape

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.460
with one of the points facing down

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.300
Then we're gonna grab this top area here

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.840
then we'll need to twist that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.340
to trap as much of the water inside as possible

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.320
Now the more you twist your baggie

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.240
the more you're gonna notice it starts to bulge out

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.460
and form these curves

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.200
which starts to look like a liquid sphere

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.620
and that's exactly what we're going for

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.180
It is a very fine line though

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.280
because the more you twist

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.740
the closer the bag is to bursting

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.900
and then you're gonna lose it all
