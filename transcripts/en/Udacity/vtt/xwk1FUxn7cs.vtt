00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.786
The answer to all three of these questions is no. The only factor common to all

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:09.284
three terms is 1. We also know that we can't use a factoring pattern to factor

00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:13.510
this side of the equation. 6 is not a perfect square, so this doesn't fit the

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.937
pattern for a perfect square trinomial, or for the difference of two squares.

00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:22.430
And finally, we need four terms to do factoring by grouping so this won't work

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.974
either.
