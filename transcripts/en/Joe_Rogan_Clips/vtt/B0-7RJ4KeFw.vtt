00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.850
The Joe Rogan experience,
the whole thing is what's,

2
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:07.770
what's uncomfortable is that it's very,

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.550
they're very little conversations taking place and a lot of people that are like

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:13.550
really angry.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.830
I was watching this guy suddenly some representative,
I don't even know his name,

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:20.700
but he was offering a hundred dollars to name the,

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.920
these girls that were in front of a,
um,
planned parenthood.

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.170
And um,
he's like a grown man that these,
they're girls,

9
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:33.960
they're young Christian girls.
What do you mean name them?

10
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.940
As in like all the names so he can shame them publicly.
Cool.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.940
Very smart.
This guy's name and,
but he's offering on this video $100 like,

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.430
but this is where people have gotten to where they think that that's okay.
Yeah.

13
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.560
Like these people you have,
like,

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.980
I know you're there to support a woman's right to choose,

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.570
but you have to understand that these people think that this is a place where

16
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.780
they kill babies.
Yeah.
All right.
This is what they think.

17
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:03.750
Whether regardless of what you think,
this is why they're there,

18
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.590
they're not there because they're evil.
Right.

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.150
And I know that this would put unwanted pressure on a grows going there for an

20
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:13.890
abortion.
I get it.
I get the whole thing.
Yeah.

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.580
I get it from your side and I see where they're coming from too.

22
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.490
And although I fully support a woman's right to choose you,

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.580
you can't want to dox people that think they're saving babies or talking someone

24
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:31.200
into having a child that and that child,

25
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.100
they think we'll become the kind of relationship with that child and that mother

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.540
become like their mother and them or like the ideal version of that.
I mean,

27
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.570
that's what they're,
they're not doing it because they're bad people.
Right?

28
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:45.810
Like there's some groups that do it just because they're pieces of shit like the

29
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:49.080
Westboro Baptist church.
Like they should things because they're bad people.

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.890
Like all they want to do is go protest a soldier's funeral.
Well,
you know,

31
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:57.300
I didn't want to cause a stir Megan Phelps who left them,
right?
That got out.
Yes.

32
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.370
And now she met a guy on Twitter.
It's a great store.
Right?

33
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.260
It's an amazing,
she's human again.
Well,

34
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.610
she started talking to people and then investigating and real and dude,
well,

35
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.160
I'm telling you,
when you talk to her,
she's like the nicest,

36
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.870
most reasonable person.
And to think that just 15 years ago,
whatever it was,

37
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:20.730
10 years ago,
she was a full on zealot.
Yeah,
it's weird.
And her dad or uncle,

38
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:25.080
grandfather rather can get it right.
Her grandfather is the Fred Phelps.

39
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:27.960
He started the whole thing.
He's the old dude that hold mean guy.

40
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.040
But do you think it's facts you completely do?

41
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:34.150
You complete buy into the fact that she's scared of it.
So none of that is,

42
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.600
she's so honest and open about what she felt and why she felt it and why she was

43
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:43.350
conflicted and why it didn't jive with what she was reading in the Bible.

44
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.100
It didn't make sense to her.
Right.
And,

45
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.810
and the way he was doing it when she was realizing was not how Christians did it

46
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.590
all over the world.
Right.
And that this,
this,
you know,

47
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.250
this desire to constantly get attention in the news.

48
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.200
Even at soldier's funerals,

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.780
they would go to soldier's funerals and say that these soldiers are dying

50
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.140
because gay people are getting married.
Like what they were saying,

51
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.930
they deserve to die,
that deserve to be dead.
I mean that kind of,
you know,

52
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.650
but I'm telling you from that she's like the nicest person you'd ever want to

53
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:14.230
meet.
So she found some regulation in her world.

54
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.810
She realizes it was bullshit and she was tricked and you know,

55
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.120
she's done a great job to free herself.

56
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.680
But when you indoctrinate someone heavily into anything,

57
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:28.681
and this is whether it's being a religious zealot or being a political zealot,

58
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.670
you indoctrinate someone when they're early in their,
their,
their youth,

59
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.050
they're formidable years.
Very difficult for them to get out of it.

60
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.010
It takes real work because that's what I mean.

61
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.750
That's why I guess I'm saying it sticks with you,
right?

62
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:44.380
Like my whole thing is there's things instilled in me from my youth,

63
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.220
from where I grew up culturally and how I grew up that even though I'm more

64
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:53.110
learned now,
I still do understand those ways of thinking.
Right.

65
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.180
So it is hard to break away from those things.

66
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:58.870
Even though like when you just said the whole like a woman's right to choose,

67
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.300
right?
Like I grew up in the Midwest,
I grew up Catholic.

68
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.480
This is how I am most of my family is for so in so many words against abortion,

69
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.730
uh,
but I don't think these things are mutually exclusive that you can be against

70
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.140
abortion and against women's rights to choose.

71
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.480
You can say that you don't like abortion,

72
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.780
but also say I'm not going to control what you do with your body.

73
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.410
It's kind of how I feel.
I don't love the idea of abortion.
I'm being honest.

74
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:24.370
I just,
I just don't love it.

75
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.360
But I do think I'm not going to stand here and tell people what to do,

76
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.870
but I should be able to still say I don't like it.
I don't think it's,

77
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.720
I don't think it's a healthy thing to do.
I don't really enjoy,

78
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.310
I don't enjoy like the spreading of it being kind of this not a big deal thing.

79
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.710
But I do think people can do whatever they fucking want to do.

80
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.180
But I'm also allowed to go.
Uh,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't love the idea.

81
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.280
Like I don't like it.
Uh,
just an option.
I just don't love it.

82
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:55.720
I don't love it.
Birth control is obviously the best method of course.

83
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:58.900
And I think women should be more aware,
but women,
when they take birth control,

84
00:04:58.901 --> 00:04:59.980
man,
they have to,

85
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.270
I'm not not advocating for abortion as a method of birth control,

86
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.580
but what I'm saying is when women take birth control pills,

87
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.700
that shit fucks with them.
That fucks with their horn.
Not a good thing.

88
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.960
It's not good.
And that I know.
And,
and when they do it and they also smoke,

89
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.980
it can cause like real complications.
It can,
it's a lot.

90
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.100
It means there's a lot of women have really bad reactions to the pill changes

91
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.460
your behavior,
suicidal tendencies.
I've heard a lot of like really bad stories.

92
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:27.370
Now I'm also saying if we want to look at it from a different perspective,

93
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.880
men should also take way more fucking responsibility then.
Like,

94
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.410
this is the other side is this,

95
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.440
this argument tends to land on women a lot where it's like,

96
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.880
you don't tell me how to fucking,

97
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.670
you don't tell a woman what to do with the body's like,
okay,
that's fine.

98
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.980
I'm just saying how I don't like it.
Also,

99
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.570
I don't like guys nothing in women and fucking ghosting and not wanting to raise

100
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:47.560
a child.
Right?

101
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.310
So I think the other side of it is two parties here should be responsible.

102
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:53.050
Men should take some fucking responsibility over,

103
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.590
stop coming inside of these fucking people.
If you're not ready to have kids,

104
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.290
I'm just being real.
It's like either wear a condom or stop,
stop,

105
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.730
stop doing the thing that you know makes children.
Yeah.
So,
you know,
but again,

106
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.620
this is this weird balance of,
like I say,

107
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:10.250
I come from this and I am not conservative,

108
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.000
but like this real Catholic upbringing in the Midwest,
you know,

109
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.470
a good old Irish Catholic boy and the ideas that you hear as a kid all the time,

110
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.690
you then grow.
And I now go,

111
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.790
I think people should be able to do whatever they want to do.

112
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:26.420
I'm not gonna fucking control somebody,
but I still have those little moments of,

113
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.890
yeah,
I just don't love it though,

114
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.800
because it was something that was instilled in me as a youth.
[inaudible].
