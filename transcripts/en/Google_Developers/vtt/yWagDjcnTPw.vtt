00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.400
Gundrota: First I'd like
to announce that we are--

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.367
have part two of
the Android Developer Challenge

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:07.601
being announced today.

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:09.901
The details are located
at that url.

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:12.834
We will take submissions
for the contest in August,

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:14.567
judging will occur
through the fall,

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:16.968
and we'll announce our winners
at the end of fall.

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:19.601
This time we've learned a few
things from &lt;i&gt;American Idol,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.400
and so we will have user votes
as part of the judging,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.701
and we think this contest

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:25.601
is going to be really,
really exciting.

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:27.901
Number two,
I'd like to announce

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:29.968
that we're going to give away--

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:32.934
to every conference
attendee today,

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:34.868
all 4,000 of you, this box,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.901
which contains a link
to the SDK documentation...

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.267
[laughter]

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:47.234
And a few more surprises...

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.434
including an Android phone.

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:53.367
[cheers and applause]

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:03.467
This...

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.767
I think,
you know, we realized

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:07.868
that you could
go download the SDK,

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.601
you could use the emulator,

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.400
but nothing beats
having a real device.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.200
And I've always wanted
an Oprah moment,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.367
so for you, and you, and you.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.400
[applause]

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.300
There's one more thing.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.133
This is an unlocked device
that'll be available.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.534
In addition,
we went one step further.

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:33.300
Included in every device

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.634
will be a SIM that gives you
unlimited 3G data

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:42.834
and thousands of hours
of calls for 30 days.

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:44.934
And so we realized
some of you don't have a SIM

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:47.434
to get started tonight,
you might have a CDMA phone,

00:01:47.434 --> 00:01:48.734
but we think this is a nice way

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.100
to get started on you
exploring the platform.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.033
[cheers and applause]

00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:01.934
It's our
small way of saying

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:04.434
thank you for supporting
our conference as well.

00:02:04.434 --> 00:02:06.801
I'd like to conclude
by just making

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:08.734
a few more quick announcements.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.968
If you thought
that surprise was fun,

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:12.901
we have another
surprise for you.

00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.100
Please don't miss
tomorrow's keynote.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.133
Tomorrow's keynote, I think,
will surprise many of you

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.567
with some exciting things
that have not yet leaked,

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:24.067
and we're so excited about that.

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:25.467
[laughter]

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:27.234
So you'll enjoy that.

00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:29.767
Number two,
picking up your device--

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:32.934
you can pick up your device
starting this afternoon

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:34.300
throughout
the entire conference.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.701
So you don't have to go rush.

00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:37.934
You don't have to go
queue up in line right now.

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:39.968
Go to your sessions,
and in the afternoon

00:02:39.968 --> 00:02:41.267
at the registration area,

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:44.634
we'll start giving out
all 4,000-plus devices.

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:47.133
And we'll continue that
through the party tonight.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.968
So don't miss
the after hours party.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.467
We're going to have
some great DJs.

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:52.634
Like last year, we're
going to have a lot of fun.

00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:54.234
And, of course, many Googlers

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:55.734
will be there
to interact with you.

00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:57.667
So once again, thank you
for attending the keynote,

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:58.934
enjoy the conference,

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:01.167
and thank you
for supporting Google I/O.

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:04.834
[cheers and applause]

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:09.267
recorded male voice:
Welcome to Google I/O.
