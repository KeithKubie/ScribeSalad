00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.120
Are you a robotics expert?

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.550
Because you've just
brought Giga Gal to life!

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.040
This level has had a lot
of challenging stuff in it,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.000
figuring out how jumping should work,
keeping track of the complex set of

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
anums that define Giga Gal's state,
loading up all the right assets, and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.890
making sure they're
drawn at the right time.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.940
While jumping around
randomly sure is fun,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.780
I think this game is missing something.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.350
Maybe some platforms to jump on?
