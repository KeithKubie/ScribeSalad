they've done nothing at the time and so
we should expect the belief systems that

because there's abundance we have those

because there's abundance we have those

so for example if you think about a

if it is hospitable to farming can
support a much larger population so it

support a much larger population so it
 

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.220
support a much larger population so it

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.129
opportunities human beings will
sometimes look within their own

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:39.139
sometimes look within their own
 

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:41.829
sometimes look within their own
population and figure out who can't

population and figure out who can't
 

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:43.870
population and figure out who can't
defend the resources that they hold and

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880
defend the resources that they hold and
 

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.019
defend the resources that they hold and
they manufacture reasons that they are

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:47.029
they manufacture reasons that they are
 

00:12:47.029 --> 00:12:49.720
they manufacture reasons that they are
not entitled to keep them and so when we

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:49.730
not entitled to keep them and so when we
 

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.689
not entitled to keep them and so when we
feel austerity coming on we tend to

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:52.699
feel austerity coming on we tend to
 

00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:55.210
feel austerity coming on we tend to
become more tribal and this is a very

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:55.220
become more tribal and this is a very
 

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.329
become more tribal and this is a very
dangerous pattern of history for example

00:12:58.329 --> 00:12:58.339
dangerous pattern of history for example
 

00:12:58.339 --> 00:13:00.249
dangerous pattern of history for example
what took place during the Holocaust

00:13:00.249 --> 00:13:00.259
what took place during the Holocaust
 

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:03.370
what took place during the Holocaust
when German population decided to target

European Jews and it made up reasons

European Jews and it made up reasons
that those Jews were not entitled to

00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:25.870
boom and human beings are becoming
tribal because that is that is the

creating more mouths is not the natural

health that growth is the conversion of

health that growth is the conversion of
useful energy into useless heat and the

conversion of useful materials into
 

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.240
conversion of useful materials into
useless waste so we have what I call a

it seems that that should be a very good
 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.070
it seems that that should be a very good
thing but from the point of view of the

thing but from the point of view of the

18th and 19th century and those ideas
