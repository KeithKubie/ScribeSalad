00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:13.199
The Konami Code, also known as the Konami
Command and sometimes the Contra Command is

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.130
among the most enduring Easter eggs in video
game history.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.620
For those of you who aren’t familiar, there
are a number of video games released by Konami

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.430
over the years in which entering up, up, down,
down, left, right, left, right, B, A will

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.200
result in the player being granted a host
of power-ups or a bonus of some kind, depending

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.300
on the game.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.030
While the code itself was initially featured
in the 1986 Famicom (“Family Computer”,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.690
better known the world over as the Nintendo
Entertainment System) port of Gradius, it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.070
is best known for its appearance in the 1988
NES port of Contra, in which it granted the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.570
player 30 additional lives.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.890
So who invented the Konami Code and why was
it put in the game?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
When Gradius was being ported to the NES,
the guy in charge of developing and testing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.329
it, Kazuhisa Hashimoto, wasn’t very good
at the game.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.820
This was a problem because part of his job
included playing all the way through it to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.330
make sure there were no bugs or errors.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.280
To make beating the game easier, Hashimoto
inserted a code that would grant him a full

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.000
arsenal of power-ups.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.970
As to the story behind the specific pattern,
Hashimoto stated, “There isn’t one really.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.439
I mean, I was the one using it, so I just
put in something I could remember easily.”

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.010
After he finished testing the game, Hashimoto
forgot to remove the code before clearing

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.680
it for release and the game went into production
with the code still lingering in the game’s

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
program.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.060
Hashimoto’s fellow developers at Konami
liked his idea for a code that made games

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.650
easier to complete when testing them out,
and similarly began inserting them into other

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.409
games they were working on to make their jobs
easier.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.490
Exactly how the Gradius power up code became
known to general gamers isn’t clear.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.560
But when it did, knowledge of it quickly spread
via word of mouth, inspiring Konami developers

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.380
to put the same code in the NES port of Contra
to serve as an Easter egg of sorts for gamers

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.579
who played Gradius and Gradius 2 (the latter
of which also contained the same cheat code).

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.840
Of course, as anyone who’s played Contra
will tell you, completing the game without

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.639
the Konami Code is difficult, if not nigh-on
impossible without superhuman reflexes, perhaps

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.019
also inspiring the developers to have mercy
on gamers by keeping the code in.

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.700
The code would later become synonymous with
Contra thanks to massive coverage from gaming

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.569
publications like Nintendo Power, who famously
revealed its existence to thousands of young

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.829
gamers in their first ever issue in 1988.

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.329
Due to the code’s massive popularity with
gamers, Konami decided to implement it in

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.379
virtually all subsequent sequels to both Gradius
and Contra while also inserting it into many

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.079
of their other titles, because why not?

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.550
Since then, numerous other game makers have
used the same code (appearing in over 200

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.150
video games to date), and it has also spread
to other forms of media, including being featured

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:12.900
in songs, TV shows, movies, and on various
websites, such as BuzzFeed.
