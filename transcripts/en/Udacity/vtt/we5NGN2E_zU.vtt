00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
If you're a coach or a mentor, what you're responsible for

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.800
is spending 1 to 3 hours per week for every team.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.080
And you're going to be working with 1 to 4 teams for up to 3 weeks.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.610
We encourage you to meet up once a week in person

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.520
and/or once a week online per team with Skype or Google Hangout.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.090
But what we're really looking for is you to offer your critiques and your expertise

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.910
in their LaunchPad Central narratives.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.440
As they start talking about the customers they're actually interacting with,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.420
we want you to offer comments.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
Was this the right interaction? What should they have learned?

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.890
Should they have done something different?

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.600
You need to actually be giving them feedback, you need to be giving them contacts,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.090
people to talk to, and sharing all your domain expertise.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.300
This is not just kind of, "I showed up as a mentor."

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.240
This is a full-time engagement with these teams.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.870
So think of yourself as almost their venture investor.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.400
Assume you just put a substantial fraction of your net worth into these teams.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.880
Care like that.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.270
Let me be clear, though. We don't want you to do their work for them.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.120
But we want you to guide them to the right places to talk to,

00:01:10.120 --> 99:59:59.000
to see the right patterns in the data, and to understand what you understand.
