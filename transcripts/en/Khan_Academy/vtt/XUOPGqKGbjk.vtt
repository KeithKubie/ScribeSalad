00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.250
- [Instructor] We're told a
scale on a blue print drawing

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.250
of a house shows 10 centimeters
represents 2 meters.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.330
What number of actual
meters are represented

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.620
by 18 centimeters on the blue print?

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.860
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.360
So the main thing to realize
is that a blue print drawing

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.400
is a scale drawing of
something in the real world.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
In this case of a house.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.360
And so what we can do
is set-up a little bit

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.150
of a table here, so let's put the drawing

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.080
on the left, so this is
the blue print drawing.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.322
And then this is the real world.

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:43.322
Real world on the right.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.400
And the unit that we're using,
the units that we're using

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.490
in our drawing are centimeters.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.100
So we have centimeters over here.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.520
And then the real world, we're
thinking in terms of meters.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.030
And so let me make a
little bit of a table.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.540
And so we see that 10
centimeters on the drawing

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.940
corresponds to 2 meters in the real world.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.420
So 10 centimeters in the
drawing, corresponds to 2 meters

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.060
in the real world.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.450
Then they ask us what
number of actual meters

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.070
are represented by 18
centimeters on the blue print?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.250
So 18 centimeters on the
blue print would correspond

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.120
to what in the real world?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.020
Well there's several ways to approach it.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.440
One way to think about it is,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.313
look to go from 10 to 18, we
are going to multiply by 1.8.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.270
So to go from what 10
centimeters represents

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.960
in the real world to what
18 centimeters represents

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.790
in the real world, you would
similarly multiply by 1.8.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.053
So times 1.8, which would give us 3.6.

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.370
3.6 what?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.059
3.6 meters in the real world.

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:53.680
So 3.6 meters in the real world would be

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.160
what 18 centimeters on
the blue print represents.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.005
Let's do another example.

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:03.250
Jaylynn draws a hen
with a scale of 2 units

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.690
on her graph paper represents 6 meters,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.850
6 centimeters in the real world.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.810
The hen is 16 units tall in the drawing.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.880
What is the height in
centimeters of the actual hen?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.230
So once again, pause this video

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.600
and see if you can figure that out.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.140
Alright, so let's just
set-up our tables again.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.710
So for our table, so we have our drawing,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.590
and then we have the real, real world.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.510
And in our drawing, it's
just these little units

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.600
on our graph paper, so I'll
call it just that, units.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.450
And the real world,
we're thinking in terms

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.830
of centimeters, centimeters.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.920
And so let me set-up a
little bit of a table here,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.080
and so we know, and we
see that right over here

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.350
from this scale.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.020
We can see two units
represent 6 centimeters

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.190
in the real world.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.630
So two units in our drawing
represent six centimeters

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.320
in the real world, and
then they say the hen

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.380
is 16 units tall in the drawing.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.800
So it's 16 units tall in the drawing.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.350
What would that represent
in the real world

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.320
which would be the
actual height of the hen?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.830
If two units represent six centimeters,

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.730
and now we have eight times as many units,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.980
well that's gonna represent
eight times as many centimeters.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.030
So six times eight is 48 centimeters.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.870
So what is the height in
centimeters of the actual hen?

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.403
48 centimeters, 48 and we're done.
