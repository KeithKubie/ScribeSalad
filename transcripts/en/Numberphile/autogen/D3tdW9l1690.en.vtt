when I was a kid every time we had

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159
when I was a kid every time we had
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.450

oranges my dad would always peel this

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460
oranges my dad would always peel this
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.990

little orange man into the skin as he

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
little orange man into the skin as he
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.820
little orange man into the skin as he
was cutting them for us which is quite

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
was cutting them for us which is quite
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.070
was cutting them for us which is quite
fun really I mean like get to have like

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080
fun really I mean like get to have like
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.379
fun really I mean like get to have like
a little companion why would he do that

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
a little companion why would he do that
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.150
a little companion why would he do that
was it to encourage you to eat because

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
was it to encourage you to eat because
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.370
was it to encourage you to eat because
he liked you know what I'm actually I'm

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
he liked you know what I'm actually I'm
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.050
he liked you know what I'm actually I'm
actually allergic to oranges as well so

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
actually allergic to oranges as well so
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060
actually allergic to oranges as well so
it'd be all nice and fun until I was

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
it'd be all nice and fun until I was
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.330
it'd be all nice and fun until I was
sick but the mathematical idea of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
sick but the mathematical idea of
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.299
sick but the mathematical idea of
peeling a two-dimensional object into

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
peeling a two-dimensional object into
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130
peeling a two-dimensional object into
the surface of the sphere it stuck with

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
the surface of the sphere it stuck with

the surface of the sphere it stuck with
you thunk with me I think I've lost my

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
you thunk with me I think I've lost my
 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.430
you thunk with me I think I've lost my
place now okay when we had like like

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
place now okay when we had like like
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.799
place now okay when we had like like
need another arm the reason I wanted to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
need another arm the reason I wanted to
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.970
need another arm the reason I wanted to
show you this was because I was always

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
show you this was because I was always
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.200
show you this was because I was always
something a little bit annoying about

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
something a little bit annoying about
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.770
something a little bit annoying about
the orange man it's like his legs coming

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
the orange man it's like his legs coming
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.650
the orange man it's like his legs coming
off now ah wait wait

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660
off now ah wait wait
 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.510
off now ah wait wait
imagine you don't see that bit okay no

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
imagine you don't see that bit okay no
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.770
imagine you don't see that bit okay no
it kind of works it kind of works right

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
it kind of works it kind of works right
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.229
it kind of works it kind of works right
kind of way see there you go he's sort

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
kind of way see there you go he's sort
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.840
kind of way see there you go he's sort
of that I took his leg off well whatever

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
of that I took his leg off well whatever
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939
of that I took his leg off well whatever
he's kind of cool like this little

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
he's kind of cool like this little
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.649
he's kind of cool like this little
orange guy it's more like a starfish

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
orange guy it's more like a starfish
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.350
orange guy it's more like a starfish
really here's one okay

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
really here's one okay
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.640
really here's one okay
my only one was a bit better and my

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
my only one was a bit better and my
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.530
my only one was a bit better and my
practice one was a bit better and this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
practice one was a bit better and this
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.940
practice one was a bit better and this
is a fresher orange I think that's my

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
is a fresher orange I think that's my
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.649
is a fresher orange I think that's my
problem I just realized that you own I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
problem I just realized that you own I
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.580
problem I just realized that you own I
know exactly the problem is they even

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
know exactly the problem is they even
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.630
know exactly the problem is they even
though you got this kind of quite fun

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
though you got this kind of quite fun
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.969
though you got this kind of quite fun
little guy you can never get him to sit

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
little guy you can never get him to sit
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.640
little guy you can never get him to sit
flat on the desk you can never quite get

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
flat on the desk you can never quite get
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.609
flat on the desk you can never quite get
him to like lay perfectly flat

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619
him to like lay perfectly flat
 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.140
him to like lay perfectly flat
especially not without really you know

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
especially not without really you know
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.300
especially not without really you know
deforming the orange bill and there's a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
deforming the orange bill and there's a
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340
deforming the orange bill and there's a
reason for that and the reason is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
reason for that and the reason is
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.730
reason for that and the reason is
something called the Gaussian curvature

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740
something called the Gaussian curvature
 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.859
something called the Gaussian curvature
now Gaussian curvature is a number that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
now Gaussian curvature is a number that
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990
now Gaussian curvature is a number that
describes how curvier surface is and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
describes how curvier surface is and
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270
describes how curvier surface is and
it's made up of two things multiplied

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
it's made up of two things multiplied
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670
it's made up of two things multiplied
together one is how the surface curves

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
together one is how the surface curves
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889
together one is how the surface curves
in one direction and the second number

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
in one direction and the second number
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510
in one direction and the second number
is how it curves in the perpendicular

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
is how it curves in the perpendicular
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.100
is how it curves in the perpendicular
direction you multiply those two

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
direction you multiply those two
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.539
direction you multiply those two
together to get the Gaussian curvature

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
together to get the Gaussian curvature
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.870
together to get the Gaussian curvature
no matter how you'd bend a surface the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
no matter how you'd bend a surface the
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.030
no matter how you'd bend a surface the
Gaussian curvature will always stay the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
Gaussian curvature will always stay the
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980
Gaussian curvature will always stay the
same so here with an orange it's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
same so here with an orange it's
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.929
same so here with an orange it's
positive in that direction positive in

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
positive in that direction positive in
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.359
positive in that direction positive in
that direction but so whatever you do to

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
that direction but so whatever you do to
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.459
that direction but so whatever you do to
the surface of an orange it always has

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
the surface of an orange it always has
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.600
the surface of an orange it always has
to have some kind of a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
to have some kind of a
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.120
to have some kind of a
and away from you you actually want your

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130
and away from you you actually want your
 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.980
and away from you you actually want your
orange man to lie flat on a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
orange man to lie flat on a
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.990
orange man to lie flat on a
two-dimensional surface which has zero

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
two-dimensional surface which has zero
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.480
two-dimensional surface which has zero
Gaussian curvature there's no way that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490
Gaussian curvature there's no way that
 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.730
Gaussian curvature there's no way that
two positive numbers can ever multiply

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740
two positive numbers can ever multiply
 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.200
two positive numbers can ever multiply
together to make zero and that doesn't

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210
together to make zero and that doesn't
 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.400
together to make zero and that doesn't
really matter so much when you're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410
really matter so much when you're
 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.830
really matter so much when you're
talking about orange peels or the orange

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
talking about orange peels or the orange
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.470
talking about orange peels or the orange
men but it does matter when you really

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480
men but it does matter when you really
 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.110
men but it does matter when you really
want to make the surface of a sphere lie

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
want to make the surface of a sphere lie
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.830
want to make the surface of a sphere lie
flat on a two-dimensional surface like

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840
flat on a two-dimensional surface like
 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.500
flat on a two-dimensional surface like
when you're trying to make a map of that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510
when you're trying to make a map of that
 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.120
when you're trying to make a map of that
oh ok so one option that you've got if

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130
oh ok so one option that you've got if
 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.340
oh ok so one option that you've got if
you wanted to effectively peel the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350
you wanted to effectively peel the
 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.220
you wanted to effectively peel the
surface of the earth to make a map is to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
surface of the earth to make a map is to
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.970
surface of the earth to make a map is to
cut up all sorts of slits like this

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980
cut up all sorts of slits like this
 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.920
cut up all sorts of slits like this
unfurl them kind of like this and then

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
unfurl them kind of like this and then
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.320
unfurl them kind of like this and then
squish it as literal as possible so I am

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330
squish it as literal as possible so I am
 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.390
squish it as literal as possible so I am
still you will end up with these kind of

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400
still you will end up with these kind of
 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.420
still you will end up with these kind of
deformations the skin deforming as you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430
deformations the skin deforming as you
 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.400
deformations the skin deforming as you
squish it down especially at the ends

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410
squish it down especially at the ends
 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.479
squish it down especially at the ends
they're not really gonna match together

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489
they're not really gonna match together
 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.170
they're not really gonna match together
very well

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180
very well
 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.050
very well
but you've kind of got a sort of flat

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
but you've kind of got a sort of flat
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.630
but you've kind of got a sort of flat
shape that came from the surface of your

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640
shape that came from the surface of your
 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640
shape that came from the surface of your
sphere and that really is the idea

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
sphere and that really is the idea
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.690
sphere and that really is the idea
behind dude Hummel sign projection which

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700
behind dude Hummel sign projection which
 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.670
behind dude Hummel sign projection which
sometimes gets nicknamed the orange peel

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680
sometimes gets nicknamed the orange peel
 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.890
sometimes gets nicknamed the orange peel
projection and kind of see why it does a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
projection and kind of see why it does a
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.509
projection and kind of see why it does a
good job it's certainly flat but you

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519
good job it's certainly flat but you
 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.150
good job it's certainly flat but you
have to squish quite a lot of this to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160
have to squish quite a lot of this to
 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.039
have to squish quite a lot of this to
get it into the right place so this map

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049
get it into the right place so this map
 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.270
get it into the right place so this map
here doesn't preserve Direction very

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280
here doesn't preserve Direction very
 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.220
here doesn't preserve Direction very
well and also it's not going to be

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230
well and also it's not going to be
 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.050
well and also it's not going to be
particularly useful for navigating I

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
particularly useful for navigating I
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.400
particularly useful for navigating I
mean you're kind of coming off here and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410
mean you're kind of coming off here and
 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.140
mean you're kind of coming off here and
there's a massive gap it's just not very

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150
there's a massive gap it's just not very
 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.970
there's a massive gap it's just not very
nice not particularly nice so this is a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980
nice not particularly nice so this is a
 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.400
nice not particularly nice so this is a
very squished at the top so if you kind

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410
very squished at the top so if you kind
 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.850
very squished at the top so if you kind
of look at the top here the shape of the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860
of look at the top here the shape of the
 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.520
of look at the top here the shape of the
of the land of the coast doesn't quite

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530
of the land of the coast doesn't quite
 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.830
of the land of the coast doesn't quite
match the shape that you get up here but

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840
match the shape that you get up here but
 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.830
match the shape that you get up here but
also actually if you sort of imagine

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840
also actually if you sort of imagine
 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.960

folding this round into three dimensions

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970
folding this round into three dimensions
 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.250
folding this round into three dimensions
and stitching it back together you

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260
and stitching it back together you
 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.199
and stitching it back together you
wouldn't get a spherical shape so you

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209
wouldn't get a spherical shape so you
 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.699
wouldn't get a spherical shape so you
can kind of see how things have been

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709
can kind of see how things have been
 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.590
can kind of see how things have been

the problem of transforming the surface

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500
the problem of transforming the surface
 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.069
the problem of transforming the surface
of a sphere into a flat two-dimensional

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079
of a sphere into a flat two-dimensional
 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.349

okay well around the equator these
squares have last shoes and longitude

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320
squares have last shoes and longitude
 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.270

you want to try and keep that so when

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050
you want to try and keep that so when
 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.110
you want to try and keep that so when
you go up the top maybe you say okay

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120
you go up the top maybe you say okay
 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.780
you go up the top maybe you say okay
well why don't we deform these areas so

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790
well why don't we deform these areas so
 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.670
well why don't we deform these areas so
that they're always nice neat rectangle

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680
that they're always nice neat rectangle
 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.320
that they're always nice neat rectangle
or by the time it gets to these paper

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
or by the time it gets to these paper
 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.260
or by the time it gets to these paper
for that you end up with something that

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270
for that you end up with something that
 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.159
for that you end up with something that
looks like the equirectangular

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169
looks like the equirectangular
 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.220
looks like the equirectangular
projection here which is certainly the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230
projection here which is certainly the
 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.340
projection here which is certainly the
world and it's you know successfully on

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350
world and it's you know successfully on
 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.440
world and it's you know successfully on
two dimensions but the problem with this

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450
two dimensions but the problem with this
 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.690
two dimensions but the problem with this
one is that direction goes all over the

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700
one is that direction goes all over the
 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.340
one is that direction goes all over the
place here so if you take one of the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350
place here so if you take one of the
 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.570
place here so if you take one of the
ones near the North Pole

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580
ones near the North Pole
 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.850
ones near the North Pole
this line here is actually really tiny

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860
this line here is actually really tiny
 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.340
this line here is actually really tiny
when it is on the globe so if you want

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350
when it is on the globe so if you want
 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.380
when it is on the globe so if you want
to get from one corner of this to the

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390
to get from one corner of this to the
 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.180
to get from one corner of this to the
other you'd end up going in like this

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190
other you'd end up going in like this
 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.040
other you'd end up going in like this
very weird part it's not very good for

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050
very weird part it's not very good for
 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.060
very weird part it's not very good for
navigation so that leads to the map that

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070
navigation so that leads to the map that
 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.880
navigation so that leads to the map that
probably most of us know which is made

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890
probably most of us know which is made
 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.980
probably most of us know which is made
by in Spain it's taken a big sheet of

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990
by in Spain it's taken a big sheet of
 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.080
by in Spain it's taken a big sheet of
paper and forming a cylinder around your

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090
paper and forming a cylinder around your
 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.880
paper and forming a cylinder around your
globe you know you can imagine that

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890
globe you know you can imagine that
 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.590
globe you know you can imagine that
you've got a light on the inside of this

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600
you've got a light on the inside of this
 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.690
you've got a light on the inside of this
globe and that's right in the center and

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700
globe and that's right in the center and
 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.810
globe and that's right in the center and
shining outwards and then if you trace a

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820
shining outwards and then if you trace a
 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.850
shining outwards and then if you trace a
shadow of the land on the paper as it

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
shadow of the land on the paper as it
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.980
shadow of the land on the paper as it
was wrapped in a cylinder around you

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990
was wrapped in a cylinder around you
 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.490
was wrapped in a cylinder around you
would end up with the Mercator

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500
would end up with the Mercator
 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.230
would end up with the Mercator
projection this is what Google Maps uses

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240
projection this is what Google Maps uses
 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.810
projection this is what Google Maps uses
and it does a really good job especially

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820
and it does a really good job especially
 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.460
and it does a really good job especially
keeping the shape of the countries quite

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470
keeping the shape of the countries quite
 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.529
keeping the shape of the countries quite
nicely and also in preserving direction

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539
nicely and also in preserving direction
 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.990
nicely and also in preserving direction
so this is really good for navigation if

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000
so this is really good for navigation if
 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.060
so this is really good for navigation if
you want to get from London to Brazil

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070
you want to get from London to Brazil
 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.190
you want to get from London to Brazil
you can just head in a straight line it

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200
you can just head in a straight line it
 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.390
you can just head in a straight line it
might not be the shortest way to get

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400
might not be the shortest way to get
 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.040
might not be the shortest way to get
there but you know you're gonna get

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050
there but you know you're gonna get
 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.600
there but you know you're gonna get
there so that's kind of why the Mercator

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610
there so that's kind of why the Mercator
 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.050
there so that's kind of why the Mercator
map projection is point and handy the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060
map projection is point and handy the
 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.540
map projection is point and handy the
only problem about Mercator because

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550
only problem about Mercator because
 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.430
only problem about Mercator because
you're using a cylinder things are going

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440
you're using a cylinder things are going
 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.430
you're using a cylinder things are going
to be distorted at the poles much more

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440
to be distorted at the poles much more
 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.170
to be distorted at the poles much more
than they're distorted at the equator

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180
than they're distorted at the equator
 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.440
than they're distorted at the equator
and as a result the area of different

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450
and as a result the area of different
 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.930
and as a result the area of different
land masses ends up being completely

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940
land masses ends up being completely
 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.070
land masses ends up being completely
completely mucked out completely skewed

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080
completely mucked out completely skewed
 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.779
completely mucked out completely skewed
so if you look on the Mercator map

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789
so if you look on the Mercator map
 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.730
so if you look on the Mercator map
Greenland and Africa look roughly the

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740
Greenland and Africa look roughly the
 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.670
Greenland and Africa look roughly the
same size but when you look on the globe

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680
same size but when you look on the globe
 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.150
same size but when you look on the globe
Africa is absolutely bloody massive and

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160
Africa is absolutely bloody massive and

integrals and essentially in this paper
 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.790
