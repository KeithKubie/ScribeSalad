1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.391
All right.

2
00:00:01.391 --> 00:00:06.391
So let me start again by am I hitting you

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.530
what it is that was done last time?
So if you say,
you know,

4
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.140
can you summarize for me in a few words,
man ideas?
So I would like to do that.

5
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.700
<v 0>So what I did last time was to show you how to handle Morrison in more than one</v>

7
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:37.720
dimension.
And I picked for it,
uh,
to that.

8
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:41.470
Madison says the standard way to explain it.
Okay?
By the way,

9
00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:45.100
I would like to make one recommendation if you guys have coming in a little
late,

10
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.080
uh,
don't worry about submitting.

11
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:50.590
The homework does come in and settle down because it's very hard to lecture with

12
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.730
this.
I wonder if traffic,
I do try to start a few minutes late,

13
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.350
but I also have to finish a few minutes early so you can go the next class.

14
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.080
And also people who come in early,
maybe you should try to settle,

15
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.150
sit in the middle part of the classroom so they're late.

16
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:09.460
Comers can come in without too much disruption.
All right,

17
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:13.660
so somebody of last time,
if you live in two dimensions or more,

18
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.690
you gotta use vectors to describe most things.

19
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.720
So the vector was typical vectors called V or arb,
something with an Arrow on it.

20
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.590
Most important vector is position vector that tells you where the object is.

21
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.990
It's got
competence,
which are x and y.

22
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.160
That could vary with time.

23
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.230
I and J are unit vectors in the x and y directions and you can deal with the

24
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:45.280
vector in one of two ways.

25
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:48.190
You can either think of it as an Arrow and imagine the Arrow are,

26
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.900
you can reduce it to a pair of numbers x and y.
If you want to add two vectors,

27
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.020
you can add the arrows by the rule I gave you are just add the components of x.

28
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.070
Oh the two guys to get the component of the summit.
Likewise for the y

29
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.440
I mentioned something of importance of increasing importance.

30
00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:12.790
The only later which is that you are free to pick another set of axes,

31
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.110
not in the traditional x and y direction,
but it's all bleak direction.

32
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.460
If you do you unit vectors are call I prime and j prime,
the components,

33
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.190
the back of the chains.
You can imagine that if affected is viewed from an angle,

34
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.200
then it's competent will vary with the perspective so the competence of the

35
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:36.760
vector are not invading and characterizations of the vector betters directed

36
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.350
herself has a life of its own.

37
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.020
The components coming in the minute you pick your axes,

38
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.090
so it's not enough to say these are the competence of the vector.

39
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:43.924
You got to tell me.

40
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.650
I am working with I and j which are defined in the following manner.

41
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.790
I gave you a law of transformation of the components,

42
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.590
name leave the back that as components x and a y in one reference frame and x

43
00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:59.020
prime and Aya prime.
Another reference frame.
How were the two?

44
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.450
They come from writing I prime and j prime in terms of I and j.

45
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.451
Then sticking it into the expression and identifying the new representation

46
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.240
somehow.
Then I told you to invert the transformation.

47
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:14.590
Some of you have some difficulty.

48
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.390
Maybe you didn't realize that they are just simultaneous equations that you

49
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.040
solve.
Normally.
If I tell you three x plus four away,

50
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.080
six and nine x plus six wires,
14 you know how to solve it.

51
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.150
It's like really the same kind of problem except that the three and four would

52
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.130
all be placed by signed fi and co signed fine,

53
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.580
but they're just some numbers and you eliminate them the same way you eliminate

54
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:40.330
them.
But I've given you a homework problem where you can,
uh,

55
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.260
you can try your skills.
So when you go today and look at the homework,

56
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.750
you'll find that besides problems from the textbook,

57
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.450
one extra problem that deals with all of this.

58
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.120
Then I gave you one other

59
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.360
very important example of a particle moving in the x way plan.
Excellent.

60
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:01.360
Why couldn't be whatever you like,
but I picked a very special example,

61
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.070
but it looked like this.

62
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.030
Our Times cost sine Omega t times I was art times sine Omega t.

63
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.430
Now you should go back and remember what we did.

64
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:18.400
If it took you a while to digest it,
I asked you to think harder.

65
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.280
This describe a particle that's going around in a circle.

66
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.060
We know it's going around in a circle because if I find the length of this

67
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.740
vector,
which is the x squared part was a white square part,

68
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.940
I just get our square at all times because science squared plus cosine squared

69
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.810
is one,
so we know it's moving on a circle of radius art for the Lord.

70
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.030
As time increases the angle

71
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.700
or Manga te is increasing in this fashion and Omega is called the angular

72
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:53.200
velocity and I related it to the time period,

73
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.590
which is the time it takes to go around the full circle by saying once you've

74
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.040
done a full circle,
Omega t better B two Pi.

75
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.580
So this new quantity Omega which may be new to you is related to the time period

76
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.360
which for whichever an intuitive feeling,

77
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.270
how long does it take to go one round in this fashion,

78
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.950
you're also free to write it in terms of the frequency,

79
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.500
the time period and frequency are reciprocals.

80
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.010
If it takes you one 60th of a second to go around once,

81
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.970
then you do it 60 times a second.
So Omega,

82
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.050
it's really very simple.
Quantity is related.

83
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.870
The frequency with which you go around the circle,
but it's multiplied by two Pi.

84
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.783
Why is that?

85
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.920
Frequency is how many times you go around and two Pi is the rate at which the

86
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:40.750
angle is being changed,

87
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.910
but if every revolution is where the two Pi Radians than two pie F is a number

88
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:47.020
of Radians per second,

89
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.630
so efforts revolutions per second and two Pi Radians per second and it's called

90
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:53.620
the angle of velocity.

91
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.000
The most important results from last time was that if you took this are and you

92
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.840
took two databases of this,
defined the acceleration

93
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.570
due to auto over d d square,
try to do this in your head.

94
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.790
If you took the two databases of this guy,

95
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.070
first time will become minus Omega Sine Omega t second time will become minus

96
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:18.050
Omega Square Casa,
Omega t,

97
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.000
otherwise it'll become minus Omegas squared times itself.
Same thing here.

98
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.100
The final result is the acceleration is minus Omega squared times the position.

99
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.950
That means the acceleration is pointing towards the center of the circle and it

100
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:37.640
has a magnitude a.
When I draw something without an Arrow,

101
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:40.850
I'm talking about the magnitude.
It just Omega squared r

102
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.350
<v 1>yeah,</v>

103
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.710
<v 0>but I had shown you yesterday did the velocity and I'm sorry,</v>

104
00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:50.430
the speed of the particle as it goes around the circle is this.

105
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.330
Again,
you should make sure you know how to drive this.

106
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.630
You can do it anyway you like.
You can take one full circle.

107
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.410
It realized the distance traveled is to PR divided by the time and you will get

108
00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:04.830
this either way.
Take the deliver to have this,

109
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.210
get the velocity vector and you notice this magnitude is a constant and a

110
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:10.530
constant we'll be omega are

111
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.230
so whichever way you do it,

112
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.970
you can then rewrite this as the v squared over r.

113
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.860
This is called the centripetal acceleration.

114
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.530
This is the acceleration directed toward the center and I told you this is very

115
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:33.400
important results.

116
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.540
Got To get this in your head and nobody to see a particle moving in a circle.

117
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.520
Even if it's the constant speed,

118
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.380
it has an Acceleration v squared over r directed towards the center.

119
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.510
This formula doesn't tell you which way it's pointing because it's a scalar is

120
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.960
not effected equation.
If you want to write it as a vector equation,

121
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.690
you want to write it as v squared over r minus?

122
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.433
Uh,

123
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.000
<v 1>yeah.</v>

124
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
<v 0>I want to say that it's pointing in the bad action toward the center.</v>

125
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.640
So sometimes what we do is we introduced a little vector here called e sub are,

126
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.820
I'll tell you more about it later is a bar is a vector at each point of length,

127
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:25.340
one pointing radially away from the center.

128
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.420
It's like the unit vector I unit directed.

129
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:32.920
I points away from the audit in the aesthetician j points every from the ideas

130
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:36.920
and the way the election er is not a fixed vector at each point.

131
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.140
E artists,
a different vector pointing in the radial direction of length.
One.

132
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.540
The advantage of introducing that guy is that if you like,
I can now write

133
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.590
any equation for the acceleration acid vector.

134
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.770
The magnitude is obese squared over r the Derek and his negative er.

135
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.320
So e r e s a Bot is a new entity I've introduced for convenience plays a big

136
00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:06.080
role in gravitation in the coolest interaction.

137
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.090
Good to have a vector pointing the radial direction of length one.

138
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.300
That's what it is.
That's really the heart of what I did last time.

139
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.100
Then we did some projectile problems.

140
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.000
You know you should something you should know Bennett will land where it will

141
00:09:20.001 --> 00:09:22.640
land with what speed it will land,
how high it will go.

142
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.630
I assume that those problems are not that difficult and I've given you a lot of

143
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:27.464
practice.

144
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.560
So now I'm going to move to the really important and central topic.

145
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.650
I guess you can guess what that is,
right?

146
00:09:38.651 --> 00:09:43.270
We are going to talk about Newton's laws.
This is a big day in your life,

147
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.600
okay?
Because this is when you learned the laws symptoms,
so,

148
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:51.340
but you can understand and explain a larger number of phenomenon.
In fact,

149
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.030
till we do electricity and magnetism next semester,

150
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.840
everything's going to be based on just the loss of Newton.

151
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.780
It's really amazing that somebody could condense that much information into a

152
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:08.470
few,
namely three different laws that barred to be going to talk about.

153
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.330
So let's start.
So know your reaction may be that you know,

154
00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:15.700
you've seen Newton's laws,
you've applied them in school.

155
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.350
I got to tell you that a idealized fairly late in life,

156
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.690
that more subtle than I imagined the first time.

157
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.770
It's one thing to plug in all the numbers and say I know the Newton's laws and I

158
00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:29.170
ain't know how they work.
But uh,

159
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.020
as you get older and you're a lot of spare time,

160
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:33.370
you think about what you're doing,

161
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.810
which is something I have the luxury of doing right now.

162
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:37.420
I mean I realize this is more tricky.

163
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.980
I want to share some of that with you so you can fast forward and get the

164
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.380
understanding took me much longer to get,

165
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.440
that's what I'm going to emphasize more than just plugging in the numbers.

166
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.360
Of course we have to also know how to plug in the numbers so we can pass all the

167
00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:52.661
tests.

168
00:10:52.661 --> 00:10:57.430
But it's good to understand the nature of the edifice that are set up by Newton.

169
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.930
So first statement by Newton,
I don't feel like writing it down.

170
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.710
It's too long and everybody knows what the law is.

171
00:11:05.711 --> 00:11:10.570
It's called the law of inertia.
Let me just say it and talk about it.

172
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.290
Finish it says that if you,

173
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.000
if a body has no forces acting on it,
then

174
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.960
it will remain at rest.
If it was addressed to begin with art,

175
00:11:25.961 --> 00:11:29.860
if it had a velocity to begin with,
it'll maintain that velocity.

176
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.970
So one way to say this,

177
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.980
everybody will continue to remain in a state of rest or uniform motion in a

178
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:39.670
straight line.

179
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.380
That's another way of saying maintain velocity if it's not acted upon by a
force.

180
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.110
Now what makes the loss of pricing is that if I only gave you half the law,

181
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:56.380
namely everybody will remain at rest.
If it's not acted upon by a force,

182
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.050
you will say,
that's fine.
I accept that because here's something.

183
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.900
You leave it there.
It doesn't move.
It's not a big surprise.

184
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.690
People who are used to that from the time of Aristotle.

185
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.100
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

186
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.900
<v 0>but at a startle used to think that if you want something to move that has to be</v>

187
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:14.770
some agency making good move.
That agency,
you could call it force.

188
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.550
The great discovery that Galileo and Newton made is that you don't need a force

189
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.110
for the body to move at a constant velocity.

190
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.720
<v 1>That</v>

191
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.390
<v 0>it's very clear you don't need a force.</v>

192
00:12:27.391 --> 00:12:29.940
If something is doing nothing sitting there,

193
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.270
the fact that you don't need a force for it to move forever,

194
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.430
are they given speed in a given direction?

195
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.840
That's not obvious because in daily life you don't see that daily life,

196
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.480
everything seems to come to rest unless you push it out or you pull it,

197
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:43.920
that you exert some kind of force.

198
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.060
But we all know that the reason things come to haul when you push them a steady

199
00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:54.450
eventually some friction or drag or something that's bringing them to rest and

200
00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:59.130
somehow if you could manufacture it really smooth,
frictionless surface,

201
00:12:59.131 --> 00:13:02.670
that if you took a hockey puck or something and an adequate and to give it a

202
00:13:02.671 --> 00:13:06.420
push in on some idealized world,
it'll travel forever.

203
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.280
So it's hard to realize that in the terrorist you'll situation.

204
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:16.450
But Galilee already managed to find examples where things would roll on for the

205
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:19.720
video very long time.
But nowadays if you go to outer space,

206
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.180
you can check for yourself that if you throw something out,

207
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.030
it just goes on forever without your intervention.

208
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.810
That is the nature of things to go at a constant velocity.

209
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.250
They don't need your help to do that.

210
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.883
<v 1>Now</v>

211
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.300
<v 0>you have to be careful that this first law of Newton is not valid for everybody.</v>

212
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.051
In fact,

213
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:46.130
I'll give you an example in your own life value to find that this law doesn't

214
00:13:46.131 --> 00:13:48.470
work.
So here's the situation.

215
00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:53.471
You go on an airplane and then after the usual delays plain begins to accelerate

216
00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.860
down the runway.
I that instant,

217
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.310
if you leave anything on the floor,
you know it's no longer yours,

218
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:05.250
it's going to slide down and the guy in the last row is going to collect

219
00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:08.220
everything,
right?
Why is that?

220
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.260
Because we find in that plane,

221
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.320
when objects are left at what we think is addressed with no external agency

222
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:16.704
acting on them,

223
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.730
they on slide backwards stewards that we had ended the plane that happens during

224
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.860
takeoff.
That doesn't happen in flight,

225
00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:27.861
but it happens during takeoff so that there's an example of a person for whom

226
00:14:28.111 --> 00:14:29.760
the life inertia does not work.

227
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.070
So this is something you guys may not have realized [inaudible] lost at.

228
00:14:34.071 --> 00:14:38.720
Not for everybody.
You have to be what's called an inertial observer.

229
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.400
If you had an inertial observer,

230
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.430
then in your system of reference objects left at rest will remain addressed.

231
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.250
The plan that's ready to take off or is taking off is not such a system.

232
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.450
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

233
00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.820
<v 0>the earth seems to be a pretty good inertial system because on the ground you</v>

234
00:14:57.821 --> 00:14:59.170
leave something,
it stays there.

235
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.903
<v 1>Okay.</v>

236
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.170
<v 0>Depends on what you leave.</v>

237
00:15:04.171 --> 00:15:06.570
You leave your iPod is not going to stay there for very long,

238
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.370
but then you can trace it to some external forces which are carrying your iPod.

239
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.470
But if you don't do anything,
things stay.
So here is the main point.

240
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.870
The point of Newton is two things in the life inertia,

241
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.940
which one may think is trivial.
First three velocity.

242
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.410
Constant velocity can be obtained for free without doing anything and there are

243
00:15:28.411 --> 00:15:32.670
people for whom this is true.
For example,
in outer space,
if you're an astronaut,

244
00:15:32.671 --> 00:15:37.210
you send something,
you will find it goes on forever.
Here's another thing.

245
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.920
If you find one inertial observer,
namely one person put home,

246
00:15:41.921 --> 00:15:43.210
there's life in our show works.

247
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.950
I can manufacture for you an infinite number of other people for whom this is

248
00:15:47.951 --> 00:15:52.390
true.
Who are these other people?
Do you know what I'm talking about?

249
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.060
If I give you one observable for whom the life energy is true,

250
00:15:57.061 --> 00:16:00.420
I say that others put home is also true.

251
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.733
Yes.

252
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.780
Did he hear that?
Let me repeat that.
First of all,
if the life in there,

253
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.870
she has a valid,
for me,

254
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.090
it's valid for other people in the same room at rest with respect to me because

255
00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:21.120
if I think is not moving,
you would think it's not moving.
That's just fine,

256
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.460
but suppose you are in a train and you're moving past me and you look at this

257
00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:30.060
piece of chalk.
Of course everything in my room is going backwards for you,

258
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.280
but things which were addressed,

259
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.390
we'll move at a constant velocity opposite of the velocity that you have

260
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.350
relative to me.
So you will find that objects,

261
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.470
which are a constant initial velocity maintained the velocity.

262
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.610
So if I'm an initial observer,

263
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.680
another person moving relative to me at constant velocity will also be an

264
00:16:53.681 --> 00:16:56.320
international observers.
Why?

265
00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.450
Because any velocity I ascribe to a party to an to a particular object,

266
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.380
you will add a certain constant to it by the law of compensation of velocities,

267
00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:06.820
right?
All velocities,
IC,

268
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.150
you will have a certain number to get the velocities according to you,

269
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.670
but adding a constant velocity to objects does not change the fact that those

270
00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:19.950
which would maintaining constant velocity still maintain a constant velocity is

271
00:17:19.951 --> 00:17:24.280
the different constant velocity and particular things that I see at at rest,

272
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.240
you will say,
or moving backwards at the velocity that you had a little,
to me,

273
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.760
things that I say are going at 50 miles per hour.

274
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.680
You may see that going at 80 but 50 is a constant and ab,
it's a constant.

275
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.703
Therefore,

276
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.110
it's not that there's only one fortunate family of inertial observers.

277
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.370
There's infinite number of them,

278
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.700
but they're all moving relative to each other at constant velocity.

279
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.590
So if the earth is the initial frame of if you go in a drain,

280
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.010
it lets you be at a constant velocity.
You're also initial,

281
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.790
but if you go on a plane with this accelerating no longer than Russia.

282
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.690
That's the main point.
But the point is that our inertial frame,

283
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.720
so reference now you must know the earth is not precisely inertial good.

284
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:11.580
The Earth has an acceleration.

285
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.160
So maybe can you tell me why?
I'm sure the earth has an acceleration.

286
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.400
Yes,
it's going around the sun.

287
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:30.110
Let's imagine it's a circular orbit that we've just shown here is an accelerated

288
00:18:30.111 --> 00:18:30.890
frame of reference.

289
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.890
It just turns out that if you put the v squared and you put the Ar you artist 93

290
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.920
million miles,
you will find that acceleration is small enough for us to ignore,

291
00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:43.130
but there are effects of the Er's acceleration which we'll demonstrate.

292
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.210
The Foucault Pendulum is one example where you can see that the earth is

293
00:18:47.211 --> 00:18:51.320
rotating around its own axis and the fact that earth is going around the sun,

294
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:55.490
all of them mean it's really an odd inertia,
but it's approximately initially.

295
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.810
But if you go out the space nowadays it you can find truly inertial frames of

296
00:18:59.811 --> 00:19:03.680
reference.
Okay,
so that's the first law.

297
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.980
First life you want.
If you want to say,
okay,

298
00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:11.750
what's a summary of all of this summary is that constant velocity doesn't

299
00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:16.660
require anything.
No.
The reason things don't have gone it,

300
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.870
it looks like a totality because you look around,

301
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.780
nothing seems to have its velocity.
If whatever,
then you say,
oh,

302
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:23.430
that's because there's a force acting on it.

303
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.930
It looked like a totality because you're never able to show me something that

304
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:28.620
moves forever.

305
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.290
A constant velocity because every time you don't find such a thing,

306
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.660
I give an excuse.
Emily forces acting,

307
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.580
but it's not a big con because you can set up experiments in free space,

308
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:42.630
far from everything where objects will in fact maintain the velocity forever.

309
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.760
That's a possibility and it's a useful concept on the earth because earth is

310
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:51.990
approximately inertia.
Okay,
now you come.

311
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.820
The second law of course,

312
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:57.690
which is the law is the law that we all memorize and learn.

313
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.520
And it says that if a body has an acceleration,
then you need a force.

314
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.430
And the relation of the forest acceleration is this thing.

315
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.630
No,
I have to say a few words about units.
Uh,

316
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.890
acceleration doesn't measure.
I in meters per second.

317
00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:19.220
Square mass is measured in kilograms.

318
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.730
So the way to measure it forces in kilogram meters per second square.

319
00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:25.370
But we get tired of saying that long expression.

320
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:30.440
So we're going to call that a Newton,
right?
Okay.
Jude invented it.

321
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.550
We'd call it whatever your name is,
but this is the guy who invented it.

322
00:20:34.551 --> 00:20:38.030
So it's called a Newton,
usually denoted by a capital n.

323
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.490
So a typical problem that you may have done,
you know,

324
00:20:43.491 --> 00:20:45.140
in your first pass at Newton's law,

325
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.080
someone tells you a force of 36 newtons is acting on a mass of whatever,

326
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.540
four kilograms worth the accident ration.

327
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.910
You divide and you find there's nine and you say,
okay,

328
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:58.960
I know what to do with Newton's laws.
That's what I want to tell you,

329
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:00.850
that it's actually more complicated than that.

330
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.330
Let's really look at this equation.

331
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.730
Take yourself back to 1600 whatever went over.
Newton was inventing this loss,

332
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:13.840
so you don't any of these laws,
you have an intuitive definition of force.

333
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.350
You sort of know what forces,
right?
Somebody pushes you or pulls you.

334
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.630
That's the force and suddenly you're told,

335
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.600
here is a law.
Aren't you better off in any way?

336
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.730
Can you do anything with this lie is what I'm asking you?

337
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:30.550
What can you do with this law?
I give you a Newton's lie and say,
good luck.

338
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.150
What will you do?
What does it help you predict?

339
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.490
You can even tell if it's true.
Here's the body that's moving,
right?

340
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.180
I want you to tell me yes,
Newton,
right?

341
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.870
How are you going to check that early?

342
00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:48.190
Wanted to measure the left hand side and you want to measure that right hand

343
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:50.680
side and very equal.
Maybe you will say the lies working.

344
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.120
So what can you measure in this equation?

345
00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.173
<v 2>Pardon me?</v>

346
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.050
<v 0>All right,
so let's start with acceleration.
What's your plan?</v>

347
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.980
What measuring acceleration?
If some little thing is moving,
how do you play?

348
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.090
What do you need to measure it?

349
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:11.883
<v 2>Jeez.</v>

350
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.400
<v 0>Right?
But what instruments will you need to measure it?</v>

351
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.240
You are supposed to really measure it.
What will you ask me for

352
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.780
a watch?
Yes.
And what else?

353
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.270
A ruler.
Okay.
Audit.
That's right.

354
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:36.160
I'm you don't mean Queen Elizabeth,
right?
You mean some long.
Very good.

355
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.410
Okay.
So what you really want,
a ruler may not be enough,
but maybe it's enough.

356
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.990
So here's the long ruler and here's this thing moving,
right?

357
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.710
And you asked what a Rolex.

358
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:50.170
So here's your watch stealing time.

359
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.340
Tell me exactly what you want to do to measure acceleration.

360
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.203
What do you have to do?

361
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.410
I want to acceleration now what will you measure?

362
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.540
Okay,
you go ahead.
Okay,
you can try

363
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.560
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

364
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.040
<v 0>eight Ben.
I'd be at rest to begin with.
It's,
it's doing its thing.</v>

365
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.170
It's going at some speed.
Yes.

366
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.833
<v 2>Okay.</v>

367
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.850
<v 0>That'll give you the velocity.</v>

368
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:34.000
<v 2>Well,
did you do like distance after one sec?</v>

369
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.220
<v 0>Good.
So in principle,
let me repeat what he said.
He said first let it go.</v>

370
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.490
Let distance take the distance time.
That gives us a velocity.

371
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:50.180
Now let it go a little more.
That gives us the velocity later.

372
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.410
Take the difference of the two velocities divided by the difference of the two

373
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:56.510
times and you got the acceleration.

374
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.060
Of course you have allowed it to move with a finite distance and a finite time.

375
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:06.710
So what you should imagine doing is making these three measurements more than

376
00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:10.760
more quickly,
right?
Do you need three position regimens now,

377
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.600
a little later and a little later later because between the first and second you

378
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:18.820
get a velocity second,
third to get another velocity there.

379
00:24:18.821 --> 00:24:23.120
Difference divided by the difference in times is going to be the acceleration.

380
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.070
But if you imagine making these measurements more and more and more quickly,

381
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:32.810
in the end you can measure what you can say is the acceleration.
No,

382
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.590
that's the meaning of the limit.
And Calculus.

383
00:24:35.591 --> 00:24:37.490
You take belt bags and you take Delta t.

384
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.340
What's the meaning of Delta x and Delta t going to zero?

385
00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:44.810
It means measured them as quickly as you can.
So in real well,

386
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:46.670
no one's going to measure it instantaneously,

387
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.910
but we can make the difference as small as we like it mathematically,

388
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.990
we can make it zero soon.
That limit,
we can measure velocity right now.

389
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.690
That means we can also measure the velocity slightly later and make the slightly

390
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:03.860
later come as close to right now as we want and then that ratio will give you

391
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:08.450
acceleration.
Acceleration is the easiest thing to measure.

392
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:09.680
Obesity quantities.

393
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.490
We all have a good intuitive feeling for what acceleration is.

394
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.510
So you want to test if what Newton told you is right,

395
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.690
you will see an object in motion.
You find a,

396
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:24.800
and you've given a certain numerical value,
10 meters per second square,

397
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.270
but that's not your testing the equation because you got to find both sites.

398
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.790
So what about the mass?
What's the mass of this object?

399
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:40.420
Anybody want to try from this section here?
Yes.

400
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.133
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

401
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.070
<v 0>Okay.
His idea was following a,</v>

402
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.790
you take a standard mass and you maybe go to a seesaw,

403
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:06.440
right?
You put the standard mass here and you put some other fellow,

404
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:09.710
the mass you're looking at there and you are just the lengths and when it

405
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:14.280
balanced,
as you can sort of tell what this masters right,
what's up,

406
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.840
what you at an outer space,
there's no gravity.

407
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.540
Then the CSO will balance.

408
00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:23.330
Even if you put a potato on one side and the elephant on the other side,

409
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:28.331
you cannot tell the mass because what you are doing now is appealing to the

410
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:32.300
notion of mass as something that's related to the pull of the earth on the

411
00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:34.070
object.
But Newton's laws,
you see,

412
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.130
you've got to go back and whiteboard everything.
You know,

413
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.720
if this is what you have,

414
00:26:38.721 --> 00:26:42.680
there is no mention of the earth and these equations and yet the notion of

415
00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:43.530
masses defined.

416
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:48.450
It's not talking about the gravitational pull of the earth on an object.
Yes.

417
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.980
Uh,
but do you know what the force on the body is?

418
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.260
We don't have to measure that either.
You agree?
We don't know what the forces,

419
00:27:08.261 --> 00:27:10.810
because we are hoping to save forces is going to be an time save.

420
00:27:10.811 --> 00:27:12.080
We just getting it on to measuring.

421
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.510
So it looks like a circular definition right now.
Yes,

422
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.383
<v 2>yes.</v>

423
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.100
<v 0>Uh,
but density is mass over volume,
but we don't know the mass.</v>

424
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.523
Right.

425
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.720
<v 2>Great.
Do you do that then?</v>

426
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.820
<v 0>How about,
do you go ahead.</v>

427
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.160
How is anyone going to give you the density of anything?

428
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.410
We're just asking what's the massive,

429
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.490
any optics we have not yet found a satisfactory answer to watch the mass up and

430
00:27:41.491 --> 00:27:42.990
object.
Yes.

431
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.450
<v 2>Are we still operating in that space?</v>

432
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.170
<v 0>Yes.
This cannot depend on the planet earth.</v>

433
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.210
<v 2>Great.</v>

434
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.043
<v 0>Yes.</v>

435
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.693
<v 2>Great.</v>

436
00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:01.680
<v 0>I'm sorry,
what did you just say?
You can have a spring.
Yeah.</v>

437
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:02.810
You could have this great again,

438
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.170
<v 2>Eh,
Oh,
uh,
objects to grab a little bit.</v>

439
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.750
You don't yet.

440
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.210
<v 0>Okay.
Let me repeat what he said.
He said,
take a spring out outer space and work,</v>

441
00:28:17.211 --> 00:28:21.860
hookup some objects to them and see how fast they move and do a comparison

442
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.510
that's fairly close to what I had in mind.
But it's not,

443
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.730
not the word.
Perfect answer.
And I just want to take some time thinking about,

444
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:35.740
yes.
Uh,

445
00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.860
what do I learn from the period?
How

446
00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.980
remember you have,

447
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.270
you cannot a peek into chapters six and seven because you've seen it before.

448
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:54.720
I'm asking you if you know somebody wrote,

449
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.750
apparently Shakespeare's plays for it and there's one of the rumors,
right?

450
00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:59.830
Suppose Newton comes to you and says,
you know,

451
00:28:59.831 --> 00:29:03.480
I have this great law but I don't want to publish it under my name,

452
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.350
not so I'm going to give it to you and you have got this new law,

453
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:09.660
but how are you going to sell this?
Right?

454
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.470
You've got to tell people how to use it and you realize it's very subtle because

455
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.730
the very first thing in that equation,
which is am is not yet been defined,

456
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.890
and he gave an answer which is fairly close,
doesn't rely on gravity,

457
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:26.250
doesn't rely on the planet.
No.
You cannot say to me,

458
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:30.570
take a force due to a spring and see what force it applies and divide by the

459
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:33.270
acceleration.
Get the mass because we haven't defined foresee that.

460
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:37.530
You got to realize that.
Let me ask you something.

461
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:40.470
How do we decide how long a meter is?
Can you tell me?

462
00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:42.130
How would we know how long a meter is?

463
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.063
<v 2>Right,</v>

464
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.570
<v 0>and we will call it.
First thing you got to do,</v>

465
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:56.970
you said some of these things are not God given a meter for example,

466
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.350
is not deduce from anything.

467
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.860
Napoleon or somebody said the size of my ego is one meter.
That's it.

468
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.750
That's the new unit of length.

469
00:30:03.751 --> 00:30:08.070
Do you take a material like silver put in a glass case and that's the meter and

470
00:30:08.071 --> 00:30:10.410
that's the definition of a meter.
That's not right or wrong.

471
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.100
Then I asked you what is two meters and what is three meters?

472
00:30:14.101 --> 00:30:17.880
We have ways of doing that,
right?
I take the meter and put it next to the meter.

473
00:30:17.881 --> 00:30:19.880
That's two meters or Carter and half of use.

474
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.760
Some protractors and dividers encompasses.

475
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.790
You can split the meter into any fraction you like.
Likewise for mass,

476
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:32.100
we will take a chunk of some material and we will call it a kilogram.

477
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.080
So I should give you some hint.

478
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.550
So that kilogram I don't expect you to deduce that is a matter of convention.

479
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.270
Just like one second.
There's some convention we use in one meter,

480
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.180
some convention use.
So I'm going to give you a little help.

481
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.970
I'm going to give you a glass case.

482
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.890
And in a glass case is an entity which is one kilogram by definition.

483
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.460
Yes.
Then I give you another object,
elephants,
this elephant,

484
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:04.710
and I'm telling you what's the mass of the elephant?
How do you find this mass?

485
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.800
You've got to take the hint he gave,

486
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:14.220
I gave you a spring and an elephant.
What should we do?

487
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.670
Yes.
No.

488
00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.660
Remember when we hang the elephant in outer space,
nothing's going to happen.

489
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.173
<v 2>Right?</v>

490
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.530
Okay.
And then you also do that,

491
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:43.910
the resting state,

492
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.540
<v 0>uh,
when you say push the elephant,</v>

493
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.750
you want to push it in a particular way or what do you want to do

494
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.490
<v 2>towards the compress the spring board?</v>

495
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.050
<v 0>That is correct.
But you don't want to give it a definite push.
Yes.</v>

496
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.533
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

497
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.940
<v 0>Or maybe,
yeah,
maybe that's an interesting thing,
but that's correct.</v>

498
00:32:16.941 --> 00:32:19.100
You can do that too.
But uh,

499
00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.010
let me now put you out of your suspense.

500
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.520
I think I've heard bits and pieces of the answer to everywhere,

501
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.900
so I don't want to wait till we get it word perfect.

502
00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.580
The point is the one kilogram is a matter of convention.

503
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:37.010
We want to know what is the mass of the elephant so we can do the seesaw

504
00:32:37.011 --> 00:32:40.490
experiment you said yesterday,
but the CSI pediments that acquires gravity,

505
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:45.560
so we don't want to do that so spring,
well on the other hand,
exert a force.

506
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.630
We don't know what the force of his spring is.

507
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.200
UPS assume that you're not playing by the rule because we don't know what force

508
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:54.740
it exits,
but we do know it exerts a force.
So here's what you do.

509
00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.530
You Hook one end of the spring to a wall and you pull it from rest by some

510
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:04.280
amount and you attach the one kilogram mass to it.

511
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:06.853
Yes,

512
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.643
<v 2>the wall,</v>

513
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.010
<v 0>a wall that will not move</v>

514
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.980
<v 2>if you look it up to any wall and every space.</v>

515
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.610
<v 0>Well no cheating.
No,
no,
you're,
you're right.</v>

516
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:27.670
What can actually happen is that if you're an enormous laboratory which is made

517
00:33:28.401 --> 00:33:29.780
up of an enormous object,

518
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.170
then you will find that you can in fact attached to the wall.

519
00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:36.620
You can go out of space.
No,
it one move very much and we can,

520
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:39.650
once we know enough dynamics,
we can understand,
we can answer your question.

521
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.190
Does outer space even rob you of something to which you can anchor?

522
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:45.890
The spring answer is no.
You can anchor things,

523
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.200
do objects and outer space.
They just one act the way gravity does,

524
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.060
but you can nail it the wall and pull one end.

525
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.020
So you put pull one and we don't know what force it exerts.
Okay.

526
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.390
But it exerts some force.

527
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:04.820
Now I tied this one kilogram mass to it and let it go and I find the

528
00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:08.840
acceleration that is the force,
which I do not know in magnitude.

529
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.693
Okay.

530
00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.290
But this is the acceleration of the one kilogram mass.

531
00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:23.150
Then I bring the elephants and I pulled the spring by the same amount and I find

532
00:34:23.341 --> 00:34:24.870
the acceleration of the elephants.

533
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.170
And the denominator is obviously the massive elephant.

534
00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:33.450
The force is not known,
but it's the same force.

535
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.360
So when they divide these two numbers,

536
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.720
I'm going to find a one n a e is equal to m e over m with just the one kilogram

537
00:34:46.441 --> 00:34:47.274
mass.

538
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.540
So what we needed was some mechanism of exerting some fixed force be didn't have

539
00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:57.530
to know orders of magnitude,

540
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.940
but the acceleration it produces on the elephant and then on the mass are in the

541
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:08.510
inverse ratio of their masses.
So if you knew this was one kilogram,

542
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.630
then the acceleration of the elephant,
which would be some tiny number,

543
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.660
maybe 100 though.
What this guy did,
the master the elephant,

544
00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:19.450
is that a hundred kilograms?
No,

545
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.040
that is against subtleties.
Even here,
if you think harder,

546
00:35:22.041 --> 00:35:23.870
you can get worried about other things.
For example,

547
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:25.730
how do I know that when I pull the spring,

548
00:35:25.731 --> 00:35:30.050
the first time for the mass exhibited the same force,

549
00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:34.610
but I pull the spring the second time for the elephant after all springs wear

550
00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:34.940
out.

551
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.980
That's why you change your shock absorbers in your car after a while they don't

552
00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:38.814
do the same thing.

553
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.140
So firstly we've got to make sure the spring exerts a fixed force every time.

554
00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.900
Or you can say,
how am I going to check that?

555
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:48.780
I don't have the definition of force yet,
but we do know the following.

556
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.480
If you pull the one kilogram mass and I let it go,
it does some things,

557
00:35:53.481 --> 00:35:57.030
some acceleration that or put it again by the same amount and let it go.

558
00:35:57.031 --> 00:36:00.180
I do it 10 times.
If every time I get the same acceleration,

559
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.040
I'm convinced this is the reliable spring that is somehow producing the same

560
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:09.410
force under the same condition.
On the 11th time I pulled the Mass on,

561
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.950
put the elephant in of some degree of confidence I'm working with,

562
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.270
they're liable to spring and then I would get the massive elephant.

563
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.760
Why is it so important?

564
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:21.360
It's important for you guys to know that everything you write down on the

565
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.250
notebook or blackboard as a symbol,

566
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.080
it's actually a measured quantity and you should know at all times how you will

567
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:30.990
measure anything because if you don't have to mention anything,

568
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.020
you are doing Algebra,
trigonometry,
you are not doing physics.

569
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.550
So this also tells you that the mass of an object is nothing to do with

570
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:43.551
gravitation myself and object is how much it helps to accelerate in response to

571
00:36:44.461 --> 00:36:48.060
your force.
Newton tells you forced this cost acceleration,

572
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.780
but that acceleration is not the same on different objects.

573
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.180
Certain objects resisted more than others.

574
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.800
They are set to have a bigger mass and we can be precise about how much bigger.

575
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:03.801
By saying if the acceleration of a body to given force is 10 times that of a one

576
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:08.310
kilogram mass,
then there's masses than one 10th of one kilogram.

577
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.290
This is how my sis can be tabulated using a spring.

578
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.840
So imagine then from no one we can find the mass of any object,
right?

579
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.540
You know now with the same spring by this comparison will find all objects now

580
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.930
can be attributed at mass.

581
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.860
Then we may from this equation,

582
00:37:29.861 --> 00:37:33.940
say a certain forces acting in a given situation,

583
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.910
but multiplying the m times the A,

584
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:42.850
but then here's what we actually do.
Now we go back to the spring.

585
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:44.920
<v 1>Okay,</v>

586
00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.060
<v 0>you go back to the spring and we want to learn something about the spring.</v>

587
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.170
We want to know how much force it exerts.
Then I pull it by a certain amount.

588
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:58.350
Now I can measure that because I pull it by one centimeter and I find the

589
00:37:58.351 --> 00:37:59.041
acceleration.

590
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:02.970
It exerts on a known mass that Mtm says the forest is putting us exerting.

591
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.500
Then I pull it by 1.1 centimeter and I find Ama,

592
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.610
I find 1.2 I find Mai,

593
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:13.630
I draw a graph here of the amount by which I pull the spring versus the force it

594
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:16.884
exerts.

595
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.910
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

596
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:23.910
<v 0>and it will typically look like this and the formula we says f equals minus Kx,</v>

597
00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.850
where k is called the forest constant.

598
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.340
<v 1>Yeah.
You've got to understand</v>

599
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.930
<v 0>what the minus sign is doing here.</v>

600
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.620
This is the force exerted by the spring.

601
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.320
On the mass it says,

602
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:48.820
if you pull it to the right so that x is positive.
The Springville exert a force,

603
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:51.400
which is the negative bad action.
That's where you have a minus sign

604
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:57.040
and then all springs,
we'll do something like this further out.

605
00:38:57.041 --> 00:39:00.000
They can do various things.
The force may taper off.

606
00:39:00.001 --> 00:39:01.630
Worse Menard be given by a straight line,

607
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.310
but for modest deformations every spring we'll have a linear regime in with the

608
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:09.220
forces linearly proportional to the stretching.

609
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.060
It also tells you that if you compress the spring compress,

610
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:18.061
it means x is now x is measured from this position where the spring is neither

611
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:20.110
compressed,
not expanded.

612
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.710
So x is not really the coordinator of the end point.

613
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.220
You got to understand that springs have a natural link,

614
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.640
so x is measured from that length.
If it's positive,
it means you stretched it.

615
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.371
If it's negative,

616
00:39:31.371 --> 00:39:34.900
it means compressed and this equation is telling you if you compress it,

617
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.130
namely if x is negative,

618
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.160
f will be than positive because it's pushing you outwards.

619
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.231
Therefore,

620
00:39:42.231 --> 00:39:46.910
what we have done now is we can take all kinds of springs and we can calibrate

621
00:39:46.911 --> 00:39:49.610
the force.
They will exert under various conditions.

622
00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.220
Namely if you pull it by so much,
that's the forest it will exert.

623
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.660
So I want you to think for a second about two equations.

624
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.790
One equation says f equals m a

625
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.610
other equations is f equals minus k.
X.

626
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.880
So what's going on?
I mean is one of them.
Newton's law and what's the other one?

627
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.420
Maybe F equals minus K x should be called Newton's law wise I think was maa

628
00:40:21.421 --> 00:40:24.840
called Newton's law.
Then what's the meaning of this expression?

629
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.570
What's the difference between sayingF is minus Kx and saying f equals m a dated

630
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.830
saying very different things.

631
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.843
<v 2>Yup.</v>

632
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.270
<v 0>Right.
Let me repeat.
F equals m a is universally true.</v>

633
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.540
Independent of the nature of the force acting on a body

634
00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.183
<v 2>and then</v>

635
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:55.603
very good.

636
00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.370
<v 0>That's the whole point.
So the cycle of Newtonian dynamics has two parts.</v>

637
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.770
First one says,

638
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:07.630
if you knew the force acting on anybody without going into what costs the force,

639
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.430
then you may set that force equals mass times acceleration of the body.

640
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.300
We think of force as the cause and a as the result or the effect force causes

641
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:26.540
acceleration.
And this is the precise statement
they are.

642
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:30.960
Newton doesn't tell you what forces are going to be acting on a body in a given

643
00:41:30.961 --> 00:41:34.970
situation.
If you'd leave the body alone,
maybe there's no force acting on it.

644
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.990
If you connect the body to a spring,
which is neither compressed,

645
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.350
[inaudible] extended,
there's no force acting on it.
If you pull the spring,

646
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:43.700
that is a force acting on it.

647
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.890
Newton is not going to come and tell you what fours the spring will exert when

648
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:52.220
it's pulled by some amount.
That is another part of your assignment.

649
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:58.030
So the physicist has to constantly find out what forces act on bodies as a

650
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:02.090
separate exercise.
In every context in which I play as a body,

651
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.220
I love to know what are the forces acting on it.

652
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.220
I've got to find them by experimenting,

653
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:11.480
by putting other bodies and seeing how they react and then finding out that's

654
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:14.540
the force that acts on the body even is placed in this or that situation.

655
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.310
Once you got that,
then you come back.
So in the case of a spring,

656
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:20.840
this is the law that you will do to use.

657
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:25.100
If it's something else you would have to deduce.
And other law.
For example,

658
00:42:25.101 --> 00:42:27.560
we know that if a body is near the surface of the earth,

659
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:33.370
the forces of gravity and that object seems to be an times g and gs 9.8 that's

660
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:37.430
something you find out about experiment.

661
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.850
So every time you're finding out different force that's acting on a body with

662
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:48.560
different audits,
one says leave anybody near the year.
It feels so forced.

663
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.450
I know this is the right answer because if I never find the acceleration,

664
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.870
I find mg divided by M and they get minus g as the answer for all bodies.

665
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.450
By the way,
that's the very remarkable property of the gravitational force.

666
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.270
The cancellation of the two M's.

667
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.850
If you look at the electrical force,
the force of electricity,

668
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:15.560
the Proton and the electron or something,

669
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.220
it's not proportional to the massive either object id for abortions,

670
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.920
electric charge of either object.
Therefore,
when you divide by the master,

671
00:43:21.921 --> 00:43:25.910
get the acceleration that a sponsor different bodies is inverse of the mass.

672
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:30.470
But gravity has the remarkable property that the pull of the earth is still

673
00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:32.270
proportional.
The inertia of the object.

674
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:37.240
So there's been a divide by m m cancels and everything falls at the same rate at

675
00:43:37.241 --> 00:43:39.650
the surface of the earth.
In fact,

676
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:42.770
it's a property of gravitational fields anywhere,
even in outer space,

677
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:46.070
but there is some residue will feel due to all the planets and all the stars in

678
00:43:46.071 --> 00:43:50.360
the universe that the force on the body is proportional to the mass of the body.

679
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.480
So we need divide by the master,
get the acceleration.
You get the same answer,

680
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:59.180
everything.
Gold,
silver,
diamonds,
particles,

681
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:02.930
everything accelerates the same way in a gravitational field due to this

682
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:05.660
remarkable fact,
and this was known for a long time,

683
00:44:05.661 --> 00:44:10.370
but it took Mr Einstein to figure out why nature is behaving in that fashion.

684
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.960
If I have some time,
I'll tell you later,

685
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.920
but there are two qualities which happened to be equal.

686
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:20.960
One is inertial mass,
which is how much you had your velocity to change,

687
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.660
how hard you resist acceleration that exists far from planets,

688
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.680
far from everything,
others,
gravitational mass,

689
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.900
which is the measurement of how much you're attracted to the earth.

690
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.240
There's no why.
These two attributes have to be proportional,
proportional,

691
00:44:35.241 --> 00:44:37.110
and are equal by choice of units,

692
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.460
and you can ask is it just an accident or is it part of a big picture?

693
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:46.170
It turns out it's part of a big picture and all of dental relativities based on

694
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.820
this one grade equivalence of two quantities with a very different attributes.

695
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.760
Why should the amount by which are attracted to the earth?

696
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.110
The also a measure of how much you had acceleration to different features,
right,

697
00:44:58.111 --> 00:45:00.510
but they happen to be the same anyway.

698
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:04.890
What physicists do is they put bodies in various circumstances and they did use

699
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:05.850
various forces.

700
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.200
This is the force of gravity is the force of the spring.

701
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.630
Here's another force you might find.

702
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.960
You put a chunk of wood on a table and you try to move it at constant speed.

703
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.540
Then you find that you have to play minimum force.

704
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.180
We are moving at a constant velocity.

705
00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:27.540
That means the force you're applying is canceled by another force,

706
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.130
which has got to be the force of friction.

707
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.100
So forced the friction is yet another force.

708
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.580
Then there are other forces,
right?
You guys know there's the electrical force.

709
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.980
If you bring a plus charge near a plus charge,

710
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.120
and if my body am has a plus charge and another plus charges there,

711
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:48.780
it'll feel a forced you to that.
That's not going to be given by Newton.

712
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.010
So Newton did not ever tell you what the expression for forces in a given

713
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:57.690
constant that is a constant study column discovered the Columbus Law,

714
00:45:57.691 --> 00:45:59.340
which is that impulse in between charges.

715
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:03.990
And nowadays we know if you go into the neutron or proton that our quirks that

716
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:07.780
are forces between the quarks and you can ask what the force that this quark

717
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.930
will exert and that quark at a certain separation.

718
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:15.300
There's obviously not known the Newton.
Remember Newton said f equals I may,

719
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:19.710
but didn't tell you what value f has any given contest.

720
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.280
He just said,
whenever there's an acceleration,

721
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:26.580
it's going to be due to some forces and it's your job to find what the forces

722
00:46:26.581 --> 00:46:30.900
are and to find the forest.
What you will do is suppose somebody says,
Hey,

723
00:46:30.901 --> 00:46:35.250
I've got a new force.
Every time I go near the podium,
I find I'm drawn to it.

724
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.810
Okay,
that's the new forest.
You know,

725
00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:40.920
word gets around and we want to measure the force.
So what do I do?

726
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.460
I stand near this podium,
I'm drawn to it.
I cannot stop.

727
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.600
So I tie a spring to my back and I anchored the walk and to see how much the

728
00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:51.180
spring stretches before the two forces balance.

729
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.820
Then I know that the Kx is equal to the force.

730
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:58.590
This is exerting at this separation and move a little closer than I find.

731
00:46:58.591 --> 00:47:01.410
The stretching is a different number.
Maybe the forest is getting stronger.

732
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:06.810
That's how by a that balancing the unknown force with the known force,

733
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.120
odd by simply measuring my acceleration,

734
00:47:09.121 --> 00:47:12.020
I say fall towards his podium and multiplying by a master,

735
00:47:12.021 --> 00:47:16.320
you can find the force it exerts on me.
So it's not a sickly can,

736
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.970
cyclical and useless definition.

737
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:22.740
It's a very interesting interplay and that's the foundation of all our
mechanics.

738
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.010
So we are constantly looking for values ofF and B,

739
00:47:26.011 --> 00:47:29.290
constantly looking for responses of bodies to a known force.

740
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
So he has a simple example of a complete Newtonian problem amasses attached to a

741
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.393
spring.

742
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:41.740
It is pulled by certain amount x and it's released.

743
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.630
What is it going to do?
You go to Newton.

744
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.160
Newton says f equals m a,

745
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:53.020
so to make it a useful in this problem,
we know the mass of this guy.

746
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.510
We did the comparison with the elephant or something.

747
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.310
A is the secondary to a vax

748
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.010
and for this problem when f is due to a spring,

749
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.870
we know the force is that by studying the spring and suddenly you have a

750
00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:09.520
mathematically complete problem,

751
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.920
mathematically complete problem is that you can find the function x of t by

752
00:48:14.921 --> 00:48:19.870
saying that the second derivative of the function is equal to minus care.

753
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:23.470
What am times the function?
Then you go to the math department and say,

754
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:25.450
please tell me what's the answer to this equation.

755
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.250
We don't have to worry about how you solve it,

756
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:31.660
but it's problem in mathematics and the answer will be surprised.

757
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.380
It's going to be oscillating back and forth and that'll come out of the of the

758
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.950
wash.
This is how you formulate problems.

759
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.740
You can formulate another problem later on.
We know about gravity,
right?

760
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.550
You wouldn't find south as the force of gravity acting on everything.

761
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:50.380
Here's The sun,
here's your planet,
and uh,
this incident,

762
00:48:50.381 --> 00:48:52.120
the planet may be moving at that speed.

763
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.900
Then the acceleration of the planet is the force of gravity between the planet

764
00:48:58.181 --> 00:49:01.060
and the Sun with Newton will tell you is directed towards the Sun.

765
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.740
And it depends on how far you are.

766
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.060
So depending on how far the planet is from the sun and where it's located,

767
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.670
you will get the lefthand side.
That's another law.

768
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.910
That's a law of universal gravitation.
Then again,

769
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:17.410
you will find the evolution of the planetary motion because the rate of change

770
00:49:17.411 --> 00:49:21.610
of the rate of change,
a position is connected to the position.
Again,

771
00:49:21.611 --> 00:49:23.380
go to the math guys and say,
what's the answer to that?

772
00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:26.240
And they tell you the answer,
which will be some elliptical motion.

773
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.740
Okay.
By the way,
Mr. Newton did not have mad guys he could go to.

774
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.410
So not only did he formulate laws of gravitation,

775
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.300
he also invented calculus.

776
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.810
Then you also learn how to solve the differential equation.
For Calculus,

777
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.640
so he probably felt that nobody around us doing any work because all the thing

778
00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:50.140
was given to this one person.

779
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:54.460
It's really amazing that what Newton did in the case of gravity was to find the

780
00:49:54.461 --> 00:49:57.740
expression for this and few months or few years earlier,

781
00:49:57.741 --> 00:50:01.060
they had also gotten this lie by putting the two together outcomes,

782
00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:05.890
the elliptical motion of the planets.
Okay,
so we'll come back to that,

783
00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:10.891
but you have to understand the structure of Newtonian mechanics or generally any

784
00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:13.240
mechanics will require knowledge of the force.

785
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.330
Now I'm going to add one more amendment.

786
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:18.610
You don't have to write in their notebook,
but you got to remember,

787
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:23.350
maybe we'll put a little t and circle it.
Let me write it here.

788
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.560
F T means the total force on a body.

789
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:30.020
If there are many forces acting on a body,

790
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.840
the acceleration is controlled by the sun.

791
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:38.060
If I'm now working in one dimension is obvious because I'm not using any
vectors,

792
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:42.070
then you may have forces to the right forces to the left,
pushing,
pulling.

793
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.930
You add them all up,
algebraically,
keeping track of their sign,

794
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.490
and that's the total force.

795
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:51.550
That's connected to mass times acceleration can now I'll give you the third law.

796
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:58.350
The third law says that if there are two bodies then called one and to force a

797
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:04.580
one on two is minus the force of second on the first one.

798
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.950
This is the thing about action and reaction

799
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.800
and all the laws that anybody knows have this property.

800
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:19.190
So what does it require to be a successful mechanic?

801
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.840
To do all the mechanics problems,
you got to be good at writing down the forces,

802
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:26.540
acting on a body.
That's what is all going to boil down to.

803
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.390
So here's my advice to you.

804
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:36.610
Do not forget the existing forces and do not make up your own forces.

805
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:42.350
I've seen both happen and right now at this point in our course,

806
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.340
whenever you have a problem with that is somebody and someone says,
right,

807
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:50.030
all the forces on it,
what do you have to do is very simple.

808
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:55.870
Every force with one exception can be seen as a force due to direct contact with

809
00:51:56.481 --> 00:52:00.470
the body.
He did a rope is pulling a rope is pushing it.
You're pushing it,

810
00:52:00.471 --> 00:52:03.170
you're pulling it.
That is a contact on the body.

811
00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:08.630
If nothing is touching the body that are no forces on it with one exception,

812
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:09.740
which is of course gravity.

813
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:15.710
Gravity's one fours that acts a body without the source of the force actually

814
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:17.300
touching it.
That's it.

815
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:22.140
Do not dry anymore forces and people do draw that forces forces in a body's

816
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:23.060
going around in a circle.

817
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.960
They said that some centrifugal force acting that is no such thing.

818
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.720
So be careful whenever that is the force,

819
00:52:29.721 --> 00:52:34.721
it can be traced back to a tangible material cause which is all the time of

820
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.930
force of contact with the exception of gravity.

821
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:45.970
Okay?
So with that,
if you write the right forces,
uh,
you will be just fine.

822
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.940
You'll be able to solve all the problems we have in mechanics.

823
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:52.960
So I'm going to now start doing simple problems in mechanics.

824
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.400
They'll start out simple and as usual they will get progressively more
difficult.

825
00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.270
Okay.
So let's start with the,

826
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:09.930
I would first a triumph will be motion in one d it is some object is five

827
00:53:12.881 --> 00:53:17.881
kilograms and they applied 10 newtons and someone says what the acceleration and

828
00:53:18.851 --> 00:53:22.270
everyone knows it.
The stand over five equals two

829
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.980
but now we know how have you got all the numbers that go into the very question.

830
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.000
How do we know tend to Zach,

831
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.050
oh I think you people know how we can say that with confidence.

832
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.680
How do we know the mass of this is five kilograms,
you know,

833
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.540
have you got that from an earlier experiment?

834
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:41.250
So now we know how the numbers come in.

835
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:43.950
The Algebra is of course very trivial here.

836
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:49.740
Then the next problem is little more interesting.
So he hit,

837
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:54.741
I got a three kilograms and they got two kilograms and I'm pushing with 10

838
00:53:55.891 --> 00:53:58.230
newtons and I want to know what happens.

839
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:06.250
So one way is to just use your common sense and realize that if you push it this

840
00:54:06.251 --> 00:54:06.401
way,

841
00:54:06.401 --> 00:54:11.401
these two guys are going to move together and know intuitively that if they move

842
00:54:11.531 --> 00:54:15.430
together there they will behave like an object of mass.

843
00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.490
Five and the acceleration will again be too,

844
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.420
but there's another way to do this.

845
00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:25.540
And I'm going to give you an out the simplest example of the other way,

846
00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:29.670
which is a draw free body diagrams.
By the way.
Uh,

847
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:34.000
when I say that is 10 newtons acting this way,
you might say,
what about gravity?

848
00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.080
What about the table?

849
00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:38.440
So imagine that this is an outer space where there's no gravity for now.

850
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.800
So the motion is just along the x axis.

851
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.460
So the free body diagram,

852
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:52.620
it says you can pick any one body that you like and apply if equal Emmett do it

853
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:58.060
provided you identify all the forces acting on that body.

854
00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:04.540
So we will first speak the body
mass three.

855
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.700
Here's the body of mastery.
What are the forces on it?

856
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.710
This is certainly acting on it.
Then you have to ask what other forces acting.

857
00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:20.670
So here is where you have to think.
Yup.

858
00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:23.920
Anybody want to guess from the last row?
What force?
Yes.

859
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.100
Right?
So let's give it a name,
right?

860
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:34.460
So let's pointed that way and call it f two one three.

861
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.470
That's the end of this guy that let's look at the other fellow.
Uh,

862
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:45.020
maybe you should complete the force acting on this one

863
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.280
and it tells me what it is.
Uh,

864
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:52.610
same person in the last row.

865
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.483
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

866
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.100
<v 0>I know.
How big is that,</v>

867
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:07.280
right?
So be,
I don't want to give it to many different names,
right?
Because F two,

868
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.430
three and after the two are equal and opposite and is showing f boot reacting to

869
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:12.180
the left.

870
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:17.180
So let me give it some other name like f then you agree this would be the CMF,

871
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:22.860
but pointing that way
and he had his mistake.
Some people,

872
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.240
the add to that,
the 10 newtons

873
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.250
is the 10 newtons acting on it because I know the 10 Newton is pushing me and

874
00:56:30.251 --> 00:56:33.640
I'm going to feel it.
If I,
even if I'm here,
that would be a mistake.

875
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.720
That's an example of adding a force that you really shouldn't be adding.

876
00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:43.530
The only force acting on this guy is this little left and that's in turn because

877
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:46.870
this guy is being pushed by the 10 Newton.
But that's not your problem.

878
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:51.750
Your problem is the only look at the forces of contact on you and that is just

879
00:56:51.751 --> 00:56:52.584
as f.

880
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:57.430
Then we do f equals m a for these two guys.

881
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:02.970
But this guy f equals m a would be 10 minus F is three times a.

882
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.830
The other one it'll be f equals to [inaudible].

883
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.770
And notice I'm using the same acceleration for both.

884
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.080
I know that if the second mass moved faster than the first one in picked,

885
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:19.450
it is completely wrong.
And if it moves slower than the first one,

886
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.750
it meant it rammed into this one.
That also cannot happen.

887
00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:26.650
So they're moving with the same acceleration.
So there's only one unknown a.

888
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:31.120
So once you got this,
you realize what you got to do,
right?

889
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:36.270
This equation is begging you to be added to this equation might be better plus F

890
00:57:36.611 --> 00:57:39.610
and a minus f.
So you gotta do what you gotta do.
You add the two,

891
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.090
you get 10 equals five a and you get equals two.

892
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:46.080
Once you got eight wants to,

893
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:51.330
you can go back and realize here that F is equal before.

894
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.240
And so you got really four newtons.
Now we know the full story,

895
00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.730
four newtons acting on two kilograms.

896
00:57:57.731 --> 00:58:01.420
It gives you an acceleration of two on this guy.

897
00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:07.050
I have 10 from the left and I have four 10 acting this way of what?

898
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.700
Acting that way.

899
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.970
That is six newtons divided by three kilograms is also acceleration of too.

900
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.620
This is a simple example.
Simple example of free body diagrams.

901
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:23.230
Very simple.
If you can do this,

902
00:58:23.231 --> 00:58:28.200
you can do most of the problems you will run into.
Yes,

903
00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:30.450
don't add stuff that's not there.

904
00:58:30.451 --> 00:58:33.270
That's all you have to be careful about and the stuff that people tend to add

905
00:58:33.271 --> 00:58:36.750
sometimes is to keep drawing the 10 Newton is acting on that.

906
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:45.420
Okay,
now here's another radiation.
Radiation looks like this.

907
00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:51.680
I got three kilograms and I have a rope and I got two kilograms and I pulled

908
00:58:52.471 --> 00:58:54.660
this guy with 10 newtons.

909
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.900
What's going to happen?
I gained your comments since downs.
You look,

910
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:04.990
you're pulling something was effective.
Mass seems to be five.

911
00:59:04.991 --> 00:59:08.260
The answer to this too.
Let's get that uh,

912
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:13.330
systematically by using free body diagrams.
Now that it really three bodies here,

913
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:14.321
block one,

914
00:59:14.321 --> 00:59:19.321
block two and the rope connecting right now in all these examples,

915
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:24.800
this rope
is assumed to be massless.

916
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.600
Uh,
we know there is no thing called the massless role,

917
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:31.550
but most ropes have a mass which may be negligible compared to the two blocks

918
00:59:31.551 --> 00:59:32.360
you're pulling.

919
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.570
So we'll take the idealized limit where the mass of the rope is zero.

920
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.380
So here's the deal.

921
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:45.760
Three kilogram is being pulled by the rope on the right with a force that I'm

922
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:48.380
going to call t,
which stands for attention.

923
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:55.770
The rope is being pulled backwards by this guy,
the t.

924
00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.470
And what is the forest on the other side?
What should that be?

925
01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:09.960
Was that t and why is it they definitely tea and not something else?

926
01:00:10.001 --> 01:00:11.500
What would happen if it's something else?

927
01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:16.800
<v 2>Good.
Good.
Well,</v>

928
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.090
if it was greater

929
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.250
<v 0>one snap,
but something else will be a problem.</v>

930
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:25.933
<v 2>Yes.</v>

931
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.110
<v 0>Not only faster.
What it'd be is acceleration.</v>

932
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:35.800
If the two forces don't cancel,
you have a net force.

933
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.680
What are we going to divide by to get the acceleration?

934
01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.620
Zero.
Right?

935
01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.940
So massless body cannot have a net force on it because the acceleration of the

936
01:00:45.941 --> 01:00:48.990
rope cannot be infinite.
In fact,
it has to be some finite number,

937
01:00:48.991 --> 01:00:51.070
which is the acceleration of either of these two guys.

938
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.870
So massless bodies will always have like a massless role,

939
01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.430
equal and opposite forces on the two ends and that is called the tension on the

940
01:01:00.431 --> 01:01:05.080
road.
So when you say the rope is under tension being pulled from both sides by a

941
01:01:05.081 --> 01:01:09.910
certain force,
the tension is not zero just because this d and that he canceled.

942
01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:16.420
It's true.
The net force is zero but doesn't mean you can ignore it,
right?

943
01:01:16.421 --> 01:01:20.200
Suppose you are being pulled by my favorite animals.

944
01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.080
The elephants from both sides.
By equal force,

945
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.590
you don't find any consolation in the fact that these forces add up to zero,

946
01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:30.640
right?
Yeah.
You feel the pain.
That pain is what we,

947
01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:35.140
the gentleman doesn't agree.
One of you guys nodding your head.

948
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.420
You feel the pain.
You agree?
Okay.
That force is called the tension.

949
01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:45.220
So you and I would get asked in the problem what the tension on the road you're

950
01:01:45.221 --> 01:01:49.390
looking for that equal and opposite forces acting at two ends of the rope,

951
01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.000
so we don't know what it is.
We'll give it a name,

952
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:56.020
but by linking that t to that tea,
you can also figure it out.

953
01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:01.900
The same team must be accepted on this one by Newton's third law because if this

954
01:02:01.901 --> 01:02:04.210
block is the only one that could be pulling this rope,

955
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:08.320
but t therefore the ropes will be pulling the block with the other direction.

956
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.240
Then I got 10 newtons here.

957
01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:16.330
Now you can do f equals m a for the three different objects.

958
01:02:16.331 --> 01:02:19.950
There's nothing to do here because the forces are zero.
The masters zero,

959
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:24.120
it doesn't tell you anything.
The first one tells you t equals three.

960
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:28.410
A other one tells you 10 minus t

961
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:34.980
equals to a
no.
Again,

962
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:35.761
we know what to do.

963
01:02:35.761 --> 01:02:40.761
We add these numbers and we get 10 equals five a net for refined egg once to,

964
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.090
once you find a equals two you find teak or the six.

965
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.900
The tension on the rope is six newtons.

966
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:51.190
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

967
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:53.230
<v 0>no,
this is very important because when you buy a rope,</v>

968
01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:55.930
they'll tell you how much attention it can take before it'll snap.

969
01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.850
And if your plan is to accelerate a three kilogram mass with an acceleration of

970
01:03:00.851 --> 01:03:01.870
two meters per second,

971
01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:06.070
you better have a rope that can furnish that for us and we can take the tension

972
01:03:06.071 --> 01:03:07.000
of six newtons.

973
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:18.290
Alright,
now for the,
uh,
whoa.

974
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

975
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:37.410
<v 0>Okay.
I'm going to give the last class of problem with this pretty interesting,</v>

976
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:41.670
which is what happens to you when you're in an elevator.

977
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:47.550
So he had us a weighing machine and that's you

978
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:52.850
standing on the elevator and we're going to ask,
oh,

979
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.380
what's the needle showing a different times?

980
01:03:57.210 --> 01:04:00.930
First take the case and the elevators and the ground floor of some building and

981
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:01.920
completely addressed.

982
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:06.570
Then let's look at the spring.

983
01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.610
The spring is getting squashed because you're pushing down in the float is

984
01:04:11.611 --> 01:04:12.444
pushing up,

985
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:18.420
pushing down with the weight mg and the Floridas gotta be pushing up with Wade

986
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:21.600
empty because the spring is not going anywhere.
So it's bring us being pushed

987
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.460
by AMG here and AMG here.

988
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.740
Therefore it'll compress by an I'm on x,

989
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:35.250
which is equaled mg divided by the force constant of the spring.

990
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:40.050
By the way,
that's the second thing people may not have realized.

991
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.560
Even in the case of this spring,
when you pull it,

992
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.020
if you pull it to the right by some force,

993
01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:51.900
remember the wall is pulling to the left with the same force says brings her,

994
01:04:51.901 --> 01:04:54.750
always pushed or pulled on either side with the same force.

995
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:56.730
We focused on one because we are paying for it,

996
01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.700
but the wall is doing the opposite.
We don't pay any attention to that,

997
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.900
but you cannot have a spring pull only at one site because then it'll that

998
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:05.910
accelerate with infinite acceleration in that direction.

999
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:11.090
So this spring is getting squashed on either side and it will squash.

1000
01:05:11.091 --> 01:05:11.970
They said no more.
Next,

1001
01:05:11.971 --> 01:05:15.860
that depends on your mass and that x will be turned into a motion of a needle

1002
01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.400
and that'll read your mass.
Now,

1003
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:23.290
what happens if the elevator is accelerating upwards with an acceleration?

1004
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.780
A,
that's the question.
No.

1005
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.800
The way I analyze it is I say,

1006
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:35.130
if I look at me and I write the forces on me that is empty acting down.

1007
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.860
Let me use w as the symbol to represent the force exerted by the spring.

1008
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:48.630
W minus AMG is m a that is f equals m.

1009
01:05:49.091 --> 01:05:53.360
A.
When I was not accelerating the,

1010
01:05:53.361 --> 01:05:55.370
everything was addressed.
Mia was zero,

1011
01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.480
W was AMG and w was the reading on the needle.

1012
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:05.210
But if I'm accelerating the force exerted by the spring and therefore the
needle,

1013
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.330
the weighing machine reads is m times g plus a.

1014
01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:15.100
It means when you're accelerating upwards as the elevator picks up speed,

1015
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.100
the reading on the spring,
we'll be more than you will feel heavy.

1016
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:23.350
You feel heavy and it reads more because the poor spring not only has to support

1017
01:06:23.351 --> 01:06:26.260
you from falling to the floor but also accelerate.

1018
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:28.210
You countered to what gravity wants to do.

1019
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.500
That's why it is g plus h so you picked up some speed,

1020
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:36.490
then you're coasting along at a steady speed than a ad drops out any way.

1021
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:39.910
Your normal self.
As you come to the top of the building,

1022
01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.520
the elevator has to decelerate so that it loses its positive philosophy and

1023
01:06:45.521 --> 01:06:50.470
comes to rest.
So able to be negative and W in fact will be less than mg.

1024
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:54.820
So you will feel weightless for a short time or do you feel your way this
little?

1025
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.140
Then you come to rest and the opposite happens on the way down.

1026
01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:02.290
Let me just briefly look at the ride on the way down.

1027
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:06.190
As you start at the top and go down,
your acceleration is negative.

1028
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.190
Nobody got to keep track of the sign of acceleration.

1029
01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:12.310
So if you're picking up speed towards the ground,
a is negative.

1030
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.010
So it'd be deeply say,
but ace a negative number.

1031
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:19.030
So let me write it as g minus the absolute value of a,

1032
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:22.690
and you can see that if a was equal to g,

1033
01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:27.370
you're downward acceleration is that of gravity.

1034
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:31.480
Namely the cable has snapped in the elevator.
Then you don't feel any weight,

1035
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:37.860
you don't feel any weight because you wait as the above the opposition.

1036
01:07:37.861 --> 01:07:39.480
You get the falling through the floor.

1037
01:07:39.481 --> 01:07:43.440
But the floor is giving way and you're just falling freely.
You feel weightless.

1038
01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:47.940
So it's wrong to think that you feel weightless because you escape the pull of

1039
01:07:47.941 --> 01:07:51.060
gravity.
We all know,
even the falling elevator,

1040
01:07:51.061 --> 01:07:52.920
you've definitely not as the pull of gravity.

1041
01:07:52.921 --> 01:07:57.540
It's going to catch up with you in a few seconds.
Like westbend and outer space.

1042
01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:59.250
You know,
as orbiting the earth.

1043
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:01.920
People that are always floating around in these space stations,

1044
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.790
they have not skipped the pull of gravity either.
They just stopped fighting it.

1045
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:09.270
If you guys get the pull of gravity,
your spaceship will be off,

1046
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:12.330
won't be orbiting the earth.
So anyway,

1047
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:17.040
I will return to this next time.
So do your problems.
Now.

1048
01:08:17.041 --> 01:08:20.550
There's quite a few problems.
You should start them right away.
