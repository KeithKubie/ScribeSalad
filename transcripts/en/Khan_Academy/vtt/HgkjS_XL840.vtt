00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.228
- [Instructor] In multiple
videos we have already talked

00:00:03.228 --> 00:00:07.799
about if something is
moving in a circular motion

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.508
at a fixed speed, its velocity
is constantly changing.

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:13.369
Why is that?

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.823
Because velocity is a vector

00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:18.317
and a vector has not just a magnitude

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:19.620
which would be its speed

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.279
but also its direction,

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.873
so even if I have the
same speed at this point

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:28.064
as I have at say this
point right over here,

00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:31.859
my velocity will be pointing
in a different direction

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.456
so now the magnitude might be the same,

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:37.014
I'll try to draw it roughly the same,

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.270
the length of this arrow
should be the same,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.741
so the magnitude,

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.388
V without an arrow on top,

00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:44.306
you could view that as the linear speed,

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:45.256
that will be the same

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:46.915
but now the direction has changed

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:48.820
and in order to change the direction,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.568
you must have this ball

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:53.074
that's moving in this circular motion

00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:54.978
must be accelerated.

00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:55.813
That's the only way.

00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:57.802
If you have a change in velocity,

00:00:57.802 --> 00:00:59.952
then you must have acceleration

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:02.488
and it's a little
counterintuitive at first

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:04.302
because you're saying well,
my magnitude didn't change,

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:05.708
only my direction did

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:08.734
but any change in your velocity
implies that acceleration

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.884
and in previous videos we saw

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:14.387
that that acceleration is
constantly going to be inward

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:17.265
if you have your uniform circular motion

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:19.773
and we call that inward acceleration,

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:23.199
we call that centripetal acceleration

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.679
and though if I wrote
this A sub C like this,

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.185
this means the magnitude of
my centripetal acceleration.

00:01:29.185 --> 00:01:31.570
If I'm talking about the
magnitude and the direction

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.161
I would put an arrow on it just like that.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.326
Now, we have also, in previous videos

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.648
have been able to connect
what is the magnitude

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:41.151
of centripetal acceleration,

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:42.382
how can we figure that out

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:45.617
from our linear speed and the radius

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:47.000
and we had the formula,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.226
the magnitude of centripetal acceleration

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:52.643
is equal to the magnitude of our velocity

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:56.283
or our linear speed squared

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.116
divided by our radius.

00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:02.377
Now, what I wanna do in this video

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:06.041
is see if I can connect our
centripetal acceleration

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:08.405
to angular velocity,

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:11.731
our nice variable omega right over here

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.564
and omega right over here

00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:13.950
you could use angular speed.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.229
It's the magnitude, I
could say our magnitude

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.387
of our angular velocity,

00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:20.624
so our angular speed here.

00:02:20.624 --> 00:02:24.334
So, how can we make this connection?

00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:27.165
Well, the key realization
is to be able to connect

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.670
your linear speed with your angular speed.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.853
So, in previous videos,
I think it was the second

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.831
or third when we introduced ourselves

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:38.067
to angular velocity or the magnitude of it

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.400
which would be angular speed,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.521
we saw that our linear
speed is going to be equal

00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:47.688
to our radius, the radius of
our uniform circular motion

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:52.219
times the magnitude of
our angular velocity

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:57.089
and I don't like to
just memorize formulas.

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:58.555
It's always good to have an intuition

00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:00.288
of why this makes sense.

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:03.027
Remember, angular velocity

00:03:03.027 --> 00:03:04.673
or the magnitude of angular velocity

00:03:04.673 --> 00:03:07.423
is measured in radians per second

00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:12.920
and we typically view radians as an angle

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.892
but if you think of it as an arc length,

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:16.840
a radian you could view it

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.124
as how many radii in length
am I completing per second?

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:22.992
And so, if I multiply that
times the actual length

00:03:22.992 --> 00:03:25.470
of the radii, then you can get a sense

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.295
of well, how much distance
am I covering per second?

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:30.263
Hopefully that makes some sense

00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:32.754
and we actually prove this formula,

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.768
we get an intuition for this
formula in previous videos

00:03:35.768 --> 00:03:38.534
but from this formula it's
easy to make a substitution

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:39.954
back into our original one

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:43.190
to have en expression for
centripetal acceleration,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.266
the magnitude of centripetal acceleration

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:48.741
in terms of radius and the magnitude

00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:51.085
of angular velocity

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:52.441
and I encourage you, pause this video

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.498
and see if you can drive that on your own.

00:03:55.498 --> 00:03:56.331
All right, let's do this together.

00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:58.498
So, if we start with this,

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.052
we have the magnitude of
our centripetal acceleration

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:04.671
is going to be equal to,

00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:07.504
instead of putting V squared here,

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:13.687
instead of V, I can write R omega,

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.348
so let me do that,

00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:17.765
R and then omega.

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:22.479
There you go and all I did I said look,

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.063
our linear speed right over here

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:26.931
is equal to our radius

00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:29.864
times the magnitude of
our angular velocity

00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:30.828
or angular speed,

00:04:30.828 --> 00:04:32.802
so everywhere I saw a V here,

00:04:32.802 --> 00:04:35.934
I'm just replacing it with an R omega

00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:37.805
and so, I have R omega,

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:40.638
the entire quantity squared over R

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.231
and then we can simplify this.

00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:46.359
This is going to be equal to,

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:48.078
I just use my exponent properties here,

00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:49.926
R omega times R omega

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:51.676
is gonna be R squared

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.060
times omega squared,

00:04:57.203 --> 00:04:58.786
all of that over R.

00:05:00.187 --> 00:05:01.849
If I have it R squared over R,

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.575
well, that's just going
to simplify to an R,

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:06.646
so there we have it,

00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:08.473
we have our formula for the magnitude

00:05:08.473 --> 00:05:09.910
of our centripetal acceleration

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.041
in terms of the magnitude
of our angular velocity.

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.624
It is going to be R

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:20.311
times the magnitude of our
angular velocity omega squared.

00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:23.022
There you have it

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:23.900
and in future videos

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.794
we'll do worked examples

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:27.877
where we actually apply this formula.
