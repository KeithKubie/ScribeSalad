00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.150
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.740
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.880
Thank you for joining
us for Inside Baseball,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.180
Baseball Collections as Data.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.270
This morning we're going
to hear a lot about a week

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.940
of rapid prototyping, designing,
collaboration, a little bit

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.040
of scrambling, maybe a
dash of magic as well.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.320
First I'd like to
introduce you to our Director

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.980
of Digital Strategy
at the Library

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.710
of Congress, Kate Zwaard.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.010
Kate's going to share
a little bit more

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.300
about the work that's
happening here at the Library,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.400
and we are delighted to
have her here with us.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.510
Thank you.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.190
[ Applause ]

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.600
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: Thank
you so much, Meghan.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.170
I'm thrilled to be here
to open today's events.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.650
I'm Kate Zwaard, the Library

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.160
of Congress's Director
of Digital Strategy.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.120
And on behalf of the
Library of Congress, LC Labs,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.900
the National Museum of African
American History and Culture,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.760
and JSTOR, I'd like
to welcome everybody

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.710
to the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.120
We're excited to
be able to share

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.730
with you today a week's
worth of very focused work.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.790
As you all know, Dr. Hayden
has brought a new vision

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.290
to the Library that we be
more user-centered and focused

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.150
on how we can reach
more people and interact

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.710
with them at a deeper level.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.010
And technology, I think,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.880
is a really great enabler
of that kind of work.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.790
This event highlights how
we can effectively partner

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.010
with our users and
create prototypes

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.740
that will make us more
effective and efficient.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.880
We'll be publishing a digital
strategy for the Library

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.310
of Congress in September
which will describe our plans

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.700
for reaching more
users with technology

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.890
and enabling further
access to our materials.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.860
To accomplish that work
we're going to lean on labs

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.940
and their ability to try new
things and test our assumptions.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.560
One of the things I love about
the culture of labs is our --

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.320
that we do things in the open

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.270
so that while we're learning
we're helping other learn.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.310
So we've learned to much from
JSTOR Labs here this week.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.650
We're thrilled that
they're here with us.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.820
So that's a great, great segue
into the past week and today.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.730
It's been a lively week
of looking at collections

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.780
and new ways of engaging users
inside and outside of our walls

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.580
and of flash-building.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.490
It's been a week of
shared learning and a week

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.990
of demonstrating the power

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.490
of computational
access to collections.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.820
We love thinking about the
different ways our collections

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.170
can be understood and power
of computation brings up a lot

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.850
of more opportunities.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.680
Today's going to be a
really thrilling day.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.360
We've got some wonderful
speakers up ahead.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.860
And we're going to get to
see some fantastic datasets

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.150
and prototypes which will be
useful to baseball researchers

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.200
and data analysis and,
hopefully, can form a model

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.930
for other types of collections.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.500
It's always fun to show what
could be quickly put together

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.340
when great minds are together.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.110
We'll be hearing from LC
Labs, from the National Museum

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.050
of African American History
and Culture, and JSTOR.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.800
And this afternoon
I'm excited to share

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.110
that we'll have Clinton Yates,
Rob Ruck, and Jordan Ellenberg

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.230
in a panel discussion.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.510
Okay? As the unofficial
umpire here, play ball!

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:41.550
[ Applause ]

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.740
&gt;&gt; I'm Jaime [laughter].

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.430
Okay, yeah.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.950
So my name is Jaime Mears,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.390
and I work for the LC Labs
team that Kate mentioned.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.120
I'm going to talk
a little bit --

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.760
I'm going to try to
frame the day for you,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.810
which is a big task, because
it's a little confusing.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.880
For those of you who dropped
in for the event today,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.340
the biggest point that I want
you to know from the start is

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.380
that we've been working
since Monday around the clock

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.590
to put together flash
build products

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.760
to help people research baseball
and discover our collections.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.420
And it's kind of crazy
that we did that.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.600
It's a very vulnerable exercise,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.540
and it's been really,
really fun.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.640
It's required all of us to
really trust each other.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.390
And so here we go.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.030
I'm going to try to help
explain why we did this

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.850
and why we're here.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.310
So inside baseball.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.060
This is the look
at inside baseball.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.460
I wanted to kick this
off with one of our --

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.780
an item from one of the Library

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.580
of Congress's baseball
collections.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.290
It's a picture of an
indoor baseball team

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.210
in Chicago, 1897 I believe.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.750
And it's considered to be --

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.930
they're considered to be
the first softball team

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.330
that ever existed.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.990
They seem more dapper than a lot

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.130
of the other baseball
pictures I've seen so far.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.730
People may be playing inside.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.770
I don't know.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.320
Makes you age better.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.560
This is inside baseball to
me when I think about it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.940
which may be scary
to some people here.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.580
So inside baseball
underneath is essentially data

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.070
and it's so much work.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.280
But it's so worth it, and
so, hopefully by the end

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.430
of this presentation
you'll see why I love this.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.360
So this is a picture
of the LC Labs team.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.730
If we were on a baseball card --

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.550
you know how they used to
do those like action shots

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.000
for teams that were staged.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.660
This is not staged, but it's
not very dynamic either.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.570
But if LC Labs had an
action baseball card,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.330
this would probably be us,
just kind of standing around

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.680
and problem-solving
together around a whiteboard.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.010
I wanted to mention
that our team --

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.770
you got Abby Potter here

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.580
who you'll actually see
her face quite soon, me,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.810
and Megan Ferriter,
who introduced the day.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.820
Not featured here
is half of our team.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.020
We just expanded to three more
people and they've joined us

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.380
because we're launching a
crowdsourcing transcription

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.300
and tagging application that's
going to launch in the fall.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.420
So if you -- if this talk makes
you interested in data at all,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.830
and you want to take
a hand in it,

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.920
then that opportunity is
going to happen quite soon.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.130
Okay. So I wanted to talk
a little about our goals

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.120
because they feed directly into
why we did this event this week.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.970
It's difficult for me -- wait.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.700
So the first one is enable
transformational experiences

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.090
by connecting users
with the Library

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.720
and its digital collections.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.330
So some people, people
ask us all the time,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.020
how do you measure impact?

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.780
And the way that we think about
it is if you see a photograph,

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.680
for example, whether it's
a dataset or a single item,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.710
and it transforms the way that
you think about American history

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.170
and culture, then
we've done our job.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.750
So that was partly the impetus
for the flash build this week.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.480
And then our second big
goal is to prototype ideas

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.520
and build relationship
with stakeholders

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.910
that will realize the
Library's digital strategy.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.280
So you heard from Kate earlier
we're launching a digital

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.730
strategy, a new digital
strategy, and it's Lab's job

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.260
to pilot some of those ideas in
small safe ways to see whether

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.100
or not they work for the Library
of Congress's environment.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.580
And then the last goal is
to strengthen our community

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.090
by sharing our work for
transparency, feedback,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.390
and knowledge exchange.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.000
So that's what we're doing
now in a very extreme sense

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.520
because we're going to
demo something for you live

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.490
that no one has ever
seen before.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.400
So another point of
this whole week is

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.740
that we spent a whole lot
of time documenting all

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.810
of the exercises we went
through through the flash build,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.670
all of the decisions
we made about --

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.970
around data transformation,

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.710
and that's something
that's a little scary

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.010
to do out in the open.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.310
But we feel it's
really important

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.960
because we all learn
from each other.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.290
So, hopefully, by the end of
the day there'll be a link

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.910
that we're going to share
through social media, et cetera,

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.600
pointing you to where
all our documentation is

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.450
so that you can take this back

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.360
to your own cultural
heritage institutions

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.660
or anywhere you work to think

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.110
about how you could
incorporate user-centered design

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.410
into what you do.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.230
Okay. And labs.loc.gov
is our home.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.140
If you want to follow us you
can sign up for our listserv.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.380
But essentially this is the
main place to find, you know,

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.730
information about us and the
prototype that we're going

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:54.050
to demo is going to live
here in our Experiments page.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.560
Okay. So LC Labs.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.860
Who are we?

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.160
Where did we come from?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.740
Two years ago, a little over two
years ago now, we were formed

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.220
and we hosted an event
called Collections as Data,

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.290
and we've actually done
that now two years running.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.410
And the point of Collections
as Data, if any of you went,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.050
was an all-day symposium
talking about what does it mean

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.810
to use data in cultural heritage
institutions, to get the public

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.480
to use it, what types of
possibilities are there

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.940
for thinking about
how to interact

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.650
with collections online
in different ways.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.670
And the first two years, the
symposiums were very talky,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.970
just like I'm doing now.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.650
You know, it was a lot of
experts coming together

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.970
to discuss these
really important issues.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.020
What we wanted to do this
year was take a spin off

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.510
of Collections as Data and
actually just build something.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.610
So that's kind of
the -- I would say

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.670
that in some ways this is
an unofficial third year

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.970
of Collections as Data,

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.760
but we're taking all the
lessons we've learned

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.830
and actually incorporating
them into the way that we work.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.010
So what do I mean by
Collections as Data?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.380
This is an example here of a
tutorial of how to use our API

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.520
if you were investigating
our baseball collections

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.460
which we have many of.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.760
So one of the things
that we know is

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.780
that people are aware
perhaps of what an API is.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.080
It's the underlayer

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.370
of information that's
underneath a website

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.660
that you can make calls to.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.900
But there's some
intimidation of what it means

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.020
or how it could possibly be
useful to someone who happens

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.940
to stumble upon our Lab site.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.620
So we've done a lot of work on
our site on a page called LC

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.210
for Robots of tutorials
for you to learn how

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.630
to perhaps investigate
our collections

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.600
through the data itself.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.220
And I encourage you
to look at that

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.520
if you get inspired
by this event.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.480
This is another example
of Collections as Data.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.640
This is an example of a
product that was built

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.110
by our Innovator-in-Residence,

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.900
so this is a program
that we started.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.070
And our current
Innovator-in-Residence is the

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.550
Data Artist, Jer Thorp.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.910
And the idea behind the
Innovator-in-Residence Program

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.510
is to try to inspire people to
think about collections and how

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.040
to explore them serendipitously
in innovative ways.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.800
And underlying that is data.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.040
So this example is the Library
of Color that Jer built.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.770
And what you're seeing
right now is an example

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.170
of a visual collection
where he took information

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:29.500
from every single record
from prints and photographs

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.910
and essentially compared
this to --

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.180
took words that you could
extrapolate to color

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.200
and then visualized those
colors into a rainbow.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.550
And this is a screenshot.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.120
But if you were to use a
strapdown, for example,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.840
and look at our literature
collection visualized in color,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.000
you'd essentially see blue
and black because it turns

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.590
out that a lot of titles of
books tend to represent darkness

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.750
or the ocean or something
like that.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.910
So you can actually, I think,
intuitively work your way

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.480
through the collections
and start

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:10.630
to extrapolate some theories
around formats and titles,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.090
plus it's just beautiful,
which is also fun

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.670
and valid in its own right.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.170
This is another take on
exploring the Library by color.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.550
This is an experiment that
exists on our Experiments page

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.240
that was made by Laura Wrubel,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.830
who was a Software
Development Librarian

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.990
in Residence with us at LC Labs.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.650
And what you're seeing
here is one

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.690
of our photograph
collections extrapolated

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.010
into color palettes.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:38.050
So each of these swatches of
color represents one item.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.750
And if you were to click
on it you'd jump back

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.280
to our lc.gov collection and
be able to explore that item.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.700
And she did visualize the
baseball card collection,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.620
so if you're curious
about seeing that,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.580
I would suggest you go onto
our Experiments site and look

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.170
at the baseball one because
it's incredibly beautiful

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.470
and colorful.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:02.950
Okay. So I've talked a little
bit about how we've kind

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.520
of had people come to the
Library to work with us,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.310
to experiment with our
collections and our data

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.690
in new ways to get
the public interested.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.950
This was a different angle
of trying to do that.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.550
We essentially wanted a wide
swath of people to create,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.630
and so we hosted a challenge
called the Congressional Data

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.800
Challenge and the point
of it was to get people

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.220
to produce some type
of application or tool

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.430
with legislative
data on congress.gov.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.310
And to our surprise -- so we
had a $5000 first place winner

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.580
and a $1000 best
high school winner.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.710
We had 17 entries.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.030
They were all pretty stellar.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.900
And these two high
schoolers, Alan Gomez Tagel

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.960
and Carter Neilsen, who are
going to be here next week

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.470
to get an award in person,
won the First Place Prize.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.720
So we ended up having our first

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.830
and second place winners
being high school students

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:03.260
out of all 17 which was amazing
and also made us really hopeful

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.540
that the future is looking
bright, that there are people

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.630
who are really interested
in taking our collections

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.420
and creating things out of them
in a way that's very active,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.060
and that's definitely
what we want to see.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.170
So you can look at all the other
apps through challenge.gov.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.300
There's 12 that were
submitted publicly.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.530
Carter and Alan's is up there,
the U.S. Treaties Explorer.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.870
But there's a bunch
of other ones.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.850
So if you are interested
in congressional data,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.010
I encourage you to take a look.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.850
Okay. So where we're going --

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.640
what does this have
to do with this week?

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.720
So Collections as Data,
essentially doing it instead

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.030
of just talking about it,
we were really inspired

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.850
by the Baseball Americana
Collection

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.150
because baseball
has a lot of stats.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.720
There's a lot of data.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.160
It's also a topic that
has a very wide reach.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.560
And so we thought it would
be a way to get enthusiasts

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.250
and members of the
general public thinking

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.530
about what we're obsessed
with, which is data.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.860
So JSTOR Labs approached us,
wanted to play ball with us,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.160
wanted to do something.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.260
And, you know, we thought,
oh, why don't we do something

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.560
around baseball collections.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.870
So it's something that we
can definitely do together.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.390
So we essentially are
being led by JSTOR

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.010
through this effort this week.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.650
They are facilitating us through
the first Data Jam that we did

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.810
as a team, through the first
flash build we did as a team.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.350
But we're also competing
with each other

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.170
because we're both going
to demo our own tools

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.970
that we've been working
on separately.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.320
Let's just be real
is what's happening.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.940
And so it's been really
fantastic to learn from them.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.240
This is not their first rodeo.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.540
They've done this with a bunch

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.880
of other cultural
heritage institutions.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.240
And it's really been fantastic.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.620
Another partner of --

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.230
or collaborator of ours this
week is the National Museum

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.140
of African American
History and Culture.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.240
So although they haven't been
with us kind of sweating it

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.780
out over keyboards for
the past four days,

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.930
[inaudible] been working with
us for the past several months

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:09.080
to essentially combine some of
the baseball digital collections

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.530
with the Library of Congress's.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.870
So, not to give too
much away, but the demo

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.560
that our LC Labs team
worked on this week is going

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.850
to let you kind of
seamlessly view National Museum

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.550
of African American History
and Culture baseball items

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.010
with Library of Congress items.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.960
So it's really, really special.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.550
And that is what you see here.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.850
So this is an exercise in love
because when you're talking

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.790
about bringing data together,
it's really a negotiation

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.910
of you know what is valuable
to you and your institution

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.370
and how you show
your collections.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.880
So this is, I think, one of
the best resources that's going

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.970
to come out of this event.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.100
This was the Data Jam that
we did, and the whole purpose

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.170
of this slide is essentially
to say that there's a lot

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.010
of people behind the
scenes that worked on this.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.520
We had curators from our
Photographs and Prints Division.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.560
We had baseball researchers.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.970
And then, of course, our
LC Labs team and JSTOR.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.120
It was a full house of people
trying to figure out how

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.390
to build things that would
get researchers interested.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.650
Grif doesn't know I
put this slide in.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.520
So another thing that was
really wonderful about this is

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.700
that the LC Labs team
got to work hand-in-hand

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.030
with Chris Adams, the
software developer

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.310
and Grif from UX designer.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.690
And we got to build
this tool together

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:28.990
which usually doesn't happen.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.580
We kind of, you know,
work inside in silos

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.200
and a project gets
passed around.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.500
But it was awesome

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.900
to see everyone's expertise
play out in real time.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.090
So this is Grif drawing
a very small preview

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.650
of what you're going
to see later --

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:44.260
wireframe of our
application that we built.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.900
So, hopefully, that set
the stage a little bit.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.820
I really wanted to make sure
that everybody here was aware

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.560
of just how much work has
gone into the week leading

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.150
up to what you're about to see.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.240
And for LC Labs, if
you're interested in any

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.180
of the experiments
that I shared with you

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.640
or you want more information

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.920
about the Congressional Data
Challenge or other challenges

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.190
that might be coming up, you
can email us at ndi@loc.gov,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.350
follow us on Twitter at LC
Labs, follow us on our Listserv,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.720
or go to our website
at labs.loc.gov.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.520
Okay. So that's it for me.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.200
So now I'm going to pass
it off to a collaborator

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.550
that I just mentioned,
the National Museum

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.360
of African American History and
Culture's Museum Specialist,

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.510
Courtney Bellizzi
and Emily Houf.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:44.310
[ Applause ]

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.930
&gt;&gt; Emily Houf: Good morning.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.940
I'm Emily Houf and this
is Courtney Bellizzi.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.880
And we're part of
the Digitization Team

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.910
at the Smithsonian
National Museum

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.470
of African American
History and Culture.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.780
Our team catalogs the Museum's
objects, digitizes them,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.620
and helps make the collection
information accessible

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.900
and discoverable for both
users inside the Museum

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.730
and outside the Museum.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.500
And today we're going to
talk to you a little bit

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.040
about the objects that we
featured in this dataset

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.810
for this project and how
we cataloged them and walk

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.650
through the datapoints together.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.690
The goal of the Museum is
to present American history

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.910
through an African
American lens.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.530
And what is more
American than baseball?

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.830
Although we knew the sport

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.870
of baseball plays
a significant role

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.720
in the exhibition sports
levelling the playing fields,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.870
and we're familiar with some
of our baseball objects,

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.370
we hadn't really ever done
a deep dive into the --

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:48.000
our baseball-related holdings
until we did this project.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.880
Once we pulled the data
together and began looking

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.680
at the various subjects and
object types that connect

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.780
with the term baseball, we
were not surprised to see

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.570
that America's favorite
sport appears all the way

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.450
through our collection, from Jim
Crow segregation in Mississippi

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.060
to the early days of
Hip-Hop in New York City.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.300
Looking at the numbers
within the dataset,

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.810
we have baseball objects
from 22 states including --

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.100
and the District of Columbia.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.700
16% of our objects are
from New York City and 8%

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.380
of our baseball-related objects
also have stories to tell

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.110
about the American South.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.480
If we compare types of objects,
8% are items of clothing

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.150
like jerseys and hats,
30% are part of the class

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.300
of objects we call
memorabilia and ephemera --

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.660
things like tickets,
programs, pennants,

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.500
pin-back buttons,
and autographs.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.590
The most well-represented class
of objects are photographs

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:59.140
and images, making up
44% of the dataset.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.190
Analyzing the subject terms
connected to baseball --

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:07.260
a remarkable 34% of our
collection, baseball collection,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.310
have stories related
to segregation,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.840
like this 1920s wood sweater
for the Eastern Colored League,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.940
and 4% of our objects
are related to musicians

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.460
such as this Texas Ranger's
uniform worn by Charlie Pride.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.750
Before he became one of country
music's most successful artist

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.310
ever, Pride was a
baseball player.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.970
He was a pitcher for
the Memphis Red Sox

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.560
and other Negro League teams
before he ever kissed an angel

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.130
good morning.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.160
Pride is now part owner
of the Texas Rangers

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.680
and at 84 years old still
trains with them every spring.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.030
We're able to connect baseball
across various collections

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.400
and subject areas
because we're committed

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.760
to consistent cataloguing
throughout our collection,

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.950
using the same standards,
vocabularies, and approach,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.830
regardless of department.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.970
This allows us to tie
together thematic threads

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.100
that appear throughout
the collection --

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.090
things like identity,
resistance, connection, and job.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.110
Starting with baseball, we
can follow the datapoints

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.570
through the three pillars
of history, community,

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:18.970
and culture that
form the collection.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.350
&gt;&gt; Courtney Bellizzi:
Good morning.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.730
So we're going to start with
our history collections,

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.660
and since it's All Star week
it's only appropriate to start

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.030
with a collection object that
harkens back to the beginning

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.510
of the All Star Games.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.260
This pennant from about 1933
celebrates the Negro League's

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.010
East-West All Star Game.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.460
The Negro Leagues established

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.560
in 1885 gave African American
ballplayers who, due to racism,

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.250
were not accepted to play in
other major and minor leagues,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.970
a chance to play professionally.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:56.020
The East-West All Star Game
began in 1933, the same year

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.880
that the MLB All Star
Game was established.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:04.610
The game was generated to
start as a way for the owners

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.780
to generate money essentially.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.490
But the game became
so much more.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.140
It was a way to help legitimize
the Negro League teams

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.270
and the African American
professional baseball players.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.300
The game was the
preeminent sporting event

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.600
for African Americans.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.280
Celebrities like Count
Basie, Alice Fitzgerald,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.560
Joe Lewis would attend,
and Lena Horne even threw

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.890
out the first pitch of the
very first All Star Game.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.950
And though these games were
celebrated, they still stood

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.050
as a stark reminder that
professional baseball,

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.920
like many aspects of American
society, was segregated.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.530
When we look at the datapoints,
the term segregation is used

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.750
to convey this very
important aspect of history.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.340
The term also links
us to our next object,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.290
a poster about the integration
of the Detroit Tigers.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.500
This is nicely [inaudible] done.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.630
In 1947, Jackie Robinson
stepped onto the field to play

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.930
for the Brooklyn Dodgers

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.900
and desegregated
Major League Baseball.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.650
Not all teams were
quick to follow.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.700
In 1958, the Detroit Tigers
were the second-to-last team

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.400
to integrate when Ozzie
Virgil, Senior joined the team.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.510
Virgil was born in
the Dominican Republic

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.650
and was the first
person of African descent

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.710
to join the Tigers, and was
also the first Dominican

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.010
to play in MLB.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.830
On June 6, 1958, Virgil went
five for five in his debut

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.320
with the Tigers, and despite
occurring more than 10 years

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.090
after Robinson's first
game, the integration

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.120
of the Tigers was
still met with protest

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.680
from staunch segregationists,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.530
including Detroit City
Council Member Billy Rogell.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:38.430
He was also a former shortstop
for the Detroit Tigers.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.050
Rogell opposed Virgil's
appointment

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.200
to the team vehemently.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.260
And this poster here sends a
clear message to Mr. Rogell

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.150
about his policies and
beliefs and gives us a glimpse

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.330
into race relations in the
city of Detroit in 1958.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.610
As you can see, several
subjects have been attributed

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.480
to this object including
segregation,

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.740
civil rights, and
race relations.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.450
Using the term race relations,

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.880
we can move to our next
related object type,

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.700
a magazine from 1960
featuring notable African

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.170
American athletes.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.560
As professional sports
became integrated,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.770
African American athletes
soon became household names.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.550
Though African American
athletes became mainstream,

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.190
they were still viewed as other
as evidenced by this issue

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.030
of <i>Sport Magazine </i>from 1960.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.910
The title of the issue
is "Sport, Special Issue,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.330
the Negro in American Sport."

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.590
And it still conveys this idea

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.580
that African American
athletes needed to be looked

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.600
at separately from their
white counterparts.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.870
The term race relations
was used for this object

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.870
because <i>Sports Magazine </i>was
founded in 1946 and was one

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.190
of the first national
sports publications,

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.660
and serves as an example

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.960
of how African American
athletes' achievement were

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.850
covered by mass media.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.720
The magazine features
notable athletes include Wilt

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.950
Chamberlain, Willie Mays, Althea
Gibson, and Jackie Robinson.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:26:00.020
From a data perspective, all of
these athletes become subjects

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.820
of the collection object,
so that this object appears

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.900
when any of the aforementioned
names are searched.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.980
Let us look at the
datapoint Jackie Robinson

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.810
to move along to
our next dataset.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.410
Our next set of objects focus

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.880
around NMHC's collection
theme of community.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.540
Using the subject term
Jackie Robinson and a search

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.430
of our internal databases
brings up a variety of objects,

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.420
including a ring,
magazines, and photographs.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.320
The collection objects
span different aspects

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.700
of Jackie Robinson's career,
not only as a baseball player,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.370
but as a family man and activist
who impacted both baseball

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.940
and African American community.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.460
For instance, let's take a look
at this photograph from 1954

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.780
of Jackie Robinson
and Harry Owens.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.430
Here Robinson is out of uniform,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.400
receiving a Lifetime
Membership Award

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.130
to the Irene Kaufmann
Settlement House in Pittsburgh,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.490
Pennsylvania for
his charity work.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.960
The photograph was taken

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.220
by a community photographer
named Charles "Teenie" Harris.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.840
Harris was founded --
Harris had a connection

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.020
to baseball actually because he
helped found and was a player

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.600
for the Crawford Colored Giants

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.640
who later became the
Pittsburgh Crawfords.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.240
So there's another little
baseball connection in there.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.760
But Harris was known as
"One-Shot," not in a reference

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.860
to his baseball career, but in
reference to his photography.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.270
His photography mainly
focused on the Hill District

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.150
which is a African American
community in Pittsburgh,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.800
and his more than
80,000 images provide one

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.670
of the most complete
documentations

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.640
of a minority community
in the United States.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.460
When cataloging this
photograph, it's important

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.290
that the data not only leads
us to these researchers,

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.410
to Jackie Robinson, but
also to "Teenie" Harris,

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.810
the notable community
photographer.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.610
Using another datapoint from
this object, the date, 1954,

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.210
it will lead us to
another photograph taken

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.290
by another community
photographer, Ernest C. Withers.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:01.140
Around 1954, Ernest C.
Withers took this portrait

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.670
of Connie Morgan.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.470
Withers, a well-known
photojournalist,

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.490
documented African
American communities

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.070
in the segregated
South for 60 years.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.000
Morgan was the third woman

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.260
to play professional
baseball in the Negro League.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.090
She joined the Indianapolis
Crowns in 1954

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:20.160
as a second baseman and
replaced the first woman

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.360
who joined the Leagues,
Toni Stone.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.290
Though many saw having women
join the teams as a gimmick

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.470
to increase sales after
the integration with MLB,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.060
many journalists who covered
the Negro Leagues also wrote

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.070
about the women's skill
and talent as players.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:40.240
For example, an article covering
the Crowns' game on May 29,

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.800
1954, featured in the <i>Afro
American </i>, noted, quote,

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.570
"Morgan electrified over
6000 fans when she went far

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.620
to her right to make
a sensational stop,

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.930
slip the shortstop, Bill Holder,

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.960
and started a lightning
double-play

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.670
against the Birmingham
Barons," end quote.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.050
Morgan's great double play
excited this large community

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.350
of fans.

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.650
And what we find that's

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.680
so prevalent throughout our
Museum's Baseball Collections is

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.510
this tie to community.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.630
This time, let us turn to
the object type Portraits

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.510
to see how this portrait of
Connie Morgan can link us

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.490
to another object
reflecting community

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:17.790
within the Museum's collections.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.610
&gt;&gt; Emily Houf: The object
type Portraits brings us

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.270
to the collection
of the photographer,

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.510
the Reverend Henry C. Anderson.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.270
Anderson was the local portrait
photographer in Greenville,

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.640
Mississippi from 1947
through the 1970s.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.600
Nearly every m4mber
of the black community

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.290
of Greenville had their portrait
taken by Reverend Anderson

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.400
at one point or another.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.650
Anderson documented all
aspects of Greenville's family

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.870
and community life during
Jim Crow segregation,

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.780
including new babies, birthdays,
weddings, anniversaries,

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.540
graduations, church groups,
community clubs, and, of course,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.630
the Little League teams
like this one here.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.720
So we've just seen how our
subject terms can take us

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.420
through several community
photographers.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.100
But if we use the classification
Media Arts Photography,

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.050
where all of our photographs
and images are grouped under,

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.300
we can expand and will
find the IGME Collection

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.920
of Hip-Hop Photography
where perhaps, surprisingly,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.400
we also find baseball.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:31.290
This leads us to the Culture
section of our objects.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:37.230
In this photograph of KRS-One
taken by Al Pereira in 1991,

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.470
the rapper sports
the iconic pinstripes

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.310
of the New York Yankees.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:45.820
KRS-One is an influential
MC from the South Bronx.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.320
He started his career as
part of the duo Boogey

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.820
Down Productions before going
solo after the shooting death

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.000
of his partner, DJ
Scott La Rock.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.560
And being from the South
Bronx, KRS-One's affinity

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.250
for Yankees' gear
signifies his ties

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.350
to the birthplace of hip-hop.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.560
Using athletic wear, and
baseball teams in particular,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.440
in this way, is a common style
for hip-hop stars like KRS-One.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.450
And if we follow the
term hip-hop we'll see

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.690
another example.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.190
This is perhaps the supreme
example of the intersections

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:27.350
of baseball, music, and fashion,
the iconic baseball cap.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.750
I learned recently, yesterday,

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.540
that baseball historians
credit Tom Selleck

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.580
with popularizing the
off-the-field baseball cap trend

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.370
in the 1970s.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.910
But I think we can all agree

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.410
that hip-hop is largely
responsible

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.550
for the longevity of the trend.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.980
This purple Atlanta Braves
cap from the rapper Big Boy,

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.210
who is one-half of
the group Outcast,

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.780
was made by the preeminent
manufacturer of baseball caps,

00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:00.450
New Era Cap Company, which has
been making caps since 1920.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.490
This particular hat was
a limited release in 2013

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:08.370
in conjunction with Big Boy's
solo album, "Vicious Lies

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.250
and Dangerous Rumors."

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:15.770
In early June, 2013, fans who
attended a CD signing by Big Boy

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:20.200
at the New Era store in Atlanta
also received this limited

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.120
edition hat inspired
by the album.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.690
Big Boy and Outcast
is known as the group

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.610
that brought southern
hip-hop into the mainstream,

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:33.810
and Big Boy is seldom seen
without his signature Braves hat

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.700
to rep his home town of Atlanta.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.680
This hat has the
sub-classification,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.580
Clothing Fashion.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.390
But if we follow the main class,
Clothing, or the subject term,

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.790
Clothing and Dress, we end up
back in the traditional world

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.230
of baseball with this Cardinals'
jersey that was [inaudible] worn

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.180
by Curt Flood in 1966.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.050
Flood was an All-Star
player and a centerfielder

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.540
for the St. Louis Cardinals.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.760
He won Gold Glove seven
consecutive seasons

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.560
from 1963 to 1969.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.150
And during Flood's 11
seasons on the team,

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:15.870
the Cards won three pennants and
earned two World Series rings.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.230
When Flood refused to accept a
trade away from the Cardinals

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.790
in 1969, his challenge to the
Reserve Clause helped in usher

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.560
in the Free Agency System
which was transformative

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.780
for the culture of baseball.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.510
Flood wrote a letter to the
Baseball Commissioner reading,

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:35.760
"After 12 years in
the Major Leagues,

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.910
I do not feel I am a piece
of property to be bought

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:42.180
and sold irrespective
of my wishes.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.220
I believe that any
system which produces

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.040
that result violates my
basic rights as a citizen

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.240
and is inconsistent with the
laws of the United States

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.510
and of the several states."

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.560
Flood's subsequent lawsuit
again Major League Baseball was

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.780
unsuccessfully argued in front
of the Supreme Court in 1972

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.730
which sided with the League.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:08.000
But it eventually led to the end

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.870
of the reserve system
a few years later.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:17.270
Twenty-six years later, with
the Curt Flood Act of 1998,

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.710
Congress declared Major
League Baseball subject

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.510
to antitrust laws like
any other corporation.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:27.100
Flood is also responsible
for the 10-5 Rule,

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.080
which is often known as the
Curt Flood Rule which states

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.600
that when a player has play for
a team for five straight years,

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.150
and played in the Major League
for a total of 10 years,

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.680
they have to give the club
their consent to be traded.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.970
Although Flood's
legacy is larger

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:46.670
than the time he spent playing
with the Cardinals, well,

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:51.030
we can use the team name to
follow to our final object,

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.590
Minnie Roundtree's Radio.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:59.010
Mini Roundtree was a
diehard Cardinals fan,

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.090
living in the rural
community of Lyles Station

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.340
in Gibson County, Indiana.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.790
Her husband, Herman,
bought her this radio

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.010
so that she could listen
to the games and keep

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.970
up with her favorite team.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:15.340
And the story of Minnie and
her radio is a favorite of mine

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.090
because she reminds me of
my own grandmother who,

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.950
at 94 years old, never
misses a Cardinals game.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.340
&gt;&gt; Courtney Bellizzi: Well,

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.500
thanks for taking the little
journey through our collections.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.310
And it's just a small sample of
the collections that we shared

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.960
for the event with LOC.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.550
But, as this graphic shows,
by following a variety

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.970
of datapoints we've been able
to share and explore this group

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.680
of baseball-related collections

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.020
from the Negro Leagues
to hip-hop.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.800
We were able to connect each
object based on a set of terms,

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.170
classifications, and
cataloging fields.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:54.670
However, we could have utilized
a totally different set of terms

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.490
and datapoints to come up
with a totally different set

00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:58.790
of objects.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.530
That's the exciting part about
our collaboration with LOC

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.190
and JSTOR and the
flash build team

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.650
who have taken a deep
dive into our data.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.130
What is important is that the
data is consistent and clean.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.850
And so that way people
can utilize it in ways

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:15.690
that we can't even imagine.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.160
On behalf of Emily and myself,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.350
we would like to thank our
NMHC Digitization Team,

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.650
the cataloguers

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.040
who painstakingly make sure
our records are accurate

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.920
and consistent, the curators
who review all of our records,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.650
Doug Remley, Laura
Coil, Aileen Nichols,

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.490
and Damion Thomas [assumed
spellings] for its curator,

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.630
for their support on this
project, the team at Library

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.160
of Congress, especially Julia
Hickey who cleaned the data

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.710
and pulled together
the cross [inaudible],

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.340
nd the team at JSOR and,
again, the flash build team

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.690
who worked all this week

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.240
and participated in
this great event.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.540
Thank you for having us

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.510
and I hope you enjoy
the rest of your day.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:37:03.750
[ Applause ]

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.050
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: All right.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.350
Thanks so much to the NMHC Team.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:11.800
Next we have Alex Humphreys from
JSTOR Labs who's going to come

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.830
up and share about
what their wonderful is

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.130
and what they've been up to,

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.920
and you'll see the first
demo, hopefully [laughter].

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.180
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: I don't
get to see the presentation,

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.480
or I do from a very
strange vantage point.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.780
Hi, everybody.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.100
I'm Alex Humphreys.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:40.250
I'm the Director of JSTOR Labs.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:45.620
And I want to start just by
thanking the Library of Congress

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.160
for being such amazing
hosts and going

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.490
on this very quick
adventure with us.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:56.430
A week, a lot of things happen
in a week, and they have been

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.600
so supportive and eager

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.180
and in every step along
the way just wanted to jump

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.070
in with both feet and do.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.600
And we find in our
team that learning

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.610
by doing is just the best
possible way, and we'll share

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.860
as we go some of the
things that we've learned.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.150
So, first a little bit
of context just for those

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:21.160
of you are aren't familiar with
JSTOR or the JSTOR Labs Team.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.810
JSTOR is a part a
nonprofit called ITHAKA

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.550
which helps the academic
community embrace

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.850
digital transformation.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:34.480
We have a number of different
brands within it dealing

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.430
with digital preservation, with
art, and strategy and research.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.250
JSTOR is a digital archive of
academic literature primarily,

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:48.640
so it's got 10 million
articles and tens of thousands

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.860
of academic books
spanning centuries

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.760
of the scholarly record.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.230
So these are the
academic journals that,

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.700
if you're writing,
if you're a scholar,

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.780
or writing your dissertation,
you're doing that research,

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:07.210
and you do that often these days
online with tools like JSTOR.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.280
It's especially prominent in the
humanities and social sciences,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.230
and it has a number of --
it's multidisciplinary,

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.420
so if you are anywhere
within those fields,

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.670
you'll often dip into JSTOR.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.380
There we go.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.270
The JSTOR Labs Team is
a relatively small team

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.970
within that organization.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:32.900
You know, there's
five/six/seven of us.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:38.450
And our job is to build
experimental tools, and we --

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.700
to sort of show the future of
what research can look like.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.890
We do it -- and the
best way to see that is

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.350
through some examples
which I'll walk you

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.830
through in just a second.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.530
We approach all of these
projects collaboratively.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.290
Wherever possible, we work
with partners like the Library

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.070
of Congress here,
and we do so openly.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.130
So we share all the
work that we develop.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.430
We share the code if we can,

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.910
the content wherever
a copyright allows,

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.240
and make that as
open as possible.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.770
And we also do it as
quickly as possible,

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.350
all the way down to
doing things in one week.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:15.450
So I think it will be helpful
just to get a feel for that

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.820
so see a few of the things
that we've done in the past.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.490
These are a little
bit more polished

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.790
than what you'll see at the end.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:26.500
But they'll give you a
feel for what we've done.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:32.970
So if we can jump to the
browser that would be wonderful.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.340
There we go.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.830
Okay. So the first
project was --

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.540
we did this just
across the street

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.380
at the Folger Shakespeare
Library.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.320
Developed it maybe about
a couple of years ago.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.170
And this is Understanding
Shakespeare.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.180
So if you're studying
Shakespeare,

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.360
what this allows you to do --

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.060
it has all of the
plays of Shakespeare,

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.520
and I'd go ahead and
click on any one.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.250
It has all of the plays

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.770
of Shakespeare and
all of the texts.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.390
And what we were trying
to do was find a new way

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.300
for those people who
were studying and writing

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.120
about Shakespeare to
research that work.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.580
So you'll see this
the text of <i>Hamlet </i>.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:17.340
The Folger Library has these
amazing digital editions

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.540
of Shakespeare which
are openly available.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.090
When we approach these
projects they're not sort

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.700
of transactional, they're not --

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.570
they're very open
and collaborative.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:32.700
And I describe them
often as play dates.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.490
You have your toys
and I have my toys,

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.280
and let's go play
in that sandbox.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.590
And their toys were these
digital editions of Shakespeare.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.210
So if you see -- the play on the
left, and that's from Folger.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.160
And in the middle there
are all those numbers.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.240
If you click on one of
those numbers, that's --

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.180
each one of those is the
number of articles in JSTOR

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.400
that quote that specific line.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.390
And we have that for every line
of every play of Shakespeare.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:59.190
And then if you hover over
any of those, you can --

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:02.620
any of the thumbnails, you can
see how it quotes that article,

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.350
quotes that particular line.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.450
And if you're a student, it
can help you interpret it.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.120
If you're a scholar,
you can see how

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.740
that line has been
interpreted through the ages.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.410
And if you're -- if you've
got a digital humanities bent,

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.130
you can -- we have
an API for this

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:22.190
so that you can build
visualizations on the -

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:26.600
how Shakespeare has been studied
and quoted through two centuries

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.290
of academic literature.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:31.380
So this was released
a couple of years ago.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.320
This is the kind of
tool that we build.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.150
And this has had a
really great response.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.280
It's now being included
in syllabi.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.680
Teachers often tell us that
this is a really great way

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.170
for students to first dive
into academic literature

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:51.510
which can be really daunting and
hard with keyword search and --

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.270
it can be -- they're used to
Google and going to the library.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:59.190
And this is a very easy
way to get into that.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:02.630
We now just -- to give
you -- to tease something,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.660
we're currently working
on an expansion

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.630
of this called Understanding
Great Works which we hope

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:11.130
to go live later this summer,

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.820
which will be this
same functionality

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.420
for more than Shakespeare.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:20.240
It will include the Kings James
Bible as well as a selection

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.540
of British literature that we're
working on with the <i>Studies</i>

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.160
<i>in English Literature
Journal </i>.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.750
So we're really excited
about that.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:30.300
And if you're interested,
follow JSTOR Labs,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.140
follow me on Twitter, and
we'll let you know, or JSOR.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.870
So that's one tool.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.260
We built the core of
this functionality

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.480
in a previous Labs Week,
and then we spent a lot

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.090
of time making it look prettier

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.550
and be a little bit
more perfect,

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.250
and adding the rest
of the plays.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.990
So let's jump to another
example of something

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:54.650
that we've done,
a text analyzer.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:58.070
As I said, academic
research can be daunting

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:01.180
and challenging and
in various ways.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.220
And text analyzer we
envisioned as a different way

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.550
of doing research to
overcome some of the hurdles.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.700
So text analyzer -- so for
those of you who aren't familiar

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.600
with it, academic
research is often done

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.650
through either citation mining,

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:20.770
meaning you follow bibliography
one to the next to the next,

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.760
or by keyword search like
you would do in Google,

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.800
but in an academic database

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.750
or in something called
Google Scholar.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.430
But those keywords and all
that can be challenging

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:36.250
to a new student and if you're
doing the citation mining,

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.880
you can get stuck in a
particular, in a silo.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.280
So what text analyzer does
is it changes that by instead

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.530
of searching with words,
you search with a document.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.450
So if you've either found an
article that is already perfect

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.230
and about what you're
writing about,

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.080
or if you've written
the first draft

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.960
of your paper, you
can upload it.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.210
So if we can drag the
sample document over.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:00.950
You just drag and drop it over,

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:03.990
and what it does is it reads
the document and it figures

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.670
out what the document is about.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.180
And it does that not just
by looking at the words,

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.670
but the implied words.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.920
It uses a technology called
Natural Language Processing

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:19.030
and topic models to figure out
the implied words in addition

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.880
to the explicitly
mentioned ones.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.640
It calls attention to those
and tells you what it found,

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.840
suggests another selection of
them in case there are some

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.540
that are really important to
you, and then gives you articles

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.930
in JSTOR, articles in book
chapters in JSTOR that are

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.480
about the same materials.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.660
You can then, you
know, adjust the --

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.720
we call it the equalizer at
the top which is a metaphor

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.460
that probably nobody
gets anymore [laughter].

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:50.750
You can add new terms and then,

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:54.000
when you find the articles you
want, you can download this.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.610
This actually just won an
award a couple of weeks ago,

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.730
which we're really
proud about, proud of.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.680
And this is available
right on the JSTOR site.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.220
All these tools that
we build are just

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.680
so -- are openly available.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.540
The access to the
JSTOR Scholarship is --

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.220
that will often come
through your institution.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.160
But if you're a -- if you're
not a member of a university

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.790
or a library, much of that
content is available for free.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:21.090
Some of it with registration.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.900
Some of it is pure open access.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:31.560
Okay. That was the other example
of something we've done before.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.140
Let's get to the fun stuff of
what we actually did this week.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.970
So if we can go back
to the PowerPoint.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.900
Great. We showed you that.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.410
We showed you that.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.560
All right.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.980
So, first of all, we
wanted to build --

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.480
we knew that we wanted to build
a tool for -- about baseball.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.860
And what I'll do is I'll
walk you through the process,

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.570
sort of the story
of this project.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.880
It's the story that we've
been leading the Library

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.730
of Congress Team through this
week, and sort of enjoying

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.900
that process with them.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.250
I will say, every time we
do this, it's different.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:20.050
We're learning all the time
and trying to experiment.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:24.430
This is the first time we've
done sort of the parallel play

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.160
of two teams working,
evidently in competition.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.200
Here I thought it was
like the All Star Game

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.500
where it didn't matter.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.800
And it turns out it's
like the All Star Game

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.840
where it totally matters.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.320
But, it's okay.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.620
We're up for that.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.920
We're up for the battle.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.950
So let me walk you this process.

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.260
This process -- we talked about
it, I should say, as something

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.850
that happens all in one week.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:49.150
It's true.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.780
A lot of work goes
on in that week.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:56.550
But you can't -- I mean, you run
a marathon all in one, you know,

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:59.070
for me, five hour
[laughter] period.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.280
But there's a lot of work
to prepare for these weeks.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:06.090
So I don't want to minimize
all of the preparatory work.

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.980
That's really important
and it helps us

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.280
to run fast these weeks.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.650
So I'll walk through those
-- that process a little bit

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:16.690
and then we'll show you what we
came out with at the other end.

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.040
Okay. So I mentioned earlier

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.670
when describing the Folger
Understanding Shakespeare

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:28.130
Project, that we treat these
projects kind of like playdates.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:32.180
And we just decide
what is the sandbox.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.380
When we talked to the
Library of Congress Team,

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.200
they suggested organizing this

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.820
around the Baseball Americana
Exhibit because baseball was

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.150
such -- it had so much
interest generally,

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:50.040
it was multidisciplinary, and
there could be a lot of interest

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.210
and multidisciplinary in
a way that aligns well

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.110
with JSTORs collection.

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.000
So focusing on baseball
seemed really exciting.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.140
And I will say, personally,
I'm such a baseball nerd.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.490
I'm so happy that
we could do this.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.840
There was no way we were
not doing this as soon

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.140
as that was suggested.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.580
This has been so much fun,
especially to meet some

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.330
of my favorite baseball
writers through this process.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.820
So we knew we wanted
to work with baseball,

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.780
but what exactly were we
going to do with baseball?

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.240
We wanted a little
bit more definition.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.120
And because the Library of
Congress Team had their content,

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.360
and JSTOR had our content, and
they're not exactly the same.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.320
They're quite different.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.850
And then when you bring in the
Smithsonian, the National Museum

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.740
of African American History
and Culture, their content --

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.060
we were really interested
in finding ways to bring all

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.370
of that content together to tell
a story and really make it sing.

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.910
And so we were interested
in trying to do

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:47.780
that using linked open
data which I won't get

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.810
into the technology of because
I'd probably mess that up.

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:54.240
But linked open data is
also called the Smart Web.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.340
It's more than just links, but
it knows about the information.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.150
And we've been working
through that with Wikidata,

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:04.040
a part of the Wikimedia
to enable that.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.930
So I'll show a little bit
about what comes from that.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:10.920
So the idea here was multiple
corpora, multiple collections

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.270
of content, and using linked
open data to connect them.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:17.720
And that's what we wanted
to find a way to do.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.300
I'll tell you a little bit
about the content in JSTOR

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.910
and how we went about
collecting that data.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.820
We'll probably publish some
logs or something that get

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.400
into this in more detail.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:34.610
But just so you have the context
for that, we started with --

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.300
by selecting a set of content
in JSTOR that is about baseball.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.670
We did that using a
topic model similar

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:43.820
to what powers text
analyzer that you saw.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:48.290
So it looked at all of the words
within every article to find

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.330
out the likelihood that that
article is about baseball,

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.490
even if the word is not used.

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:57.790
And we've ended up coming up
with about 25,000 articles

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:02.520
through the centuries of content
in JSTOR, articles in chapters

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.260
that were about baseball.

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:07.780
We then used some, again,
natural language processing

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.580
to pull out the people and
places and organizations

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.330
from those articles so
that we could connect it

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.890
into the other collections.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:22.440
We then used Wikidata
to limit those people,

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.890
places and organizations to
those related to baseball.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.850
Not all of the people in every
article was a baseball person.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.540
We wanted to keep
it focused on --

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.050
really do a deep
dive on baseball.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:38.900
And that allowed us to create
what's called a knowledge graph.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.810
And then we were able to plug

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.400
into that knowledge graph
the material from Library

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:49.810
of Congress and the Smithsonian
and also some material,

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:53.190
some additional data
that's in Wikidata.

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:56.190
And that's as geeky
as we'll get.

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.300
At least that kind of geeky.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.340
There's so many kinds of
geeky that we embrace.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.170
So that's the preparation
on the technology side.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:07.680
But that's not all that we do
in preparation for these weeks.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.310
If we're building a tool
for baseball researchers,

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.930
people studying baseball,
we have some theories

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.320
about what might be helpful.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.510
We know how people
research generally.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.600
But we don't know the
exact issues facing

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.170
baseball researchers.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.230
And so we solve that
problem by talking to them.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:29.410
We did, I think,
seven interviews

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:31.410
with baseball researchers
of all sorts.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:35.160
I talked to my favorite sports
journalist in the world.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.630
We talked to Joe Posnanski.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:38.930
He's awesome.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:43.320
We talked to historians
of baseball,

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:46.230
cultural studies people.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:50.610
We talked to students
and scholars.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:53.490
And in doing that we tried

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:57.060
to understand what are their
challenges, what are the things

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.810
that they have to overcome
that's specific to baseball?

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:02.900
We had to understand their
goals and their practices

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.990
so that we could help them
achieve their goals a little

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:07.370
faster or overcome
one of the hurdles.

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:09.090
And so some examples
-- and this --

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:13.000
I should say this Joe
Pearlman is not a real person.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.380
This is the embodiment
of those seven.

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:19.070
We sort of shoot them up,
wrapped them up, and put them

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:24.800
into one personification, and
it's Joe, who's a fine guy.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.020
So, for example, they --

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.610
everybody we talked to that
taught the baseball history

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.210
related classes said that on
the first day of class they had

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.080
to overcome the fact
and tell their students

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.520
that this class is not
about last night's game,

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.190
it's not about how Brace
Harper's really stinking

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:42.490
this year.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:47.380
It's about looking at America
and the story of America,

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:52.300
race relations and labor
relations and capitalism and all

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.290
of these wonderful --
and hopes and dreams.

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:59.640
But it's looking at the story
of America through baseball.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.740
And the walkthrough that we
just got of the National Museum

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.050
of African American History
and Culture was really

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:07.020
such a great embodiment
of that story.

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.390
It was really wonderful.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:12.880
And all of these people that
we talked to got as excited

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.080
about those stories and
wanting to be able to tell them.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.210
I'd go through their
books or their lectures.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:19.110
We wanted to find ways
to make it even easier

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.410
for them to do so.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.950
So that was the work we did
over the past couple of months,

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:33.320
leading up to Monday when
we all came down here.

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.580
And the first thing we
did on Monday was --

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.650
I think Jaime had a
picture of this as well --

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:40.950
was lead a Design Jam.

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:44.900
And these are called a
few different things.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.630
Sometimes called Design James.

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:50.790
I've called them Idea Jams,
Design Studios sometimes.

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:52.570
There are various ways --

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.920
it's a structured
brainstorming technique,

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.250
and there's a few different
steps that you go through.

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:02.580
And the first one is the one you
see here on these Post-It Notes

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:07.910
that Jessica, who's awesome, and
in the back, is ably leading.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:11.870
An empathy map is a way to
highlight and bring together all

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:13.420
of that research on users

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.210
and baseball researchers
that we'd done.

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.480
Sort of brainstorming
what are their big goals,

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.170
what are the tasks
that they need to try

00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:21.840
to achieve, what
are the hurdles?

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.520
Because those can spark
ideas for what we can do

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.390
to make -- to help them.

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:30.000
From there -- this was all --

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.580
this Design Jam was
a couple of hours.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.720
It was a quick brainstorming
session.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.630
We did something
called an eight-by-eight

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:38.050
which are what you see here.

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.620
You see pages and pages
of pieces of paper

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:47.250
with eight squares and everybody
in the room worked silently.

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:50.500
Had eight minutes to draw
eight different ideas.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.840
They then presented their
ideas to the entire room,

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.870
and we did it again
sharing those ideas.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:01.340
And it's a really wonderful
way to very quickly come

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.340
up with lots of ideas.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.490
And these were all based on, and
responding to the empathy map.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.490
They build on it, helping --

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.170
each one would help a
user achieve their goals

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.470
or overcome a hurdle.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.800
And some of the ideas
aren't fully formed.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.310
None of them are fully formed.

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:20.320
Some of them are
more fully formed.

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.620
But they help each other,

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.500
and it's a very generative
approach to brainstorming.

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:28.210
We then ended the
Design Jam by dot voting.

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:30.040
Everybody had three dots,
could choose the things

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.270
that were most exciting,
and that gave us a heat map

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:35.690
of the ideas that
were most exciting.

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:41.260
From there -- so we ended that
with five or six general ideas

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.360
that we were excited to explore.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.670
But we need to have a way
to choose between those.

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:48.840
And one of the hallmarks, and
one of the important parts

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:53.160
of these Labs Weeks is
it's focused effort,

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.750
but it's iterative effort,
even within the week.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.560
It's not just one week of work.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.360
We've had baseball
researchers coming

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.300
in to pretty much
every day this week,

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:07.760
and at each step we'd be showing
baseball researchers our works

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.430
in progress, of where we are so
far, and using their feedback

00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:13.140
to help us make decisions.

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.150
So at this point we had,

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:17.540
we created a set of
paper prototypes.

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.450
And you saw a picture
in Jaime's presentation

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:22.350
of Grif doing this
on the LC Team.

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:26.340
Paper prototypes of different
ways that we could go

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.560
about using linked open data

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:32.430
to help baseball
researchers do this.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:33.730
There's a map.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:38.050
There was a Chrome filter
that gave us a baseball lens

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:40.610
when you're reading
about anything.

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:44.690
And then there's this idea
called cultural history baseball

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:48.020
cards, and that's the one
that we ended up running with.

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.750
So then the rest of the week --

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.930
so by Tuesday we knew
what we wanted to build.

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:54.150
It might even have
been Monday afternoon.

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:57.330
So then it was about rapidly
refining and making --

00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:58.990
turning that idea into a thing

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.910
that actually exists
in the world.

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.390
So this -- so I'll
show you quickly what

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:05.690
that evolution looked like,

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.440
and then we'll get
to the actual site.

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.610
So this was the Design
Jam sketch.

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:16.990
You can see it's pretty
unclear what it is.

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:18.290
It's very sketchy.

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.970
There's a couple -- a
little bit of a flow there.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:24.040
And sometimes with these you'll
have multiple sketches all

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.340
talking about the same idea.

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.640
And we'll bring those together.

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.210
That turned into the paper
prototype which turned

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:34.830
into the first design mock-up
which we'd show on screen

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:38.030
to users to get feelings
for whether they liked --

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:39.770
whether the thought the
idea could be useful,

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.060
where they were confused,
what made sense.

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.840
At this point people
were getting confused

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.800
between baseball
cards and car --

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.490
and like they thought this was
a collection of baseball cards.

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:53.600
They weren't seeing the
links to the materials.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:59:00.740
And there were all sorts
of other problems, too.

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.530
But that's why we
do the research.

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.270
And that makes it kind
of fun and exciting.

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:07.980
This is a further
refinement of the design.

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.470
And so now you can see
on the baseball card

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:15.060
for Jackie Robinson, the
cultural history baseball card.

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.110
You know, on a baseball card,
if you're familiar with them,

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:19.680
there's often physical
-- there's the stats,

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.420
their batting average,
their ERA, year-by-year

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.280
on the lower -- on
the back of the card.

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.780
But on the cultural
history baseball cards,

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:33.000
you can get that stuff,
those baseball stats

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.980
at baseballreference.com or
any other wonderful place.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.880
Instead we have stats about
their cultural history.

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:44.690
So these are links to and stats
about the scholarly articles

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:47.840
about Jackie Robinson, the
number of photos or videos

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.950
or objects that are available
in the different collections.

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:54.540
So that's Library of Congress
and Smithsonian, Wikidata.

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.680
And so it sort of
gives a snapshot

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.540
of how much information we have.

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.260
And then you can dive into it.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:05.580
So, with that I think we should
switch over to Chrome and see

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.620
where it is, see
what it looks like.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.780
This is the -- there we go.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.340
A quick, you know, caveat.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.880
This is a week of work,
so the way you're going

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.520
to see is definitely
a work in progress.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.960
There will be parts
that look great.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.540
There will be some parts that
are a little bit buggy still.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:29.530
And you get to do that
when it's only a week.

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.750
We're trying to focus
enough to give an idea

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:33.210
of what this actually is.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:37.680
So what we have is the Cultural
History Baseball Cards brought

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.050
to you by the JSTOR Labs Team.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:42.660
And the idea is that
you can pick a player

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:46.100
or historical figure, see
their cultural history card,

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.580
and then browse through
the primary

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.840
and secondary resources
about them.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.410
These are organized right
now by the number of articles

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.160
in JSTOR about each of these.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.240
And what's fun about this, and
if you even show the next 25

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.330
or whatever, first of all
it's not just players,

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:06.370
your Branch Rickey, your Bill
James, you have Marvin Miller,

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:10.200
you have -- this is not just
the players of baseball.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.770
This is the history of
baseball sort of told here,

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.600
which is really exciting.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.060
We envision, but before we
go live, that would be --

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.640
we'll have more than
just the article,

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.110
number of articles
on this homepage.

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:24.220
It will include the
number of videos

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.460
and images that we have as well.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.170
Then when you click through
to an individual file --

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.470
who do we have?

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:33.540
Ah, Hammered Hank.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.620
We have their baseball card
that has the data of the number

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.790
of articles and images
and videos

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.470
if we have them,
physical objects.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:44.550
We're sort of still working
on the classifications

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:46.960
and how we map those
to the libraries

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.900
and Smithsonian's
classifications.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.390
So those are at the top.

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:52.920
And then you can browse through.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.500
If you're looking at
articles, you can see all

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.220
of the articles right there.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.550
Click through them to get
access to them on JSTOR.

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:03.190
Or if you want to
look at the images,

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:05.880
it brings together the different
images from all the sources.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.800
You can browse through those
images and then get access

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.610
to those images where
they're available,

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:13.310
the high resolution
image perhaps that's

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.850
on the Museum site or
the Library's site.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:20.880
Then there are some printed
materials here as well.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.370
And I'd just encourage --

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:26.240
I mean, so there's a lot of
exploring that you can do,

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.230
all organized around people.

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:30.680
When we talk to the user
-- the researchers --

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.640
and one of the things
that led to this was a lot

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.070
of them did want people.

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.850
They were interested in how
to connect the different --

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:42.450
the materials related
to each person.

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:46.540
They would say that, you know,
I know I'm doing research on --

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.450
I'm telling this particular
story, and I don't know

01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:51.940
if this archive, you know,
is available at the Hall

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.420
of Fame, is it available here?

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.780
So if I could have a
way to connect those

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.580
and bring those together,
it could be valuable.

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:00.630
They also described that when
they first start their research,

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.310
they start with the
secondary literature,

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:07.520
so that would be the
scholarly articles in JSTOR.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.580
And then they dive
in, do a deep dive

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.280
into the contextual material.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.580
But that depends.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.880
For students, they may want --

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.780
may benefit from
seeing the pictures

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.120
that help bring the history
to life and tell some

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.950
of the stories like we heard
just in the presentation

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:25.560
from the National Museum

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.970
of African American
History and Culture.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.890
I think that's enough demo.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:35.830
We could keep clicking
around and --

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:38.250
but let's go back
to the presentation

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:42.060
so we can get to questions.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:46.290
One thing I should say is that
this -- I see this right now,

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.850
and the team sees
this right now,

01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:50.630
as probably a little bit
more of a proof of concept

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:53.250
than full-fledged, you know,

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:56.540
research tool ready
for heavy lifting.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.260
This is more of an idea,
an evocation of that idea,

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.440
to help people understand
what it could look like.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.740
But there's still work to do.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.750
If you -- oh, I get to click.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.390
So there's still work to do.

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:12.110
So what we'll do, just so you
know, is over the coming week

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:15.040
or two, we'll fix
some of the things

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.240
that you might have seen
-- the alignment issues,

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:24.120
the bugs that we deftly
managed to avoid in demoing it,

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.700
and then we'll release
it as a proof of concept.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.230
It will be available
in the labs.jstor site.

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.880
You can follow me on Twitter.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.180
I'll announce it.

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.930
And we'll encourage everybody
to explore it and use it.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:39.340
And I'll probably give
some presentations

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.020
about it -- conferences
and such.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:45.020
Just so share what we've
learned along this way,

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.640
along this journey.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.600
We do see some opportunity
for further development.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.170
And the first one is
-- I think for this

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:55.950
to be a really valuable tool,
the amount of collections

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:59.410
and data that's included in
it needs to be more robust.

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:02.400
JSTORs great, the collections
at the Library of Congress

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.220
and the National Museum of
African American History

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.060
and Culture, that's some
really wonderful material.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.440
But it feels still a little --

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.390
I think there's even more
that we can do by bringing in,

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:13.810
for example, the Digital
Public Library of America

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:17.930
or some other materials
and beefing that up.

01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:19.410
So that would be work
that we would love

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:22.510
to explore sometime
in the future.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:28.370
We also would love to explore
some crowdsourced improvement,

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:30.300
the knowledge craft
that we have is --

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.030
there are going to
be errors in it.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:34.330
That's the nature of how --

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.670
what it looks like to bring
this material together,

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:39.320
photographs miscategorized,
or things like that.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.890
So we'd love to have an
opportunity for people to,

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.200
you know, help improve
that, especially in a field

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:50.160
like baseball where there's
so many citizen experts

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.250
who can help us do that.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:55.830
And then the last area for
opportunity, and again,

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:59.070
we'll see when we
can explore these,

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:00.900
is expanding the
concept beyond baseball.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.200
I mean, they are baseball cards

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.300
but we can call them
trading cards.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:11.480
But the idea of using people
as an exploratory tool

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.980
to multiple collections
is really exciting.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.980
This is sort of a front end to
some of the work that's being --

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.950
that's working in linked
open data in Wikidata.

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:23.560
And you could imagine the
same kind of exploratory tool

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:29.350
for personages of the
Civil War or famous writers

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:31.170
or anything like that.

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:37.270
And so we'd be interested
in exploring any of those.

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:42.190
So before we get to questions, I
want to thank you for being here

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:43.660
and the Library of
Congress again.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.180
I also -- and perhaps
most importantly,

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:49.520
I want to thank the JSTOR
Labs Team, so if you're

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.500
on the JSTOR Labs
Team, stand up.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.300
We have Jared and Shubom
[assumed spelling],

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.950
Jared and Shubom and Jessica
and Matt and Ron [applause],

01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:00.500
and Beth is sitting down.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.700
She was sort of a
double agent this week.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.830
They're amazing, and I am so
deeply privileged to be able

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.620
to work with these guys
who can pull this together.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.380
My main job this week
was to buy coffee.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:16.670
And I knocked it
out of the park.

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:17.990
All right.

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.950
Thanks. Are there any questions?

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:21.250
Yes.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.120
&gt;&gt; I have a comment.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.020
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphrey:
Oh, or comments.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.450
&gt;&gt; Yes [inaudible].

01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:29.320
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphrey: There's
a microphone [inaudible].

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, hi.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.690
My name is Hollis Gentry and
I'm a Genealogy Specialist

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:35.990
with NAMOC.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:37.290
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Oh, great.

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:38.590
&gt;&gt; The African American
History Museum.

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:41.490
I'm also employed with
the Smithsonian Libraries

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.560
and a long-time dedicated
researcher here

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.430
of JSTOR, and I love JSTOR.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.730
So --

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.030
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: We love you.

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.330
&gt;&gt; -- yesterday, after
registering for this,

01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:54.050
I went online to play with
your text, the drop and drag --

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.350
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Oh, yeah.

01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:56.650
&gt;&gt; -- and I have
one word for it.

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:57.950
It was absolutely awesome.

01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:59.250
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Oh.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.020
&gt;&gt; For someone who's done a
considerable amount of research

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:06.390
and trying to find related
data on just anything,

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:09.030
any given subject, because I
do reference, you know, work.

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:10.330
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Yeah, yeah.

01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:11.630
&gt;&gt; It was amazing.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:12.930
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Oh,
that's so wonderful to hear.

01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:14.230
&gt;&gt; I just typed in,
for example --

01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:16.560
we have a transcription project
where we're digitizing records

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.720
of Federal Government
records, millions of documents,

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.570
and I just typed
in one sentence.

01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:26.130
I created a document and
all I said was, you know,

01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:28.750
the [inaudible] Bureau was
founded on such-and-such a date,

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:30.050
Washington, D.C.

01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:32.740
And it generated
thousands of hits for me.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.040
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Yeah.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.340
&gt;&gt; So all I want to say is keep
up with whatever you're doing.

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.640
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Oh.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.940
Well, thank you.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:42.700
&gt;&gt; And in terms of trying to
figure out ways to apply this,

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:47.980
you want to touch
with universities,

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:49.940
like you're doing
already with the scholars,

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.780
but there are different
nuances to that research

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.140
that I think you're going
to find as you reach

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.340
out to the universities in
the different subject areas.

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.880
But, again, all I can
say -- it was awesome.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.180
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys:
Thank you, thank you.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.480
&gt;&gt; I didn't have to
have any training on how

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.780
to learn how to do it.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.690
I'm talking about I looked at it
and I said let me play with it.

01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:10.430
In less than 10 minutes it
generated all of that material.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.730
So that is [inaudible].

01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:13.050
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: I hope
somebody wrote that down

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:15.850
to get your quotes on
this because, dang,

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.680
that's a wonderful testimonial.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.860
Thanks so much.

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.800
Any other questions or comments?

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.410
And we'll be around
over break and later.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.840
Over there [inaudible].

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:30.930
There's a microphone coming
down to you, Orioles fan.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.340
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Jordan Ellenberg.

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.760
I'll be on a panel
later this afternoon.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.060
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: Oh, cool.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.920
&gt;&gt; I'm curious just because
I'm sort of naive about sort

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.010
of how this information
is controlled

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:44.320
and what accesses had to what.

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.670
I mean, if for your cultural
baseball cards you wanted to,

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.910
let's say, for each player
I want to see every time

01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:54.500
that player was quoted
in the newspaper,

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.060
like every single
thing they said.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.120
I mean, those archives exist.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.470
What are the barriers to
somebody like you being able

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:05.160
to just build that in so I see
the complete journalistic record

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.470
of that player?

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:08.770
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys: The barriers

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:12.250
to that access have
to do with access.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.580
I mean there's a lot of the in
copyright material for the --

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.940
you know, when we were
talking to the researchers,

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.240
showing them this, one

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.720
of the first things they said
was exactly what you said, like,

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.520
oh, my gosh, I want to see,
you know, how newspapers talked

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.860
about Roberto Clemente when
he was just on the team.

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.910
And they were, you know -- he
was forced to be called Bob

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:35.930
and I mean, just the, the
language was terrible.

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:40.150
And I want to see that and I
want to show it to my students

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:43.600
and help them understand
the context for it.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.080
The biggest challenge to
that has to be with access

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.060
and copyright which
are reasonable things.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.150
The way to overcome that is
through partnerships with people

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.450
who have, you know, things --

01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.430
people like maybe ProCrast
[assumed spelling] or others

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:02.340
who have the aggregations
of newspapers.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.130
And then we can create
pathways through there.

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:09.190
It's a little -- it's another
-- it's a bigger challenge to do

01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:12.530
that than with the open
material that we have

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:13.830
with the Library of Congress.

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:16.340
So we often, when we're
doing these weeks,

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:19.460
focus on the open
material because it's easy

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.020
to experiment really rapidly,

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.800
and not worry so
much about that.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.000
And then, once we've
proved the value of this

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.150
as a really nifty way
of doing research,

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:32.730
then approaching those
copyright holders or people

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:34.440
who have access to
those databases.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.150
Does that answer your question?

01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:37.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, awesome.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:38.750
Thank you.

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:41.930
&gt;&gt; Alex Humphreys:
Any other questions?

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.750
Okay. Well, thank you very much.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:51.350
And I want to see what the
Library of Congress did

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.510
because it's competition.

01:11:53.510 --> 01:12:10.040
[ Applause ]

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.340
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: Hello.

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.850
All right.

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:16.230
Sorry. I have a lot of --

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:21.120
we're going to start with
the starting line-up.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.330
So this our team, here,
on your left, the --

01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:31.050
every team [inaudible] is in
it's line-up, and this is ours.

01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:36.030
We have Megan Ferriter, who
did a lot of the planning

01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:39.790
for the overall event and did a
lot of coordination on our team;

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.610
Jaime Mears, who
you met earlier,

01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:45.730
who was also very important;
myself, Abby Potter.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:47.670
We're all part of Library
of Congress Labs Team.

01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:52.640
We worked with folks from the
Office of Chief Information,

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.170
Office of the Chief
Information Officer, Chris Adams

01:12:56.170 --> 01:13:00.490
and Grif Friedman and visiting
Archivist, Julia Hickey,

01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:01.810
who we'll hear more
from in a minute

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:04.520
about what she actually
did with our baseball data.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.810
And we had a lot of great help
from our summer class of interns

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:12.480
who are also around here.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.380
You'll see them --

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:17.820
Ilene Jakeway, Yasira
Sweediz [assumed spelling],

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.330
Ann DeLot [assumed spelling]
and Courtney Johnson.

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:23.160
We were also coached by
the Library of Congress --

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.440
I mean, the JSTOR Labs, Beth
Duffert [assumed spelling],

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.270
and she helps us really
clearly define our goals

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:30.630
and move us along over the week.

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:32.990
So it's -- this was
a great team.

01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:34.810
And we started there.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:40.100
But, actually, we started
before then, during our warm-up,

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.400
which was our data prep.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.720
And I'm going to let
Julia talk about that.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.340
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Abby.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.640
Good morning, everyone.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.060
First I just want to say my
thanks to everyone I've gotten

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.620
to collaborate on this project.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.730
Again, I don't work
with LC directly.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.690
I'm employed by another
Federal agency

01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:59.220
and so this has been an
incredible project for me

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.010
to work on, so -- and if you
ever get the opportunity to work

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.710
with LC Labs, it's amazing.

01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:07.530
So, please take that
in consideration.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:11.860
So what this slightly less
scary diagram here or chart is

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:15.490
than what Jaime showed
before is what I've come

01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:17.690
to call the metadata crosswalk.

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:20.540
And so this is, in other
terms, a metadata map.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.040
And you'll see in the first
column to your farthest side

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.090
over here, this is the
authoritative reference

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.390
for the map.

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:32.810
So this is the Merck data and
-- that the Library has related

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:37.600
to their digital collections
from general topic of baseball.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.200
And to the next column over,
you'll find the JSON export.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:47.310
So this is actually as,
I think, Jaime mentioned

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:51.230
through the tutorial, you can
learn how to do a JSON API call

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:54.540
and acquire LC digital metadata.

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.700
And we use that, we
plotted that back

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.090
onto the Merck data
and moved forward.

01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:03.150
And the significance here
is that when we turn to look

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:06.150
at the National African
American and History

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:08.470
and Cultures collection
and their metadata,

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.930
we had to bring it all together.

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:13.010
And so holding the JSON
data and mapping it

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:16.270
into the Museum's data
was the significant point.

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:19.550
And where we get to provide
this dataset out to you.

01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:24.190
And one of the unifying
factors was the next column

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:25.490
over from there.

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:26.790
And this is the Dublin Core.

01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:30.320
It's a very common,
simplistic metadata schema.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.290
And this united the data
in common field names

01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:35.930
such what you see
in the final column

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.560
and what will be presented
in the final dataset.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.410
Some significant
factors here to look

01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:44.010
at would include the
Museum's Attributes Field.

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:46.690
You'll see that in the --
it's about third from the top,

01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:48.450
or fourth from the
top, excuse me.

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:50.790
And you can follow that through.

01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:53.550
And you'll see that's mapped in
a number of different fields.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:56.420
And so this is just some of the
intellectual work you have to go

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.520
through when looking
at metadata,

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.660
to explore where it needs
to go into the right fields

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.930
for proper use, for
proper querying,

01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:05.800
and certainly for unification.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.690
And bringing two different
unique cultural heritage

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:12.260
institutions together,
there's difficulties.

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:14.360
But it's also kind of
exciting challenges to see

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.160
that LC's collection can very
easily talk through and with

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.180
and form this incredible dialog
related to baseball and all

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.690
of the subject matter you
saw the Museum present,

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:28.520
and what you get to explore
in our visualization as well.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.380
So, with that, I'll turn
it back over to Abby.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.010
Thank you.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:34.360
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter:
Thanks, Julia.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.180
It seems less scary when
you say it like that.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:44.830
Okay. So we started off
the week visiting our --

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.490
the Baseball Americana
Exhibit and we did

01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:49.630
that to get us loose
and ready to play.

01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:53.430
We were -- the docents
let us through,

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:56.390
and they told us what the main
themes of the exhibit are,

01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:59.430
which are creating
and building community

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:02.710
and paralleling American
history.

01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:07.080
So this -- when we were sort
of walking through the exhibit,

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.060
it led us to ask
sort of questions

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.610
about what we could
do during this week.

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:13.390
We wanted to know what else
our visitors might want

01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:16.950
to see besides this exhibit, as
an extension of this exhibit.

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:20.500
We wanted to know what other
stories our collections could

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.520
tell and what different
possibilities

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.110
of presentation we could
use, because there's only

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.500
so much we can see
in the exhibit.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:35.060
So in order to generate
sort of the ideas --

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.560
Alex really talked --
did a nice overview

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.250
of what this design
session was all about.

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:45.490
We had some really interesting
ideas come out of them

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:47.650
that I think we'd like to
pursue later, including sort

01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:51.960
of different phone apps and
Snapchat filters and, you know,

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.540
just sort of fun things that
we think could bring our

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:59.690
collections closer to the
people who want to use them.

01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:03.680
And this led us, really,
to think about audiences.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.040
So we saw all the
work that JSTOR did --

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:11.040
interviewing the
potential users of our tools

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.970
and we saw how careful
they did those interviews

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:16.960
and got really useful
feedback that --

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.250
and, you know, that
created the persona.

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:25.120
And when we were watching
that work we thought, well,

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.760
I think with our
collections, with our exhibit,

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.790
with our focus, we have
sort of a different user

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:32.580
in mind who's more
of a lifelong learner

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:36.700
or a teacher who's trying to
teach people about community

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:40.200
or history and just
baseball fans in general.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.310
So those are the users
that we had in mind.

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:47.670
Following JSTOR's lead,
we sort of jumped right

01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:53.550
into user interviews and we
quickly created these mock-ups

01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:56.440
of how we could display
our collections.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.740
One's in a timeline.

01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:01.100
We used Timeline JS, and one
in -- on a map, we used ArcGIS.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.710
And these are just tools that
were sort of quickly available

01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:07.820
to us that we wanted
to, you know, try out,

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.320
see what would work and what
people would respond to.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.450
And we did get some useful
feedback on the concept

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:18.580
of displaying things
in a timeline or a map,

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:23.050
but we thought that maybe we
should have, we should sort

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:26.290
of go back and sort of come
near what JSTOR should have done

01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:32.900
and start with a wire frame and
get sort of more information

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.290
about -- besides -- you know,
because there's a lot of --

01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:37.240
when you're working
with a tool that exists,

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.140
there's limitations there
and what we learned is

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.230
that we should have
started from square one

01:19:43.230 --> 01:19:47.350
and not sort of skipped steps.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:53.030
So we used this for the
remaining of our user interviews

01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:56.980
and we got a lot of useful
feedback on this drawing.

01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:58.280
We heard that it could --

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.420
something like this could
be used in a classroom,

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:04.580
especially the timeline
aspect when teaching people --

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:07.210
teaching a subject
chronologically.

01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:10.900
We heard that adding datasets to
our baseball collections data,

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:16.870
like a census data or income
data, would help tell the story

01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:20.500
of how baseball -- use
baseball to tell the stories

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.940
like the Great Migration
or other sort

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.790
of big historical
movements that sort

01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:27.400
of take up the whole country.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.750
We also learned that it
would be meaningful to sort

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:33.460
of plainly show what the
gaps in our collections are,

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:36.170
what we don't have,
and sort of --

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:40.110
is there a way that we
can see that clearly?

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.550
And we also learned that
there's users that have a lot

01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:46.480
of knowledge about what we
at our institutions have,

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.940
but knowledge that we don't
have about our collections.

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:52.260
So they're interested
in contributing to,

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:58.510
and adding their knowledge
to, the things that we do.

01:20:58.510 --> 01:21:04.630
This [inaudible] typing also is
iterative and we, like I said,

01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:09.960
we shared this with users, five
users, and with their comments

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.170
in mind, it sort of helps
us work through challenges.

01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:16.010
So this is -- I don't know
if you can see this clearly,

01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:20.720
but this is a -- our subjects
that we are dealing with.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.620
So we had 19 columns of
subjects when we brought all

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.160
of our collections together.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.970
And this is really
difficult to show to a user.

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:33.340
As you can see, the biggest sort
of subject is baseball card.

01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.470
The second biggest is color.

01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:36.770
And is that useful?

01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:38.570
Is that -- trying to
-- so when we keep --

01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:42.810
we think of our users, it helps
us sort of work through some

01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:45.970
of these decisions of
how we might present data

01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:48.610
about the subject of
the items to users.

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:55.040
So -- I mean to pass it over
to either of you to talk

01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.650
about the -- so this
is a next prototype,

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:02.670
sort of after the
paper prototype.

01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:04.280
This is what Chris made.

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.420
Do you want to talk
through [inaudible]?

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:11.310
&gt;&gt; Chris Adams: So, basically,
we had several stages here.

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:14.670
The first was getting all
of Julia's hard work pulled

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:17.730
out of the CSE files which
are one of our datasets,

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:20.220
and then geocoding them so
we could put them on a map.

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.310
So that was the early
part of the project.

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:23.930
We didn't have a
whole lot to show

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:26.320
because it was basically
here's some data,

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.260
here's a different file
that contains the same data

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:31.120
in a different shape, and then
we started actually being able

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.880
to do stuff like
put things on a map.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.750
So this slide shows -- I think
this was Wednesday, yeah.

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:40.330
Tuesday was data ring,
then Wednesday we got this.

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:44.240
And then -- could we
go to the next slide?

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.440
Oh, yeah. So this
is a good thing.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.060
So we actually had
three deliverables.

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.970
So we had the raw
dataset for people

01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:53.560
who are comfortable working
with csv files directly.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:57.400
We then pulled it into a new
experimental tool called the

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.280
dataset which is basically
just a SQL-like database

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.120
with a web interface which is
kind of nice because we can take

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.720
that data, you can write
any query you want,

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.610
you can just browse through
it and see what it is.

01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:08.910
So for people who
want to be able

01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:12.150
to really do advanced filtering
or [inaudible], but don't want

01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:13.450
to write their own
code to do it,

01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:15.160
this is a nice little
intermediate step

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.440
where you can go on a web
browser, you can look on things,

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.970
you can tweak it a little
bit, you hit some basic plots

01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:22.270
and pull out the data.

01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:26.660
And then the last slide
here is basically getting

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.940
into the tool we built
which is intended to be sort

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:31.190
of the general overview
to the collection.

01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:34.190
So I guess if we wanted to we
could go to the Chrome Browser

01:23:34.190 --> 01:23:37.920
at this point and actually
show the live version here.

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:45.420
But, basically, the idea here is
this gives you a way to view all

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.380
of the items in the
dataset on a map,

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:49.910
having the ability
to do a search.

01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:51.940
So you can click on
any one of those pins

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.930
and you can see the items
that are in that location.

01:23:54.930 --> 01:24:00.500
You can click on an item
and pull up the information

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.590
about that, and just scroll
down, it will pass the picture

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:08.660
and it will show the
metadata, the description,

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:10.980
one of the goals
that we didn't fit

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:13.830
into the sprint week was
actually linking all those

01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:16.100
things so that when you
see something tagged

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.120
with a particular subject you
could then see everything else

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.420
in the collection
with that subject.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:21.720
And then the last thing here.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.370
You can just close this,
click anywhere on the map

01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:31.860
because we want to reset the
selection to the whole list,

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:35.580
and then you can drag that
timeline slider up at the top.

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.440
Either of the ends can be
adjusted and you can just drag

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.780
that over and it
adjusts the whole thing.

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.650
And you can drag
the slider itself.

01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:46.490
So if you wanted to, you could
pick like a five-year period

01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:48.650
and then just scrub
that forward or backward

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:51.730
and see how them dataset
changes over time.

01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:53.830
It will also work nicely
if you mention then --

01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:56.210
if you put anything
in the text field.

01:24:56.210 --> 01:24:59.260
So if you're interested in
a certain team or league

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.970
or place that's mentioned
in there,

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.640
you can filter all
of these together.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.850
And so we were thinking,
this is the raw over --

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:07.640
this is the basic
overview of the data.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.990
Somebody who's getting
here first,

01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:11.320
they can get an idea
of what's in here.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.690
They can follow specific items
back to the source institution

01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:19.080
or up in the toolbar there we
also have the links right now

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.990
to the dataset and at some point
there will actually be the link

01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:23.590
to the explanatory document

01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:25.720
that says here's how
you download this,

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.770
here's what you can do with it,
here's, you know, the rights,

01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:31.800
the known limitations.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.870
And I really think
this was a nice way

01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:36.980
to just illustrate how quickly
we can give somebody an overview

01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:39.050
for what's in the data
so that they can confirm

01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:41.060
that it even answers
the question they have

01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.360
in the first place.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.700
And maybe it inspires some
questions about why we have

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.890
so many pins in a row
[inaudible] obscure place

01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:51.790
on the map or, you know, whether
there might have been some

01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:54.550
confusion in what
you were searching

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:56.800
for matches somebody
you hadn't heard of.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.930
It really is a good
way just to narrow

01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:02.080
that down interactively before
you've invested any time loading

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.850
it into your favorite data
analysis tools [inaudible].

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:07.150
&gt;&gt; Griffen Friedman: Yeah, sure.

01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:09.970
So one other thing we wanted
to focus on was the idea

01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:11.500
of bringing in even more data.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.350
So we're already aggregating
data from our collection here

01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:15.990
at the Library and
the National Museum

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:18.110
of African American History
and Culture's collections.

01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:20.460
Over on the right side you'll
see a mix of items there.

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.030
And it helps contextualize
these items.

01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:23.670
You can look at them
in location and time

01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:25.070
and really understand them.

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:27.340
But as a researcher, there
may be other information

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:28.830
that you want to
overlay on top of it.

01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:30.660
Helps you understand
those even more.

01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.300
So up on the top right of the
map there's a control there

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.330
where you can actually turn
on and off other layers.

01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:36.900
And we've got two
example layers.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.880
The first one shows stadiums.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.040
So if you can check that one on.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.360
That layer's actually
from data we found online.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.050
So someone publicly made
available GeoJSON data

01:26:46.050 --> 01:26:48.890
that shows all of current
stadiums in the U.S.

01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:51.730
So it was very easy to take
that and overlay it on the map.

01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:54.130
So that was demonstrating
you might find a dataset

01:26:54.130 --> 01:26:56.170
in a standard format and
bring it in yourself.

01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:58.370
And now you can make
more sense of the data.

01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:59.670
The other thing we
did we we wanted

01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:02.120
to see how hard it would be
for us to make our own dataset.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.230
So thanks to hard
work on the team.

01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:07.020
If you turn on the second
one, we built a dataset

01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:08.880
that has team locations.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.800
So this can sort of aggregate
with that other data.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.470
It gives you a sense of
where teams are today

01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:14.770
and where they were.

01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:16.690
And you can start to look
at how the items correspond

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:17.990
to those team locations.

01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:20.080
So this is just a sort of hint

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.510
of what you could
overlay on here.

01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:23.890
It uses a standard format so
the idea is you could bring

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:26.010
in your own data very
easily and add it

01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:30.390
to our collection and our data.

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:31.690
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: Great.

01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:32.990
Whoops. All right.

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:34.690
We can go back to
the presentation.

01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:40.710
I think we're just
about -- yeah.

01:27:40.710 --> 01:27:43.130
So that link, that
short link there,

01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:45.460
that is where the
current tool is now.

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.180
We're also going to be
linking that with -- at our --

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:51.390
on our Experiments
Page on Lab, so --

01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:54.540
and we'll continue to,
you know, work on it.

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.710
So what's next?

01:27:56.710 --> 01:28:00.370
The -- we do want to
finish building this

01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:07.790
and we do want users to come
use it and give us feedback

01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:09.900
and add different layers.

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.710
So we want to give some
instructions on how to do that

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:20.720
and we do similarly to JSTOR,
we are really interested

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.620
in different sort of
crowdsourcing aspects

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:28.900
of how this kind of
presentation of data could work.

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.050
We're interested in adding
different organizations,

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:39.620
different types of data
to our set, and continuing

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:40.950
to sort of learn more.

01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:45.360
One of the big sort of
goals of this week was just

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.680
to sort of have this week.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.750
So we're done now, so that
was a complete success, and --

01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:55.460
but we really want to sort of
model this same type of process

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:58.090
with other groups, other groups
inside the Library of Congress,

01:28:58.090 --> 01:28:59.610
other groups outside
the Library of Congress.

01:28:59.610 --> 01:29:03.330
So we're really happy
with how everything went.

01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:05.810
We're really excited to do
more of this kind of thing.

01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:10.870
And I'm sure our collections
in different, in more ways

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:14.290
like we just showed you, and
like JSTOR just showed you.

01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:17.630
So with that, that
is our demonstration.

01:29:17.630 --> 01:29:19.580
And we can take any
questions that you have.

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:22.290
And I should also say, I'm sure
the NAMOC folks would also take

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.860
questions if you have
questions for them.

01:29:33.190 --> 01:29:35.560
We have a question,
two questions.

01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:43.130
Here we go [inaudible].

01:29:43.130 --> 01:29:44.430
Yeah.

01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:48.310
&gt;&gt; Could I see the
raw data that was --

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:49.610
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: Yeah.

01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:54.620
We can go back to
the demo and the --

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:58.970
back to the browser and then
there's the raw data link

01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:00.270
at the top.

01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:02.870
&gt;&gt; I think you opened it.

01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:06.980
It's like a -- the next tab.

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.280
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: Yeah.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:09.580
Yeah.

01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:12.720
&gt;&gt; So this is the SQL database
that you created and worked on?

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.020
&gt;&gt; Chris Adams: Yeah.

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:15.320
And the nice thing is if you --

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.620
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: Here.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.870
&gt;&gt; Chris Adams: -- if
you click on items,

01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:20.890
you'll see the raw item records.

01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:22.190
But the other records --

01:30:22.190 --> 01:30:26.200
and so you can see there's one
issue we didn't have to deal

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.060
with -- time to deal
with this week

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.380
which is normalizing
multivalue columns.

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:32.690
We have an answer to that;
it's just not ready yet.

01:30:32.690 --> 01:30:35.360
But, basically, at
the top there,

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.420
there's a SQL Query Builder.

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.280
It's there so if you wanted
to, you could filter things

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.180
and just do arbitrary
expressions for how

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.480
to group or coalesce things.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.300
So like one simple
example we use is

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.660
when we were just looking
is we have data coming

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:51.030
in from a number of sources.

01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:53.710
And depending on what you
might want to use as the title

01:30:53.710 --> 01:30:56.960
for an item, the answer can vary
depending on where it came from

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.260
and what metadata it had.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.760
And in the SQL query we can
just say pick the first of these

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.950
that isn't empty
and pull that in.

01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:04.810
And that makes it easier
to give somebody a link

01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:07.020
that shows them the things and
not have to explain, oh, well,

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:09.080
for items like that go
look over in this column,

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.210
otherwise look -- you know,
we can just cut that out.

01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:12.510
You've done that work once.

01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:13.810
You don't have to
think about it again.

01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.650
If we go back and click
on either the Geography

01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:19.580
or Location columns, these
are also specific things

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:23.840
that were present in the dataset
and so one of the nice things --

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:27.500
we were able to geocode them and
then the viewer that we're --

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.850
oh, go back one more screen here

01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:34.010
to the main list
of all the tables.

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:38.030
And click on either
Location or Geography.

01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:41.350
There. This allows you
to view those directly.

01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:43.480
It also just puts them
all on the map for you,

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.950
so this is a great way.

01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:48.330
We were able to do the data QA
while the main viewer was being

01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:51.160
worked on because somebody
else can go look at that list

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.370
and say, do we really have
an item from this location

01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:56.210
or from the things that we got

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.780
out of the subject
list for Salisbury.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.760
Was that -- Salisbury, Maryland
was what it geocoded to,

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.670
but it should have
been North Carolina.

01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:06.460
And those are the kind of issues
that you have for any dataset

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.440
like this where we're trying

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.230
to link a non-precise
entity to a real value.

01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:12.670
And that was great
being able just

01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:14.990
to let somebody else
do that independently.

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:18.530
And this is, I think,
kind of a nice example

01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:20.370
because you could
also explore this.

01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:22.130
You could click on any
entry in that subject table

01:32:22.130 --> 01:32:24.130
and it will show you which
items it's linked to.

01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:26.350
So if you wanted to do some sort

01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:28.260
of filtered query
you're just browsing

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.060
around that we didn't
anticipate,

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:33.580
that's there is a safety
mechanism before you get

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:36.160
to the point of well, now you
have to load the data and query,

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.640
build your own tool,
the query [inaudible].

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.940
&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks.

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.970
Can I -- one more question?

01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:47.110
On a scale from first base to
home run, how fun was this?

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:48.410
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: How fun?

01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:49.710
&gt;&gt; Griffin Friedman: How fun?

01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:51.010
&gt;&gt; Home run [laughter].

01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:52.310
&gt;&gt; Griffen Friedman: Yeah.

01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:53.610
If this was all I was
working on this week,

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:54.910
definitely a home run.

01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:56.210
I'd say a triple.

01:32:56.210 --> 01:32:57.510
It was really great.

01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:59.330
I work for OCIO here at the
Library, so I don't get to work

01:32:59.330 --> 01:33:00.630
with the Labs Team all the time,

01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:01.930
but it was really
wonderful working

01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:03.920
with a really enthusiastic
group of people,

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.220
having Chris on the team.

01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.790
Everybody just worked
really well together

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:09.390
and that certainly
makes it more enjoyable.

01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:11.520
It was also really fun
to go from having nothing

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.680
to having a functional tool
and having that tool validated

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.460
by users and listening to them
say how useful it would be,

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:19.210
how they'd use it
in their classroom,

01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:21.120
how they'd find things they
didn't think they'd be able

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.420
to find, and all
that kind of stuff.

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:24.760
So it was definitely
a great week.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.060
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.380
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: Okay.

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:32.680
All right.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:33.980
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering

01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:36.380
if you have a data that's
digitalization of the number

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.570
of baseball puns used
throughout the week.

01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:40.760
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: We
have a running list.

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:45.930
Yeah. I think our -- Courtney,

01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:48.350
who's [inaudible] our
Communications has utilized

01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:49.950
almost all of them
I think [laughter].

01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:54.910
But, yeah, that's a sub-goal
of the week, is to --

01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:59.640
all baseball idioms
all the time.

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.940
All right.

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.240
Any other questions?

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.540
All right.

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:05.470
If there's no more questions,
then we will break for lunch

01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:10.360
and then we are back
here at 1:15.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:13.340
We will have a great
panel discussion

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.970
with some baseball
experts, scholars, and fans.

01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:19.260
And we hope that you all come
back and ask your questions.

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:21.510
So we'll see you at 1:15.

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:25.130
[ Applause ]

01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:31.080
Hello and welcome back to
our Inside Baseball event.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:35.940
For this afternoon, we'll have a
great panel discussion featuring

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:38.780
-- moderated by our
very own Meghan Ferriter

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.710
who is a Senior Innovation
Specialist here

01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:43.370
with the Library
of Congress Labs.

01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:45.890
She's also a Sports
Scholar and using

01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:48.690
that knowledge to
grill our guests.

01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:52.490
Not grill them, but have a
conversation about baseball

01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:55.830
and how it has influenced

01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:58.810
and reflected our
history and culture.

01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:01.410
I'm going to announce
the panelists

01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:03.510
and they're all going
to come out here.

01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:05.860
But I want to let you know
that this is being livestreamed

01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:10.070
and the video will be archived
at the Library of Congress

01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:12.560
so you will be able to
watch this again and again

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.830
and again if you want.

01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:17.070
So, first the panelists.

01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:20.990
Jordan Ellenberg is a
mathematician and author,

01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:23.830
and he uses math to
uncover the hidden patterns

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:25.490
that guide our daily lives.

01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:28.830
He's a Professor at the
University of Wisconsin Madison

01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:30.690
and his book, <i>Not
Not To Be Wrong,</i>

01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:33.300
<i>The Power of Mathematical
Thinking </i>is a <i>New York Times</i>

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:37.290
Mbest seller and one of Bill
Gates' 10 favorite books.

01:35:37.290 --> 01:35:39.000
We also have Clinton Yates.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.880
He is a radio host,
commentator, and columnist

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.030
for <i>ESPN's The Undefeated </i>,
and a <i>Washington Post </i>alumnus.

01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:49.370
A D.C. native, Yates's work
examines the intersections

01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:54.300
between pop culture,
politics, race, and athletics

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.930
in contemporary American life.

01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:58.400
And then, finally,
we have Rob Ruck.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.100
He is a Sports Historian and
Professor at the University

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.690
of Pittsburgh whose research
traces the dynamics of race

01:36:04.690 --> 01:36:06.290
and major league baseball.

01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:09.140
He's recognized as a
authority in the history

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.550
of the Negro Leagues
and Latinos in baseball.

01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:15.850
Ruck's recent publications
include the 2011 book,

01:36:15.850 --> 01:36:17.710
<i>Raceball </i>.

01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:20.900
So we'll get started
with our panel first

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:22.700
by welcoming them out.

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:36.070
[ Applause ]

01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:37.370
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: I think
it only matters so we're not

01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:38.990
so close to each other
that we can't hear each

01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:40.550
other afterwards.

01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:42.000
Well, thanks so much
everyone for being here.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.530
Thanks for those of you who've
tuned back in to the livestream

01:36:44.530 --> 01:36:45.830
if you were here earlier.

01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:48.090
I already, JSTOR Labs Team,
already have some feedback

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:49.600
on things that would
be extremely helpful

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.900
for sports journalists

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:54.210
and performing research using
cultural history baseball cards.

01:36:54.210 --> 01:36:56.260
And if you're just turning
in to the livestream again,

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:58.170
you may have missed
this morning.

01:36:58.170 --> 01:37:00.940
We had some sessions where we
were describing a week-long

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:05.000
process of exploring collections
from the Library of Congress,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.310
the National Museum of African
American History and Culture,

01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:10.770
and articles in JSTOR
and the JSTOR databases.

01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:12.450
It gave us some starting
points of conversation.

01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:15.150
But the whole reason that we
wanted to do this and connect

01:37:15.150 --> 01:37:18.580
with you all is that we have a
Baseball Americana Exhibit here

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.880
at the Library, opened
only about two weeks ago.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.380
We're hearing a lot of
really interesting things.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.630
And we started our week
with a tour of that.

01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:28.820
We're going to end our week
with another tour of that space.

01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.700
And we heard from the docents
that some of the themes

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.630
that they are emphasizing
and the stories

01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:36.640
that they are telling are
around convening community

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.150
and paralleling America's
history.

01:37:39.150 --> 01:37:41.770
So I wonder if -- Jordan,
you want to lead us,

01:37:41.770 --> 01:37:44.460
I mean step into the
plate first here?

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:45.760
Don't worry.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.690
We'll talk about some language
in baseball idiom as well.

01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:50.190
What are your thoughts
around the way

01:37:50.190 --> 01:37:52.970
that baseball brings
people together?

01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:54.270
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Well, yeah.

01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:55.570
I guess I'll -- it's like
batting practice, right?

01:37:55.570 --> 01:37:57.040
I'm like coming first
to the plate before you.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.050
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: So --
and they're both a little bit

01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:01.950
of a softball team [laughter].

01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:03.870
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Well, at
least to me what I think is one

01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:05.500
of the things that's
so interesting

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.390
about the community
of, let's say,

01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:08.690
fandom around the
baseball team --

01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:10.710
well, that's not the only kind
of community around baseball.

01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:12.830
There's communities of players,
there's communities of people

01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:14.560
who work in baseball,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.480
But when I think about
the community of fandom

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.960
which is the community
that I'm a part of,

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.370
I think it's interesting
in sort of like how chosen

01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:24.140
of a community it is, right?

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.440
I mean, many of the communities

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.050
that we're part of,
we are born into.

01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:30.910
You know, we don't choose our
family, we choose our history.

01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:35.740
We do, on some level, choose
our team that we root for,

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:39.340
and yet our commitment to
that, I think for most of us,

01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:43.190
emotionally I think it feels
-- it it okay to say this?

01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:46.600
Like just as deep as [inaudible]
historical communities

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.900
that we're a part of.

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.870
And I think that can be like a
really good learning [inaudible]

01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:52.740
to think about like, boy, what
does community mean if I feel it

01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:56.550
so strongly at the same time
as -- I chose it myself.

01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:57.850
I could have chosen
something else.

01:38:57.850 --> 01:38:59.930
In some instance it's
arbitrary as a, I think,

01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:02.220
Jerry Seinfeld said,
you're rooting for laundry.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.700
Yes, but it matters.

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:06.000
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Clinton,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.840
Jordan's speaking a
little bit to passion.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.710
And you do a lot of
communicating with people

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:11.220
in various media spaces --

01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:13.230
on radio and TV and
social media spaces --

01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:14.840
and I think social
media's a place

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.340
where interesting
communities convene.

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:18.640
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: This is true.

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.940
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: -- to
bring a person to session.

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.230
Would you share some maybe
things that you've seen recently

01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:24.890
in those spaces that
you think is either new

01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:26.190
or interesting about
communities?

01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:27.490
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:28.870
I mean, I think one of the
the things that's forgotten

01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:32.440
about baseball is -- you know,
you can talk about the history,

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.740
you can talk about the math,

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:35.580
but in the sport itself
the communal contact

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.880
of how it exists.

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.100
Everybody has to watch
two people do one thing

01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.230
and that is a very interesting
relationship in terms

01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:44.550
of how it forces you to
understand the concept of team

01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:48.400
and the concept of performance
and the concept of failure in,

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.730
you know, the communal sense.

01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:52.030
And I think that's a large part

01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:55.460
about why people attract
themselves, you know --

01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:58.180
baseball is attractive for
them and why it explains

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.110
about how you have
to communicate.

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:01.410
There's an umpire,
there's a manager.

01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:03.580
Everybody on the
bench wears a uniform.

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:04.880
You know what I'm saying?

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.910
Like it's very different
communication in terms

01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:12.290
of the basic fundamentals of
the game that I think apply

01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:14.340
to how people relate
to it, you know?

01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:17.780
So the laundry in one way is
very important in a certain way

01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:21.650
because you're not wearing
helmets, you know what I mean?

01:40:21.650 --> 01:40:22.960
You're not wearing shorts.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.900
You're wearing pants
and a shirt that button,

01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:26.340
and a belt, you know
what I mean?

01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.080
Like it is very much about a
sort of very normalized process

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.670
that I think brings a
lot of people together.

01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:34.110
When you're talking
about social media

01:40:34.110 --> 01:40:38.900
and how different people come
toward it, everybody is allowed

01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:42.280
to like, as a result of all
those different things going on,

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:44.100
a different part of
the game, you know?

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.610
And that's very much, I
think, what attracts a lot

01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:47.910
of people to baseball.

01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:49.320
Most people who like
baseball probably --

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.620
I say this all the time --

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:52.460
probably never know how
to score a game, you know?

01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:55.670
But they enjoy the
environment around it.

01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:59.250
They enjoy the sounds
and sights of the game

01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:01.030
without even necessarily
caring what happens.

01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:04.750
And that's a large part
that baseball brings

01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:06.670
to the American sporting
landscape.

01:41:06.670 --> 01:41:09.670
And I think a lot of other
sports have not found a way

01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:10.970
to tap into it.

01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:14.280
And why, ultimately, it is
considered America's Pastime is

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.530
because it doesn't
change much, you know.

01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:18.580
And people kind of like
that because people enjoy

01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:21.640
that in their communities.

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.940
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter:
Speaking about numbers

01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:25.390
and people not being able to
like maybe create a scorecard,

01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:27.210
fill it out, even
read it afterwards --

01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:28.510
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:29.810
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: -- and know
what different annotations mean.

01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:31.270
We had a lot of people who
asked us questions about --

01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:33.550
as we were working on building
prototypes, we'll begin to bring

01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:36.210
in statistical data, and we
said, well, we want to tell some

01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:37.510
of these cultural stories.

01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:40.420
So, Rob, I wonder if you
can reflect on the types

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:43.200
of communities that formed
around baseball in Pittsburgh

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.650
and some of your work
that you've shared

01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:47.070
about those types
of teams and people.

01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:48.930
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: I'm glad you're
not asking me a statistical

01:41:48.930 --> 01:41:50.230
question [laughter].

01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:51.530
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I'm here.

01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:52.830
Don't worry [laughter].

01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:55.550
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: Jordan's
got that covered.

01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:58.140
You know, I'm must more
interested in what sport means

01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:00.560
to people than the game itself.

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.540
And when you look at a
place like Pittsburgh,

01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:06.180
where baseball was the sport,

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:09.340
was the pastime,
for quite a while.

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.030
No longer is.

01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:15.160
You see that it allowed
different groups of people

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:18.070
to feel included in
a sense of community.

01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:22.150
I mean that whole notion of
baseball as the ultimate vehicle

01:42:22.150 --> 01:42:24.240
of Americanization
for the children

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.230
of immigrants I think
is pretty valid.

01:42:28.230 --> 01:42:29.610
Where that broke
down, of course,

01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:31.970
was over questions of race.

01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:34.160
And during the half
century or so

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.280
that the Major Leagues were
segregated Black Pittsburgh

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.640
created a sporting
world of its own.

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.920
And an amazing one, with
two Negro League franchises,

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.120
seven of the first 11 men
from the Negro Leagues elected

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.160
to the Hall of Fame
came from Pittsburgh,

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.400
and many more ever since.

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:57.270
But you look at that
community, that black community,

01:42:57.270 --> 01:43:00.510
which was fractured
by geography,

01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:03.640
by whether they were the Old
Pittsburghers who had come

01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:06.750
from the northern part of
the South in the 1890s,

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:10.010
who were better off, better
educated, and lighter skinned,

01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:12.890
or those who came during
World War I and after

01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:15.570
from the Black Belt
who were not,

01:43:15.570 --> 01:43:18.690
you saw that it created
a sense of community

01:43:18.690 --> 01:43:22.710
for Black Pittsburgh
which allowed them,

01:43:22.710 --> 01:43:26.120
as the Negro Leagues
formed in the '20s,

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.340
and had this archipelago
of franchises

01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:35.300
in these norther cities, to
feel a part of Black America.

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.820
And I think that had a
profound impact on the ability

01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:41.440
to build cohesion and a positive
sense of collective self

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.160
which lasted for quite a while.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.460
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter:
Thank you very much

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:47.960
for sharing more about that.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:50.050
During lunch today we
talked a little bit about --

01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:52.560
Clinton led us out
on this one --

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.970
describing the ways
that professionalization

01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:58.430
of Major League sports may
make the sport less enjoyable.

01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:01.670
So I wonder if you can --
because it's predictable,

01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:03.320
I should say, not
less enjoyable,

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.640
predictable in the sense of it's
routine, there's less variety,

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.450
there's less excitement
over what might happen.

01:44:10.450 --> 01:44:13.500
And so I wonder if you, Clinton,
if you'd like to respond

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.500
and maybe lead on your thoughts
on this, some of the ways

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:21.130
that amateur sport or collegiate
sport and how baseball formed

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:23.870
in those communities or in those
spaces tell us different kinds

01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:25.840
of stories than professional
sport.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.140
&gt;&gt; Clinton: Yeah.

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:30.720
I think that's actually a
large part of why this sort

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.530
of regionalization of
baseball has led to this sport

01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:35.300
at the highest level
of not being as popular

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.510
as other leagues is that
Major League Baseball acts

01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:40.270
like they're the only form
of baseball that exists when,

01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:41.820
in reality, you look
at somebody like me.

01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:43.120
I grew up playing baseball.

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.540
I played in RVI here in D.C.
I can name you, within a,

01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:48.180
you know, a couple
of relay throws,

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:50.830
10 fields I played
on in the city.

01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:53.940
And that is what baseball
is to me, you know?

01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:55.680
People tell me all the
time, like oh, my god,

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:56.980
how do you watch
college baseball.

01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.280
I can't deal with
the metal bats.

01:44:58.280 --> 01:44:59.580
Well, you must not have played
a lot of baseball growing up.

01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.320
I don't know anybody who's
playing wood bat leagues,

01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:02.670
you know what I'm saying,
when you're a kid, you know?

01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:03.970
That's not real.

01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:05.270
So what are you talking
about, right?

01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:07.360
And so what I'm saying -- and
the reason I bring that up is

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:12.320
because it is -- it's
important to understand

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.590
that like what you're referring
to in terms of the Negro Leagues

01:45:16.590 --> 01:45:19.860
and how that sense of community
came together was about more

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:22.010
than just achievement
at the top.

01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:24.140
People played because they
liked playing baseball,

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:26.010
and that's what's cool about it.

01:45:26.010 --> 01:45:27.730
You know, you go to
a high school game.

01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:29.590
People show up because their
kids are there to play.

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:31.160
They don't plan to
go to college.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.070
They're not trying to
necessarily make the pro's.

01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:35.530
They enjoy spitting
seeds and talking trash

01:45:35.530 --> 01:45:37.910
with their friends, and
they enjoy hitting the ball

01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:39.210
and picking it up
and putting it down.

01:45:39.210 --> 01:45:41.470
And so if your only
sort of understanding

01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:45.540
of what the game is exists
from just the top level down,

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.850
you're really selling
yourself short on a lot

01:45:47.850 --> 01:45:49.510
of what the community of
baseball is, you know.

01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:50.970
That's why I go to so
many minor league games.

01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:52.850
That's why I liked
coaching baseball,

01:45:52.850 --> 01:45:55.880
because you're involved
with it on a community level

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.920
that is more than just about
the achievement, the contracts,

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.200
the trophies, you
know, and the TV time.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.350
And that ultimately, to me,
is what gives back a lot more

01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:06.500
than any nonsense I
see on television.

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:09.510
You know, it's knowing the
people I know from the game

01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:13.200
and what I was given
as a human in terms

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.450
of understanding what it took
to, you know, make it work.

01:46:15.450 --> 01:46:17.740
And that's still something
that sticks with me.

01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:19.330
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I mean,
if I can jump in on that.

01:46:19.330 --> 01:46:20.630
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Of course.

01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:21.990
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I mean,
but it's about this one thing.

01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:24.360
I mean, I -- because I spoke to
it in the story from this kind

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:25.660
of top-down point of view.

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:26.960
But it's very true that,
you know, if you're a fan

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.650
of like your favorite sitcom
or something, you're not going

01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:30.870
to set up like four TV
cameras with your friends,

01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:32.410
like make your own
sitcom at home, right?

01:46:32.410 --> 01:46:34.940
I mean there's -- the only way
you're going to experience it is

01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.240
through the professional
[inaudible].

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:37.540
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: You're talking
about YouTube, man [laughter].

01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:39.270
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: No, it's
probably more now than before,

01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:41.700
but -- but, you know, as you've
seen with baseball, with respect

01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:43.810
to regionalization, you
know, I grew up in Maryland

01:46:43.810 --> 01:46:47.030
and hardly anybody I knew
played Little League.

01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:49.560
Like now I live in Wisconsin
and what I have learned is,

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:52.450
you know, my son
plays and I go there

01:46:52.450 --> 01:46:54.630
and like there's parents
there whose kids are not even

01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:55.930
in the game.

01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:57.230
People in Wisconsin just --

01:46:57.230 --> 01:46:58.530
they'll just drive down to
the Little League field --

01:46:58.530 --> 01:46:59.830
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:01.130
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
-- because you know one

01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:02.430
of your neighbor's kids is going
to be there and like, you know,

01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:03.730
you're going to see
people you know --

01:47:03.730 --> 01:47:05.030
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:06.330
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: --
or something like that.

01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:07.630
I mean -- so I think it
is like really different

01:47:07.630 --> 01:47:08.930
in different parts
of the country,

01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:10.510
and there you see this extremely
organic kind of fandom --

01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:11.810
or I shouldn't even
have called it a fandom,

01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:14.640
but an organic involvement
with baseball at --

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.440
and if you think college
baseball is unpredictable,

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.270
you know, watch --
the 12-year-olds,

01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:20.110
that's a different
story entirely.

01:47:20.110 --> 01:47:21.410
I mean --

01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:22.750
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
Tell me about it, man.

01:47:22.750 --> 01:47:24.050
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: I'm thinking

01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:25.350
of two different
lines of thoughts.

01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:26.650
So I'm going to put
them together

01:47:26.650 --> 01:47:27.950
in the same [inaudible].

01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:29.250
I've heard a little bit
of mention here about some

01:47:29.250 --> 01:47:30.860
of the artifacts or objects of
baseball, some of the things

01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:33.630
that are -- metal bat
versus a wooden bat,

01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:36.500
the uniform that you wear,
what you're representing.

01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:38.800
And in some of our work at
the Library, we're looking

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.390
at these collection items.

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:41.690
We're thinking a
lot about the data.

01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:43.610
But there's also
the representation

01:47:43.610 --> 01:47:44.910
of [inaudible] as an image.

01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:46.680
What does that show us?

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:50.120
And I wonder, Rob, if you can
share or reflect on how some

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.290
of -- spaces of baseball
or items or objects

01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:56.050
of baseball are changing, and
how that connects to the types

01:47:56.050 --> 01:47:59.080
of -- the forms of baseball
that we see played today

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.980
or other people have
played in the past.

01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:05.000
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: Most of the work
I've done on baseball's been

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.350
in the Caribbean or
in black communities,

01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:13.130
looking at baseball pretty much
before integration [static].

01:48:13.130 --> 01:48:16.750
There's virtually no artifacts.

01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:19.120
What you have are memories.

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.340
If you're lucky,
you find photos.

01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:24.060
The amount of footage is scant.

01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:30.710
I think, you know,
the last 25 years

01:48:30.710 --> 01:48:33.250
or so is baseball has
become overcapitalized.

01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:36.790
There's increasing stuff.

01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:39.220
But in some ways, to
me, it has less meaning.

01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:40.830
It's noise.

01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:44.690
The same way I feel when I go
to a Major League ballgame,

01:48:44.690 --> 01:48:49.020
which is why I don't feel it's
as enjoyable as a Minor League

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:51.910
or a Caribbean or a
Little League game,

01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:55.090
because you can't even hear
the person next to you talk.

01:48:55.090 --> 01:48:57.400
You feel overwhelmed by it.

01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.070
So I'm probably not the one
to answer your question.

01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:03.200
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Oh, I think
that's a perfect way to connect

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.360
to spaces that may
be disappearing

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:06.660
or still in [inaudible].

01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:10.000
Go ahead, Clinton.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.340
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: As
I was there recently

01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:13.640
and I wanted to point it out.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:14.940
My mother, who was
in the crowd --

01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.240
she's from Kansas
City, Missouri.

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.100
And in Kansas City, the Negro
League Baseball Museum is there.

01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:20.890
Bob Kendrick is the
President of that facility.

01:49:20.890 --> 01:49:23.230
And what it does
is -- to your point

01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:26.200
about things being
scant, that is very true.

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:27.580
There's not a ton.

01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.020
But there is a lot of it there.

01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:30.320
And what it does
that's interesting,

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.730
and this is not necessarily
correlated.

01:49:31.730 --> 01:49:33.550
I just thought to bring it up.

01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:35.500
You realize that
what it chronicles is

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:38.360
as much the history of
America as it is the history

01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:39.970
of many things necessarily
baseball.

01:49:39.970 --> 01:49:41.270
It really is, you know?

01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:43.160
And that's sort of
what you're --

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.940
speaking to your point about how
sports affects people, you know,

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:49.870
one of the first women owners in
sports was in the Negro Leagues.

01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:51.760
One of the first times
where they, you know,

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.200
they played in those outside
view as communities first,

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:57.820
be it the Caribbean, be in
Japan, be in wherever, you know?

01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:04.210
And it is scant, but it is
not non-existent, you know?

01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:07.090
And I think that's why
collections and things

01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:09.540
of this ilk are important
because everything

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:10.840
at some point becomes scant

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:12.140
because you can't
keep everything,

01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:13.440
you know what I mean?

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.170
But there are collections
that do these jobs to keep

01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:17.720
around what, you know,
what people could.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:19.550
And it is, it's really
fascinating

01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:20.850
to look at, you know, this --

01:50:20.850 --> 01:50:22.300
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: To reinforce that.

01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:27.060
I mean, there's a reason
why Buck O'Neil was the star

01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:30.010
of Ken Burns's work on baseball,

01:50:30.010 --> 01:50:32.140
and I think a much
more important figure

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.900
than Shelby Foote
in the Civil War.

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:39.950
And Buck's memories and stories
and reflections steal the show.

01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:41.250
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

01:50:41.250 --> 01:50:43.730
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: But it underscores
how much your point is

01:50:43.730 --> 01:50:48.360
that questions of baseball are
questions of American history.

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.550
And perhaps no more so
than when it comes to race.

01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:54.300
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
I'll, first of all,

01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.600
just second the recommendation

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.860
of the incredible Negro
League Museum in Kansas City,

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.010
which is like, I think, one
of the best history museums

01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:02.630
in America that I've been to.

01:51:02.630 --> 01:51:05.200
And then it's also to say I
think what you say is very

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.090
right, and I think -- you
know, so I teach math.

01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:08.390
That's what I do for a living.

01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:12.070
And I find that one way
I tell stories about math

01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:13.920
as a teacher is to tell
stories about baseball

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:15.940
because baseball touches
math like through statistics.

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:18.330
And in the same way, I think,
you know, you teach history,

01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:20.890
Rob, and I think because
baseball touches so many things,

01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:25.100
as teachers one of the ways we
can teach whatever subject it

01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.550
is, like whether it's history,
whether it's sociology,

01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:30.940
whether it's African American
Studies, whether it's math.

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.950
We can teach those through
the lens of baseball

01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:35.290
because baseball
touches them all.

01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:37.400
It's not just the story
of American history,

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.700
but is the story of
American history.

01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:40.650
It's the story of like all
those things put together.

01:51:40.650 --> 01:51:43.020
And you can meet -- I mean,
you know, I meet a lot of kids

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:44.440
who don't think they
care about math,

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.740
but they know they
care about baseball.

01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:47.040
They know they care
about arguing

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.340
about which player is
better than another.

01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:51.510
You may -- I mean, you know, a
kid who's a little kid today.

01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:52.880
You say, like, you
know, there was a time

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.260
like when a black man
couldn't go to Woolworth's.

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:55.560
They'll be like,
what's Woolworth's?

01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.860
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.160
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Like
-- but if you say like,

01:51:58.160 --> 01:51:59.460
not everybody could play
Major League baseball.

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:01.910
I mean that's -- I think
that's as meaningful

01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:03.210
and kids feel it as [inaudible].

01:52:03.210 --> 01:52:04.510
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: I was there.

01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:05.810
It's a huge discussion in
sports around the world, I mean,

01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:07.420
because I happen to be of
the opinion that anybody

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.120
who played before
integration, I'm sorry,

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.820
you're throwing your
records out, like I just --

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.570
as a matter of course
they're not [inaudible].

01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:13.870
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: And they
don't call it the White League.

01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:15.170
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
That's right, right.

01:52:15.170 --> 01:52:16.470
[ Multiple Speakers ]

01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:17.930
And that's a huge point
of contention for --

01:52:17.930 --> 01:52:19.440
because a lot of --
the most famous players

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:22.390
in people's minds ever played
long before integration,

01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:23.690
you know?

01:52:23.690 --> 01:52:24.990
And so that -- yeah, it touches
on a lot of different things.

01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:26.290
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: But I
think the math people get that,

01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:27.590
by the way.

01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:28.890
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:30.190

to the mathiest [assumed
spelling] people

01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:32.790
who study baseball statistics,
I think they understand

01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:34.090
that there's like a discount
that you have to [inaudible]

01:52:34.090 --> 01:52:35.390
that you can't avoid that.

01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:36.690

And they just kind of -- we've
encountered this this week

that don't match each other,

as subjects we give things.

As professional organizations
that categorize information,

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:46.870
how there may be a
disconnect between the kinds

01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:50.110
of stories we're talking about,
the ways, the oral histories,

01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:53.140

people talk about baseball

or life in general, which
includes recounting being

01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:59.300
at a game or being with someone,
meeting someone at a game,

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:02.170
knowing where you were when
kinds of conversations.

01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:04.190
So I wonder if any of you
want to share anything

01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:07.600
about the ways you think memory
can be connected to talking

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:11.130
about baseball or where you
may have recently have found

01:53:11.130 --> 01:53:12.970
something that was
surprising when someone did try

01:53:12.970 --> 01:53:15.400
to describe something
to you about baseball.

not that I just acknowledged
talking to you.

01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:23.560
A very elderly cousin of
mine who, unfortunately,

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:25.260
just died about a year
ago, Marilyn Sachs,

01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:27.810
who was a children's book
writer, and from one thing --

01:53:27.810 --> 01:53:29.340
I mean, when I talked to
her a couple of years ago,

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:33.460
she was pretty old and her
memory was not completely there.

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.070
But she was telling me
a story I never knew,

01:53:35.070 --> 01:53:39.740
which was that how she met her
husband in the '40s in New York,

01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.920
was that they were both
Communists and they were

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:44.280
on a door-to-door
drive, knocking on doors,

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.180
getting a petition
signed for the Dodgers

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:48.940
to bring Jackie Robinson
up from the Minor Leagues.

01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:51.760
And that was like their first
date, the fact it was going on,

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:53.680
not in Brooklyn,
knocking on doors trying

01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.370
to get other Communists
to like sign this petition

01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:57.720
to like get Jackie
Robinson up to the Majors.

many intersections there, right?

ain't [inaudible].

a thing on social media.

01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:11.610
[Inaudible] I go to basically,
and it's for that exact reason,

01:54:11.610 --> 01:54:13.680
is that it -- while
I'm doing it,

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.300
it provides memory of the game.

01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:17.860
I can share it with
other people.

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:20.450
People can understand
that there's more to it

01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:22.470
than just sort of
looking at it, you know?

01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:26.970
And I think that that's a oddly
-- not oddly, but that is,

01:54:26.970 --> 01:54:31.060
I think, where baseball sort
of scores, pardon the pun,

01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:34.290
over a lot of other sports, is
that there's a memory element.

01:54:34.290 --> 01:54:38.190
This for me, it's very different
than a lot of other sports.

01:54:38.190 --> 01:54:42.590
I remember -- you know, the way
I remember baseball games is

01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:43.890
by the notation.

01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:48.360

apples-to-apples comparison fro

different -- other
sports, you know?

01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:51.770
And that's why I do it is

01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:53.070
because it's there,
it's available.

01:54:53.070 --> 01:54:54.630
I was pissed this year
when the Nat's, by the way,

01:54:54.630 --> 01:54:55.930
like didn't allow
their scorecard.

01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:57.760
You know, they stopped giving
away scorecards and I'm

01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.560
like what are you doing?

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.690
I was like, how do you -- like
you're instantly deleting half

01:55:04.690 --> 01:55:06.640
of the reason why people are
going, is to remember the fact

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:07.940
that they were there, you know?

01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:09.900
And if you kind of
like pay x -- so.

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:11.680
That is a huge part
of baseball in a way

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.400
that I think is very
different in a lot of respects.

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.440

that connects a little bit also

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.370

01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:33.170
The flip side of that though --

01:56:33.170 --> 01:56:34.470
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: I'm sorry.

01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:35.770
We're trying to make
it way too easy.

01:56:35.770 --> 01:56:37.070
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: -- is
that when I'm listening

01:56:37.070 --> 01:56:38.880
to all the stuff you've
brought together, I mean,

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.950
I feel if there was a
subject I was interested in,

01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:47.690
I'd be overwhelmed by the amount
of material and information.

01:56:47.690 --> 01:56:51.550
And it seems to me the next
step is not just to make all

01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:55.380
that universe of material
possible, but figure out how

01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:59.860
to filter and prioritize so
that I can tell my grad students

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:02.790
to do it [inaudible]
my expectations.

01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:04.090
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: This
week we -- oh, sorry.

01:57:04.090 --> 01:57:05.390
Go ahead.

01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:06.690
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: I think what
would be most valuable to me,

01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:07.990
and I think about this
as somebody that doesn't

01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:10.660
like television at this
point, would be able to --

01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:13.030
if you could categorize
how you see things,

01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:15.100
like if I said I want to see
every homer that happened

01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:18.360
on July 17, 1988,
you know what I mean,

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.210
like around the league
or whatever.

01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:25.980
Like those kind of
specificities for visual --

01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:27.280
even if I could listen to them.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.580
You know, radio calls
or whatever.

01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:30.940
Like that to me would be
cool because you could --

01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:33.390
for whatever reason the way
my brain categorizes things,

01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:36.060
like this day in history
kind of stuff, really is --

01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:37.920
speaks for me, you
know what I --

01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:42.330
and that that to me would
be a very valuable resource

01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:45.290
to know like, you know, what
was happening on this day

01:57:45.290 --> 01:57:48.210
in the world, nevermind in
a ballpark, and kind of look

01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:51.490
at them all in the same space
and sort of compare them and go

01:57:51.490 --> 01:57:53.810
from there as to how I look at
the rest of the globe, you know?

01:57:53.810 --> 01:57:55.110
That to me would be critical.

01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:56.980
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: And
that's what I love about images

01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:58.280
of old newspapers, right?

01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.580
Because it would be the base --

01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:00.880
the story about the
baseball game.

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:02.180
And next to it, you know --

01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.480
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.780
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
-- there's like a story

01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:06.080
about like strikebreakers
and police or there's a story

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:07.380
about like what's happening
in Asia, or like whatever.

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:09.830
And you sort of see like,
okay, not just what happened

01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:12.450
on the baseball field, but the
people who were experiencing

01:58:12.450 --> 01:58:15.620
that in the time, what
else was on their mind?

01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:16.920
You know what I mean?

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.290
That puts it in context.

01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:19.600
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Well,
I promised we would talk

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.090
about baseball idiom
and language,

01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:22.960
so let's talk a little
bit about the ways

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:25.700
that baseball is
integrated unexpectedly

01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:27.470
into American vernacular.

01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:30.800
As someone, Clinton, as someone
who's a sport journalist,

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.910
you probably encounter this all
the time and have to find ways

01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:35.920
to not use sporting
analogy all of the time.

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.220
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: This is a
tough one for me, right --

01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.520
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Yeah.

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:39.820
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: -- because
I'm also a massive baseball fan

01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:41.120
that talks in baseball lingo
just as a matter of course.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.420
So I don't --

01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.720
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Yeah.

01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:45.020
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: That's hard.

01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:46.320
I mean I just realized
I did that earlier

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:47.620
when I said it's a
couple of relay throws --

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:48.920
it's like a distance
of [laughter] --

01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.220
space that I use in my mind.

01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:52.810
And so that's -- I'm going to
listen on this one [inaudible].

01:58:52.810 --> 01:58:54.750
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Well, if
we think about maybe listening

01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:56.530
about rather than direct
language like metaphors

01:58:56.530 --> 01:58:59.030
of baseball and whether
or not baseball --

01:58:59.030 --> 01:59:01.750
we can understand other --
we're arguing in our exhibit

01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:04.170
that you can understand American
history through baseball,

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:08.030
or you can see direct metaphor
for particular points in time

01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:09.980
or the ways that people
organize themselves.

01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:12.080
Do you have any reflections
on that, Jordan?

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.020
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
I mean I want to say

01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:17.270
that in some things we're
like the exact wrong people

01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:19.330
to answer this question
because, like, we're immersed

01:59:19.330 --> 01:59:21.740
and we hear those words and
that language is alive for us,

01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:23.530
so we know what's
being referred to:

01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:24.830
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:26.130
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: And what
I suspect is that for a lot

01:59:26.130 --> 01:59:30.740
of Americans in 2018, they
will say, give me strength.

01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:32.040
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Yeah.

01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:33.750
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: But they
may not even know that refers

01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:35.050
to -- or maybe -- I mean,

01:59:35.050 --> 01:59:36.510
what I would compare it
to is the way I feel.

01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:37.810
I think what happened

01:59:37.810 --> 01:59:39.990
to our language is governed
by nautical metaphor.

01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:41.290
And, you know, you say

01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:42.590
like somebody's three
sheets to the wind.

01:59:42.590 --> 01:59:43.890
Like I don't know what
the hell that means.

01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:45.190
Look I feel like the sheet
was probably [inaudible]

01:59:45.190 --> 01:59:46.910
like attached to the boat
and then there was like wind.

01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:48.210
I mean

01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:49.510
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Maybe
a mast was involved, like

01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:50.810
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Yeah.

01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:52.110
Like there's no way that
doesn't have something

01:59:52.110 --> 01:59:53.410
to do with a boat.

01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:54.710
I'm like that's -- you know,

01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:56.010
that's fossilized
language to me.

01:59:56.010 --> 01:59:57.310
That's gone.

01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:58.610
And maybe if there's like
any sailors in the audience,

01:59:58.610 --> 01:59:59.910
like can they tell
me what it means.

01:59:59.910 --> 02:00:01.830
But I think I -- to be
honest, I think for a lot

02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:03.210
of Americans today, a lot

02:00:03.210 --> 02:00:05.070
of that baseball language
is probably like that.

02:00:05.070 --> 02:00:06.570
They're sort of like dimly aware

02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:08.570
and have something
to do with baseball.

02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:10.390
But they can't really
put a reference to it.

02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:12.360
And yet they know what
sort of that word means

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.830
in English vernacular.

02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:15.130
And you should ask
them [inaudible].

02:00:15.130 --> 02:00:16.430
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Yeah.

02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:17.730
I want to [inaudible] --

02:00:17.730 --> 02:00:19.030
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: I mean, not to
mention -- I mean, that's not --

02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:20.330
just be real about the
incarceration policies

02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:21.630
in this country just involving
three strikes and how --

02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:22.930
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Yeah, yeah.

02:00:22.930 --> 02:00:24.230
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: -- like
that's as real as it gets,

02:00:24.230 --> 02:00:25.530
you know what I mean, in terms

02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:26.960
of putting people behind
bars vis-à-vis the concept

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:29.350
of like a baseball
metaphor making sense

02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:32.460
as to why you should be in
prison for the rest of your life

02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.760
as kind of crazy, you
know, [inaudible].

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.310
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Where
now we think of three strikes

02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:36.610
as like -- oh, yeah,
that's the [inaudible] --

02:00:36.610 --> 02:00:37.910
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:39.210
I would put them in cage
baseball if I was in jail

02:00:39.210 --> 02:00:40.510
for three -- you
know what I'm saying?

02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:41.830
Like yeah, like --
because that's --

02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:43.130
you know -- but whatever.

02:00:43.130 --> 02:00:44.430
That's sort of a
different discussion.

02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:45.830
But, yeah, I mean
that's, to me, is --

02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:47.350
that's drilling down
as far as you can go

02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:50.400
for taking away people's
freedoms based on the notion

02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:52.870
of what happens when you're in
a batter's box as determined

02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:55.390
by an umpire based on
a pitcher and a catcher

02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:57.600
and [inaudible] like
that's crazy.

02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:01.610
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Picking
up on a little bit of a thread

02:01:01.610 --> 02:01:02.910
that you had there,
Jordan, of that --

02:01:02.910 --> 02:01:04.390
of you not being the
right people to ask.

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:05.690
I disagree.

02:01:05.690 --> 02:01:06.990
I think you're the
perfect people

02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:08.290
to ask these kinds of questions.

02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:09.590
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Okay.

02:01:09.590 --> 02:01:10.890
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: But I
also wonder if you can --

02:01:10.890 --> 02:01:12.680
kind of related to what
you both are talking

02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:15.870
about of being removed -- taking
baseball out of its context,

02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:18.780
and there's -- this could be
a slightly controversial view

02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:20.790
or it could be something
that you think is true,

02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:23.860
this idea of a decline of
baseball as America's Pastime,

02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:27.780
or that should it still
be America's Pastime?

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.020
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: I don't think there
is a national pastime anymore.

02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.660
I mean, I think that sporting
interests are fractionalized.

02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:38.550
Clearly the NFL is the most
successful economic sporting

02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:41.110
league in U.S. sporting history.

02:01:41.110 --> 02:01:44.610
Even that could be at some
sort of existential crossroads

02:01:44.610 --> 02:01:46.150
for a number of reasons.

02:01:46.150 --> 02:01:48.940
You know, I look at my students.

02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:51.400
And I've been teaching
the History of Sport

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:54.740
since the late '70s at the
University of Pittsburgh.

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:58.830
And it was easy to discuss
baseball and to have

02:01:58.830 --> 02:02:00.270
that common shared knowledge.

02:02:00.270 --> 02:02:03.540
And I think Jordan's point
is right on the money.

02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:05.590
They don't have the
language anymore.

02:02:05.590 --> 02:02:07.420
They don't have the memory.

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:12.170
I can talk about Bill Mazeroski
and Clemente, and a lot of them,

02:02:12.170 --> 02:02:15.660
you know, they'd rather I'm
talking about Leonore Messi.

02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:20.290
And it's -- I think
we're past that point

02:02:20.290 --> 02:02:24.730
where we have one
collective sporting experience

02:02:24.730 --> 02:02:27.070
that is defined by
a single sport.

02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:28.920
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: I'll
tell you this though.

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.480
And this is something that
I don't know that it's --

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:34.180
I know that a lot of
Americans take it for granted.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:37.590
If you go to another country and
you throw something to somebody,

02:02:37.590 --> 02:02:39.260
they will likely take
it as an assumption

02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:41.160
that you were throwing it
at them and not to them.

02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:43.910
And that is a very
interesting thing about how --

02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:46.640
I mean, just -- I'm saying
though, like you did -- no.

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:49.570
You get my point, You know what
I mean is that like that --

02:02:49.570 --> 02:02:51.740
on a very interesting base
level, whether or not they care

02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.980
about baby league baseball or
whatever, the simplest part

02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:57.590
of the game is something that
is integrated into our society.

02:02:57.590 --> 02:02:59.000
Remember, you all,
hey, catch this.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.660
It's not going to freak you out.

02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:01.960
You know, you're
probably going to catch it

02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:04.080
and you're probably going to
be able to send it back --

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:05.380
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Yes.

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:06.680
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: --
without much of an issue.

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:08.500
And that's why I think baseball,
not changes the past time.

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.820
It will simply exist in a
different part of our brains

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:14.520
as a sporting level, but what
the actions are are very much,

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.400
very much engrained
in our, in who we are

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.700
in this society, you know?

02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:19.890
Throwing and catching is
a pretty standard American

02:03:19.890 --> 02:03:21.400
operation, you know.

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:22.790
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: That's the
perfect segue into a question

02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:24.420
about whether or not --

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:27.410
or do you view baseball
as an international sport.

02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:30.720
And I think there's maybe
certain places in the world

02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:33.980
that we think of as
connected to the United States

02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:36.150
through baseball in a
professionalized way,

02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:38.170
but you may also have other
reflections that you want

02:03:38.170 --> 02:03:41.970
to share about amateur
or community sport.

02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:46.360
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I
mean, I think it's both.

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:47.660
I mean, I think baseball,

02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:48.960
more than it ever has
been, is a world sport.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:51.500
But it's also a world sport
whose home is the United States.

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:54.380
I mean, I think -- I don't think
there's any contradiction there,

02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:56.230
that the U.S. is
kind of the temple.

02:03:56.230 --> 02:03:59.600
And I think it's still true that
like the greatest world players,

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.410
their ambition is to not play in
Korea, like not play in Taiwan,

02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:07.680
like not play in Mexico, but
to play in the United States.

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.170
And I kind of like
about it that it's a --

02:04:10.170 --> 02:04:13.090
but it's a different mix, right?

02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:15.580
It's not like -- the NBA has
become a world sport, too.

02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:16.880
But it's like a different
mix of countries.

02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:19.190
Baseball has this
kind of like, you now,

02:04:19.190 --> 02:04:22.730
sort of a Pacific orientation,
right, where it's like --

02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:24.030
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: I wish.

02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:25.330
I mean, I'm being honest.

02:04:25.330 --> 02:04:26.630
Like that's going to be the
death of major league baseball,

02:04:26.630 --> 02:04:28.220
is being concerned about
being too American.

02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:29.560
I mean that's, you know,
really the way it is.

02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:30.860
You look at the culture
of the game.

02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:33.320
You watch some world
baseball classic

02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.240
where different nations
field different squads.

02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:39.150
You know, you've seen this,
you now, with your scholarship

02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:40.450
on the Caribbean and so forth.

02:04:40.450 --> 02:04:41.750
It's a totally different concept

02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:43.050
than what the game even
is, you know what I mean.

02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:44.350
And so from an entertainment
standpoint,

02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:48.670
nevermind the participation
standpoint, it has to be global

02:04:48.670 --> 02:04:50.040
in order for it to survive.

02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:51.980
And that's sort of the
large mistake, I think,

02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:53.870
that the big leagues is
making, is that they're trying

02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:55.780
to make it very much this sort

02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:59.740
of puritanical nonsense
that's boring and, you know,

02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:01.660
you go to so many
different places

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.520
and it's just -- it's more fun.

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.820
It's a different thing.

02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.980
And it has to be global in
order for it to be, I think,

02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:09.100
real for a lot of people.

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:10.880
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
[Inaudible] baseball classics.

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.870
You get like lots of teams
from different countries

02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:16.970
and they're not playing in the
same styles as American players.

02:05:16.970 --> 02:05:18.900
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
One thousand percent.

02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:20.770
Oh, yeah. Like that
-- I mean, that's --

02:05:20.770 --> 02:05:22.740
I mean, we could break this
down on a strategy level,

02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:24.730
we could break this
down on a style level.

02:05:24.730 --> 02:05:26.710
You could break it down
on a communications level,

02:05:26.710 --> 02:05:28.010
you know what I mean?

02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:29.710
This way -- the way people talk,
the way that people run bases,

02:05:29.710 --> 02:05:33.910
the way the people,
I don't know --

02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:36.240
the aggressiveness with
which, you know, the strategy

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:37.540
with which they use the game.

02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:39.570
It is very different
in different places

02:05:39.570 --> 02:05:41.690
across the globe for sure.

02:05:41.690 --> 02:05:42.990
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: And
[inaudible] about the kind

02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:46.560
of stultifying conformity of the
kind of this is how it's done,

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:47.860
and if not, then this other way.

02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:49.160
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:50.460
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
That -- and I --

02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:51.760
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: It sucks.

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.060
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: --

02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:54.360
a hundred percent in
agreement [inaudible].

02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.660
But it's interesting.

02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.740
I would have said -- I mean,

02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:00.890
I've never noticed the
players who [inaudible].

02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:02.190
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Okay.

02:06:02.190 --> 02:06:06.570
I'll give you a great
example of this.

02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:11.140
Clint Hurdle is the
Manager of the Pirates.

02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:13.600
Clint Hurdle was a number
one pick in the draft.

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.570
Clint Hurdle hit like 40
bombs in his 10-year career.

02:06:16.570 --> 02:06:18.280
And Clint Hurdle has been
managing in the Big Leagues

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:19.580
for God knows how long.

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:21.700
And Clint Hurdle is not a
good manager [laughter].

02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:23.920
Bobby Baez is probably one

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.760
of the most exciting
players in all of baseball.

02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:28.320
Javier Baez hit a bomb
against the Pirates in --

02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.620
you know, hammed it a little.

02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:33.550
And Clint Hurdle went off about
how this is not how you do this

02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:34.850
and this is not how you do that.

02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:36.150
And I'm like, you know,

02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:37.800
Clint Hurdle was a bum
compared to Javier Baez.

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.100
You know what I'm saying?

02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.140
And like that -- and he just --
he didn't appreciate the fact

02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:43.820
that he was celebrating
something he had done well.

02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:47.540
I mean, that right there showed
me exactly all you needed

02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.130
to know, a random white guy

02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:54.820
who was not a very good
player felt the need to scold,

02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:58.160
you know, a young Latino player
who was showing too much emotion

02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:00.200
for what he felt was
appropriate to the game.

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:02.750
And that, to me, is a
massive problem with baseball,

02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:05.240
just as a matter of
course, in general.

02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:06.540
You know what I'm saying?

02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:07.840
That's -- come on.

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.140
You know what I mean?

02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:10.440
Like we're going to have fun.

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.740
We're not here to talk
about unwritten rules.

02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:13.040
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: I'll let
you slide on fertile.

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:16.900
But just [laughter] -- don't
dis my column [laughter].

02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:18.200
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: I'll bet.

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:21.550
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: Getting
back to your question.

02:07:21.550 --> 02:07:23.700
The Major Leagues have
always seen themselves

02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:25.000
as the temple of the game.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.290
And they've always
wanted to dominate.

02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:34.490
But, frankly, MLB was never
the only game of baseball.

02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:39.020
And a hundred years ago the best
white and black players went

02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:41.580
down to the Caribbean
and played winter ball.

02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:44.800
During the summer, players
from the Caribbean came

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:47.180
and played either Major
or Negro League Ball,

02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:50.340
depending on whether
they passed for white.

02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:54.120
The demarcation point
is integration.

02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:58.330
And in the years after that,
particularly with the expansion

02:07:58.330 --> 02:08:03.580
of different media and
the ability to broadcast,

02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:07.570
the games in the islands and
in Mexico increasing sucked

02:08:07.570 --> 02:08:11.090
into MLB's commercial organ.

02:08:11.090 --> 02:08:13.670
And that's what I
think is deadly.

02:08:13.670 --> 02:08:17.370
I agree with you
totally about the style.

02:08:17.370 --> 02:08:20.520
I mean a Cuban game,
a Dominican game,

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:23.300
a Nicaraguan game,
differ from MLB.

02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:28.670
But what's even more fun is
the style in the stands --

02:08:28.670 --> 02:08:29.970
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

02:08:29.970 --> 02:08:33.610
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: -- where it's just
not piped-in music all the time.

02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:37.560
Or, you know perogy races.

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.730
It's just real action.

02:08:39.730 --> 02:08:43.320
And it's a far more
exciting experience.

02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:45.250
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: I might
connect back to this idea

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:48.690
of community in experiencing
a game you mentioned.

02:08:48.690 --> 02:08:49.990
We've heard this a couple

02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:51.290
of different times
in the conversation.

02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:54.550
We've talked about coming
together in a sandlot style

02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:57.300
and how people share information
or connect with one another,

02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:00.230
or the way they anticipate or
plan their runs to the bathroom

02:09:00.230 --> 02:09:03.480
or next snacks because they
know what's coming up ahead,

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:06.490
or they need -- they want to
get on the camera if they're

02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:09.520
in a professional
sporting space.

02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:11.130
So what are some of the ways

02:09:11.130 --> 02:09:13.190
that you think baseball
might provide --

02:09:13.190 --> 02:09:16.410
and Jordan,, maybe ask you
to speak to this baseball

02:09:16.410 --> 02:09:19.440
as an experience provides
the opportunity for people

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.990
to come together or
learn something new

02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:26.430
about the place that they are.

02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:27.730
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Well.

02:09:27.730 --> 02:09:29.030
I'm supposed to talk
into this now?

02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:30.330
Is that [inaudible]?

02:09:30.330 --> 02:09:34.550
Okay. I mean I'm going to say
something like very simple

02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:36.450
about it because I think
there's this very primal things

02:09:36.450 --> 02:09:41.130
where in your life it's actually
pretty rare that you're among

02:09:41.130 --> 02:09:44.430
like a large group of people
whose attention is focused

02:09:44.430 --> 02:09:49.130
in the exact same place
on the exact same thing.

02:09:49.130 --> 02:09:50.560
That's an uncommon experience.

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.060
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: All
of us here today, right?

02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:54.090
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
All the way.

02:09:54.090 --> 02:09:55.390
All of us were not
on our phones, right?

02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:56.690
I've had that experience
[inaudible].

02:09:56.690 --> 02:09:59.590
No. The -- I mean, okay.

02:09:59.590 --> 02:10:01.050
[Inaudible] a little bit
embarassing the story myself.

02:10:01.050 --> 02:10:05.730
But I took my kids to
the eclipse last summer.

02:10:05.730 --> 02:10:07.460
Like we drove down to Missouri
and went to the eclipse.

02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.940
And I did, you know, standing
there in this big field

02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:12.010
with like all these people,
like all kind of looking up

02:10:12.010 --> 02:10:13.310
and seeing the sun slip away.

02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:14.610
I was like, oh, yeah.

02:10:14.610 --> 02:10:16.440
Like this is like
baseball, right [laughter].

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:18.540
Like everybody here,
like this big huge crowd,

02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:21.790
all looking up at this like
round thing in the sky, right?

02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:23.090
Like they're all
in the same place.

02:10:23.090 --> 02:10:24.550
But the point is that does
not experience [inaudible]

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:25.850
very much.

02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:27.150
So I don't know if
that experience --

02:10:27.150 --> 02:10:28.450
if it's meaningful.

02:10:28.450 --> 02:10:30.930
It's meaningful without actually
meaning any particular thing,

02:10:30.930 --> 02:10:32.230
right?

02:10:32.230 --> 02:10:33.530
It's like meaningful
in this very primal way

02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:37.560
that I think it feeds some kind
of desire for mass experience

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:41.640
that we rarely are offered.

02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:42.940
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
I think [inaudible]

02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:44.240
in a point there's some --

02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:46.110
I'm not really sure this
answers the question,

02:10:46.110 --> 02:10:47.560
just something I thought
I wanted to highlight

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.490
because of the sort of the
dichotomy of the situation.

02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:56.610
But a couple of years ago
when there were riots,

02:10:56.610 --> 02:10:58.620
I'm using air quotes for
those of you listening

02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:00.690
on YouTube, in Baltimore.

02:11:00.690 --> 02:11:03.060
They always played a
game where they locked

02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.360
up the entire stadium.

02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:05.660
They didn't let anybody
into the ballpark

02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:06.960
and they played a Major
League Baseball Game.

02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:08.800
And I remember thinking at
the time -- I was at the game.

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.180
And I remember thinking, because
there was probably 50 people

02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:12.480
there covering the game,

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.500
which was another super
bizarre element of this.

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:18.380
But I remember thinking at the
time like we have really failed

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:20.600
as a nation on a lot of fronts

02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:23.190
if we're legitimately playing
baseball games in front

02:11:23.190 --> 02:11:24.990
of nobody for the sake --

02:11:24.990 --> 02:11:28.500
[ Applause ]

02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:29.800
You hear what I'm saying?

02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:31.100
Like for the sake of
the game continuing,

02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:33.570
but the actual experience being
robbed because of some concern

02:11:33.570 --> 02:11:34.870
about something that may

02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:38.230
or may not happen
outside of the ballpark.

02:11:38.230 --> 02:11:40.880
And it was eerie
on a lot of levels.

02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:46.500
And to the O's credit, this year
they've instituted this thing

02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:47.920
where you can bring your
kids to the ballpark

02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:49.330
for free if they're under 10.

02:11:49.330 --> 02:11:52.050
And you can sit up in the crowd
because nobody's there anyway.

02:11:52.050 --> 02:11:53.350
And so [laughter] I just --

02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:55.430
I mean I'm not saying
-- it's not a knock.

02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:57.490
I mean that's a legitimate way
to get people in the ballpark.

02:11:57.490 --> 02:11:59.030
And the reason I bring
that up is because it was

02:11:59.030 --> 02:12:03.010
such a stark contrast of
how, in the same place,

02:12:03.010 --> 02:12:05.520
different experiences can
be so different and can make

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:08.760
such a profound impact
on a community.

02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:11.980
And I remember talking
to people, you know,

02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:14.530
around the ballpark on what
I called the Ghost Game,

02:12:14.530 --> 02:12:16.020
and they were mad.

02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:17.620
They were like who
does this, you know?

02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:21.160
And now, you know, Camden Yards
is one of the nicest ballparks

02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.140
in America, and I just --
to me I -- it was very --

02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:26.940
an interesting example
of the evolution

02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:29.210
of what I think it kind of
needs to be like, you know,

02:12:29.210 --> 02:12:30.820
a lot of people [inaudible]
ballpark and people will

02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:32.120
like their sport more.

02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:33.930
Like that's pretty obvious.

02:12:33.930 --> 02:12:35.690
And to me that's a large part

02:12:35.690 --> 02:12:37.370
of the experience is the biggest
patch of grass that a lot

02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:38.670
of people are ever going
to see in their lives

02:12:38.670 --> 02:12:39.970
in one place, you know?

02:12:39.970 --> 02:12:42.100
And [inaudible] people
should experience that.

02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:43.950
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: You know I think
that this thing about sports is

02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:46.890
when you're playing it yourself,
when you're participating.

02:12:46.890 --> 02:12:48.930
The next best thing
is when those

02:12:48.930 --> 02:12:51.840
who are competing are people
you know and care about.

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:54.510
We get further and
further removed

02:12:54.510 --> 02:13:00.780
until we become these consumers
primarily on TV or on our phone

02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:06.490
or something, of people who
live in different zip codes.

02:13:06.490 --> 02:13:10.410
And I think if you flip it
historically with baseball,

02:13:10.410 --> 02:13:13.080
between World War I and
World War II there were 4-

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:17.690
or 500 independent baseball
teams in Western Pennsylvania.

02:13:17.690 --> 02:13:22.250
The two Negro League
teams, you had the Pirates.

02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:24.240
But the independent sandlot

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:27.420
and community teams drew
far more people each week

02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:30.130
than the professional clubs.

02:13:30.130 --> 02:13:33.860
And a lot of the people who
were playing were people

02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:37.710
who were playing into
their 40s or 50s,

02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:40.320
and 40 or 50 was relatively old.

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:42.680
And they were playing
in the neighborhood

02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:46.390
where people could walk to
work, walk there after work,

02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:48.050
throw some money
in a passing hat,

02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:51.610
and either see people
they cared about

02:13:51.610 --> 02:13:53.530
or be a part of the action.

02:13:53.530 --> 02:13:57.340
And that to me is when sport
provides the most community.

02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:00.160
I think we've gotten several
steps removed from that.

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.930
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: I want
to pick up on something

02:14:01.930 --> 02:14:03.230
that you mentioned
earlier, Clinton.

02:14:03.230 --> 02:14:04.560
And you and Jordan had a
little bit of a conversation

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:06.390
about this, about some

02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:09.770
of the greatest players
playing before integration,

02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:11.070
and also the ways that --

02:14:11.070 --> 02:14:12.930
so we've got a couple of
press cuttings [inaudible].

02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:14.320
I only have two more questions.

02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:15.990
This is the second to last.

02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:21.190
So this is a question that's
about what types of patterns

02:14:21.190 --> 02:14:23.590
that you've seen in history,
Rob and Clinton and Jordan.

02:14:23.590 --> 02:14:27.310
And maybe you're thinking about
the numbers and what types of --

02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:30.860
what would you think is the
most important type of statistic

02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:37.570
or form of playing baseball or
pattern from players in the past

02:14:37.570 --> 02:14:39.870
that we've lost in today's game?

02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:44.450
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Math Man.

02:14:44.450 --> 02:14:45.750
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Oh.

02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:49.840
I mean, if he means -- if
you really mean statistic,

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.180
then I think the answer
is nothing I can --

02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:52.480
just statistical richness

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:53.970
with which we understand
the sport today is just

02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:56.250
like vastly greater than it
was in any point in the past.

02:14:56.250 --> 02:14:58.030
So I actually think we
have everything we had

02:14:58.030 --> 02:14:59.330
in the past and like --

02:14:59.330 --> 02:15:00.630
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Then
the numbers are consistent

02:15:00.630 --> 02:15:01.930
over time --

02:15:01.930 --> 02:15:03.230
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
And that's my point.

02:15:03.230 --> 02:15:04.530
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: -- and
other things have changed.

02:15:04.530 --> 02:15:05.830
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I mean,
well, apart from the fact that,

02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:07.860
you know, as Clinton brought
up, there was like differences

02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:09.650
in playing conditions like
literally who was allowed

02:15:09.650 --> 02:15:11.880
to play and who the competition
was and who was pitching to you.

02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:15.190
So that, obviously, is something
that you have to do separately

02:15:15.190 --> 02:15:17.910
from a numerical computation.

02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:20.350
But I think, you know, the
age of statistics that sort

02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:23.370
of really gets started in like
the late '70s, early '80s.

02:15:23.370 --> 02:15:25.050
Like when Bill James
goes big and sort

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:27.000
of makes this a mass
market thing.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.760
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Does everybody
here know who Bill James is?

02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:30.060
Is like that's just
a [inaudible].

02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:31.360
I mean --

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:32.660
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I'm leaving

02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:33.960
that people don't
who Bill James is.

02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:35.260
I'm [inaudible].

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.560
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Why is that?

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:37.860
I mean I --

02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:39.160
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Bill James
is the guy who brought kind

02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:40.460
of modern statistical
analysis of baseball.

02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:41.760
People were doing it, but Bill
James was the person who was

02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:43.810
like I can sell my books in
the B. Daltons and Waldenbooks.

02:15:43.810 --> 02:15:45.790
And maybe nobody knows
what B. Dalton [inaudible].

02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:47.730
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: We got
further away [laughter].

02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:49.030
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I'm the --

02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:52.890
like he was the guy who had
the kind of quixotic belief

02:15:52.890 --> 02:15:55.450
that like I can make this
like a mass market thing.

02:15:55.450 --> 02:15:57.650
And now, you know, you go
to Miller Park in Milwaukee.

02:15:57.650 --> 02:16:00.110
There's like OPS and WHIP
like on the scoreboard,

02:16:00.110 --> 02:16:01.410
on the big Diamond Vision.

02:16:01.410 --> 02:16:02.710
It's like right there
for everybody to see.

02:16:02.710 --> 02:16:04.570
I did not think I would see
that happen in my lifetime.

02:16:04.570 --> 02:16:05.870
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:07.170
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
And I'm of the party --

02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:08.470
maybe it's obvious
that I would be --

02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:11.230
who thinks that's an
unalloyed good for baseball.

02:16:11.230 --> 02:16:13.830
I don't think that
replaces our fandom

02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:16.280
with spreadsheets
or number crunching.

02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:18.130
I think it just adds;
it doesn't subtract.

02:16:18.130 --> 02:16:19.430
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
I'm really interested

02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:20.730
to hear what you think about
this in terms of the way

02:16:20.730 --> 02:16:23.250
that this statistical
forms of baseball has sort

02:16:23.250 --> 02:16:24.550
of overtaken -- I
mean, you know,

02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:25.850
between launching
[inaudible] and [inaudible]

02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:27.150
and all this other stuff.

02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:28.760
Like I imagine this is not
very popular in your world.

02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:31.150
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: Well, I
stopped understanding math

02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:34.030
after Woodstock [laughter],
and a lot of other things.

02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:35.330
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Wow.

02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:38.630
What did you take [laughter]?

02:16:38.630 --> 02:16:42.020
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: You know the --
when you look at all the stats,

02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:44.380
you just don't have
that for Black Baseball.

02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:45.680
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:46.980
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: You don't have
that for the Caribbean.

02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:50.650
You're using a ball which
would have been thrown out if,

02:16:50.650 --> 02:16:52.380
you know, it was scratched

02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:54.640
or hit the ground
once in the majors.

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.970
These guys might have played
most of a game with it.

02:16:57.970 --> 02:17:01.240
They're playing with
terrible lighting on fields

02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:03.900
that are not going to
give you a true hump.

02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:08.650
So the statistical stuff for
that era mean little to me.

02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:14.630
You know that Joe DiMaggio
can say Satchel Paige is the

02:17:14.630 --> 02:17:20.710
toughest pitcher he ever
faced, or when I would talk

02:17:20.710 --> 02:17:22.700
about the Negro Leagues
in Western Pennsylvania

02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:25.980
and have guys who played
for their coalminer team,

02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:29.240
white guys, stand up and
tell me how proud they were

02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:31.330
that Josh Gibson hit
a home run off them.

02:17:31.330 --> 02:17:32.630
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

02:17:32.630 --> 02:17:33.930
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: That
resonates with me.

02:17:33.930 --> 02:17:37.650
You know, the stuff
you see in box scores

02:17:37.650 --> 02:17:41.150
from those days --
it's shaky stuff.

02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:42.450
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

02:17:42.450 --> 02:17:43.750
And when I watch a
game now, I mean,

02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:46.160
the fun part is the stat --

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:48.780
I mean the stats are part
of the game and the context

02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:52.390
of it is part of the notation,
it is part of the record.

02:17:52.390 --> 02:17:54.100
Like I said, I keep
score at games so that --

02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:57.090
that's sort of different
than statistics, obviously.

02:17:57.090 --> 02:17:58.670
But, you know, that's just --

02:17:58.670 --> 02:17:59.990
that's a part of the
game that I'm not going

02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:01.480
to say I don't care about
because that's not true.

02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.270
But it is not -- it is
behind the action, you know?

02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:07.260
And that's, that's -- but
that's also why it's cool,

02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:09.210
because you never -- you know,

02:18:09.210 --> 02:18:10.510
you don't remember
these things, you know.

02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:11.810
That's what they're there for.

02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:13.720
But, you know, the most
important stat to me is always

02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:15.650
when everybody forgets about
votes, which is runs scored.

02:18:15.650 --> 02:18:17.010
The player who scores
the most runs

02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:19.490
on a team is typically the best
player on the team [laughter],

02:18:19.490 --> 02:18:21.190
just so you know that.

02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:22.490
Yeah.

02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:23.790
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Actually,
can I -- I could have --

02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:26.550
I want to -- can I follow
up on that question, too?

02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:27.850
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter:
You may, of course.

02:18:27.850 --> 02:18:29.150
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: Am I
allowed to like usurp --

02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:30.450
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Of course.

02:18:30.450 --> 02:18:31.750
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
-- momentarily.

02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:33.050
Okay. Because I think when I
think about what's different

02:18:33.050 --> 02:18:34.350
about the way the fans
today experience baseball --

02:18:34.350 --> 02:18:36.270
I don't think, actually, the
new regime of statistics makes

02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:37.570
that much different in how.

02:18:37.570 --> 02:18:38.870
I think, as you say, when
people are watching them

02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:40.290
when they watch the game is does
the guy cross the plate or not.

02:18:40.290 --> 02:18:41.590
And that's what they're
watching.

02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:44.610
But what I think is truly
different is to the extent

02:18:44.610 --> 02:18:47.450
that people's interaction
with the business

02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:49.820
of the sport is part
of their fandom.

02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:51.120
I mean, then you brought
it up when you talked

02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:53.500
about how it has become
more distant and more

02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:54.800
of a consumer operation.

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:56.400
I mean, it kind of blows my
mind that my son, he's 12,

02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.210
he loves playing baseball
games on his phone.

02:18:58.210 --> 02:19:00.490
And he has one game where
he's like the hitter

02:19:00.490 --> 02:19:01.790
and a little pitch comes
and then he sort of tries

02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:03.090
to hit the phone
at the right time

02:19:03.090 --> 02:19:04.390
to make the bat hit the ball.

02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:06.390
But he has another game
where he's like the GM

02:19:06.390 --> 02:19:08.210
of a baseball team
and he has like --

02:19:08.210 --> 02:19:11.080
he thinks of both of those as
baseball games on the phone.

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:12.380
You know what I mean?

02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:13.680
And I do think that
for this generation

02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:17.260
of fans thinking okay, like,

02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:19.930
how many compensatory draft
picks am I going to get

02:19:19.930 --> 02:19:21.230
if I trade this player
at this time?

02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:23.330
It's part of what they're
thinking about, not just like is

02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:24.630
that third baseman
going to like --

02:19:24.630 --> 02:19:25.930
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

02:19:25.930 --> 02:19:27.230
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
-- be able to like get

02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:28.530
over [inaudible]
to make that play.

02:19:28.530 --> 02:19:29.830
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:31.130
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: That's
a little bit foreign to me.

02:19:31.130 --> 02:19:32.430
And to me, I think that -- and
I'm curious what you guys think

02:19:32.430 --> 02:19:34.130
about that as -- in terms of
this next generation of fandom.

02:19:34.130 --> 02:19:35.690
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: The
League Manager is sort

02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:36.990
of what you're referring to.

02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:39.150
And there's games that are
based solely on that, you know,

02:19:39.150 --> 02:19:41.220
where you're not even playing
-- like video games, you know,

02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:44.100
like actual consoles, you know,
where that's all you're doing.

02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:46.160
That -- I don't need
that personally.

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.460
I mean, that's not a knock.

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:48.760
And I just -- I just don't --

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:50.060
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: This is

02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:51.360
like the old man
portion of the program.

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:52.660
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Oh, no.

02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:53.960
I mean [laughter] --

02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:55.260
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: He's
worried about the [inaudible].

02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:56.560
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: I mean
I -- well, to be fair,

02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:57.860
I'd say the reason I don't do
it, because I'm not smart enough

02:19:57.860 --> 02:19:59.160
to get a handle on it.

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:00.460
I mean, that's what
it comes down to.

02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:01.760
I mean, at the end of
the day I like playing

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:03.060
because that was the easy part.

02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:04.360
Figuring out all this other
nonsense was hard, you know.

02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:05.660
So, that's not for me.

02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:06.960
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Okay, one
last question and I'm going

02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:08.350
to connect it back to our
Collections at the Library.

02:20:08.350 --> 02:20:11.190
We recently digitized
Branch Rickey's papers

02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:12.840
and released them, so
anyone can explore them.

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:15.610
And we heard a lot of
feedback publicly from people

02:20:15.610 --> 02:20:18.780
who were surprised and
excited to see different kinds

02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:21.500
of information within
the scouting reports

02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:22.800
and correspondence.

02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:25.520
And my question is,
what is an enduring myth

02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:28.120
that you think you would
like to either dispel

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:31.850
or you recently myth-busted
yourself about baseball?

02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:33.150
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: Hmph.

02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:34.450
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
Interesting question.

02:20:34.450 --> 02:20:36.750
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: You
can take your time today.

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:42.460
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Well, I
think a story worth noting

02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:44.770
about Branch Rickey that
may not necessarily go

02:20:44.770 --> 02:20:48.790
into the myth context
though, is that --

02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:50.850
I'm not going to say

02:20:50.850 --> 02:20:53.950
that integrating baseball was
not the most important thing

02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:55.250
that he did, because
I don't believe that.

02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:56.550
But people don't know
that Branch Rickey tried

02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:59.150
to start a third league like
the -- there was a whole --

02:20:59.150 --> 02:21:00.550
it was the National League,
there was the American League,

02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:01.880
and he tried to start
the Continental League.

02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:04.560
And I -- part like
-- I always think

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:07.560
about what would have
happened if that had been real.

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:08.860
You know what I'm saying?

02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:10.160
Like he had managed to --

02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:11.460
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: That
sounds like a great pilot.

02:21:11.460 --> 02:21:12.760
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: -- if he
had managed to pull that off,

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:14.060
like we're just some
third league

02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:15.360
where the big leagues were
now, you know -- there was --

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:17.820
I don't know, insert
15 more cities

02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:19.280
where there were just
Big League Teams now.

02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.580
That would have gotten
sort of subsumed

02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:21.880
into the large [inaudible].

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.620
I think about that all the
time in terms of who he was

02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:26.870
because it was more -- like he
wasn't just some dude trying

02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:29.230
to get, you know, one
brother into the big's.

02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:30.530
That wasn't what he was.

02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:32.770
He was a totally larger
baseball mind in terms

02:21:32.770 --> 02:21:34.730
of so many different
things for a business

02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:37.380
and a growth standpoint.

02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:40.010
And that oddly gets
forgotten a lot, you know,

02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:41.310
which understandably --

02:21:41.310 --> 02:21:43.010
obviously Jackie Robinson's
importance to America and,

02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:44.480
you know, baseball is huge,

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:45.950
and Branch Rickey's
involvement, and that was major.

02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:47.960
But that dude was much
bigger than that in terms

02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:52.580
of the specificity of the
sport and trying to grow it

02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:56.820
on an expansion level
in terms of [inaudible].

02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:59.810
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: Not to pile on
Branch too much, but you know,

02:21:59.810 --> 02:22:01.970
I think whoever described
him as the person

02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:05.860
who taught Machiavelli the
strike zone was on the money.

02:22:05.860 --> 02:22:07.600
And, you know, I thought
you were going to talk

02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:10.510
about the fact he built
a farm system in the '20s

02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:13.010
which monopolized
hundreds of kids --

02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:14.310
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

02:22:14.310 --> 02:22:16.190
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: -- for
the Cardinals.

02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:18.610
You know, Branch Rickey gets a
lot of credit, and I think a lot

02:22:18.610 --> 02:22:21.130
of it has been demolished
for integration.

02:22:21.130 --> 02:22:26.050
He's not doing it over
a social conscience --

02:22:26.050 --> 02:22:27.350
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Right.

02:22:27.350 --> 02:22:28.650
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: -- question.

02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:30.520
He's doing it to monopolize
talent, win championships,

02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:34.380
and improve the bottom line.

02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:38.310
And, you know, to me a more
interesting proposition would

02:22:38.310 --> 02:22:40.550
be, what if they had brought

02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:44.750
in Negro League Clubs
in the late '40s?

02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:47.480
And the Negro League
Clubs, after integration --

02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:48.780
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Yeah.

02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:51.270
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: -- which witnessed
their fanbase crumble overnight,

02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:53.450
petitioned Major
League Baseball --

02:22:53.450 --> 02:22:55.360
bring us in as a
high minor league.

02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:56.660
And [inaudible] didn't
even answer.

02:22:56.660 --> 02:22:59.860
And you could, you know
-- if that had happened,

02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:05.840
then you wouldn't have the
Al Campanis Movement in 1987

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:10.590
where there's no black managers,
GMs, front office, or ownership.

02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:12.830
We're a little bit better
now, but not all that much.

02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:15.100
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
Not by much at all.

02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:16.400
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter:
Well, thank you so much

02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:17.960
for chatting with
me exclusively.

02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:19.980
Let's open up to
questions here in the room.

02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:23.660
Oh, we got one right
there, enthusiastic.

02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:25.660
So we have some microphones
for you to bring around.

02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:26.960
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: Water?

02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:28.260
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Ah,
yes, please [inaudible].

02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:29.560
&gt;&gt; All right.

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:30.860
Charles Martin.

02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:32.160
Thanks to Rob Ruck
again for your blurb

02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:33.540
on my book, <i>Lawyerball </i>.

02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:35.690
I'd like to make a statement

02:23:35.690 --> 02:23:41.380
and a proposal regarding
this stultifying conformity

02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:46.660
of baseball, the existential
turning point of baseball.

02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:50.700
I suggest that they
have the same --

02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:54.480
they relate to the same problem,
and they have the same solution

02:23:54.480 --> 02:24:00.340
which is that baseball,
thanks to the Major Leagues

02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:05.140
and to the Congress in
whose library we're sitting,

02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:11.360
is one of the few
legal, economic cartels.

02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:14.400
And Mr. Yates, the Continental
League would never have

02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:19.780
succeeded because baseball would
have used its 1922 Supreme Court

02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:24.810
Exemption in the
Anti-Trust Laws to kill it.

02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:27.810
This is how economic
cartels behave.

02:24:27.810 --> 02:24:29.490
They do no innovate.

02:24:29.490 --> 02:24:31.860
They kill competition.

02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:35.770
And the way to solve the
existential problem of people

02:24:35.770 --> 02:24:38.990
like Rob Ruck no longer enjoying
going to baseball games,

02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:43.090
baseball games taking three
hours, kids not knowing

02:24:43.090 --> 02:24:49.920
who Mazeroski and other people
in history are is competition.

02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:55.910
You introduce competition,
you will save the game.

02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:57.210
The game is great.

02:24:57.210 --> 02:24:58.510
It's hard to kill.

02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:59.810
But Major League Baseball

02:24:59.810 --> 02:25:02.040
and Congress are doing
their best to kill it.

02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:03.840
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: Is
this where we applaud?

02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:12.340
[ Applause ]

02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:13.780
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Gates Ward.

02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:15.530
I was just wondering
if you ever think

02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:17.040
that we'll see a woman play

02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:19.480
in a non-exhibition Major
League Baseball Game?

02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:20.780
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: No.

02:25:20.780 --> 02:25:25.620
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: And I
think the reason for that is

02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:29.060
because I would rather just
watch women play baseball

02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:34.450
against other women than I would
necessarily some, you know,

02:25:34.450 --> 02:25:38.220
notion of egalitarianism
through competing against men.

02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:40.970
I like have a huge issue
with that on a lot of levels,

02:25:40.970 --> 02:25:42.270
mainly just because --

02:25:42.270 --> 02:25:44.860
for example, Serena Williams is
my favorite athlete of all time.

02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:46.780
Do I think she's the greatest
tennis play of all time.

02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:48.170
People like, you mean
for women, right?

02:25:48.170 --> 02:25:52.020
And I'm like, dog, that's
not -- first of all, no.

02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:56.350
And, secondarily, that's
not what that is, you know?

02:25:56.350 --> 02:26:01.700
And I would like to see
more opportunities for women

02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:03.070
to play baseball, period.

02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:06.620
And if it has to come only in
the world, in the framework

02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:12.510
of doing it against a man,
that's a major problem for me.

02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:17.010
[ Applause ]

02:26:17.010 --> 02:26:20.970
&gt;&gt; Questions relating
to the exhibit stairs.

02:26:20.970 --> 02:26:25.420
The first question is, the
exhibit really focused a lot

02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:27.000
on the evolution of baseball

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.950
and I was wondering what
the panel's position was

02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:33.300
on the current changes
in the baseball rules,

02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:37.820
whether it be raising the
mound, as what, 20 years ago

02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:41.800
or introducing the DH,
or even the new rules

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:43.800
that they're trying
to speed up the game

02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:46.170
by introducing differing things.

02:26:46.170 --> 02:26:49.020
As a historian or as
an ESPN commentator

02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:52.160
or as a mathematician
or statistician,

02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.510
how does that change the game
each time they introduce a new

02:26:55.510 --> 02:27:00.780
rule, or does it change the
game for the better or worse?

02:27:00.780 --> 02:27:02.080
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I mean,

02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:03.380
I'll just say this
as a mathematician.

02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:04.980
I value elegance a lot,
and I think this concept

02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:06.280
of having a runner start

02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:08.060
on second base is the most
cockamamie thing I've ever

02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:09.360
heard [laughter].

02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:11.090
I can't even say that it would
make the game better or worse.

02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:12.390
It's just ugly.

02:27:12.390 --> 02:27:13.690
And I don't like ugliness.

02:27:13.690 --> 02:27:17.930
So I oppose it on that ground.

02:27:17.930 --> 02:27:19.410
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates:
I went to a game

02:27:19.410 --> 02:27:23.160
in Nashville probably a month
ago, and if you don't know this,

02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:25.090
in AAA they've got pitch clocks.

02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:26.980
It's -- what is it?

02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:32.390
It's 30 seconds between batters,
15 seconds between pitches,

02:27:32.390 --> 02:27:34.420
20 if there's a runner on base.

02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:37.100
And, okay, you know,
like whatever.

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:38.870
Conceptually do I have
any problem with this?

02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:41.150
And I realized that my
only issue with it was

02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:42.790
that there's clocks
on the field.

02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:44.550
And like the huge cool
part about baseball is

02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:45.850
that there's no dang old clocks.

02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:47.150
And it's like the whole point.

02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:48.670
And there's like three
or four clocks around,

02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:51.810
so there's this sort of constant
countdown happening in your mind

02:27:51.810 --> 02:27:54.810
which was a little bothersome.

02:27:54.810 --> 02:27:58.280
But then they played
nine innings

02:27:58.280 --> 02:27:59.580
for like seven runs in the game.

02:27:59.580 --> 02:28:02.240
That bad boy was over in like
two hours and 15 minutes.

02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:04.860
I was like, whoa, okay.

02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:06.740
Like maybe I can kind
of deal with this.

02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:09.230
And so I'm not really sure

02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:12.150
because on the surface
it's annoying,

02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:13.990
but it worked, you know?

02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:15.290
It kept it moving.

02:28:15.290 --> 02:28:18.980
And if that's what your goal
is for baseball, then, sure.

02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:24.130
But my position on this has
always been that it's the nature

02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:28.340
of the game, batted balls and so
forth, that what happens on --

02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:30.280
during the course of the
game is what changes people's

02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:32.320
excitement, not just
the length of time.

02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:35.810
Inserting seven dudes between
the sixth and the ninth

02:28:35.810 --> 02:28:37.940
for [inaudible] is annoying,
you know what I mean.

02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:40.140
Like that's, that is
far more aggravating

02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:41.810
than just the amount
of time it takes.

02:28:41.810 --> 02:28:44.180
Instead you're constantly
stopping and starting,

02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:45.520
and what you're getting
isn't action.

02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:47.820
It's not, in fact,
that exciting.

02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:49.860
That to me is a larger issue
than people don't actually

02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:52.700
like what's happening, not
necessarily how long it's taking

02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:55.400
in any amount of time.

02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:56.700
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Have we --

02:28:56.700 --> 02:28:58.000
have time I think for
-- oh, sorry, Jordan.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.300
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: No,
that's okay [inaudible].

02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:00.600
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: One
more question if it's quick,

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:02.680
and maybe another
one after that.

02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:05.790
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'll try
to make this quick.

02:29:05.790 --> 02:29:09.660
Do you think that the owners'
preoccupation with making money

02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:13.420
in the Major Leagues especially
has limited the availability

02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:17.020
for families, and obviously
it has, to go to the game?

02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:18.690
But the importance
of going to the game,

02:29:18.690 --> 02:29:22.230
having the same experience as
somebody like me that grew up

02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:25.280
and is 50 years old now,
would go to the game and end

02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:27.610
up behind Home Plate even
though I bought a ticket

02:29:27.610 --> 02:29:28.910
out in the outfield.

02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:31.090
And now if you try to go to
it and do that now and have

02:29:31.090 --> 02:29:33.910
that same experience of actually
hearing the communication

02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:36.460
between the dugouts and
the umpires and the batters

02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:39.100
and stuff is just -- you
don't have the same experience

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:40.400
when you go to the
game and you go

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.020
with family of four to a game.

02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:45.200
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg: I'll say
there's one thing I think modern

02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:47.960
baseball is doing right, and I'm
interested to hear your takes,

02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:51.170
too, is that I think the modern
baseball stadium, the cheap,

02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:52.570
faraway seats are really good.

02:29:52.570 --> 02:29:54.370
And that was not true when I
used to go to Memorial Stadium

02:29:54.370 --> 02:29:55.670
as a kid in Baltimore.

02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:58.050
I got to Miller Park now and
I go to Camden Yards now.

02:29:58.050 --> 02:30:00.490
I buy an -- I mean, I like to
buy an expensive seat sometimes,

02:30:00.490 --> 02:30:01.790
show off my kids, whatever.

02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:04.980
But like I -- if I sit in
the bleachers it's still --

02:30:04.980 --> 02:30:07.430
you really feel in the game, and
think it was way that was not

02:30:07.430 --> 02:30:08.730
as true in the older stadiums.

02:30:08.730 --> 02:30:10.500
So in that one respect I
actually think they're doing

02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:12.440
more to equalize the
experience [inaudible] more,

02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:13.740
and people [inaudible] less.

02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:15.040
&gt;&gt; Clinton Yates: That's
an excellent point.

02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:16.340
I hadn't ever really
though of it that way,

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:18.270
which is that the
stratification between the best

02:30:18.270 --> 02:30:20.560
and the worse is not
necessarily that different.

02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:21.860
You know what I mean?

02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:23.160
I hate sitting behind the plate.

02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:24.680
For me it's a bad
view, and I'm not --

02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:25.980
you know, you're
looking through a net.

02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:27.930
Like I don't actually
like that seat.

02:30:27.930 --> 02:30:30.390
But I do think there's
something to be said

02:30:30.390 --> 02:30:33.410
about the family experience.

02:30:33.410 --> 02:30:34.810
But, I mean, when I
go to baseball games,

02:30:34.810 --> 02:30:36.760
like I really kind
of only see families.

02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:38.060
Like I don't -- you know,

02:30:38.060 --> 02:30:41.300
I'm not really sure what the
other side of that complaint is

02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:43.510
because while, yes, it
is extremely expensive

02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:46.630
in the basic context of the
value of a dollar, like I don't

02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:50.970
like -- I don't know who
else is going to ballgames.

02:30:50.970 --> 02:30:52.270
You know what I'm saying?

02:30:52.270 --> 02:30:53.570
It's not like people are
just walking off the street

02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:55.860
that much necessarily
outside of, you know,

02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:57.860
random businessmen specials or
whatever, which, by the way,

02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:59.160
I still never understand.

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:00.460
Like businessmen's specials.

02:31:00.460 --> 02:31:02.140
Like what -- why is it called
that, you know what I mean?

02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:03.440
Is it dudes leaving their aunt?

02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:04.740
Like what is this, you know?

02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:06.460
That's such an --
[inaudible] integrated terms.

02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:07.760
That is an integrated one.

02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:09.060
But I guess what I'm saying --

02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:10.530
that there is still a lot of
families going to ballparks and,

02:31:10.530 --> 02:31:15.060
you know, without delving
into the intense economics

02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:19.250
of why it costs so much
to go to games, you know,

02:31:19.250 --> 02:31:20.570
it's still a fun experience.

02:31:20.570 --> 02:31:23.000
And that to me is
hard to evaluate.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.830
Like if you don't like
it, you don't like it.

02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:26.130
But if you go there,

02:31:26.130 --> 02:31:27.800
you're probably going
to have a good time.

02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:30.100
And that to me is, I guess,

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:32.570
effectively the most
important thing overall.

02:31:32.570 --> 02:31:34.210
No? I mean is that --
does that make sense?

02:31:34.210 --> 02:31:36.620
&gt;&gt; Rob Ruck: I would
just add that I think

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:38.630
that the smart franchises

02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:41.920
in the smart sports
are cultivating kids,

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:43.800
and building them as fans.

02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:46.770
And I've seen the Penguins
do that in Pittsburgh

02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:49.730
by making a large block
of tickets available

02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:53.180
at moderate prices
to college students

02:31:53.180 --> 02:31:55.580
and the success of
the team itself.

02:31:55.580 --> 02:31:57.590
But you know I think,
for example,

02:31:57.590 --> 02:32:00.480
in the Dominican Republic, where
you go to some [foreign words]

02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:04.590
and before a game you
see 30 or 40 kids seated

02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:08.430
on the outfield walls
with poles with nets

02:32:08.430 --> 02:32:11.410
at the end to try to snag balls.

02:32:11.410 --> 02:32:18.110
And they become lifelong
fans in the process.

02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:19.410
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: Great.

02:32:19.410 --> 02:32:20.710
I think we will wrap up here.

02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:22.570
I want to thank everyone for
joining us in person and also

02:32:22.570 --> 02:32:24.330
on the livestream, and
especially thank Jordan,

02:32:24.330 --> 02:32:26.980
Clinton, and Rob for spending
the afternoon with us.

02:32:26.980 --> 02:32:30.420
If you are watching, we will
be archiving the livestream

02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:31.930
and make that available to you.

02:32:31.930 --> 02:32:33.790
We encourage you to
visit the [inaudible].

02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:35.090
What's that?

02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:36.390
&gt;&gt; Jordan Ellenberg:
The [inaudible].

02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:37.690
&gt;&gt; Meghan Ferriter: The
[inaudible] on YouTube.

02:32:37.690 --> 02:32:38.990
We also encourage you
to visit the exhibit

02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:40.290
if you haven't seen it yet.

02:32:40.290 --> 02:32:42.810

&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter:
Well, thank you so much.

02:32:53.380 --> 02:32:54.680
That was such a great
conversation.

02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:57.460
I wish it could be hours
longer, but [inaudible].

02:32:57.460 --> 02:32:58.760
I don't know.

02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:00.060
It would be [inaudible].

02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:01.970
The Tigers.

02:33:01.970 --> 02:33:04.470
Transition year.

02:33:04.470 --> 02:33:05.930
It's fine [laughter].

&gt;&gt; And decade.

02:33:07.350 --> 02:33:10.270
&gt;&gt; Abigail Potter: But this is
just a very short wrap-up just

02:33:10.270 --> 02:33:13.150
to thank everybody that
came, thank everybody

02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:15.500
from the JSTOR Team
who's still around,

02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:21.730
who really made this week
very -- just packed with --

02:33:21.730 --> 02:33:24.090
I want to use baseball idioms,
and I just can't think of them.

02:33:24.090 --> 02:33:26.330
But it was a really,
really wonderful week,

02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:29.930
and I think this conversation
just put a big exclamation point

02:33:29.930 --> 02:33:32.480
on it, and I just
want to thank everyone

02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:34.200
for coming and tuning in.

02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:35.670
And thank you, Megan,
for moderating

02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:37.510

02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:45.400
And go see a baseball game.

02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:46.940
