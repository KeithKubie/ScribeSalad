00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:04.171
- [Instructor] How many faces
does the following shape have?

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:07.248
Pause this video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:08.601
All right, I'm assuming you paused,

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.405
and I'll see if we can
work through it together.

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:13.779
And I'm gonna actually
try to color the faces.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.029
So, we have this face over,

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.568
whoops, let me do it
in my, this other tool,

00:00:20.568 --> 00:00:24.767
so we have this face
over here in the back.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:27.059
So that's one face.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.608
So that's one.

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:29.691
Then you have

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.697
this face right over here,

00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:34.810
also in the back.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.415
The only way we can see this is

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:39.437
because they've drawn it
so that it is transparent.

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:42.422
So that is the second face.

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:45.110
Now you have this triangular face on top.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.487
So let me color that in.

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:48.404
So you have

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:51.756
this triangular face

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:53.124
on top.

00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:56.894
So that's going to be our third face,

00:00:56.894 --> 00:00:58.201
third face.

00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:00.710
And then you have this
triangular face on the bottom.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.659
That's gonna be our fourth face.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.577
That's going to be our fourth face.

00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:07.979
And then the key question is are we done?

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.359
Looks like I've colored all
the ones that I can see,

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.026
but there's one a little bit tricky here.

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:15.799
There's the one that we are
actually seeing through.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.952
There is the face,

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:20.316
there's, let me pick a color,

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:24.402
there's the face out front
that we can see through

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.734
so that we can see faces
one, two, and four.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:30.173
So that's actually going
to be our fifth face.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.187
The way they've drawn it, it's
like it's made out of glass,

00:01:32.187 --> 00:01:34.427
so we can see faces one, two, and four.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.585
But that is our fifth face.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.335
And so this thing has five faces.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.974
All right, let's do another example,

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:43.807
but instead of faces,

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:48.194
we're gonna think about edges.

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:51.912
So how many edges does
the following shape have?

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:56.317
Pause the video, and see if
you can work through this.

00:01:56.317 --> 00:01:58.259
Okay, let's work through
this together now.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.589
And I'm just gonna count these edges.

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:03.547
So the edges are where two faces meet.

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:07.377
So this is an edge right over there.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.014
So that's one edge.

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:11.120
There's an edge back here,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.785
we can see 'cause it's transparent.

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:14.785
That is our second edge.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.073
We have this one over here.

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:18.990
That is our third edge.

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:22.687
We have this one over there.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.005
That is our fourth edge.

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.557
Then we have this one over here.

00:02:28.557 --> 00:02:31.112
That is our fifth edge.

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:32.945
Now we have this here.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.645
This is our sixth edge.

00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:39.492
Let's see, all we have left is this one,

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.692
which is edge number seven.

00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:43.612
And then last but not least,

00:02:43.612 --> 00:02:46.095
this edge of here, which
is edge number eight.

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:48.472
And I actually found this
very valuable to color 'em in

00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:50.262
to make sure that I wasn't missing an edge

00:02:50.262 --> 00:02:51.458
or double-counting an edge.

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:53.975
So this thing has eight,

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:54.975
eight edges.

00:02:56.637 --> 00:02:58.736
Actually, if you're curious,
just for extra practice,

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:00.586
how many faces does this have?

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:03.016
Well, we can count those as well.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.628
This has

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:06.575
one face back there,

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:07.950
another face back there.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.805
So that's two faces.

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:12.829
And then you have a third
face, which is the base,

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.080
this rectangular face.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.923
So that's three faces.

00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:19.702
And then you have your
two faces out front.

00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:20.535
You have

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:24.841
this face that we're seeing through,

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.620
and then we have that face
that we're seeing through.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.992
So even though they're asking
edges, just for practice,

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:32.812
we figured out that this
thing has five faces,

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.274
one for the square base

00:03:35.274 --> 00:03:39.107
and then four triangular
faces for these sides

00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:42.094
to make this square pyramid.

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:45.177
So it has eight edges and five faces.
