00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
 Unknown unknowns. 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.440
 Well, unknown unknowns come to you from places you don't expect. 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.720
 Because other you had prepared for that damn thing. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.600
 So, these are the things that always open their mouths when you don't expect it. 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.480
 They are just like, say, snakes in the garden of Eden, that might be a way to think about it. 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.220
 You can't keep the damned snakes out of the garden. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.940
 And that's because you can't make limits to keep complexity out of it. 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.260
 The complexity always returns secretly. Try to defend your children from the internet, 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.040
 For instance. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.300
 You cannot make limits to keep the complexity out of it, it always comes back secretly. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.020
 So what would an unknown unfamiliarity be? That's a good one. Here, 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.540
 You have an intimate relationship. You have this for 10 years. You trust your partner. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.040
 So what does that mean? 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.840
 You know where you are. You know who you are. And you also have a reasonable idea of ​​where you are going. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.040
 And then one day you find out that your partner cheated, not with one person but with three. 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.700
 During the entire 10 years! 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:10.080
 Well, hypothetically, that comes as a shock. But you may have missed many indications that indicated this. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.720
 Non relevant! 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.600
 Let's say it comes as a shock, what happens to you? 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 You don't know where you are. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140
 You do not know where you have been! That is interesting! 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.980
 Because you think you know where you are because you have already been there. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.760
 But suddenly something happens and you are so upset that you don't even know where you were. 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 So in a way that means that the past depends on the now. A very strange thing. 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 You also have no idea where you are going. 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 Regarding 'not knowing where you are going', that is very deep. 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.020
 You may think "I thought I was in a marriage", that's wrong, 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.820
 "I thought I knew who my wife / husband was", that's wrong too. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 "Because I thought I knew my wife, I thought I knew women in general", that's wrong. 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.100
 "I thought I was in a relationship with someone I could trust," that's wrong. 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 "I don't know enough about trust, I'm clearly too gullible." 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.120
 And because that all happens, I doubt everything that ever happened to me, yes? 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.800
 That is the emergence of chaos! 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.380
 And that is.. 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:29.280
 This! Sometimes you go from point A to point B and something you don't expect will manifest itself in the middle of your plan. 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.015
 But it's not such a disaster, because you can just ignore it. 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.240
 And sometimes something appears and oh, then you just don't have a plan anymore. 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 And then you ask yourself, where exactly are you when you don't know where you are? 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.240
 I'd say that's a place! And it is actually a place that is very well documented in classical and religious mythological stories. 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.660
 That is chaos. 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.600
 For example, the Daoists believe that the world is made of chaos and order. 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.160
 Order, that's where you are when what you do gives you back what you want. 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.480
 Chaos. 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.535
 That is where you are when you have no idea what is happening. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.020
 And then you can ask, is there a way you should behave when you are in chaos? 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.560
 The answer to that is: there is a way better. 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.020
 Because it is a place that you will visit several times in your life. And everyone visits this place. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.620
 That is why it is an archetypal story, it is the descent to the underworld. 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.860
 The underworld is that terrible place that lies under all our assumptions. 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.200
 It is .. Cold lake that lurks under the thin ice that everyone skates on. 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.660
 And it is something that can manifest itself at any time. 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.320
 That is probably why, in the Daoist symbol, the black paisley is chaos and the white is order, 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.160
 In the Order paisley is a little black dot, that is because order can turn into chaos, what it does at any time. 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.700
 And the reverse is also true. Chaos can change in order at any time. 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.340
 And insight will do that for you. And alcoholics say that when they reach their low point, 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.180
 then it is so * click * there is a catalysis and they look at the world in a different way. 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.360
 Now they are a new person, they are back from the underworld, returned from death, so to speak. 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.780
 And this is partly because your right hemisphere seems to be good at this, 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.360
 derive patterns in chaotic places. It keeps track of what abnormal things are happening. 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.400
 And it makes alternative maps of the world that are there for you to use. 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.080
 At least to a certain point, if ever necessary.
