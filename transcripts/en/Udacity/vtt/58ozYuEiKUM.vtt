00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.732
&gt;&gt; Just like we computed the xy position of the tile index for our atlas, we can

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:07.572
use the same math magic to determine what position in the worldX and worldY we

00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:11.607
need to draw this tile. We change the numbers, right? Given the tile index, we

00:00:11.607 --> 00:00:15.327
modulate it by the number of x tiles, and divide it by the number of x tiles

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:19.434
times by the tile size, to give us our pixel offsets in the world. From there,

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:23.850
we go back to our accelerated draw image API, that passes the image, x, y in the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.181
source, tile size and tile x in the source. And then, where we would like to

00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:32.436
draw it in the world X and Y? Notice that the tile size for the source and the

00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:37.071
destination are identical here. This means we'd actually like to draw a 64 pixel

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.487
by 64 pixel atlas image, to represent a 64 pixel by 64 pixel image inside of our

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:41.985
world.
