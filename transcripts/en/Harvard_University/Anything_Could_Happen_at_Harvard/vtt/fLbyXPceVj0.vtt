00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:05.767
The first line of my application here...

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:09.367
said, “For as long as I can remember,
I’ve wanted to be an actor.”

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.467
It was asking kind of who you were,
and that was really who I was...

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.200
and I wanted them to know who I was...

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:16.400
and, whether they accepted me or not...

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.733
I wanted them to know
who they were gonna let in or not.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.000
Having grown up here, I think I had one way
of looking at Harvard–

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:25.300
kind of a townie view of the school.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.000
Suddenly walking through
as a prospective student...

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:30.833
I just started to really take in
how impressive it was.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.667
I assumed if I could get
into an Ivy League school–

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.100
That kind of touched every base for me.

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:40.667
And then I got into Harvard,
and it’s a very tough place to turn down.

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:44.667
This great teacher named Anthony Kubiak–
I took a number of his classes.

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.200
This was the final one that I took.
It was the playwriting class.

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.933
I handed in the first act
of a three-act movie–

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
what eventually became
Good Will Hunting.

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:55.067
I apologized to him when I handed him
this 40-some-odd page document.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.733
I just said,
“I don’t think I did what you wanted.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.367
I was supposed to write a one-act play...

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:02.967
and this is clearly the first act
of a three-act movie.”

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.100
He was unbelievably encouraging.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:08.333
He gave me a flat “A” in the class,
which was a big deal.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.733
He wrote extensively in the margins–

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.533
or on a cover page that he put on it–

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.433
to “please keep up with this”–

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.167
that it was worthy,
that it was good...

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:23.667
that it wasn’t anything
close to a failure...

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.267
that it was something I had to pursue.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.033
So I showed it to Ben Affleck,
and the rest is history.
