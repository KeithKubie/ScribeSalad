00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.460
In the modern world, many countries have lotteries.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.360
And every week, many millions of people participate.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.040
In the hope of suddenly acquiring a substantial fortune.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.820
A striking thing is that it’s often quite disadvantaged and uneducated people,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.400
Who are most enthusiastic about lotteries.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.940
We might smile at their folly in getting statistics quite so wrong.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.660
– if they had the wisdom and mathematical intelligence to understand

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.920
How slim their chances really were,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.860
They’d surely never bother.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.480
The chances of winning the largest payout is 1 in 14 million

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.420
(nearly the same probability as being one of the Queen’s children,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.380
currently a 1 in 15 million chance).

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.740
We naturally feel a bit sorry for people investing in such slender hopes.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.660
They are taking aim at an impossibly small target.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.180
But we’re no better.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200
We may not have a sense that we’re playing any kind of lottery.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.080
– and yet we are: the Lottery of Life.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.320
We too are clutching tickets of various kinds

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.840
and setting our sights on statistical near-miracles.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.380
– even while we think we’re being utterly sober, rational and level headed.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.900
The crucial place where this lottery-like behaviour happens

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.100
is in relation to our hopes of happiness in two areas in particular: love and work.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.240
If we were forced to spell out a picture of an ideally successful life,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.180
it might go something like this.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.340
Early on we pick just the right area of work to apply ourselves to,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.300
swerve neatly into new fields at the ideal moment and get public recognition,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.720
money and honour for our efforts.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.440
Work is fun, creative and utterly in line with our talents.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.880
There are similar satisfactions to be had around love.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.800
After a spate of compelling and passionate relationships,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.760
We meet one very special beautiful, kind and devoted person.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.380
Who understands us completely – often without us needing to communicate with words.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.120
Sex is extraordinary and children and domesticity never grind us down.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.300
We enjoy perfect health and retire with the feeling of having accomplished what we set out to do,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.260
and enjoy a dignified, respected old age,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.640
admired by our descendants and occasionally exercising a deft guiding touch behind the scenes as an eminence grise.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.560
We die gently in our late nineties of a non-painful illness

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.460
in a tranquil, flower filled room, having written a wise and generous will.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.180
Such scenarios occur about as often as a payout at the Lottery.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.860
But (to our surprise, despite our education and apparently realistic and practical natures),

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.720
We may have strongly invested in some modified version of just this form of ideal life.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.520
We don’t quite grasp just how rare and strange ninety years on earth are

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.800
without major disasters in love and work.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.060
Our brains – the faulty walnuts through which we assess reality –

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.380
have a  habit of fatefully misunderstanding statistics.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.020
We imagine some things are much more common than they really are.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.740
We might suppose that half of new businesses are a great success.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.000
In fact, it is less than two per cent.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.320
We readily suppose that a lot of people have flat stomachs.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.860
– though in Australia, for instance, only 4% of adults over 45 have a slender physique.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.300
In the UK about half the population feels worried about money on any particular day;

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.000
half of marriages collapse and sixty percent of the population feel that no one really loves them.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.620
But we rarely keep these kinds of facts in mind when we plot our own trajectories.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.820
Part of the reason lies with what we read and see.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.300
Without anything necessarily sinister lying behind this,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.740
The media continually bring anomalies to our notice,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.560
and so we end up feeling we’re inhabiting a very different kind of world

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.500
to the one we actually live in.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.440
Our imagined society is likely to contain

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.000
many more murders, rabid dogs, man-eating sharks, and beautiful happy people

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.060
than the real world does.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.860
Our mental map of how much contentment is possible defies all the known facts.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.380
If we could really see what love and work were like for most other people,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.260
we’d be so much less sad about our own situation and attainments.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.940
If we could fly across the world and peer into everyone’s lives and minds like an all-seeing angel,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.740
we’d perceive how very frequent disappointment is, how much unfulfilled ambition is circulating,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.440
How much confusion and uncertainty is being played out in private

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.240
and how many breakdowns and intemperate arguments unfold with every new day.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:46.340
And then we’d realise just how – statistically speaking – abnormal and therefore cruel the goals we have set ourselves really are.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.300
It would be a painful lesson in some ways. We might be shocked and saddened by what we saw.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.940
We’d be disappointed, of course, to conclude that in all probability, we wouldn’t achieve what we’d hoped for.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.300
But in another way it would be a comforting and deeply reassuring experience.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.120
We’d feel a little more tenderness towards ourselves for not having – in effect – won the Lottery of Life.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.340
Without being overtly naive, most of us are holding out hopes

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.620
equivalent to thinking we might win EuroMillions or the PowerBall jackpot.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.780
We don’t deserve criticism. We need to pity ourselves for the formidable obstacles

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.480
that sit in the way of the kind of success that it is so normal to want

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.220
– and yet so rare to have.
