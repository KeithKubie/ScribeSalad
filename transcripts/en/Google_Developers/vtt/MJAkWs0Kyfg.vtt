&gt;&gt; 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.010
SWANSON: Hi, I'm here with Google I/O Sometrics.
Could you please tell me a little bit about

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.010
yourself and what you do?
&gt;&gt; SWANSON: Yeah, no problem. I'm Ian Swanson,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm one of co-founders and CEO of Sometrics.
Sometrics--we built products which helps,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.720
you know, social application publishers, monetizers
and understand their audience.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.630
&gt;&gt; Great, so what did you (INDISTINCT)? Do
you Google pick us?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we--we definitely utilize OpenSocial
as we work with many publishers that are on

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.440
MySpace or High Five, in Orkett (ph). We work
with 2,200 application development companies

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.690
and so we definitely utilize OpenSocial.
&gt;&gt; SWANSON: Who was the reason behind the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.339
utilizing OpenSocial?
&gt;&gt; Well, it was nice to have a standard. I

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.840
mean, we’re making--we have an analytics
product, an ad manager product, as well a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.839
virtual currency economy solution. And to
build those for each one of the different

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.159
social APIs that are out there is very difficult.
So it’s good to--to build it off of OpenSocial

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.800
and build to make it so they can scale across
multiple platforms.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.520
&gt;&gt; SWANSON: Do you have any tips and tricks
about the developers who are (INDISTINCT)

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.690
OpenSocial.
&gt;&gt; So Sometrics has been around for the past

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.360
three years and as soon as OpenSocial came
out, we quickly adopted it. And I think what

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.350
key is just staying up on all the latest news
and tips, to utilize the Google Blogs that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.752
are out there, and I think that’s something
that a lot of developers really don’t utilize

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:28.299
as a resource. And so, we just try to keep
updated on all the latest news.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.500
&gt;&gt; SWANSON: Are there any products that you
offer (INDISTINCT)?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.940
&gt;&gt; Yes, we have three. We have an Analytics
Suite, we have an Ad Server, as well as Virtual

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.420
Economy Platform. All three of the products,
they help the developer understand who there

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.000
audience is that uses their game, whether
it’s like a MySpace poker game, as well

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.130
as how they serve ads and how to make money
from those users. So our products have big-end

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.229
social targeting, and then it’s very easy
plug-and-play using OpenSocial.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.309
&gt;&gt; SWANSON: So how will developers make money
using your products?

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:05.250
&gt;&gt; Yup. So from Ad serving level, let’s
say an advertiser like Nike or AT&amp;T contacts

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.870
application developer and let’s say we want
to reach males 18 to 25, they build to use

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.020
Sometrics as an ad server, build and target
those males and very easily deliver that ad

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.830
campaign. And from a virtual currency some
point, we have solution where some of them

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.920
signs up for netflix and they can then earn
points or poker chips, in this example, to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.860
keep playing their MySpace poker game.
&gt;&gt; SWANSON: Got it. Is there anything else

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.239
you’d like to add?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it’s really important that

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.239
Google has been making the standards in OpenSocial
particularly where it’s very easy for developers

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.599
to, you know, make a product, make a scale
across multiple platforms. And there’s a

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.069
lot of companies like Sometrics out there
that have a tool set that layer on top from

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.739
a utility perspective. And I think it’s
crucial for any publisher to really understand

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.459
who that audience is and how do we make a--how
do we make a dollar at the end of the day,

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.712
and that’s where Sometrics comes in.
&gt;&gt; SWANSON: Thank you for your time.

00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:56.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you, I appreciate it.
