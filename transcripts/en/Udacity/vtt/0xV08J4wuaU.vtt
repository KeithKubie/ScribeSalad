00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.740
So we can go pretty far back in time

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.620
with the maternal and paternal lines. But we can go

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.970
even further back with the cool feature that allows

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.460
us to look at how much natal ancestry we have.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.420
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I, are you saying that

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.080
humans and Neanderthals were interbreeding at some point?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.580
&gt;&gt; Well, DNA from Neanderthal fossils is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.970
indicating just that. It seems like it did

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.500
happen. And so, why don't we go and take a look. And see how much Neanderthal

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.680
ancestry you have, Matt?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.054
&gt;&gt; Let's do it. So, here we are looking at the, y chromosome

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:31.548
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:31.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.310
&gt;&gt; How do I get to my Neanderthal results?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.702
&gt;&gt; So, go up to my results. And then, it should have a

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:36.793
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:37.793
&gt;&gt;

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:36.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.050
Neanderthal ancestry.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.395
&gt;&gt; That's it, yeah. And, hey.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:45.645
&gt;&gt; Oh wow. So it says an estimated 2.7%of my DNA is.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.781
&gt;&gt; Right. From Neanderthals.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:53.310
&gt;&gt; That's right. Which is pretty cool. and we do, do that by comparing

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.890
your DNA to what's known for Neanderthals.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.930
What the DNA that's been obtained from neanderthal

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.537
fossils and

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:07.550
&gt;&gt; So that means if you have DNA from Neanderthals that means you've

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.330
only been able to get that DNA 'because Neanderthals aren't alive any more.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.760
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.750
&gt;&gt; So the only way to get that is from fossils, then.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.770
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. And, so, and, it's, it's been exciting

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.480
to get more and more DNA out of these

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.670
Neanderthal fossils. At first, it was only possible to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.080
get mitochondrial DNA. and the mitochondrial DNA didn't know

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.460
that living humans have any sharing of mitochondrial DNA with

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.845
Neanderthals. So everyone was kind of concluding that there was no

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.320
inter-breeding. But now when we look at the rest of the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.760
chromosomes, one to 22 we, start seeing evidence of the inter-breeding.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.916
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's really cool. And, it looks down here that

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:48.070
I can actually see where all of my friends and family.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.715
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:49.812
&gt;&gt; With Neanderthal ancestry.

00:01:49.812 --> 00:01:50.437
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:51.530
&gt;&gt; I'm the average, but it looks.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.188
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:53.233
&gt;&gt; like you can be higher, like

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:53.652
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:54.664
&gt;&gt; 3.1%.

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and your dad has a little more than you.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see, yeah, my dad's like at 3%.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, these are

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.670
you know, just rough approximations, 'because it's hard

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.259
to get an exact estimate. Oh, but let

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.110
me tell you one important thing. As soon as I saw that most of your DNA trace

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.090
to Europe, I could have guessed roughly your

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.570
Neanderthals ancestors because Europeans typically have between 2 and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.770
4% of their ancestors traced to Neanderthals. whereas

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.450
people who, most of their ancestry traces to Africa

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.988
have far less. Because Neanderthals were not

00:02:31.988 --> 00:02:36.680
inter-breeding with, with our ancestors in, in Africa.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.959
&gt;&gt; Well, and we can even see that, here I am at 2.7%.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.230
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.442
&gt;&gt; And Roy King. And his father who have African history

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:46.485
[CROSSTALK]

00:02:46.485 --> 00:02:47.755
&gt;&gt; Yes, 1.2% and 1.5%.

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:48.215
&gt;&gt; 1.5%.

00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:52.770
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, so that makes a lot of sense on knowing what

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.310
we do about the timing and the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.650
location of where this inter-breeding takes place.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.050
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.290
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Great.
