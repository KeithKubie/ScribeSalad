I can tell you that as an undergraduate, I

of Princeton women.

play in this University for the rest of time.

Diversity is an educational value at this University.

Sonia Sotomayor:
Walking in through those front gates and looking
at Nassau Hall is bewitching and magical...

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.630 position:75%
Sonia Sotomayor:
but in many ways it turned out to be the exactly
perfect place for me. And because I needed

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.250 position:73%
Sonia Sotomayor:
to learn so much when I was here, and the
small personal environment that this University

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.000 position:67%
Sonia Sotomayor:
then, and I believe even today, gave, I was
able to find professors who helped me grow.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.779 position:70%
Sonia Sotomayor:
And that is what catapulted me into the rest
of my life. Justice Stevens said it the best,

Sonia Sotomayor:
which is, in the job you should be growing, always.

Wendy Kopp:
And I have to also thank Princeton for the
opportunities it afforded me. Taking me from a

bubble in Dallas, Texas, and exposing me
to the intellectual rigors of Princeton and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.430 position:67%
Wendy Kopp:
to a place where working hard was normal.
It took me a year to get over being part of

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.790 position:73%
Wendy Kopp:
a student body and I don't know how many people
out there this resonates with, where being

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.400 position:69%
Wendy Kopp:
motivated and driven was actually cool and
normal. To having the Woodrow Wilson School,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.500 position:67%
Wendy Kopp:
a place where I could pursue my passion of
solving real-world problems and, of course,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.150

for the thesis requirement.

Lisa Jackson:
We do have things in common. We need to find
them and outline where they are. And the aspiration to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.720 position:70%
Lisa Jackson:
test the limits, to go beyond where people
think we can be, is probably one of the first

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.300 position:86%
Lisa Jackson:
things we all have in common. That's something
that brought us here to this extraordinary institution.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.540 position:56%
Lisa Jackson:
It's up to us to pass it on. Nothing
will inspire the next generation of

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.400 position:77%
Lisa Jackson:
women leaders like the example of this generation
and we set that example.

Andrea Jung:
Leadership, women and Princeton have all really
collided into what I think is an amazing inflection

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:46.000 position:72%
Andrea Jung:
point. Compassion is an equal, extraordinarily
important facet of great leadership and I

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.180 position:78%
Andrea Jung:
believe in that hallmark very much. You can't
reinvent your company until you reinvent yourself.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.380 position:72%
Andrea Jung:
So, it was a great piece of advice and I share
it with you because I think, for all of us --

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.570 position:66%
Andrea Jung:
women, men alike -- I think this concept
of continual reinvention is what allows me

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.320 position:70%
Andrea Jung:
to be able to be in a job for a decade, which
allows a company to be here for 125 years,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.820 position:73%
Andrea Jung:
which allows enormously successful institutions
like this to be here 250 years and plus. So,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.730 position:67%
Andrea Jung:
the thought is at every aspect of life, but
it does start from an individual basis,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:26.350 position:73%
Andrea Jung:
in terms of just that very, very liberating but
very, very disciplined constant transformation

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.300
Andrea Jung:
and reinvention of yourself.
