[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:06.830
JORGE CUETO: Thank
you, everyone,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.650
for coming to our Talks
at Google event today

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.000
with Tina Sharkey.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.320
It's great to have you, Tina.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.430
TINA SHARKEY: So
psyched to be here.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.763
And we brought Brandless snacks.

00:00:14.763 --> 00:00:16.594
So if you're on the
live stream, we'll

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:18.260
figure out how to get
them to you later.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.840
But anyone in the room,
feel free to get up, get

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.130
some snacks.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.149
I won't feel insulted.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:24.440
I'll be really happy, actually.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.150
So.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.860
JORGE CUETO: Tina is
the co-founder and CEO

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.680
of Brandless, which is an
e-commerce startup that's

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.720
looking to shake things
up in the industry

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.540
by offering high quality
products at a really

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.040
affordable price point.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.260
Great to have you, again.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.575
TINA SHARKEY: It's
awesome to be here.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:42.950
JORGE CUETO: Can you tell us
a little bit about Brandless

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.600
in your own words.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.400
TINA SHARKEY: So Brandless--

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.190
my co-founder, Ido
Leffler, and I,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.280
we were sort of feeling
like modern consumption

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.980
was just very, very broken.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.100
And that meant that
if people really

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.330
understood what things cost
versus what they pay for them,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.974
they'd be, in his words,
rioting in the streets.

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:06.640
I don't know that I
thought people would

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.723
be rioting in the streets.

00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:09.650
But that there was
just this perception

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.230
that better had to cost more.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.490
And it actually really doesn't.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.980
And so when we
founded Brandless,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.060
we were really trying to--
at this very high level--

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.800
try and make sense
of consumption.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.070
There was a sense that there
were the haves and the have

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.030
nots.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.940
And that people
couldn't actually

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.150
find what they were looking for,
shop the values they believed

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.360
in, whether it was their dietary
values, like, I'm gluten free.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.530
Or I'm kosher.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.000
Or I'm vegan.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.770
Or I like to eat organic.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.720
Or with their belief systems.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.190
I don't want animal testing.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.110
I want non-GMO.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.510
I want certain
foods, certain things

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.150
that I reach for every
day to sort of live up

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.560
to my value system.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.650
If, in fact, they were to use
that as their shopping filter,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.560
they would definitely be paying
a premium for everything.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.860
Because their value system
actually comes at a premium.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.360
But it doesn't have to.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.790
And so at Brandless,
at the highest level

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.160
we're trying to democratize
access to goodness,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.680
starting with everyday
essentials, which is--

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.830
everything on Brandless is $3.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.390
Sometimes it's two for
$3 or three for $3.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.820
And all of our food is non-GMO.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.470
Most of it is organic.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.390
Tons of it is gluten free.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.120
And all of our beauty
and our personal care,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.180
our shaving gel, our
shampoo, our conditioner,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.750
our hand creams, et cetera,
are all completely clean.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.510
Which means in the case of
beauty and personal care,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.210
it's free of animal testing.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.250
It's free of SLSs, of
phosphates, of sulfates,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.440
of synthetic dyes, et cetera.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.340
And every single category
that we develop at Brandless,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.790
we use that filter to
say, what really matters

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.810
in that particular category?

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.220
So for example, when we
do cleaning, our cleaning

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.050
products like our
multi-surface cleaner,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.190
our toilet bowl cleaner, they
are EPA Safer Choice certified.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.300
And everything that
we do is just $3.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.740
Or two for $3 or three for $3.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.780
But everything is
very much created

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.060
for what we consider
the modern lifestyle.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.560
JORGE CUETO: How
do you set yourself

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.690
apart from other
e-commerce startups

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.120
have been coming up
over the last few years?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.130
For example, the Honest
Company, which I think

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.130
is doing similar non-GMO
healthy products?

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.980
TINA SHARKEY: So as a startup,
first and foremost, we're

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.219
a community.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.010
And we're a community
of people who believe

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.200
that everyone deserves better.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.870
I can't really say what Honest
is doing, because I don't

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.150
know a ton about that company.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.250
Other than to say that the
pricing structure at Brandless,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.610
everything that we
sell is brand tax free.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.060
So what we mean by that
is we've eliminated

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.490
all the inefficiencies
in the system

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.220
for what things cost
to produce versus what

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.630
you're paying for them.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.600
And so I don't know
how Honest does that.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.750
By being a community that
goes directly to the consumers

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.990
and makes things for the
people that we serve,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.729
we are developing the products.

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.770
We're putting them into
our distribution centers.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.840
And we're sending
them directly to you.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.380
And so if you were to look
at national brands that

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.870
have the same quality
as ours, organic coconut

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.300
oils, organic olive oils,
organic feminine hygiene, all

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.840
the non-GMO food,
on average you're

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.440
saving 40% of brand tax
savings of national brands

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.661
of similar quality.

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.410
When it comes to things
like clean beauty,

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.360
clean personal care,
and clean hygiene,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.060
it's as high as 300%
to 400% savings.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.620
So I can tell you what Honest's
system is and how they do that.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.020
But ours is really
about a community

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.400
that is connected around
a higher purpose, which

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.460
is that the doing is
what matters in life.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.040
When you check out
at Brandless, there's

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.690
something extra in
your shopping cart.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.360
And that's a meal that we
partner with Feeding America

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.690
to buy on your behalf
and in your honor

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.880
to feed those who don't have $3.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.310
If you're a member of B.More,
which is our membership--

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.976
and I'll talk about
that a little later.

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.750
Because there's a surprise
coming for all of you.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.550
We'll donate 10
meals in your honor.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.990
And every time you
shop, we donate

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.730
two meals if you're a member.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.300
In the first 18 weeks
of being in service

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.240
we've already donated
over 150,000 meals

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.630
to Feeding America, both to be
deployed to the disaster relief

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.230
zones in California, and Texas,
and Florida, and Puerto Rico,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.790
where we don't
ship, but we still

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.890
are trying to do what we can.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.830
As well as to the people
facing hunger in this country

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.742
in everyday systems
all over the nation.

00:05:39.742 --> 00:05:41.450
JORGE CUETO: You
mentioned the brand tax.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.580
Well, maybe a few of us here
aren't familiar with that term.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.440
Can you tell us a
little bit about that.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.580
TINA SHARKEY: Yes, you
wouldn't be familiar with it,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.496
because we made it up.

00:05:47.496 --> 00:05:48.710
And we trademarked it.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.290
But we were trying to find
a way to actually describe

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.260
to people what we meant by that
inefficiency in the system.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.680
So when you think
about the cost of,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.030
let's say, in our organic
tomato sauces as an example.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.520
So we make three different
kinds of tomato sauces.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.700
Arrabiata, garlic,
and tomato and basil.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.380
They're all organic.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.140
And we work with our
partner to do that.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.870
At that point, we then send
them to our distribution center,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.250
or we send them to you.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.150
That's not how most other
tomato sauce is distributed.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.310
It's often created
at that manufacturer.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.890
Sometimes the brand
owns the manufacturer.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.480
Sometimes they
partner with somebody

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.170
who's making it for them.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.650
They then have to distribute it.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.370
So sometimes, especially in
organics and naturals market,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.760
you can't sell directly to
a store like a Whole Foods.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.630
You have to go
through a distributor.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.870
And then that distributor
takes a percentage.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.000
Then you sell it, let's
say, to Whole Foods.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.550
And let's say it's a special
tomato sauce that you want

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.975
to have on a special shelf.

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:49.850
OK, well, then Whole
Foods gets their markup.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.920
And that shelf has
a special cost.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.960
Let's say there's already
a sauce on that shelf.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.570
Well, you have to then remove
that sauce, potentially,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.620
and put your sauce.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.390
Let's say you want to
do an end cap, which

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.514
is at the end of the aisle.

00:07:00.514 --> 00:07:02.030
Sometimes you see
those specials.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.210
Or you have somebody out there
sampling the sauce for you.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.390
The point is that all
of those touches--

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.960
and there's many, many,
many, many, more--

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.950
you end up paying
for that, which

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.190
is all on top of the cost
of the sauce to begin with.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.700
So by the time that sauce
leaves the manufacturer

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.980
and ends up on your pasta, it
could be two, three, four times

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.480
what it actually costs to make.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.500
I mean, everything is different.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.940
But if you're benchmarking it
against a brand like an organic

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.340
of similar quality,
you're going to see,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.810
on average, those
types of savings.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.236
So we roll that into this
idea of brand tax free.

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:41.610
Which is to say
that we're trying

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.570
in every which way that we can
to eliminate that middleman.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.460
Every product is different.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.710
Because most products
are sold differently.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.200
So the way a tomato
sauce gets distributed

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.270
might not be the same way--

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.030
you know, we also sell
plates, and bowls, and cups,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.720
and knives, and
things like that.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.780
So every system is different.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.350
But in general, wherever we
can be completely efficient

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.010
and pass on whatever
our costs are to you

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.724
by offering everything
at one simple $3 price.

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:14.140
JORGE CUETO: I think something
that characterizes Googlers

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.740
even though we work
at a big company,

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.710
is that we're pretty
entrepreneurial in nature.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.650
And people are always thinking
about what kind of product

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.880
they could potentially
go out and start making,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.270
or what kind of start
up they'll go and found.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.240
So maybe can you tell us a
little bit about your journey

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.940
that led you to come up
with the idea for Brandless

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.159
and how your previous
work experience influenced

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.289
your decision to start
this company in particular?

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.789
TINA SHARKEY: Yeah,
well I would say

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:41.809
that, first of all, the only
reason I was even keen to start

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.559
another company--
because I didn't think I

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.240
was going to do that.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.850
I sort of liken being an
entrepreneur, especially as

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.380
a woman, to childbirth.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.260
If you remembered what it felt
like, you would do it again.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.090
So somehow there's
some gene in your brain

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.290
that helps you forget that.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.240
Because I do have
two awesome sons.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.140
So clearly that
didn't happen to me.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.230
And I think entrepreneurship
and startups are very similar,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.420
which is that it's
a birth process.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.660
And it's hard.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.990
And it's unpredictable.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.230
But it's completely awesome.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.380
I decided that if I was
going to do another one,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.110
that I was going to do it
with the-- first and foremost,

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.330
with the people I wanted
to be on that journey with.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.670
And so my extraordinary
co-founder

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.770
Ido Leffler was
somebody that I wanted

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.880
to change the world with from a
business and scale perspective.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.970
And so we had been friends
for many years before.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.560
We lived in the same town.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.029
Our families were friends.

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:35.070
I was at the hospital when
his daughter was born.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.470
Like, just really
somebody I admired.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.610
And I admired his career.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.370
And he built a bunch
of CPG companies

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.210
that had not just
great success, but also

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.010
had purpose and meaning.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.930
And everything that I
try and do in my life

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.250
is rooted in sole
purpose and meaning.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.990
So I said, I'm going to start
a company with this person.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.341
And it's going to be for
profit and for purpose.

00:09:57.341 --> 00:09:59.340
And we're not going to
do purpose as a campaign.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.130
We're not going to do purpose as
something that's like a caboose

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.005
that we're going to jack
on to the back of it

00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:06.570
when it's Giving Tuesday,
which it happens to be today.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.260
I think Giving
Tuesday is amazing.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.170
But I think every day
should be Giving Tuesday.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.860
And that that's just a new
way of thinking about the way

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.730
we actually can live our lives.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.890
And so that journey started
with the right co-founder.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.840
The second thing was,
as my tour of duty

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.640
as a venture capitalist--

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.402
everyone in here, I'm
sure, in some way--

00:10:25.402 --> 00:10:26.610
and you're a product manager.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.960
I've been a product manager--

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.190
is about building things.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.260
There's features.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.450
So many of you may be
working on features.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.770
I've worked on many.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.030
Some of those features--

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.710
if you go through
YC, or you have

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.690
one of these other
incubation opportunities,

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.630
those features maybe
become products.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.060
If that product
actually has a life,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.070
that product could get
funding, potentially.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.350
It could become a company.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.740
So of those companies that
go from feature, to product,

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.780
to company, the rare
exception get to be brands.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.810
Meaning something that
people understand.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.000
It means something more
than any individual product

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.280
that they ship.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.250
Very few of those brands
actually have the opportunity

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.720
to be category leaders.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.236
So we're disrupting a category.

00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.360
We're going to be a leader.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.890
Or even better, are we going
to create a new category?

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.430
So in the case of an Airbnb or
a HomeAway, that was like, wow,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.347
it's an alternative category
to the travel category.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.680
We're going to create a new one.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.320
I would say Uber, and Lyft,
and those companies all fall

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.240
in that category, too.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.280
The highest order if you get
from feature, to product,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.990
to company, to brand,
to category leader,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.610
would be a movement.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.550
That actually, not only are
you creating a new category,

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.050
but you're inciting
something that's

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.770
bigger than your entire company,
that's actually about something

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.470
that's about people,
and moving them,

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.385
and moving society
and culture to a place

00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:49.260
that you want to see.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.270
And that your
company becomes one

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.770
of the people in that movement.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.420
But not necessarily
the only person

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.970
in that-- or the only
thing in that movement.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.760
That ladder, as an
investor, I was always

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.490
looking for things that actually
I felt could pass through.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.562
I wasn't interested in investing
in features or even products.

00:12:05.562 --> 00:12:07.020
And if it didn't
have the potential

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.294
to be a brand or
a category leader,

00:12:09.294 --> 00:12:10.710
it didn't feel
like something that

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.732
was sort of worthy of really
venture capital, which

00:12:14.732 --> 00:12:15.690
is what it's there for.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.310
Because it's the long term play.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:23.790
So when Ido and I landed on this
idea, I felt like in my soul

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.014
this was a movement.

00:12:25.014 --> 00:12:26.430
This was something
that was bigger

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.540
than any individual
piece of its parts.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.530
Which leads to the
idea of Brandless.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.670
Like, are we generic?

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.510
Are we not a brand?

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.230
No.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.900
We are unapologetically a brand.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.829
But we're redefining
what it means to be one.

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:41.370
And we're saying
we're a brand that's

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.760
based on truth, that's
based on authenticity,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.490
and that's based on being
in direct collaboration

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.510
with the people that we serve.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.380
So I would say
that when Google--

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.270
and Larry and Sergey
founded this company,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.130
it was the idea of
democratizing information.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.800
That's a big, lofty goal.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.640
And mission accomplished.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.020
Extraordinary.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.585
For us-- but they're not
the only ones doing it.

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:08.460
But you guys are clearly
the category leaders

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.640
in a category that
didn't even exist.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.570
Or maybe it did, but it
was very, very early.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.050
At Brandless we're trying
to democratize goodness.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.120
And that's this
movement, this idea

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.310
that everyone deserves better.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.930
And better shouldn't cost more.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.460
That's just not fair.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.970
But it's a very hard thing
to get your brain around when

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.750
somebody tells you that this
premium that you've been

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.610
paying, you don't need to pay.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.710
And this isn't about
going wholesale.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.690
We're actually engineering
everything from the ground up.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.060
But were in direct relationship
with the people that we serve.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:49.020
And so in doing that, in
being a community first,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.750
we think about
every single person

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.630
that we have the
privilege of working with.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.470
They're members
of our community.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.080
And so the love
letters, the notes,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.530
the engagement that we get back
all the time, like every minute

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.780
coming into our Slack
channels and all

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.250
of our social channels--

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.610
they can't believe that
they're in conversation

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.980
with the company that
they're buying organic tomato

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.710
sauce from, or organic
feminine hygiene from,

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.740
or clean beauty from, or
other things like that.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.330
Because our attitude is
if you want to be D to C,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.950
direct to consumer,
then you have

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.920
to be P to P, which
is person to person.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.190
And so everybody that
comes into our community,

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.380
we consider a member
of our community.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.450
And everyone that's
not in our community we

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.850
see as an awesome
stranger that we

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.770
have best intentions
to hopefully bring them

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.494
along our movement.

00:14:39.494 --> 00:14:41.910
JORGE CUETO: What do you see
as being your biggest success

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.870
of the first few months?

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.850
Because you guys just
launched in the summer, right?

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:45.641
TINA SHARKEY: Yeah.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.156
We're still here.

00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:51.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.170
So the biggest success.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.370
I would say that 60
hours after our launch

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.330
we got this incredible
number back.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.560
And that number was 48.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.790
And that number has held
every single day since then.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.270
What does that mean?

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:15.070
It means that we ship
to 48 states every day.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.580
And we weren't
targeting 48 states.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.180
We weren't advertising
to 48 states.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.690
We would like to ship to 50.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.170
But we can only ship in the
contiguous US right now.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.060
That's why Puerto
Rico gets our efforts,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.790
but doesn't get our product yet.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.550
And Alaska and Hawaii
are not happy with us.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.020
But we're trying.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.366
The Canadians we really love.

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:36.990
But we keep asking
them to make friends

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.970
with people in
Detroit or Seattle

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.520
that have a large minivan,
because I just can't

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.780
get into Canada right now.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.980
But the point is
that that success,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.360
the idea that the people
that we built this for

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.910
found it, whether they
were in Tallahassee,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.260
or Tennessee, or parts
of Texas, they found it.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.380
And the notes that
we get back, people

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.570
who have affordable luxuries
and could choose to get and shop

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.820
anywhere but don't
have access, people

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.460
that never thought they could
have access, because they could

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.980
never afford organics
for their family,

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.230
people that have dietary
restrictions that

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.850
didn't know where
to get these things

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.430
and now can find them
at affordable prices,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.570
and people who are
shifting their behaviors.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.780
For example, we sell
tree-free toilet paper,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.740
which means that no trees
were cut down or recycled

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.180
to make toilet tissue.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.480
It's made from bamboo
grasses and sugarcane.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.110
And so that are just
things that people love.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.320
They didn't know that they
could actually shop their values

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.430
at affordable prices.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.600
They didn't have
access to things.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.020
And so some of the communities
that have shown up early--

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.310
like the gluten-free community
is a very active community

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.870
online.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.510
And so they found us.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.500
And that was exciting.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.920
The vegan community,
they found us.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.250
I think it was our first week.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:06.280
We had gluten-free brownie
mix, gluten-free pancake mix,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.829
and gluten-free
blueberry muffin mix

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.630
before we did any of the rest.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.329
Like the regular
pancake or whatever.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.089
And they sold out in three days.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:17.530
And we were so surprised.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.089
Like, what just happened?

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.119
And then we learn that one of
the gluten-free, very active

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.640
online groups found Brandless.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.630
And boom, we sold out.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.796
I mean, we're back in stock.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.690
And we just didn't know
that those were going

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.130
to be interesting gateways.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:36.160
Or for example, our first SKU
of toothpaste is fluoride free.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.420
So we thought, you know what?

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.852
There is a growing
community of people

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.310
who believe that
there shouldn't be

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.410
fluoride in their toothpaste.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.062
And so we know that
is a niche community.

00:17:47.062 --> 00:17:49.270
But it's an important and
growing one, and one that's

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.350
very vocal, believe it or not.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.042
And so we launched a
fluoride-free toothpaste.

00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:55.000
Well, what do you know?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.280
People like-- it blew up.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.050
And they were using
that as a doorway

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.990
into the entire
assortment of Brandless

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.260
which has that intention
on every single bag, box,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.190
or bottle.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.230
So they're just
some early insights.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:09.970
Because we're only--
I don't know--

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.650
18, 20 weeks in.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.490
But those are some of the fun
nuances and stories that we're

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.080
starting to learn every day.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.650
JORGE CUETO: Yeah,
that brings me

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.180
to the general
question of how you

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.730
think about the specific
products that you pick.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.500
Because personally,
a lot of my friends

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.380
who are really excited
about Brandless,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.640
it's because they're vegan.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.890
And they're just so excited
that it's so easy for them

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.530
to access a wide variety
of vegan products

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.760
at a pretty affordable price.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.130
When usually, I think,
vegan products either

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.080
tend to be really
hard to find, or they

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.760
tend to be expensive
relative to other products.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.670
So this is a really
good venue for them

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.819
to reach out to and have easy
access to what they need.

00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:47.110
So how do you think about that?

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.110
Because I know you also have
organic feminine hygiene

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.490
products and office supplies.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.450
So it's a wide range of things.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.777
But it seems like it's
very thought through.

00:18:56.777 --> 00:18:58.860
TINA SHARKEY: Yeah, so
what's really interesting--

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.260
and when you go to buy shoes,
whether you buy them online

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.000
or whether you buy
them in a shop,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.430
the likelihood is you're
probably just going,

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.350
and you're buying the
shoes, and you're done.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.480
Whether it's a check
out at an online store

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.070
or whether it's
a physical store.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.410
And maybe if you're buying
them from an online store,

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.390
and you don't know your size,
and they have a good return

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.973
policy, maybe you're
buying two sizes,

00:19:17.973 --> 00:19:19.210
and you're returning one.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.770
That's a possibility.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.770
It's very different in
the consumables business.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.630
In the consumables
business, it's

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.060
about the mission and the trip.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.450
So what does that mean?

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.660
That means that
these are the things

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.110
that you reach for every day.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.540
Whether you reach for
them in your pantry,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.100
whether you reach for
them under your sink,

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.100
whether you reach for
them in your laundry room,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.724
or your bathroom,
or even your purse.

00:19:39.724 --> 00:19:41.640
They're the things that
you consume every day.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.970
They're the things that
you replenish all the time.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.540
And so when we created this
initial assortment of products,

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.620
we were really
intentional in saying, OK,

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.610
what do people buy
52 weeks a year?

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.500
And how many
households in America--

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.570
we took a very
analytical approach.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.240
How many households in
America buy that product?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.510
What's the-- what we call HHPs,
the Household Penetrations.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.590
And then we study that
based on every single thing

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.270
that people buy.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.960
And how could we make
sure that, unlike shoes--

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.570
which is what I would call
a one and done, right?

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.150
These are the baskets
that people are building.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.360
How can we make sure that
our shelves are stocked

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.204
with just what mattered, where
we were creating selection

00:20:27.204 --> 00:20:28.870
and assortment, and
where there was what

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.550
we call expandable consumption.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.070
So in the case of
snacks, for example.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:38.590
Snacks is something that 98.8%
of American households buy.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.170
And they buy them
52 weeks a year.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.740
And if I was to ship you a
box of 10 different kinds

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.350
of snacks, whether
or not you personally

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.896
would eat those snacks,
you might try them.

00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:53.020
If you didn't want to try
them for whatever reason,

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.610
you might bring them to work.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.500
You might bring them
to the soccer game.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.560
You might host a Monday
Night Football party.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.710
There's lots of different ways
that you might eat that snack.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.390
So that's a place where we're
launching jalapeno cheddar

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:12.880
quinoa puffs along with olive
oil and sea salt popcorn.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.680
All of these are non-GMOs.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.910
Some of these are organic.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:21.160
And we're launching quinoa chips
alongside of tomato and basil

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.940
hummus puffs.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.160
All kinds of yummy things.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.130
And they're all--
some of them are here.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.780
And so we're trying new things.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.610
We're experimenting
with new things.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.800
There are other
places where you don't

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.100
need to be paralyzed
by 50 feet of salad

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.360
dressing when the truth is you
probably just use one, two,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.290
or three.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.620
And so in that particular case,
our organic Italian dressing,

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.320
our organic balsamic
vinegar dressing,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.540
and our organic
poppyseed dressing

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.330
are the three that we
know are the most popular.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.500
And then we introduced one
that we're crazy about.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:03.470
And it's a ginger dressing that
may not be everyone's taste,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.570
but it's a way to
try new things.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:10.030
And so in that category,
we're doing just what matters.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.270
In the case of
oils and vinegars,

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.070
we launched an organic
extra virgin olive

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.100
oil and an organic
balsamic vinegar.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.900
Might we do other ones?

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.560
We might.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.800
But we knew that was the
most important thing to do.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.757
In the case of the holidays,
starting in October

00:22:27.757 --> 00:22:29.590
and taking you all the
way through the year,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.570
we have a maple collection.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.370
So that maple
collection is what we

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.800
call LTO, limited time offer.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.080
And so we have the most
incredible maple twists.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.400
Highly recommended.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.180
Maple cookies.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.560
Even maple lip balm, maple
coffees, and maple syrup.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.310
The maple syrup is organic.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.090
It's amazing.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.420
And it's $3.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.920
"Good Housekeeping"
just said it was

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.200
they're number one or number
two pick for stocking stuffers,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.420
as like the best
gift of the year.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.160
It's a beautiful
bottle, et cetera.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.900
So looking at every single item
with that lens of just what

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.990
matters.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.220
Not to do the
over-proliferation of choice.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.370
But create choice where we know
that you actually want choice,

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.770
and you want trial.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.180
Versus an area
where you're locked

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.650
into one thing or two things.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.080
And we don't need
to create waste.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.520
Don't create waste there.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.240
So we're very intentional
by product, by category,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.070
and by SKU.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.300
How we create them.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.810
What the formulations are.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.570
And how we live
up to our own sort

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.090
of filter of just what matters.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.430
JORGE CUETO: Is there some
sort of feedback cycle

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.472
with what customers want?

00:23:34.472 --> 00:23:36.430
Do you ever get requests
for specific products?

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.080
TINA SHARKEY: Oh my gosh, yes.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.610
So the initial assortment--
when we launched,

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.020
we launched with about
114 what we call S-K-Us.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.490
You know, items.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.040
And now we're
probably north of 200.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.960
We're probably around 220.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.050
But everything
since our launch has

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.910
been based on the
feedback of things

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.510
that people were looking for.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.870
So there was very much
high requests for oatmeals.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.842
And so we launched oatmeal in
September, organic oatmeals.

00:24:04.842 --> 00:24:07.300
We launched them in packs, and
we launched them in flavors.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.050
There was a big
request for soups.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.380
So we just launched our organic
chicken broth, vegetable broth,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.490
and beef broth.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.380
What I love about our
soups as an example--

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.270
you know how you can buy in the
store those cartons of soup?

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.570
The thing I hate about those is
if I'm not cooking for my kids,

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.334
I open one, and then I
feel like I'm wasting it.

00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:31.000
Because if I don't use the whole
carton I have to throw it away.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.040
What's great about
Brandless is for $3

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.310
you actually get three
individual sizes.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.290
So you can just open
them for what you need.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:44.490
We also launched two for
$3 of a vegan and organic.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.250
We have a tomato soup.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.890
We have a butternut squash soup.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.464
We have a red pepper soup.

00:24:50.464 --> 00:24:51.130
They're awesome.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.088
And they come in these
little individual boxes.

00:24:53.088 --> 00:24:54.760
So we're very
intentional about that.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.100
And people really wanted soup.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.630
But we needed to do
soup the Brandless way.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.950
And so if we can do it
the Brandless way, where

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.900
we can be brand tax
free, and we can land it

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.560
at a price that makes sense, and
it lives up to our own values,

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.802
and we love the partner who
can scale with us, we're good.

00:25:12.802 --> 00:25:14.260
But all of that
feedback that we're

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.150
getting for our
future assortments,

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.092
we're co-creating
with our community.

00:25:18.092 --> 00:25:20.425
JORGE CUETO: What has been
one of the biggest challenges

00:25:20.425 --> 00:25:24.460
that you've faced
since starting out?

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.780
TINA SHARKEY: I would say
that in the context of talking

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.510
to the Google audience, both
here and in the stream--

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.900
and I'm sure this will live
on YouTube thereafter--

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.460
is that we, in being not
a feature, or a product,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.860
or a brand, or a
company, or a category

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.720
leader, but a movement, we
really need to get big fast.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.380
And so I would say that scaling
the company and the team--

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.200
because at Brandless,
we put people first.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.510
And that starts with
every single person

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.220
who works at Brandless.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.980
And so growing our
team and growing

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.580
it quickly, but with the right
people and the right filter--

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.490
you know, I say that when
I look at my own algorithm

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.870
for recruiting, I totally
weight it at the awesome human.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.290
I don't care-- yes, of course,
you need to be qualified.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.230
But qualifications do not
trump awesome human factor.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.990
And so finding the
right people who

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.930
not only have the skills,
and the confidence,

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.540
and the scale to want
to be part of a startup,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.600
but also understand scale
and how to get to scale.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.520
And they're excited
about going to scale.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.270
But they believe that the doing
in life is really what matters.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.750
And they want to
make a difference,

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.860
not only by day in what
they're shipping and deploying,

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.850
but in the company
that we're building,

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.660
which we believe is going to
change the way people think

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.650
about things.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.850
And really try and just
keep focusing on the idea

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.790
that everyone deserves better,
and that we can actually

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.960
democratize goodness with
every shipment, with every box,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.570
with every post,
with every tweet,

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.010
and with all of our intentions.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.010
JORGE CUETO: So with
Brandless you kind of exist

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.520
at this intersection
between commerce and then

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.170
also technology.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.170
Do you ever feel like there's
a conflict of interest

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.340
between the two sides?

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.707
And how do you decide which side
to give in to at any one point?

00:27:16.707 --> 00:27:19.290
TINA SHARKEY: I would say that
there's a very good chance that

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.710
might happen in the future.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.060
But because we barely
have deployed version 1,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.090
I would say we're in
an MVP-plus right now.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.880
So we haven't hit
that place where

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.480
those two are in conflict.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.590
But we definitely
want to give people

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.310
the runway to pursue
their passions

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.710
and to pursue their interests.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.500
And so the more data
that we can play with,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.630
the more people
are enabled to use

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.310
that data to tell the kinds of
stories that are going to help

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.340
them move their piece and
the larger piece of Brandless

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.090
forward.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.950
So I'd say that we're
all sort of data

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.080
scientists underneath it all.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.670
Some of us have the skills.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.090
And some of us have the desire
to understand those insights.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:05.250
So triangulating between,
who are our shoppers?

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.480
And how are they part
of our community?

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.780
What are in their baskets,
so that we can give them

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.190
more of those things?

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.750
And how can we
deploy the features

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:17.150
and functionality to make that
automagically possible for them

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.050
in a mobile environment?

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.770
So that we can make
it just super easy,

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.670
and mitigate click fatigue,
mitigate scroll fatigue,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.220
and get them in and
out really fast.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.790
So the smaller the screens
get-- as you know all too well--

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.750
the harder it is to get all
those features into one scroll.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.100
And so given that the
universe is mobile-first,

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.010
how do you think about
that in a non-app world?

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.190
Because we weren't interested
in our first deployment

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.300
of building an app.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.970
Because I didn't want to put
a download in front of someone

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.680
who hadn't met us yet.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.870
But that will come over time.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.810
So thinking about that
balance between the roadmap,

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.310
the features and functionality,
and always, always,

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.900
always putting people first.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.390
And so that means both letting
the employees kind of scratch

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.620
their data and curiosity
itches and try things.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.140
As well as the
users, who we want

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.414
to make it as simple, and
fluid, and easy as possible.

00:29:19.414 --> 00:29:21.580
JORGE CUETO: In terms of
features and functionality,

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.720
you recently announced B.More,
which is an annual membership

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.770
program.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:29.820
I think, in my eyes, I see it as
being similar to Amazon Prime.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.520
So how would you say
you set yourself apart

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.450
from Amazon Prime?

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.640
And how did you decide
to start implementing

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.272
this annual membership model?

00:29:37.272 --> 00:29:38.730
TINA SHARKEY: So
I have to say that

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.060
being compared to
Amazon Prime I take

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.620
as a complete form of flattery.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.500
So we should have such problems.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.570
More people have Amazon
Prime memberships

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.140
than they have
landlines in America.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.300
So I think that
would be awesome.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.210
Having said that,
we launched on 7-11.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.320
Which I thought was funny.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.590
Because it was 7-11.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.590
Little did I know that it was
free Slurpee day and Amazon

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.640
Prime Day.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.850
But somehow we had
already set the date.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.590
And that was it.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.600
But it didn't seem to matter.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.760
Having said that,
like I said, Brandless

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.100
is building a community.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.700
And so when we launched
B.More, our goal with B.More

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.870
was to give people an
opportunity to do more,

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.780
to get more, and to give more.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.410
And so for $36 a year,
which, if you do the math--

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.420
and everyone in this
room I know can--

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.300
it's $3 a month.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.070
And it's free shipping with
any B.More order, no matter--

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.570
no shipping threshold.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.210
And so in addition,
when you join,

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.710
we give 10 meals
to Feeding America.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.927
Every time you check
out there's two meals

00:30:47.927 --> 00:30:49.510
that are in your
shopping cart that we

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:54.490
provide as priceless, as part
of your Brandless experience.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.430
And we're just trying to
remove any of the friction

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.560
to try and make
it easy for people

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.530
to have access to
Brandless products,

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.870
to be able to afford the
things that they want,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.580
and to be able to feel like
every day is Giving Tuesday.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.640
In that they can actually
give more, share more,

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.260
and be more engaged.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.720
Over time B.More
will be a platform

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.650
for partners to actually be
able to maybe share more.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:25.210
So for example, on
Black Friday when

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.830
everyone else was
slashing prices,

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:31.510
we gave away a meditation app.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.820
And gave-- we let people
sort of think about,

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.800
what does Brandless life mean?

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.800
Because when we say
Brandless, we're not generic.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.510
We're not private label.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.900
We're saying, just live
more and brand less.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.595
Don't let somebody else tell
you that you should be taller,

00:31:47.595 --> 00:31:49.390
that your hair
should be straighter,

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.610
that your teeth should
look a certain way,

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.610
that you should shoot
the ball a certain way.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.320
We think you're already awesome.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.400
And just be more.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.780
Be more of who you already are.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.290
And so Brandless is really
about empowering people

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.300
to just sort of live
their best lives

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.120
and not have to make a
choice between what they want

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.170
and what they can afford.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.672
Because people shouldn't
be forced to choose.

00:32:10.672 --> 00:32:12.380
JORGE CUETO: We have
our microphone here.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.440
And so if you have a
question, raise your hand,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.056
and we can get the mic to you.

00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:17.680
AUDIENCE: What percent
of your products

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.110
do you have to take a loss on
to get that $3 price point?

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.022
And then as you--

00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:23.480
I don't know much about how
the distribution process works.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.170
But I assume you have a
limited number of warehouses.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.782
Or I don't know if you can
contract through other people's

00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:29.990
warehouses or how that works.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.710
But as you grow, can you bring
the cost of those products

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.320
below to actually make
a profit or whatever

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.890
on those $3 products?

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.060
TINA SHARKEY: So the thing
that will blow your mind

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.970
is that the answer is zero.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.640
There's not a single
product that we

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.650
are underwriting at Brandless.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.510
Not one.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:53.080
Now, having said that,
there's different margins

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.310
on different products.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.890
But because you're not--

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.410
it's not like shoes where
it's a one and done.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.490
You're buying a basket.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.130
Because you are
finding the things

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.090
that you reach for every day.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:09.160
And so it's a blended
margin for sure.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.070
But there's not a single product
that we are losing money on,

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.930
If that's the question.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.420
In terms of
distribution centers,

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.310
right now we have
distribution centers

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.250
in California and
in the Midwest.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:26.110
And that enables us to sort
of try and do two days or less

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.680
wherever we serve in
the continental US.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.150
And we'll be definitely
scaling that as we grow.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.400
And so we're working
with partners

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.290
who can help us do that.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.020
Because we are in the
consumables business,

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.720
it's not like you can just
go to any place that's also

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.060
packing shirts, shoes, and--

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.860
clearly I'm obsessed with shoes.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.140
But it's a different
kind of distribution

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.080
when you're packaging up
grocery-like items, even

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.850
in the non-perishables space.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.040
But we definitely will
be able to scale that.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.180
We are not shipping directly
from our manufacturers.

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.410
Because like I said,
nobody buys one item.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.670
People buy baskets.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.159
Because when you go on
Brandless, you'll see

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.560
it's the things that
you reach for every day.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.561
And usually a better
version of that.

00:34:14.561 --> 00:34:17.060
JORGE CUETO: There's a question
related to that in the Dory.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.040
How do you select suppliers
behind Brandless products?

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.460
What fraction of the products
come from small businesses

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.350
versus large corporations?

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.150
Does Brandless plan to
source more products

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.449
that are produced locally
or at least in the US?

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.850
TINA SHARKEY: So that's
a fantastic question.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:36.739
We have very, very strict and
sophisticated sourcing policies

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:37.940
and strategies.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:42.710
Because we never want to be to
the point of that small shop.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.440
We never want to have
our tomato sauce produced

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.090
in someone's kitchen.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.909
Not to suggest that the
formulation can't come

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.090
from a fabulous recipe there.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.150
But we kind of want to be--

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.640
I wouldn't say the smallest
customer, but one of those.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.120
Because we want to be
able to expand and grow.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.530
We also make sure that the
partners that we work with

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.030
live up to all of our standard.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:11.030
So organics, non-GMOs,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.910
And that all the certifications
that we put on the label

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.860
and tell you about
that product has

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:21.440
passed through all of the QA
that they have to go through.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.520
And so all of the
partners are very much

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.110
put through that filter
and that standard.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.770
In addition, we try
and source as much

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.660
as we can here in the US.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.730
And I would say the
majority of the assortment

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.460
is developed here.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.640
But there are cases
where, for example,

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.210
our pastas, our organic pastas,
and our organic olive oils

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.980
come from Italy.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.180
And so we are sourcing
outside of the US.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.390
But it is our desire to
do as much as we can here.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:55.830
Hi.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.620
AUDIENCE: So I think I
see a very strong value

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.380
proposition for users who
actually have restrictions.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.060
Like my sister is
allergic to gluten.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.260
So having that wide
variety is really exciting.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.470
So I'm thinking for the
consumer who actually doesn't

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.920
have a lot of restrictions,
or who doesn't really

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.260
necessarily care about
whether something

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.590
is gluten-free or non-GMO.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.170
Pound for pound, are
you actually cheaper

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.519
than similar competitors?

00:36:24.519 --> 00:36:27.060
TINA SHARKEY: Pound for pound--
so it's a fantastic question.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.940
Which is, yes, for
those affinity groups,

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.020
the gluten-frees, the
vegans, et cetera,

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:36.000
we have extraordinary
products at very fair prices.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.340
But also there's
not a single person

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.280
in this country that
couldn't benefit

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.830
from the on average
40% brand tax

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.860
free savings on national
brands of equal quality.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.830
So our organic peanut
butters, our organic oils,

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.840
our organic sauces.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.680
If you're comparing
those to organic products

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.160
at a retail location, you're
paying on average 40%,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.770
sometimes 200% more.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.040
So the quality is extraordinary.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.160
And there's savings
across the board.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.020
And you shouldn't have
to pay more for that.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.689
One thing I failed
to say, and this

00:37:15.689 --> 00:37:17.730
is relevant to everyone
in this room and everyone

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.045
on the livestream--

00:37:19.045 --> 00:37:21.420
but I know this is going to
be on YouTube for the public.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.710
So I can't give away the code.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.990
But tomorrow when you
get your perks email,

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:31.050
we provided a special
code for all Googlers

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.710
to get 33% off of B.More.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.170
So that you can have
it for your families.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.570
And that you can always get
Brandless in your homes.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.990
And that's for every Googler
across the continental US.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:47.925
So definitely please tell
your lunch mates, your cube

00:37:47.925 --> 00:37:49.590
mates, people you
see in the hallway,

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.780
people you see on
campus, and your friends

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.560
across the community.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.490
Brandless is only going to be
a community if the community

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.690
helps us build it.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.350
So we really wanted you guys
to be able to participate

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:02.589
in that way.

00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:03.130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:03.570
TINA SHARKEY: Hi.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.486
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you can tell us--

00:38:05.486 --> 00:38:08.820
and it's not confidential
information, of course--

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.460
the most capital intensive
part of your business.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.800
TINA SHARKEY: Because
we have over--

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.570
we'll have by the end
of the year probably

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.460
like 250 products.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.400
And then we'll be
growing to more.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.270
Definitely securing
the inventory,

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.060
putting the inventory into
our distribution centers

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:32.160
and turning that is something
that we're very, very aware of.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.141
But because sales
are great, and--

00:38:37.141 --> 00:38:38.640
we're in the
nonperishable business,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.820
but we're turning those
things all the time.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.340
But because we're
a startup, and we

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.210
went from literally
a 100% cold start,

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.130
we are doing everything
from scratch.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.320
So we're building everything
for the first time.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.930
So it's not like
we're optimizing

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:59.640
our web site, or our servers,
or our data, or anything.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.030
We're creating it.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.730
The other thing
about Brandless is

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.490
that we are completely
vertically integrated.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.480
Meaning that from the
label, to the photography,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.350
to the packaging, to
the everything that you

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.410
see it Brandless,
whether it's on Facebook,

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:20.490
or on Pinterest,
or on our website,

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:24.840
or in any setting, everything
we create ourselves.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.390
And so we're also
a content company.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.570
Because we're creating all
of this content about how

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.360
to use it, how to share
it, recipes, all of that.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.470
And we're doing that
all from scratch.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.430
So there's an investment
in building out the company

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.380
and building out
all of the systems,

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.770
and all of the stories, and
all of those pieces and parts

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.480
of making Brandless
a community that you

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.250
want to participate in.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.410
JORGE CUETO: Another
question from the Dory.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.630
How do you compete
effectively with incumbents

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.390
like P&amp;G, Unilever, et cetera?

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:00.330
And how do you overcome
consumer's emotional attachment

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.780
to loved brand?

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.060
TINA SHARKEY: I
love that question.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.910
The question is really--

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.690
I'll take it in two parts.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.770
The first question is, how do we
compete with Unilever and P&amp;G,

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.450
or the-- let's call
those the incumbents

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.130
and the installed base.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.890
We're not trying to compete
with P&amp;G and Unilever.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:20.050
Because they don't have any
direct consumer relationships.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.890
So those companies,
their customers

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.420
are stores, or what
we call channels.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.720
So whether it's Amazon, a
virtual store, a digital store,

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.510
or a physical store, they
don't have any direct consumer

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.600
relationships.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.330
So we're not really
competing with them.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.680
Because we're
building a community.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.450
And they're really
suppliers to their channels.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.570
In terms of the second
part of that question,

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.800
is for the beloved brands--

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.020
this stat, especially
for those in the room,

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.830
might come as a big
surprise to you,

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.840
which is that, of the top
100 CPG brands in America

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.940
last year, 90--

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.850
which by my math, is 90%--

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.550
were in decline.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.880
So the problem is that the
millennial or perennial--

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.630
perennial meaning the mindset of
that new consumer irrespective

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.110
of their age--

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.380
doesn't want to buy the
brands they grew up with.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.940
There's a loss of trust.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.460
There's an openness to wanting
to meet companies who actually

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.310
people want to do business
with, who believe are socially

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.940
responsible, who believe that
they are listening and living

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.970
their values, and that are
transparent in the way in which

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.150
they operate.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.740
So we're reimagining what
those relationships can be.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.210
And there are people that
love their toothpaste

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.550
or love their toilet paper.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:45.030
But when you think about the
amount of toothpaste and toilet

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:48.220
paper that is consumed in
this country every day--

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.490
it's a very, very big country.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:55.260
And everybody-- at
least I hope everybody--

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.340
is using toilet
tissue of some sort

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.470
and brushing their teeth
at least once-- but

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.950
recommended three
times if you were

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.905
going to go to the
American Dental Association

00:42:03.905 --> 00:42:05.280
and look at their
best practices.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.360
So there's a lot of opportunity
to build new relationships

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:15.810
and introduce new products
and new ways of buying them.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.310
AUDIENCE: So obviously
there's a ton

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.740
that goes into starting a
company, from getting people

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.770
to fill all the jobs
that need to get done,

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:25.470
to looking for funding,
and just setting yourself

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:26.637
for a successful--

00:42:26.637 --> 00:42:28.470
setting yourself up for
a successful launch.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:31.080
Can you talk about the
journey from the day

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.900
you had the idea to the
day you actually launched?

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:40.760
TINA SHARKEY: Yeah, so the
journey of incubation--

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.560
so Ido and I met.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.470
We both were doing
different jobs.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.410
I was running Sherpa Foundry,
and I was a venture partner

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.670
at Sherpa Capital.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.960
And he was the founding CEO of
Yoobi, the stationary supply

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.310
company that gives back, and
Cheeky, the tabletop company

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.890
that makes dishes,
and plates, and bowls

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.160
all sold at Target and
around the country.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.240
And probably many
other companies

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.060
that he was developing
with his partners.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.710
And we said, we have to
do something together.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.490
So that was probably maybe
even two years before--

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:16.670
if not longer--
before we actually

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.800
decided to start to think about
what we could do together.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.330
At the time that we
sat down and said,

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.140
let's incubate this,
and let's brainstorm--

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.640
from the time that we
actually launched the company,

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:36.380
we probably incubated
it for maybe a year

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:39.740
or a year and a half
before a friend, who

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.200
was a venture
capitalist, said, wait,

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.330
you're incubating something?

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.190
We would love to see that.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:50.960
And this turned out to be a
very sophisticated late stage

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.020
and early stage investor,
Jeff Brody at Redpoint.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.180
And he said, I want to
seed fund this company.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.765
Because I know you.

00:43:57.765 --> 00:43:58.640
And I believe in you.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.779
And I believe in
what you're doing.

00:44:00.779 --> 00:44:02.820
But even if I don't believe
in what you're doing,

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.170
I believe in you.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:06.050
And when you're
funding a seed company,

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.880
it's really about
investing in the people.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.800
Because you're going
to learn, and pivot,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.020
and do lots of things before you
actually launch that company.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.700
So once we secured
this seed funding,

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.940
I knew that I had to
transition out of my day job.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.230
And so I replaced
myself and said,

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.450
OK, I'm going to be
the CEO of the company.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.130
Because I was like
the acting CEO.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.540
And Ido was the acting chairman.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.620
But we were still doing
all these other things.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:37.040
And we hadn't made any
commitments to launching it.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.024
Or we hadn't taken
any capital yet.

00:44:39.024 --> 00:44:40.940
Once we started to do
that, we said, OK, well,

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.690
what are the things that
we have to learn and prove.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:48.050
To your question of the
margin, can we actually

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.120
source these things
at this price point?

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.040
Can we create a UI and
UX for the packaging,

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.890
which had never really
been done in CPG,

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.430
where everything that we do
has the attributes that matter.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:04.040
And the way in which we label
things, and the way in which we

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.260
communicate the values
and the attributes

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.990
of every single
product, could we

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.910
create a system
that would scale?

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:12.590
Once we felt like
we could do that,

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:16.340
we started to recruit
the right people who

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.180
actually had the world-class
expertise to join our team.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.020
And then once we
started to do that,

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.010
and we realized that we felt
like we had a runway, that we

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:29.480
saw the path to actually
bringing this to market,

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.940
then Redpoint said,
you know what?

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.320
We want to lead the series
A. And so once that happened,

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.220
I said, OK, I'm going to shift
and be the full time CEO,

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.190
raise that funding,
and then really begin

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.120
to recruit the team.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.840
But up until that
point, even though we

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.790
knew our name was
Brandless, we were

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:53.631
operating under a code name,
which is a little-known story.

00:45:53.631 --> 00:45:55.380
Actually "Entrepreneur
Magazine," I think,

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.332
wrote about that,
which was funny.

00:45:57.332 --> 00:45:59.040
They thought that was
really interesting,

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.030
which is that we operated
under a faux name.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.210
Because we didn't want to tip
our hand to the industries

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:07.070
that we might be disrupting.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.920
And so until we
raised the series A,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.540
we were operating
under a faux name.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.370
We had a faux LinkedIn.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.780
We had a faux website.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.350
We had faux business cards, faux
email addresses, everything.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.010
Because we were in sort
of supplier conversations,

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.240
to make sure--

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.040
and we didn't want
to sort of tip

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.510
our hand to what we
were actually doing.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.630
But then once we
raised the series A,

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.210
then we came out as Brandless.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:33.860
We relaunched the web site.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.440
Not the commerce site,
but the marketing site

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.510
while we were building it.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.200
And then we started recruiting
the actual scale team.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.220
Engineering, product,
merch, everybody.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.610
Marketing, et cetera.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.340
And we were off to the races.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.490
We then knew that we were
going to launch in July.

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.340
And we didn't really
need to raise yet.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.000
But some folks had
heard about our launch.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.550
And so some of those folks
are actually Google and NEA.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.300
Google Ventures,
not Google Alphabet.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.810
So Google Ventures and
NEA came to us and said,

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.570
we're very excited
about what you're doing.

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:17.630
We know you're launching in,
like, three weeks or whatever.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.674
It was very, very tight.

00:47:20.674 --> 00:47:21.840
But we really believe in it.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.850
And we want to be a part of it.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:28.380
And so we raised our series
B before we ever launched.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.830
And in fact, we announced
the launch and the series B

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:32.270
on the same day.

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:35.480
So that was kind of crazy.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:41.300
And then we launched on 7-11,
on Slurpee day and Amazon Prime

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:41.800
Day.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.665
Who knew?

00:47:42.665 --> 00:47:43.970
[LAUGHS]

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.300
AUDIENCE: From the time the
idea was conceptualized,

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.110
did the idea or your execution
stay on the same track?

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:52.407
Or you had to pivot?

00:47:52.407 --> 00:47:53.990
TINA SHARKEY: That's
a great question.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.630
No, we actually--
it's remarkable.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:59.330
I haven't talked to Ido.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:03.959
But we stayed on the
exact same track.

00:48:03.959 --> 00:48:06.500
I haven't mentioned that to Ido
recently, that, like, can you

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.407
believe that our
first business plan,

00:48:08.407 --> 00:48:10.490
everything we thought we
were going to do, we did.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:15.950
And in fact, funny story was
that we started under embargo

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:18.605
going to talk to the media
around the March time

00:48:18.605 --> 00:48:21.500
frame for the July launch,
which is really a long time

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.300
to be under embargo.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.670
And so we had this--

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:29.390
and we only had at the time
a PowerPoint with JPEGs.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.450
We didn't have all--

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.199
I mean, the products
were being developed.

00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:34.730
But we didn't have
the products with us.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:36.230
So we would go in,
and we would talk

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:37.646
to these journalists,
many of whom

00:48:37.646 --> 00:48:39.230
we knew, because
we've been doing--

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:41.780
had relationships from
other companies, whatever.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.539
And I would tell the story.

00:48:43.539 --> 00:48:45.830
And we would tell them about
these incredible products.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.580
They're organic.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.299
They're non-GMO.

00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:47.840
They're this.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.381
They're this.

00:48:48.381 --> 00:48:49.155
They're this.

00:48:49.155 --> 00:48:52.610
And-- and then we'd wait
like, three, two, one.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:53.910
They're all $3.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.510
And at that moment then
we would go silent.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.340
And the journalists
would all say to us,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.810
like, you've got to be kidding.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:00.770
Get out of here.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.630
Stop horsing around,
da, da, da, da, da.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:05.000
They were like, stop
wasting our time.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.110
We're like, no.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.520
They're really all $3.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.209
Like, we swear.

00:49:08.209 --> 00:49:09.250
In fact, that's not true.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.083
Some are two for $3.

00:49:10.083 --> 00:49:11.390
Some are three for $3.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:15.440
And so once they kind
of processed that idea,

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.470
and then we got them the
samples under embargo.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.810
They were all like, how quickly
can I get it for myself?

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:22.460
Because they loved it.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.970
So then Ido called me up about
two weeks before the launch.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.410
And he said, I'm mad at you.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:30.650
And I said, what do you
mean you're mad at me?

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:33.710
He said, we never recorded
all of those meetings.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.540
And on July 12
everyone will know.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.984
And we can't do that same story.

00:49:38.984 --> 00:49:39.900
I said, you know what?

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.370
It's not too late.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:45.110
And so our creative director Jen
Tank and I said, you know what?

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.490
We have two weeks.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:48.470
So we put an ad on Craigslist.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:51.140
And we said, we're
looking for some actors

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.590
to come to a food tasting at
a startup in San Francisco.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.480
That's all we told them.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.130
And the reason we
wanted actors was

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.800
because we were on
such a tight budget

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.290
that we were hoping that
actors would more likely have

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:07.220
good expressions on their faces
if we tried this PR thing.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.740
But we didn't-- they didn't
know what we were doing.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.870
And we did the exact same
thing, except a little--

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.150
they actually got more
than the journalists.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:15.620
Because they had
more than JPEGs.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.170
We took them into our
generic conference room.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.650
And we just put the food
out, just like it's here.

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.330
And then they tasted it.

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:25.700
And then we walked
them into this room.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.080
And maybe we can put
this on the livestream--

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.652
I mean on the recorded thing.

00:50:30.652 --> 00:50:32.360
The room next door to
the conference room

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.580
is what we call
the Brandless lab.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.626
And it's kind of my version of
the Willy Wonka chocolate room.

00:50:37.626 --> 00:50:38.750
There's no chocolate river.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.280
Although maybe in
a new real estate

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.821
I can get that
written into the deal.

00:50:41.821 --> 00:50:44.540
It's my fantasy to have a
chocolate river in the office.

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.520
But that's just me.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.460
And so we showed
them everything.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:54.110
And we said, all these things
you've tasted, it's all $3.

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:56.840
And we got the exact same
reaction of the journalist.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.520
Like, what?

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.460
Are you kidding me?

00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.000
Stop it.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:50:59.900
That's not possible.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.750
Da, da, da.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:02.840
And then we called that,
"Awesome Strangers."

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.180
And that was the video
that we launched with,

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.650
which were these
people coming in,

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.660
tasting, and then seeing it,
and then having that reaction.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.340
So in truth we didn't change
it from the beginning.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.840
But we tried to--

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.662
we found that consistently
the reaction--

00:51:16.662 --> 00:51:18.620
now, maybe if the reaction
hadn't been so good,

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.000
we might have changed it.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.325
But the team has done
such an extraordinary job

00:51:22.325 --> 00:51:24.200
at creating products
that people really love.

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.700
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk about the $3?

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.480
How did you come to that--

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.680
TINA SHARKEY: Why $3?

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.710
That's a great question.

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:33.570
So I would say three reasons,
because we love threes.

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:37.980
So the first reason
was that, part

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.070
of the Brandless experience--

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.820
and when you go and
you check it out--

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:47.330
is that all of us are completely
paralyzed by what's called

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:49.410
now the paradox of choice.

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.570
That there is like--
you go to the drugstore.

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:52.940
You go to the supermarket.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.400
And there's, as I said before,
50 feet of salad dressing.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.180
300 sauces to choose from.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.070
It's like, what?

00:51:58.070 --> 00:51:59.810
Like, how do I even choose?

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:03.740
So part of our opportunity
was to simplify

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.020
everything including the price.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:12.720
What's the difference between
$2.89, $4.62, $6.21, $4.32.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.250
Like, it's just-- what is that?

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:15.470
That's like a manipulation.

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:19.040
So simplifying it was
one of our objectives.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.700
Being completely easy and
transparent to navigate.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.160
And the most important
thing is that, when

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.130
we studied the organics
and naturals market,

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:30.140
the sort of what we
call better for you--

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.050
organic, vegan, non-GMO,
et cetera, et cetera--

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.440
that market, if you
look at that filter, $3

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.970
is not the entry point
into that market.

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:42.140
And so our goal
was to what we call

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.120
blow the doors off the
front of the building

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.910
and make it much more
accessible to a much

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:49.070
broader swath of people.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:52.850
Because our intention was
that everyone deserves better.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.710
And better didn't
have to cost more.

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:56.120
And so we were very deliberate.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.110
So it was simplification.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:59.540
It was ease.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:04.790
And making a much broader
addressable audience.

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.436
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:05.436 --> 00:53:07.060
Thank you for being
here, first of all.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:07.120
TINA SHARKEY: My pleasure.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:07.870
AUDIENCE: And congratulations--

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:08.870
TINA SHARKEY: Thank you.

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.660
AUDIENCE: --on all your success.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.150
It seems like with the quality
of the product and also

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.350
the price point,
your product is ideal

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.410
for a low-income community.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:20.790
Do you have plans to, I guess--

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:22.710
even with the-- well,
let me rephrase that.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.500
It's great for the
low-income community.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.900
However, we know that
there's a digital divide

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.662
in those communities as well.

00:53:28.662 --> 00:53:30.620
So are the-- do you have
plans for your company

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.900
to really penetrate this
market and really reach

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:33.659
these customers?

00:53:33.659 --> 00:53:34.700
TINA SHARKEY: Absolutely.

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:35.780
So I love that question.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.200
Because the thing that I
was saying about-- you said,

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.027
what were some early surprises?

00:53:41.027 --> 00:53:43.610
Because when we launched it, we
just sort of put it out there,

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:44.110
right?

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:45.350
We were like, let's just see.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:47.340
If you build it, they will come.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.540
And they did.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.650
And so we've been hearing
from so many people

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:56.390
across the country that either
were living in food deserts

00:53:56.390 --> 00:54:02.120
where they didn't have access
to organics non-GMOs, et cetera.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.960
Or they couldn't afford
that for their family.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.580
And for their first time,
they're able to afford that,

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.980
and they're able to
have access to it.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:15.320
And the digital divide is not as
bad as the food desert divide.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.620
And so what we're finding
is that the installed base

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.840
of mobile phones
and Wi-Fi networks,

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.500
et cetera is much
broader than the food--

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.140
and deeply penetrated
than access

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:32.370
to quality organic and non-GMO
foods and goods for families.

00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.340
So we totally have plans.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.960
But we're already
executing on those plans.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.940
But we're not done.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.980
I mean, we're going
to go to every town.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:42.740
We're going to drive
what I call the United

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.750
States of Goodness tour.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.660
And go out and
really meet people.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.200
What I would like to do in
those communities is not so much

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.452
offer them Brandless, because
they can get that today.

00:54:54.452 --> 00:54:56.660
What I would like to do is
meet the awesome strangers

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:00.500
that live there and really tell
them that they deserve better.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.990
And really tell them that
they're already awesome.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:05.930
And they shouldn't have
a sense that they're not

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.250
or that they're less than.

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:09.170
Because they're not less than.

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:11.570
And so if everyone
starts to believe

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:14.530
that they deserve better, and
that they're already awesome,

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:16.540
and that they can
afford that, maybe that

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.050
will give them more confidence.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.210
Maybe that will create
a better conversation

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.260
at the dinner table.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.970
Maybe that will help
people sleep better.

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:26.240
I mean, we have nutritionals,
a men's multi-vitamin,

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.940
a woman's multi-vitamin,
melatonin, antioxidants,

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.130
all $3.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:34.340
Access to these things that they
didn't have access to before,

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.530
because they, A,
couldn't afford it,

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.260
B, didn't have a
store near them, or C,

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.360
weren't educated
about the values

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.770
of those types of products,
should be changing now.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.750
But the most important
thing, the business

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:50.450
I would like to be in is
the confidence business.

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.400
Because I don't
care how you voted.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.130
I don't care what your
socioeconomic class is.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:58.940
I don't care what your race,
your religion, any of that.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:55:59.810
You deserve better.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:02.900
And if you strip away all those
layers, and all those targets,

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.870
and all the ways that we have
filtered ourselves as people--

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:08.090
we've forgotten
what we're here for.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:09.830
We're all the same.

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.690
And this country
was built on that.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:14.300
And this company was
built on the idea

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.680
that everyone deserves it.

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.920
And it's not OK
to have a divide.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.870
Whatever's happening
in Washington,

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.760
we can change the system.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.590
But not by going
into the system.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:25.940
By building another system.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.130
I mean, that's what this
company was built on.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.200
And that's what our
company is built on.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.450
We're just trying to change
a different kind of system

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:33.949
and trying to get
back to the values

00:56:33.949 --> 00:56:36.830
that we actually believe
in as human beings.

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.720
We're the human being business.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.210
And all human beings
were created equally.

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:45.290
And this idea that people have
to choose, it's just not OK.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:47.930
But that doesn't mean
everybody has $3.

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:49.900
And so we want to help
those people, too.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.130
And that's why we partner
with Feeding America.

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:54.500
And that's why we're
trying to teach people

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.690
about tangible acts of kindness.

00:56:56.690 --> 00:57:01.597
Because if you just make
eye contact with a stranger,

00:57:01.597 --> 00:57:03.180
maybe that will make
their day better.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.640
And if that makes
their day better,

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.080
maybe they'll work harder.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.210
Or maybe they'll be kinder
to their loved ones.

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:11.540
Or maybe their kids will feel
more inspired and work harder.

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:12.230
Who knows?

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:17.144
But I just think it starts with
a smile, from my perspective.

00:57:17.144 --> 00:57:19.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for coming here.

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.170
I really love the
idea behind Brandless.

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:22.170
TINA SHARKEY: Thank you.

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:25.350
AUDIENCE: So since you like
threes, I have three questions.

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:27.560
But they're more practical ones.

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.540
So the first one
is about products.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:35.050
I understand for more expensive
products like olive oils,

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:39.220
what we discussed, three
means low quantity.

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.880
And this potentially
could mean more waste

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.500
for packaging and
things like that.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.900
Do you have plans to
move, I don't know,

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.480
$13 packages or something?

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:55.630
So that you can get
much more paper rolls,

00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:00.330
or olive oil, or things
like that without more--

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.780
with less damage
to the environment?

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:06.990
And then the other two
questions are about the company.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:16.070
You said you were using phony
names, and emails, and stuff.

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:19.690
When did you
trademark Brandless,

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:23.620
and other related slogans,
and things like that,

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:28.720
so that you didn't tip
off potential incubants?

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:33.190
And the third question
is about the capital,

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:35.230
building the company.

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:38.170
How much did you use
off-the-shelf components,

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:40.630
systems, like putting
things in cloud and things

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.250
like that, to reduce cost on
that since you're building

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:44.300
everything from scratch?

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:44.900
Thank you very much.

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.358
TINA SHARKEY: So
I'm going to try--

00:58:46.358 --> 00:58:48.780
those are three very
unrelated questions.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.330
So I'm going to see how facile
my brain is in the ability

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:53.530
to answer those.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.600
The first question
is about, have we

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.000
thought about limited
waste in our packaging?

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.630
And the answer to that
is unequivocally yes.

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:04.640
You have to remember that we're
only sort of 20 weeks old.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.180
But we are working to
create the most efficient,

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:12.210
just what matters packaging
and sizing whenever we can.

00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:13.940
And so you'd be surprised.

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:15.310
But it's like the little things.

00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:19.720
For example, I remember Rachel,
who's our head merchant,

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.300
and I were talking about
almonds sometime in--

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.290
I don't know, February or March.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.220
And not only did she
source and create

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:29.230
this incredible
assortment of nuts,

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:30.760
and mixers, and all of that.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:37.030
But the almond bag that
you buy, it's resealable.

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:40.270
And so what I love about
that is that you don't have

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:42.040
to eat all of them at once.

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.130
But you don't have to clip it,
or throw it away, or serve it.

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:46.900
You can actually reseal the bag.

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.520
So it's not just about the size.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.537
It's about being
very intentional

00:59:50.537 --> 00:59:52.120
and trying to make
your packaging work

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.980
as hard as it can for you.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.480
That's the first thing.

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.840
The second thing is about--

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.540
you asked-- wait.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.210
First you asked
about the packaging.

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.440
I know the third question
was about the deployment

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.220
of the capital.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.260
Oh, about when we
trademarked Brandless.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.030
So this is a funny story, too.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:16.400
Which is that we trademarked
Brandless way before we ever--

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.260
just when-- even probably before
the seed, when we were just

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.590
incubating the idea.

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.265
And all of our NDAs--

01:00:24.265 --> 01:00:25.640
people that were
working with us,

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.370
both suppliers as well
as potential recruits,

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:31.270
signed these NDAs.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.880
And in the NDA it said
the name Brandless.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.470
And not a single person
actually noticed.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.510
Which I think is
funny, because we

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.900
said that the operating name
of the company was Dosey.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.630
But in the NDA that
people had to sign,

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:49.790
it said Brandless
in the fine print.

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:52.394
And nobody ever said anything,
which-- we just were waiting.

01:00:52.394 --> 01:00:54.810
Because I remember having a
conversation with the lawyers.

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:56.660
No, we can't put
Brandless in the NDA.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.070
We can't disclose.

01:00:58.070 --> 01:00:59.690
And it turned out
that we had to.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.480
Because it was the real
company that you were in

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.950
non-disclosure with.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:05.460
Nobody ever saw it.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.880
And the third question was
about the use of proceeds,

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.470
and how we broke
down the budget,

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.140
and what we're using for
cloud computing versus--

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.270
I didn't get that last part.

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.410
Off-the-shelf components.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.740
So that's a fantastic
question, too.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.680
Because we could have
probably launched earlier if

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.570
we had gone with Shopify
or some sort of a turnkey.

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:31.400
But we really felt that in order
to build the kind of community

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.090
where we really owned
all of our data,

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.500
and that that data
belonged to our ability

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.830
to be able to create the
most remarkable experiences,

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:45.770
and that even if we were sort
of MVP, it was better to be MVP

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:55.580
and to have the kind of owned
solutions on the core data

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.710
and architecture of
what we were building.

01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:01.040
And then when it came to
ESPs, and other places

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.300
around email scaling,
and other things

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.605
like that, that we could
work with third parties.

01:02:08.605 --> 01:02:10.730
And we didn't have to build
those things ourselves.

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:14.070
But when it came to things that
were core to the experience,

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:17.000
those we felt we
really needed to own.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.370
And so we made a
decision, build by license

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:20.656
on sort of every aperture.

01:02:20.656 --> 01:02:21.780
And we continue to do that.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.613
JORGE CUETO: What about
on the product side?

01:02:23.613 --> 01:02:26.340
Off-the-shelf products that
then you brand as Brandless?

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.670
Do you do any of that as well?

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.470
TINA SHARKEY: Well,
there is no such thing

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:31.700
as an off-the-shelf product.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.500
I would say that
in the case of what

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.020
is a proprietary
formulation, when

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:40.710
it comes to organic brown sugar,
organic flour, organic sugar,

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:44.240
organic oregano, there's not
a lot of formulation that's

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.020
happening there.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:48.110
So it's like the packaging
and the just what matters.

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:53.120
When it comes to sort of
things where we are co-creating

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.330
and co-formulating
with our partners,

01:02:56.330 --> 01:03:01.700
we look at everything
on a case by case basis.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.497
JORGE CUETO: Great.

01:03:02.497 --> 01:03:04.080
Well, thank you,
everyone, for coming.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.150
It was great to have you, Tina.

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:06.150
TINA SHARKEY: Thank you.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.500
