[music playing]

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.540
COREY: We got a call
at the pawn shop.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.540
Somebody had a old vintage
Donkey Kong arcade game.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.880
It's a video game.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.330
Chum's my sidekick.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.500
Might as well bring him with me.
- Come on in.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.880
This is my weird media room.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.710
And, you know, this
is Donkey Kong.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.330
But as you can see,
it doesn't really

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.080
fit the motif of the room
with the killer clowns.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.580
We got a dead pig
carcass on the ground.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.040
We got Ouija boards.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.580
And then we have Donkey Kong.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.330
Definitely a little odd.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.420
JASON: I do have
some sentimental

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.380
value with the game.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.420
I mean, it's a neat piece.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.920
It's a good conversation piece.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.920
I just need to get
something that makes more

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.500
sense in my room of horror.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Donkey Kong's just not
scary enough for me.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670
COREY: So where'd you
end up getting it?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.420
JASON: My company is
partners with Circus Circus.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.250
We lease out their theme park.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.210
I was begging and pleading
with them one day.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.080
And they finally agreed
to sell me a couple games.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.670
And this was one of
the games they sold me.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.420
COREY: Oh, wow.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.170
I mean, just the history of the
game itself-- before his name

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.040
was Super Mario, before he was a
plumber, his name was Jump Man.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.420
And that was his pet gorilla.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.500
And that was his girlfriend.
JASON: Really?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.960
Yeah.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.580
And then one day, the
gorilla got pissed off,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.120
kidnapped his girlfriend,
and I guess started

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.750
throwing barrels at him.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.040
He had to jump over the
barrels and climb the ladders

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.460
to get up and save her.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.460
CHUMLEE: One of the most
influential games ever--

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.580
started the Mario Bros, boosted
Nintendo to what it is today.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.960
I had no idea.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.710
I just knew it was a cool game.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.290
COREY: So can we play it?
Can we check it out?

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.920
Yeah.
[game beeping]

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.080
CHUMLEE: You know you're
supposed to jump, right?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080
COREY: No idea that
you had to jump, Chum.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.540
CHUMLEE: Lame.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.790
COREY: Shut up, Chum.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.290
All right.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.120
Tell me, man, what are
you looking to do with it?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120
I'd like to keep it, but
my house is only so big.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.670
COREY: What are you
looking to get out of it?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.670
I'd like to get
$2,500 out of it.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.790
It is in great shape, though.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.290
I'll give you this.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.500
I don't know if Donkey
Kong is the actual arcade

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.420
game people are looking to get.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.830
Let me have a friend
of mine come over,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.330
check it out, see what
he thinks it's worth.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.790
JASON: Sure.
- Do me a favor.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.750
Go call Nick.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.920
Yep.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.080
I'm gonna stay
here and play it.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.790
JASON: I'm actually
welcoming an expert

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.830
today because I want to know
some stuff about the game, too.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.670
And I want to make sure that
it is all really original.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.170
COREY: I really want
to get Nick down here

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.330
and make sure it's not a
bootleg because sometimes,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.750
when these things are
too good to be true,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.420
they most of the time are.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.500
NICK KOVALEVSKY:
Well, here It is.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.120
Wow.
- Yeah.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.420
It took a lot of my lunch
money back in high school.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.080
CHUMLEE: Good ole Donkey Kong.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.790
NICK KOVALEVSKY: Yeah, this
is the game that gave Namco

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.040
a run for its money because
Namco was the king in America

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.540
with Pac-Man.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.880
And then when Shigeru
Miyamoto came out with this,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.710
Nintendo basically
conquered America

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.120
with selling just as many of
this as they did as Pac-Man.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.170
There's a lot of bootlegs and
reproductions of this game.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.290
But what's really going to
matter about as far as value

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.540
goes is if it's all original.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.040
Well, do your work.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.460
NICK KOVALEVSKY: All righty.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.040
CHUMLEE: What are
you looking for?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.710
NICK KOVALEVSKY: Well, I'm
looking for serial numbers.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.330
And I'm looking for a TKG
serial number on the board

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.210
because that makes a difference
on whether it's a bootleg

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.710
or if it's a real Donkey Kong.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.540
I have your answer.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.040
This is an original
Donkey Kong cabinet.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.830
Nice.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.250
COREY: So what's
it worth, retail?

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.750
NICK KOVALEVSKY: OK.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.420
Because it's original,
and the board's original,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.170
it's got an original monitor,
and an original joystick,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.420
and they are sought after
in original condition--

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.250
somewhere between $600 to $800.
- That's it?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.500
NICK KOVALEVSKY: That's it.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.000
Not quite what
you're looking for.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.380
CHUMLEE: No.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.210
NICK KOVALEVSKY: They
made a lot of these.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.210
It's not rare.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.920
Nick, thanks a lot, man.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.500
You're welcome.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.750
There's really not much
market for video arcade games

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.670
because most of the
people nowadays, they're

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.080
looking for, you know, 60 to 400
games packed into one cabinet.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.120
COREY: All right, man, so this
is always a tough one for me

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.290
because you wanted $2,500.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.960
On a good day, retail
is going to be $800.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.120
I mean, I could offer
you $300 for it.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.460
JASON: No.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.920
COREY: I've got to
double my money.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.960
If I went up to $400, would
it change your mind at all?

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.960
JASON: No.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.290
No.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.540
It's too cool a piece
to sell for $400.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.380
I wouldn't be able to do it.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.080
I totally 100%
understand, my man.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.080
Thanks a lot.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.580
I hope you find room for it.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.540
JASON: The offer was way
lower than I thought.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.580
So, you know, I get to
keep the Donkey Kong game.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
And, you know, better
luck next time.
