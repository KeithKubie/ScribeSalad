00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.240
Everyone fantasizes about the glamor and glitz
that comes with being an actor. The stardom,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.270
the seven-figure paychecks, and romantic relationships
that blossom with your co-stars but sometimes

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.160
being an actor isn’t so glamorous. Some
actors sacrifice more than they should, taking

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.210
it as far as putting their lives in danger
just for a chance at winning that illustrious

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.369
Oscar gold.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.449
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Actors
Who Took Their Movie Roles Way Too Far.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.500
Robert De Niro in Cape Fear

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.430
When Martin Scorsese cast Robert De Niro as
a psychopathic rapist in his 1991 remake of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.050
the same name, “Cape Fear” he knew he
would get an amazing performance. De Niro

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.600
already worked as a taxi driver for twelve-hour
days for weeks to prepare for Scorsese’s

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.450
“Taxi Driver.” So it was no surprise to
the director with the extremes De Niro took

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.640
to prepare for this role. De Niro paid a dentist
$20,000 to grind and stain his teeth to look

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.360
like a man who was in prison for years. The
role won him Oscar and Golden Globe nominations

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:33.840
giving the actor a wide grin.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.530
Rooney Mara in The Girl with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Dragon
Tattoo

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.889
David Fincher asked Rooney Mara to change
her body to fit the character of antisocial,

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.749
hostile Lisbeth Salander in 2011’s “The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.” He put her

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.630
on a strict diet and asked her to live in
Stockholm on her own for weeks before production

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.819
began. He even had her dye her hair black,
chop down her long bangs and bleach her eyebrows

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.841
white. What she did on her own was add numerous
piercings to her body to get more into the

00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:14.430
character. Her eyebrow, nose, lips and even
her nipple! That’s dedication.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.170
Christian Bale in The Machinist

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.640
It’s hard to believe that the muscle toned
Christian Bale in the Batman Trilogy is the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.240
same man in 2004’s “The Machinist”.
Bale lost over 63 pounds for his role in the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.370
psychological thriller that nearly cost him
his life. He lost another 20 pounds from what

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.239
his nutritionist said was safe and wanted
to loose another 5 but was told he would die

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.220
if he did. He survived off eating one apple
and a can of tuna fish daily for weeks leading

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.379
up to shooting. To make matters worse, he
smoked cigarettes to curve his hunger in this

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.670
8.2 million dollar grossing flop.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.709
Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.230
Billy Bob Thornton felt that he had a lot
to prove in his directorial debut with 1996’s

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.360
“Sling Blade”. The American drama film
set in rural Arkansas is lead by main character

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.269
Karl Childers, an intellectually disabled
man played by Thornton. Thornton immersed

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.950
himself into the role causing many filmgoers
not to recognize him on screen. To achieve

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.640
his characters peculiar shuffle, Thornton
added broken pieces of glass to his shoes

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.209
to ensure continuity throughout shooting.
Giving a new meaning the word, “Cut!”

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.110
on set.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.290
Natalie Portman in Black Swan

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.739
Natalie Portman took herself from actress
to believable ballerina for her role in “Black

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.609
Swan”, by doing extensive workouts. Portman
said, "We usually started by swimming a mile

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.090
a day, doing the front crawl and breast stroke.
Then we'd do two hours of ballet exercises

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.730
and resistance work." This was not her only
form of preparation, she even held to a stringent

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.209
diet to accomplish the figure she required
in her Oscar winning role.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.439
Daniel Day-Lewis in The Crucible

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:55.530
We all know of the irregular ways Daniel Day-Lewis
prepares for his roles but 1996’s “The

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.680
Crucible” might be the oddest. To prepare
for the role of 17th-century farmer John Proctor,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.219
Day-Lewis spent the summer before filming
on location at Hog Island, northern Massachusetts.

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:10.000
He rode into work on a brown horse, lived
without running water or electricity and helped

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.969
build the sets for the production. He even
ditched the power tools of today and used

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.640
the tools of the 17th century.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.750
Halle Berry in Jungle Fever

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.690
The talented Halle Berry has always been a
gifted actress but was over shadowed by her

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.090
stunning looks for many years. Before winning
in Oscar in 2001’s “Monster Ball” she

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.810
garnered her first critical fame in 1991’s
“Jungle Fever”. The director couldn’t

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.340
see past her looks and felt she was too attractive
for the role as a crack addictive prostitute

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.000
that lived on the streets. So during her 10
days of filming she never bathed or showered

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.210
to help portray the dirt her character lived
in. This triggered her to apologize to her

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.229
co-stars those last days of shooting but she
proved her talents and quieted her director.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.650
Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:03.200
Heath Ledger knew that the Joker wasn’t
a character he that could easily get into

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.400
and even reached out to Jack Nicholson for
help. Nicholson told him that he’d go crazy

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.660
reaching the levels he needed to for the role.
Ledger locked himself into a hotel room for

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.770
four weeks with no contact to the outside
world to prepare. He wrote in a personal diary

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.780
in which he wrote really insane things and
slept for only 2 hours per day.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.080
Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.680
Margot Robbie is quickly becoming on of Hollywood’s
most bankable stars but if acting doesn’t

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.599
work out maybe she can use her new skill as
an Olympic swimmer. Robbie learned to hold

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.020
her breath underwater for over five minutes
to perform a fight scene in “Suicide Squad”.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.460
The actress was competitive with her stunt
double and wanted to prove her mad skills.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.800
Luckily she stopped at five minutes and went
on to finish some other crazy scenes alongside

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800
Jared Leto.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.800
Shia LaBeouf in Fury

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.800
Here is one time an actor joined the US National
Guard and joined a religion to prepare for

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800
a movie. Director David Ayer told his cast
he needed his actors to give him their all

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
for 2012’s “Fury. They did, but Shia LaBeouf
went the furthest. He went as far as to cut

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800
his face numerous times and even got a tattoo
to give a more realistic portrayal on screen.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
That’s not where the actor stopped, he also
had a tooth removed and he kept his personal

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800
hygiene to a bare minimum. Ayer loved this
dedication and even had his actors’ fist

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800
fighting on set every day.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800
