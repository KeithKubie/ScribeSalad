00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.220
Whitaker it was teaching and I didn't
really know that that was a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230
really know that that was a
 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.749
really know that that was a
research-based class I didn't know much

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759
research-based class I didn't know much
 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.099
research-based class I didn't know much
about it except that it was associated

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109
about it except that it was associated
 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.439
about it except that it was associated
with the Lunar XPrize project and they

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449
with the Lunar XPrize project and they
 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.390
with the Lunar XPrize project and they
showed me the different Rovers and what

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400
showed me the different Rovers and what
 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.700
showed me the different Rovers and what
the mission was all about and I was so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710
the mission was all about and I was so
 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.549
the mission was all about and I was so
excited I had to get involved somehow

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559
excited I had to get involved somehow
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.410
excited I had to get involved somehow
and then just by sitting through the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420
and then just by sitting through the
 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.020
and then just by sitting through the
class a project was formed so I'm

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030
class a project was formed so I'm
 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.520

working on optical orbit determination

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530
working on optical orbit determination
 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.630
working on optical orbit determination
so what that involves when the lander is

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640
so what that involves when the lander is
 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.810
so what that involves when the lander is
orbiting the moon we want to figure out

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820
orbiting the moon we want to figure out
 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.810
orbiting the moon we want to figure out
what that orbit is and where we are in

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820
what that orbit is and where we are in
 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.900
what that orbit is and where we are in
that orbit so we want to do this just

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910
that orbit so we want to do this just
 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.020
that orbit so we want to do this just
based on imagery on pictures taken from

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030
based on imagery on pictures taken from
 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.169
based on imagery on pictures taken from
a camera on the lander the big goal is

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179
a camera on the lander the big goal is
 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.530
a camera on the lander the big goal is
to have the entire mission be optically

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540
to have the entire mission be optically
 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.720
to have the entire mission be optically
based so just be able to determine where

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730
based so just be able to determine where
 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.910
based so just be able to determine where
you are from launch to landing just

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
you are from launch to landing just
 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.340
you are from launch to landing just
based on imagery from cameras so that's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350
based on imagery from cameras so that's
 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.830
based on imagery from cameras so that's
the big goal and I'm going to continue

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840
the big goal and I'm going to continue
 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.400
the big goal and I'm going to continue
that and hopefully see it flying 2014

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410
that and hopefully see it flying 2014
 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.780
that and hopefully see it flying 2014
this is an idea that could revolutionize

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
this is an idea that could revolutionize
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.220
this is an idea that could revolutionize
the way that planetary missions occur

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230
the way that planetary missions occur
 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.340
the way that planetary missions occur
the idea of cameras only

from the orbit around Earth to an orbit
 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.470
from the orbit around Earth to an orbit
around the moon so that we call that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480
around the moon so that we call that
 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.960

for any sort of presentation is to take

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500
for any sort of presentation is to take
 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.470
for any sort of presentation is to take
your slides and try to explain the whole

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480
your slides and try to explain the whole

intimidating than I had originally

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
intimidating than I had originally
 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.670

thought I took all of those slide

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
thought I took all of those slide
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.400

added in my new results kind of put it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
added in my new results kind of put it
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.350
added in my new results kind of put it
into context a little bit more it

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360
into context a little bit more it
 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.150
into context a little bit more it
provided me the opportunity to share my

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
provided me the opportunity to share my
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.510
