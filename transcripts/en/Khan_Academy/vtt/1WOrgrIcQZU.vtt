00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.610
Let's say that I have a
huge, maybe frozen over lake,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.080
or maybe it's a big pond.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.750
So I have a huge surface of
ice over here-- my best attempt

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.830
to draw a flat surface
of ice-- and I'm

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.710
going to put two
blocks of ice here.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.650
So I'm going to put
one block of ice

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.814
just like this, one block
of ice right over here.

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:23.980
And then I'm going to put
another block of ice right

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.220
over here.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.490
And then another block
of ice right over here.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.510
And these blocks of
ice are identical.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.230
They're both 5 kilograms.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.280
They are both 5 kilograms--
let me write this down.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.490
So they are both 5 kilograms.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.310
Or both of their masses, I
should say, are 5 kilograms.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.700
And the only difference
between the two

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.620
is that relative to
the pond, this one

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.120
is stationary-- this
one is stationary--

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.310
and this one is moving
with a constant velocity--

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.745
constant velocity.

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:06.460
Constant velocity in the
right-wards direction.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.950
And let's say that
its constant velocity

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.890
is at 5 meters per second--
5 meters per second.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.164
And the whole reason why I made
blocks of ice on top of ice

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.330
is that we're going to
assume, at least for the sake

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.540
of this video, that
friction is negligible.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.360
Now what does Newton's
First Law of Motion

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.590
tell us about something that
is either not in motion--

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.440
or you could view this as
a constant velocity of 0--

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.314
or something that has
a constant velocity?

00:01:35.314 --> 00:01:36.730
Well Newton's First
Law says, well

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.180
look, they're going to keep
their constant velocity

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.930
or stay stationary, which is
the constant velocity of 0,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.110
unless there is some
unbalance, unless there

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.774
is some net force
acting on an object.

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:51.190
So let's just think
about it here.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.850
In either of these
situations, there

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.140
must not be any unbalanced
force acting on them.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.532
Or their must not
be any net force.

00:01:58.532 --> 00:01:59.990
But if you think
about it, if we're

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.280
assuming that these
things are on Earth,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.830
there is a net force
acting on both of them.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.780
Both of them are at the
surface of the Earth,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.949
and they both have
mass, so there

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.460
will be the force of
gravity acting downwards

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.900
on both of them.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.140
There is going to be the
downward force of gravity

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.630
on both of these blocks of ice.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.810
And that downward force of
gravity, the force of gravity,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.540
is going to be equal to
the gravitational field

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.910
near the surface of the
Earth, times-- which

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.220
is a vector-- times
the mass of the object.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.050
So times 5 kilograms.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.040
This right over here is 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.290
So you multiply that times 5.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.000
You get 49 kilogram meter
per second squared, which

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.080
is the same thing as 49 newtons.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.670
So this is a little bit
of a conundrum here.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.490
Newton's First Law
says, an object at rest

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.250
will stay at rest, or
an object in motion

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.610
will stay in motion, unless
there is some unbalanced,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.580
or unless there
is some net force.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.340
But based on what
we've drawn right here,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.320
it looks like there's
some type of a net force.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.780
It looks like I have 49 newtons
of force pulling this thing

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.740
downwards.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.900
But you say, no, no no, Sal.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.860
Obviously this thing won't
start accelerating downwards

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.200
because there's ice here.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.640
Its resting on a big
pool of frozen water.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.930
And so my answer to you is,
well, if that's your answer,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.350
then what is the resulting
force that cancels out

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.990
with gravity to keep
these blocks of ice,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.600
either one of them,
from plummeting down

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.320
to the core of the Earth?

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.610
From essentially
going into free fall,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.240
or accelerating towards
the center of the Earth?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.210
And you say, well, I guess if
these things would be falling,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.400
if not for the ice,
the ice must be

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.420
providing the
counteracting force.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.630
And you are absolutely correct.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.390
The ice is providing
the counteracting force

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.750
in the opposite direction.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.839
So the exact magnitude
of force, and it

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.220
is in the opposite direction.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.730
And so if the force of gravity
on each of these blocks of ice

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.690
are 49 newtons downwards
it is completely

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.150
netted off by the force of
the ice on the block upwards.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.560
And that will be a force 49
newtons upwards in either case.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.320
And now, hopefully,
it makes sense

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.650
that Newton's First
Law still holds.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.100
We have no net force on this
in the vertical direction,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.810
actually no net force on
this in either direction.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.740
That's why this guy
has a 0 velocity

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.140
in the horizontal direction.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.010
This guy has a constant velocity
in the horizontal direction.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.570
And neither of them
are accelerating

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.970
in the vertical direction.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.520
Because you have the force
of the ice on the block,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.470
the ice is supporting
the block, that's

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.920
completely
counteracting gravity.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.740
And this force, in this example,
is called the normal force.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.570
This is the normal force--
it's 49 newtons upwards.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.040
This right here is
the normal force.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.150
And we'll talk more about the
normal force in future videos.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.610
The normal force
is the force, when

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.380
anything is resting
on any surface that's

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.630
perpendicular to that surface.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.463
And it's going to start
to matter a lot when

00:05:27.463 --> 00:05:29.692
we start thinking about
friction and all the rest.

00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:32.150
So what we'll see in future
videos, when you have something

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.220
on an incline, and let's say
I have a block on an incline

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.120
like this.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.440
The normal force
from the, I guess

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.080
you could say, this
wedge on the block,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.364
is going to be perpendicular
to the surface.

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.530
And if you really think
about what's happening here,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.760
it's fundamentally an
electromagnetic force.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.080
Because if you really zoomed
in on the molecules of the ice

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.590
right over here, even better
the atoms of the ice here.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.840
And you really zoomed in on
the atoms or the molecules

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.320
of the ice up here, what's
keeping this top block of ice

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.030
from falling down
is that in order

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.480
for it to go through its
molecules would have to kind

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.070
of compress against, or I guess
it would have to get closer

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.420
to, the water molecules
or the individual atoms

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.530
in this ice down here.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.720
And the atoms, let me
draw it on an atomic level

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.890
right over here.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:33.300
So maybe, let me draw one
of this guy's molecules.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.044
So you have an oxygen
with 2 hydrogens

00:06:40.044 --> 00:06:41.710
and it forms this big
lattice structure.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.980
And we can talk about more of
that in the chemistry playlist.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.880
And let's talk about this ice
as one of these molecules.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.500
So maybe it looks
something like this.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.810
And it has its 2 hydrogens

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.710
And so what's keeping these guys
from getting compressed, what's

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.200
keeping this block of ice
from going down further,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.330
is the repulsion between the
electrons in this molecule

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.950
and the electrons
in that molecule.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.570
So on a macro level we view
this is kind of a contact force.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.110
But on a microscopic
level, on an atomic level,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.870
it's really just electromagnetic
repulsion at work.
