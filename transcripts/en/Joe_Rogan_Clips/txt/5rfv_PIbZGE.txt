Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Um, there, there's a real thought, and this is something that turns Mckenna described way back in the late nineties, early two thousands. He believed that you're going to be able to recreate a lot of psychedelic states through virtual reality so that people that don't want to actually do a drug will be an ideal experience. What it's like to be on that drug and that, I mean, that's, it's very theoretical and hypothetical and yes, you know, who knows whether or not that's possible, but that, that could be one other way that human beings interface with technology. So humans, in my view, are far more hackable than we think that, that there are so many that we just imagine our biology is being fixed, but our biology is really variable. Like I have a, a friend, um, who is an anesthesiologist at Stanford and she's done this experimentation of just running just like very mild electric currents through people's brains.

Speaker 1:          01:03          And people have these very real experiences and whether it's arousal or something that it's, that you're, you're entering people's minds through different ways. So you talk about, uh, that virtual reality when we are entering a world where the pixelation of virtual reality will be equal to life. And so you're going to be in this VR space and it just, it will look, it may smell, it could even with haptic suits, it may feel just like life and our brains, I don't know if you've done these things with the, these um, uh, these, uh, VR glasses where you go and you can see people, you're just like in a, in a hall and the put on the glasses and now you're in an elevator going to the, the top on the outside, like a window cleaners elevator to the top of this, um, highrise and there's a little rickety board.

Speaker 1:          01:55          And then there's this cat at the end of the board and they're saying, yeah, you have to go, go save the cat. And you've already seen that. You're just in a hall. You know it in your brain. Um, there's this cat. Everybody's looking at you and you've seen all these other people panic. And when I'm there I'm going to be, so I'm just going to go grab that cat. And you're terrified. Like you're trying to override your lizard brain and your lizard brain saying like, no, don't step on this. Love that for HTC vive. Yeah, yeah, we have, we need to set that up Jim. And we need a two by four we put on the ground floor. It's incredible. And so I think that this whole concept of reality is like that our technology is going to be changing our sense of reality. And then what's real like if you feel arousal in your brain because of an electric currents or you feel it because you're with your girlfriend or wife or reading a magazine or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Is that different? Is One real and one not real? And I think that this, there's real big issues here. I mean that is the Matrix, right? Yeah. I mean the idea that, and if it feels better and it's more enjoyable than real life, what is going to stop people from doing the Ray Kurzweil deal and downloading yourself into this, this dimension? Well, and not much. Whether it's possible to do a full download or not. Right? I think that's an open question, but whether people are going to be more comfortable living in these alternative worlds and whether we're booked, we're going to be able to say, oh no, that is the fake world. Like if you're in this virtual world, right, but your do you have friends in that world, you're interacting in that world. You have experiences that feel every bit as real in that world as in our world and people say, oh no, that's not real.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Those, those aren't your friends. Like even now, like you know, we all people with global lives, you kind of have these friends, like I have a good friend in Mongolia, we talk all the time. Do you ever see them in person once in a while, like once every year or two? It's great to see him. That's a real person though. Real. That's someone you actually know. It was a control plane that you actually do know him. But if it was someone that you only talk to online and they lived in Mongolia, that's where things get weird. It's true. But let's just say hypothetically that hypothetical, you have that person, they're part of your whole life and you're there with you. They're with you through your life experiences. You call them up when you're sad. Like is it so essential that you've met that person physically?

Speaker 1:          04:21          Like is that the core of what it means to be someone's friend that you is not essential, but it means a lot. It does. And I, and so I, I mean because we are not like we are these physical beings and we are these virtual beings, but figuring out what's the balance is going to be really tricky. Yeah. What is the balance like what I'm worried about augmented reality too. Cause I, you know, when you see people that you snapchat filters and give themselves dog ears and stuff like that, like yeah. Well how long before that is just something that people choose to turn on or turn off about life itself. Yeah. Like you'll be able to see the world through different lenses. The Sky could be a different color than plants. Could be a different color. May write about this in one of my novels, Eternal Sonata, um, where I think we're just going to have these contact lenses and I'm, and it'll be different kinds of information based on what people want.

Speaker 1:          05:14          I mean, like I'll meet with you and it'll say, all right, this is Joe, here's a little bit of background, whatever, and we'll have useful information. Or you're walking around a city and he'll be, get little alerts of things that you might do or, or history. And so I think that that's what they were thinking about with Google glasses, right? Yeah, I know, but he just was so annoying that people wanted to kill people too weird. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was just too, everybody felt like they were getting filmed too. They were, yeah. I mean, when you're walking around with Google glasses on, you assume that people recording everything. It was very strange. They were. But I think that's another thing that we're just, all of our lives are going to be recorded. Of course. Yeah. Now, do you think that that's going to come in the form of a contact lens or do you think it's going to come in the form of like ski goggles you're going to put on and see the world through the ones to look like an idiot.

Speaker 1:          06:00          And so in the beginning, in the beginning, all these, you talked about Michael Douglas with these or like my favorite one is um, is Kurt Russell in escape from New York? What do you have there? It's like, it's like this really cool tech. Like he finally gets out of this Manhattan Hell and he's got this phone and it's like this big and it's pre cell phone is free. It's like very, very early days. And so you know, now we have these kind of glasses and there's like a little bit of a little bit of cachet but all I'm has a cell phone that's that big. It'd be seen that no, I was at the Verizon store. Yeah, I think it was like an attachment. Earnest. An accessory to a phone. Yeah. You can bring it with you intervention, find, not bring your other phone. That's the idea behind it.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Yeah, so like you could decide, well, I'm going out, let me just bring my tiny phone for essentials, all this tiny, I mean the phones are going to get quote unquote, phones are just going to get so smart. So I say they're going to come inside of it. So you'll have like a little contact lens, maybe a little thing in your ear, maybe like a little permanent implant in your, you'd behind your tooth or one of your teeth to replace a tooth with a computer, you know, pipe it right into your nerves. Any kind of crazy stuff you can think of that it's probably going to happen. And some of it, some people take, some of them won't, right? Yeah, right. Yeah. It seems like that's what we're going to have to see. Like how it plays out. Yeah. That's one of the things when you were talking about scientists that are working on these things, they're working on what's right in front of them.

Speaker 1:          07:20          They're not looking at the greater landscape itself in terms of what the future holds. It's not their job. And that's why we need other people. And I certainly see myself or those people. You and who else, who would you elect Trump came to you and said, Jamie, we've got problems. We need to figure out the future. What should we do? So we'll certainly, and we need to have a mix of different kinds of people. And so I, I'm certainly people like me who are kind of big picture futurists. We need that. We need scientists. I work with some really incredible sign. I did an event at Harvard last week with George Church who is kind of like the Living Charles Darwin Davidson Claire, who you know, has been on this program is a friend of mine working on, on life extension. Um, and we need people just from all backgrounds.

Speaker 1:          08:03          And so like I would say like, we need people, we need poor people, we need people from developing world. We need all kinds of people. But in terms of the people who are kind of articulating the big picture of the world and what are the challenges that we're facing, I certainly put myself in that category. People like Yuval Noah Harari, who were just kinda big, also kind of big thinkers, people like Sid Mukherjee Am. I just think we have to articulate the big picture and we have to do it in a way so that people can see themselves in this story and then, and then enter into the conversation.
