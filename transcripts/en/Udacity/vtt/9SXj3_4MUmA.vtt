00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That means, in our garble table we'll have our outputs encrypted with different keys

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
corresponding to inputs that corresponds to that output value.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Of course, we can't send that whole table. That would reveal the values of a0 and b0.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We need to remove this part of the table.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then we need to randomly permute the order of these entries.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The other thing will do is add some padding.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That means after the garbling we'll have a table that's looks like this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Because each of these values is encrypted with a different key,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the evaluator can't tell which one is which.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The evaluator still needs to be able to decrypt these to produce the right output.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The question is how does the evaluator know what the output of that truth table is?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The evaluator could try decrypting all the entries and pick the one that seems correct.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The evaluator could try decrypting all the entries using the input value keys known to the evaluator,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and use the one that decrypts to something of the form pad concatenated with x,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and then use this value as the output, or it is not possible

00:00:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
based on what the evaluator knows.
