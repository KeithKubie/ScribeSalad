00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.830
- We always love the opportunity
to help out our community

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.210
so when we got a
call to do up a truck

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.540
to benefit our local YMCA,
man, we were all over this.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.330
We wanted to put our own
special spin on this truck, so

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.500
with Ryan's absolutely
insanely gorgeous paint job,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.620
right down to that had
turned silver leafing.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.290
this truck's a winner
right off the bat.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.000
But I kind of figured the
best accessory for this truck

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.920
would be a matching
custom chopper.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.380
I had Shannon build the
coolest little chop that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.420
not only matches
this truck perfectly,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.540
but it actually fits
in the bed of the truck

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.330
with the bed closed.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.210
Now, the cats who don't donated
this truck, Greg and Terry,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.040
they don't know anything
about this chop.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.580
So we're getting
ready to show off

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.210
the truck with the extra
added surprise in the back.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.170
I'm honored that you
asked us to do this.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.880
This is a double win for
whoever lays down the money,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.420
because they're going to do
something positive for the Y,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.500
and then they're going
to have a cool vehicle.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
So thank you for
trusting us with this.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.000
You guys ready to see this?
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.880
Yeah.
- Oh, boy.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.540
Let's do this.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.250
Here she comes.
- Wow.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.330
First notice how she sits.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.210
Look at the shine.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.250
Wow.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.080
- Look at that shine.
- Wow.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.460
Absolutely.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.210
Look at that.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960
Before we could even
think about the paint,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.120
we first had to make sure this
baby sat and sounded right.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.920
So we lowered her
down, and added

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.620
some custom 20 inch wheels and
a full custom exhaust system.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.620
Then Ryan went berserk
on the paint job,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.960
with satin black graphics
separated by orange pinstripes

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.290
and hand turned
silver leafing all up

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.210
and down the sides of his baby.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.620
He also added in some
very subtle YMCA graphics,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.250
so whoever is lucky
enough to win this beaut

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.040
will always remember the awesome
cause that they helped out.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.960
Now, let's get down to the
pretty side of this thing.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.790
Ryan and the paint
team went berserk

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.250
with some beautiful
literally hand

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.830
turned silver leafing There
is real silver leafing all

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.330
over this truck, and
every one of those

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.790
is turned by that
thumb, brother,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.330
just sat their and hand turned.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.670
And bro, there's some
special touches on here

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.920
specifically with you in mind,
that Ryan really went off on.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.290
I mean, OK, right here.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.460
Like you said, the truck
is not a billboard,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.920
but there is your YMCA logo.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.330
It's awesome.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.670
Now, come around the
back with me, brother.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.330
All right.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.920
Because there's something--
there's something important

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.620
back here that again, Ryan
took the time to dig back

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.420
and you found a vintage logo--

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.670
The original logo.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.000
The original YMCA logo.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.210
Oh, look at that, yeah.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.830
And then updated
it for us here.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.710
That's awesome.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.710
Isn't that beautiful?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.790
Dude, you know what I
just noticed though too?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.290
Oh, did we leave
that back there?

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.790
It's not like us to
leave stuff in the back

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.540
of a truck like this.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.620
No, no, it's not.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.880
It's not like us to leave--

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.380
It's kind of weird.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.380
Yeah, we apologize for
just leaving stuff around.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.670
Although, this would be helpful.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.540
It may be a little
accessory that we

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.210
added to this beautiful truck.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.040
Where is Shannon?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.040
Oh, you got to be kidding.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.000
Oh, my gosh.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.540
Look at that bike.
Wow.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.710
What do you think, fellas?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.710
Good lord, look at that.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.830
That is a work of art, man.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.750
Yeah.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.080
Wow.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.580
Is that cool.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.710
Package huh?

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.710
OK, so--

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.170
That's how you accessorize.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.420
- That's quite an accessory.
- Check it out.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.540
Wander around.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.330
It's all gone in
the same flavors

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
as the truck, the
wheels, the paint.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.420
Everything about it.
- My gosh.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.500
Same paint.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.750
Same paint.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.750
It looks like Ryan
was busy on this.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.080
Look at that air cleaner.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.540
The YMCA cover.
Wow.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.420
You know, Danny,
I'm not a bike guy,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.670
but this bike makes me
want to get on and ride.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.170
I mean, this is just gorgeous.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.500
The wheels on this bike
match the wheels on the truck.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.540
And now, I firmly believe
that when this rolls up

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.580
on the block, you
guys have got quite

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.380
the setup here to go together.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.790
I just see hands
going everywhere.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.880
- Oh.
- Everywhere.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.580
Absolutely.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.790
You dig it?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.960
Look at the logo
here on the tank.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.250
I just caught that.
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.460
Again, nice, subtle--
- Nice, subtle.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.460
--tasteful, classy touches.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.380
Really well done, Ryan.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.960
That is very, very cool.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.880
If you guys don't mind if
we show off a little bit,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.460
we're going to actually put
it in the truck right now,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.790
and show you how this whole
package is going to look.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.460
You're going to
have to grab the tire,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.790
because we're going have to
pick the back of the ramp up.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.790
Kev, you and I will
pick up the ramp.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.250
- Yeah.
- Grab the tire.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.210
Just roll the tire.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.290
OK, go in.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.250
You've got the bars?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.210
I got it.
I got it.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.920
You got the bars?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.620
Yeah, got it.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.920
Nice job, guys.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.120
Wow, it does truly
fit in the bed, huh?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.960
How about that?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.540
Fits like a glove.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.420
I'd say so.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.290
Man.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.080
Closed.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.790
Wow.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.000
Done.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.750
You guys way exceeded
my expectations.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.460
This is very, very cool.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.420
I am so glad that Greg and
Terry not only love the truck,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.120
but they love the bike, as well.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.170
And I know that
this beautiful setup

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.330
is going to fetch good dollars
at this upcoming auction.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.670
Can't wait to see this
baby come up on the block.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.750
- Thanks so much, guys.
- Thanks, guys.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.120
Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.670
- Greg--
- Danny, thank you so much, man.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.670
--appreciate it, my brother.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.670
Thank you.
