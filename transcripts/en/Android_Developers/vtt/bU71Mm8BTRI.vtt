[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.690
MESHACK ALLOYS: Same
is a Kenyan company.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.869
We connect customers
and logistics providers.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.660
What we've done
differently is figuring out

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.980
the last mile logistics,
which is a problem in most

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.950
developing countries.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.770
I mean, we don't have
things like addresses here.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.520
JASON ROGENA: Being
able to use technology

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.370
to solve a problem that
really nobody has been

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.900
able to solve in this region is
probably the most exciting bit.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.520
Sendy has two Android
apps, one for the customers

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.720
and one for the drivers.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.346
The great thing
about Sendy is you're

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:43.960
able to drop pins for your
pick up and drop off locations.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.330
So it's easier for you
to identify it on a map

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.524
rather than enter in
an actual address.

00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:50.940
MESHACK ALLOYS:
We went to Android

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.290
because the majority
of the users in Kenya,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.720
East Africa is Android
phones, and the fact

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.266
that the process
of actually doing

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.890
that continuous
deployment to customers

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.160
is much faster than
other platforms.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.209
JASON ROGENA: As a
startup that is constantly

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.490
trying new things, we tend
to roll out features a lot.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.650
A cool feature in the Google
Play Developer Console

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.590
is the alpha and
beta testing groups.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.770
We normally roll out our
new versions of the app

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.680
to groups that help us test and
get as many bugs as possible

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.810
before the app goes
into final release.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.880
Most people love
it when the UI flow

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.000
is as easy to use as possible.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.810
Material design offers a very
simple language for people

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.750
to understand.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.590
And we've found that most
Kenyans appreciate it.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.080
When developing apps
for the Kenyan market,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.630
there are certain things
that you need to consider.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.060
You need to make sure
that your APK size is not

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.670
too large, because
most people don't

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.410
have a lot of storage space.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.830
You also need to check
the amount of data

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.680
that your app is
using, because people

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.160
are very sensitive of the
amount of data they use.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.540
Battery usage is
also very important.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.100
People don't have the luxury
of plugging in their phones

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.179
all the time.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.720
MESHACK ALLOYS: One
of the key things

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.417
was building trust
among your users.

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:14.250
So one of the things
we did in the beginning

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.520
is providing free
delivery to customers.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.730
The other way of building
trust is making sure

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.410
that we keep the customer in
the know where the driver is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.760
through our Android app.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.350
JASON ROGENA: The way we've
utilized the Google Play

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.340
Developer Console to
establish user trust is

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.960
at first we make sure that
our ratings on the Play Store

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.440
are high.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.300
We also rely on statistics
such as the number

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.900
of crashes per app version.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.960
That is very helpful
for me as a developer

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.520
to know what bugs I
should escalate and fix

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.042
as quickly as possible.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.500
MESHACK ALLOYS: I
think integrating

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.980
local payments is very, very
key to the success of customers

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.110
using your product.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.440
Over 90% of our customers
pay for our services

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.590
using mobile money.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.910
We have been seeing financial
growth within the company.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.350
We've gone from a team
of three to add 19 more,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.196
about 23 people.

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:07.570
JASON ROGENA:
Being able not only

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.560
to have an impact to the end
user but also to the drivers

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.040
in our platform, so giving them
an income that they weren't

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.660
able to earn a few months
ago, is really something that

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.500
is touching for me as a person.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.760
I feel that we are driving the
economy in the littlest way

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.850
possible.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.020
But we're still
driving the economy,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.690
which is enough for me.
