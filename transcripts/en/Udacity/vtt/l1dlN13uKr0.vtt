00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.900
Meanwhile at the Smithsonian Museum
of American history,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.240
which is just a bigger map,
bigger thing.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.470
We're going to do the same thing.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.060
One thing I'll show you here is that
here the map is a little bit bigger.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.740
And in fact if you take
a look at this map,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.420
it was actually created by
a robot doing what's called Slam.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.040
Where we actually use
the robot to build the map.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.740
So here we have again,
the robot doesn't know where it is.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.970
It takes a bunch of measurements.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.120
These are where the actual
measurements are.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.080
The robot doesn't know that yet.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.990
And this is the set of
particles that survive.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.060
So you see it's clumped up a little but
it doesn't know.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.210
So it moves,
takes another set of measurements, and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.240
these are the particles that survive.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.520
Now with just two sets of measurements.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.900
Almost everything else
here has gone away, and

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.700
we're getting a bigger clump there.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.090
Just two sets of those measurements.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.050
Right?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.330
Propagate forward, take a measurement,
and now you can see,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.170
as it's advanced forward, it has pretty
much very little ambiguity left.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.410
So again, just by taking these simple
measurements, it knows where it is.
