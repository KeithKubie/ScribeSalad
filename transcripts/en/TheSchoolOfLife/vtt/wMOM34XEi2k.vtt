00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.240
Towards the end of the twentieth century,
a celebrated Romanian-French philosopher

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.320
was invited to speak in Zurich. He
was introduced with rhetorical pomp and flattering

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.810
comparisons to the likes of Kierkegaard and
Schopenhauer. The speaker smiled, and immediately

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.970
confounded his German interpreter by beginning
his presentation with the words: ‘Mais je

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.440
ne suis qu’un déconneur’ / ‘But I’m
just a joker’. A few of his critics might

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.870
agree, but they would be wrong. For Emil 
Cioran is very much worthy of inclusion in

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.289
the line of the great French and European
moral philosophers and writers of maxims stretching

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:48.039
back to Montaigne, Chamfort, Pascal and La
Rochefoucauld. Cioran was born in Rasinari,

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.429
Romania, in April 1911. His father was a Greek
Orthodox priest. Both facts were to be key

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.190
in his later work. The writer’s Romanian
origins are often taken as the source of a

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.449
brooding, Romantic, fatalistic temperament
while his father’s ecclesiastical calling

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.960
finds echoes in his son’s unswerving preoccupation
with themes of religion, sainthood and the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.320
dangers and joys of atheism.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.260
In 1934,
at the age of only 23, he published his first

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.390
book in Romanian, On the Heights of Despair.
The book contains in embryo much of the lucidly

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.420
bleak, nihilistic thinking that he’d develop
throughout his life. He explained that writing

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.520
had been an alternative to shooting himself.
This is an author to read at moments of despair

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.890
and melancholy. He doesn’t depress us, merely
makes us feel less alone with our sorrows.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.230
Here is a peak inside his work: ‘It is not
worth the bother of killing yourself, since

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.600
you always kill yourself too late.’ ‘Only
optimists commit suicide, optimists who no

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.950
longer succeed at being optimists. The others,
having no reason to live, why would they have

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.450
any to die?’ ‘Write books only if you
are going to say in them the things you would

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.879
never dare confide to anyone.’ And: ‘What
do you do from morning to night?’ ‘I endure

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:23.519
myself.’ 1937 proved a pivotal year for
Cioran. He moved to Paris and soon became

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.489
a French citizen. He never returned to the
country of his birth. It was a move that provided

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.569
him with another reason to be melancholic: exile.
And yet he asserted that anyone who doesn’t

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.769
feel themselves to be an exile has no imagination.
‘Only the village idiot thinks they belong,’

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.209
he noted. Cioran sat out the Second World
War in Paris. In its aftermath, he approached

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.189
the famous publishing house, Gallimard, with
his first work in French, A Short History

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:58.430
of Decay, published in 1949. Writing in French
was he said, ‘like writing a love letter

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.099
with a dictionary’. The book became a bestseller,
the first in a series of devastatingly wicked

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:11.639
and dark texts composed mainly of aphorisms
and tart short essays. Each title comes as

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:18.749
a provocation or a punch: Syllogisms of Bitterness,
The Temptation to Exist and his masterpiece:

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:24.609
The Trouble with Being Born. Each book deals
relentlessly with themes of illness, death

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.709
and suicide. It was a rather touching irony
that the author lived to the ripe old age

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.200
of 84. By the time Cioran died in 1995, he
had become a cult in France, attracting the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.139
sort of faddish attention he witheringly denounced
in his work. Every life, he maintained, is

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:48.749
utterly peculiar – and wholly unimportant.
In the age of Walt Disney, this kind of darkness

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:55.390
matters. Cioran’s writing belongs in the
line of those great aloof European miserabilists,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.090
including La Rochefoucauld, Chamfort, Leopardi,
Nietzsche and Beckett. Like them, he saw civilization

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.680
as an absurd distraction from the ultimate
meaninglessness of existence. ‘Only an idiot

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.730
could think there is a point to any of this,’
he insisted. But he always kept his wit and

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.280
good cheer. One of his greatest sources of
sorrow was that he couldn’t sleep very well

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.960
– and was often up at 3am. He’d walk around
the streets of Paris until dawn. He noted

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.900
sardonically in The Trouble with Being Born,
‘What is that one crucifixion compared to

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:36.530
the daily kind any insomniac suffers?’ Cioran
was obsessed by suicide. But better to live,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.710
he wrote, and yet think and act as though
one were already dead. After all, he said:

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.561
why deprive oneself of the consoling idea
of no longer being around? ‘Continuing to

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:53.009
Live is possible only because of the deficiencies
of our imagination and our memories.’ he

00:04:53.009 --> 00:05:00.020
wrote. ‘I’m simply an accident. Why take
it all so seriously?’ But suicide was a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.680
constant relief as an idea: ‘We dread the
future only when we are not sure we can kill

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.349
ourselves when we want to.’ ‘Having always
lived in fear of being surprised by the worst,

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:17.250
I have tried in every circumstance to get
a head start, flinging myself into misfortune

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.300
long before it occurred.’ Our age is notably
optimistic and it makes us suffer hugely from

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.580
being so. We are all, in private, a lot sadder
than we are allowed to admit. Writers like

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.009
Cioran provide an occasion for the sadness
inside all of us to be communally expressed

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.050
and thereby a little, but only a little, diminished
and softened. In his beautiful book, The Trouble

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.060
with Being Born, Cioran wrote: ‘I can be
friends with people only when they are at

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.940
their lowest point and have neither the desire
nor the strength to restore their habitual

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.199
sentimental illusions.’ It’s precisely
in that kind of mood – into which all thoughtful

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.039
people must sink on a fairly regular basis
– that we can be blessed to find the dark

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.760
and consoling works of Emil Cioran waiting for
us.
