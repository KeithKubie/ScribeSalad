00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:02.419
- All right, gents,

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.670
now be tested in three tests.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.296
Up first, the kill test.

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:05.839
Doug?

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.511
Bladesmiths, to see
what kind of lethal damage

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.763
your klewang will do, I
will take your klewang

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:17.183
and deliver slashes and thrusts
on these ballistics dummies.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.685
Hunter, you're up first.
You ready?

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.853
Ready as I'm going to get.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.521
My blade's very sharp.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.065
I cut through probably half
a case of water bottles.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.859
Took note of edge
defamation, and it's sharp,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.071
so I just gotta hope it's
good enough for the dummies.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.907
[music playing]

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170
DOUG MARCAIDA: All
right, Hunter, let's talk

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.005
about your klewang right here.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.507
Your edge over here is sharp.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.051
It glides through
and lasts through it.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.346
Your weapon, when
slashing, broke some ribs.

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.224
Your klewang, sir, will kill.
- Thank you.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.768
All right, Tim, you ready?

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.686
As I'll ever be.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.271
Hunter got really good feedback.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.398
That first slice went in deep.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.818
So he's got one mother
of an edge on that thing.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:09.819
I hope mine does that well.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.076
[music playing]

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:29.547
DOUG MARCAIDA: All right,
Tim, the first thing

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.591
I noticed about is your handle.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.301
The minute you
grab onto it, it's

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:37.222
ovoid enough to let us know
and index where the edge is.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:41.184
You have a tip that's also
very sharp and pointed,

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.561
that when it penetrated,
it not only penetrated,

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.938
broke some ribs also.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:48.274
Your klewang will kill.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.651
Thank you.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.319
DOUG MARCAIDA: Next
up, the strength test.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.822
Bladesmiths, we've taken
these parts from a buffalo plow.

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.157
And to test the strength and
durability of your klewangs,

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:58.076
I am going to chop into them.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.495
Remember, this test is all about
what they do to your klewang,

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.622
and not what your
klewangs do to them.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.123
Hunter, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.708
I'm ready as I'm going to get.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:06.918
I'm really nervous.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.670
My sword's lean,
it's pretty narrow.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.922
This seems like it's going to be
a lot more brutal on the blades

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.382
than what I was expecting.

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:20.265
[music playing]

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.647
[bleep]

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.069
BEN ABBOTT: Well,
Hunter, your blade broke.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.698
The main issue was that
at the intersection

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:40.994
of the blade and
this decorative curl,

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.371
there was a saw
cut that came in.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.332
It's a sharp notch, and we
call those stress risers.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.418
They're a place where
something is going to break.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.587
The way you protect
against that problem

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.422
is you round the
bottom of that notch,

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.425
and it tends to dissipate
the energy better.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.886
Hunter, your blade suffered
a catastrophic failure

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.471
and can no longer
continue with testing.

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.932
However, you're not out
of this competition yet.

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.435
Tim, your blade
also must survive

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.146
at least five whacks in order
for you to move forward.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.315
TIM: Hunter's blade snapped.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.358
(LAUGHING) Now I'm even
more nervous about what's

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.862
going to happen to mine.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.698
[music playing]

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.797
BEN ABBOTT: Well,
Tim, it held up.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.091
Can't see any evidence
of the activity

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:37.926
on the edge of this blade.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.844
It's still razor-sharp.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.763
I really enjoyed swinging it.
Nice job.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.474
Thank you so much.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:45.975
WIL WILLIS: Hunter,
your blade suffered

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.810
a catastrophic failure.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.439
For that reason, I have to
dismiss you from the forge.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.899
HUNTER: I'm feeling
pretty disappointed.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.275
I don't know-- I just
thought it was going

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:55.777
to be more solid than that.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:57.612
If I could start over
again, I'd make the blade

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.280
a little wider,
a little thicker,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.574
and make sure to have
a stress point in it.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.660
I still want to go full time.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.620
I've definitely learned a lot.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.621
Every blade I make from now
on is going to be better.
