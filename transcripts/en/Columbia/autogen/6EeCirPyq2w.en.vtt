any better and so they went ahead and

any better and so they went ahead and
got better also even without the

it's just a passage of time maybe it's

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:22.399
it's just a passage of time maybe it's
 

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:24.399
it's just a passage of time maybe it's
just that people come in and once they

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409
just that people come in and once they
 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.559
just that people come in and once they
come in to say I want help with my

see you in 10 weeks and what we found
 

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:02.889
see you in 10 weeks and what we found
was once again the the group that work

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:02.899
was once again the the group that work
 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:04.179
was once again the the group that work
with the therapists got their drinking

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189
with the therapists got their drinking
 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.089
with the therapists got their drinking
in half once again the group working on

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099
in half once again the group working on
 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.399

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409
their own who actually started somewhat
 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.980
their own who actually started somewhat
higher than the therapist group showed a

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990
higher than the therapist group showed a
 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.659
higher than the therapist group showed a
very nice reduction in drinking that

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669
very nice reduction in drinking that
 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.449
very nice reduction in drinking that
maintained well over time and the two

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:16.459
maintained well over time and the two
 

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.879
maintained well over time and the two
waiting list groups didn't go anywhere

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889
waiting list groups didn't go anywhere
 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.819
waiting list groups didn't go anywhere
up until 10 weeks and then we treated

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:21.829
up until 10 weeks and then we treated
 

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.169
up until 10 weeks and then we treated
them a therapist saw them and then

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:23.179
them a therapist saw them and then
 

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:26.619
them a therapist saw them and then
they're drinking came down after that so

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629
they're drinking came down after that so
 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.139
they're drinking came down after that so
it wasn't just the passage of time and

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:29.149
it wasn't just the passage of time and
 

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:30.819
it wasn't just the passage of time and
it wasn't the record-keeping in fact the

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:30.829
it wasn't the record-keeping in fact the
 

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:32.409
it wasn't the record-keeping in fact the
group that kept records there Ricky went

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419
group that kept records there Ricky went
 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.019
group that kept records there Ricky went
up a little bit over time you know so so

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:35.029
up a little bit over time you know so so
 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.379
up a little bit over time you know so so
it wasn't that day either and the lesson

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389
it wasn't that day either and the lesson
 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.939
it wasn't that day either and the lesson
seems to be that people seem to have an

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949
seems to be that people seem to have an
 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:41.589
seems to be that people seem to have an
impressive capacity to change themselves

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599
impressive capacity to change themselves
 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.329
impressive capacity to change themselves
if you believe in them if you tell them

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:43.339
if you believe in them if you tell them
 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.339
if you believe in them if you tell them
that they can and give them some help

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349
that they can and give them some help
 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:45.820
that they can and give them some help
and

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830
and
 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.710
and
so they're now over 30 randomized

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720
so they're now over 30 randomized
 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.869
so they're now over 30 randomized
clinical trials showing the same thing

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879
clinical trials showing the same thing
 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.240
clinical trials showing the same thing
that a relatively brief form of

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250
that a relatively brief form of
 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.700
that a relatively brief form of
counseling can bring about substantial

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710
counseling can bring about substantial
 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.760
counseling can bring about substantial
change in drinking then I got the

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770
change in drinking then I got the
 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.950
change in drinking then I got the
thinking about that waiting list control

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960
thinking about that waiting list control
 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.869
thinking about that waiting list control
because you would expect people to get

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879
because you would expect people to get
 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:03.790
because you would expect people to get
somewhat better I mean they walk into a

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800
somewhat better I mean they walk into a
 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.110
somewhat better I mean they walk into a
clinic fish that I have a drinking

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120

yeah and it's absolutely flat it doesn't

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740
yeah and it's absolutely flat it doesn't

improve at all up to ten weeks and then

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919
improve at all up to ten weeks and then
 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.920
improve at all up to ten weeks and then
it hit me that that they were doing

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930
it hit me that that they were doing
 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.600
it hit me that that they were doing
exactly what we told them to do they

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610
exactly what we told them to do they
 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.350
exactly what we told them to do they
were waiting we put them on a waiting

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360
were waiting we put them on a waiting
 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.869
were waiting we put them on a waiting
list and the message is you're not

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879
list and the message is you're not
 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.610
list and the message is you're not
expected to get better until we can

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620
expected to get better until we can
 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.529
expected to get better until we can
treat you and then it's alright to get

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:26.539
treat you and then it's alright to get
 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:27.339
treat you and then it's alright to get
better after that

we know that client change talk predicts

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020
we know that client change talk predicts
 

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.990
we know that client change talk predicts
behavior change so the more client is

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000
behavior change so the more client is
 

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.730

arguing for change during a session the
more likely they are to change we know

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:49.410
more likely they are to change we know
 

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.500
more likely they are to change we know
that mi significantly decreases
