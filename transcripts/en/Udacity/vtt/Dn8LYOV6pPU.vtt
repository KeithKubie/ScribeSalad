00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's take a look.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This was a potentially tricky quiz. Don't feel bad if you had a little trouble with it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We want this pplus nonterminal to correspond to one or more Ps.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
No matter which branch you take here, you're definitely getting at least one P,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but we need you to have the chance to get more.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This option, pplus goes to P, corresponds to picking just one.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Pplus goes to P followed by pplus--this recursive rewrite rule

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Gives you the possibility to have as many as you want--possibly even infinite.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We've seen that before with expression goes to expression plus expression.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Over here, this i-question mark is supposed to relate to i-option.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
One possibility is that you donâ€™t want to write an i at all, but another possibility is that you do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here this question mark means have either 1 or 0,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
this the rule for having 1, and this is the rule for having 0.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Some strings in this language or p, pi, ppi--that sort of thing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In fact, if you have a bit of a musical theater bent,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
you could imagine context-free grammars singing across to regular expressions

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the classic line from Annie Get Your Gun,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
"Anything you can do, I can do better. I can do anything better than you."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
To which, classically, the opponent replies, "Can you bake a pie?" "No." "Neither can I."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But in fact, any regular expression relating to pi or something similar, as we've seen above,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
can be handled both by our regular expression protagonist and our grammar protagonist.

00:01:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Just a fun little interlude.
