00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:12.580
Can You Change Your Legal Name to Just Have
a First or Last Name if You Wanted To?

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.409
Mononymous people, or people with a singular
given name, were once the norm throughout

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.779
much of the world, but are rare in modern
times, particularly in the West.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.050
As such, most of our infrastructure is built
to accommodate people with at least two names-

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.349
invariably a first name and a surname with
the occasional embarrassingly antiquated middle

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.730
name in homage to some ancestor or other for
good measure.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.000
Given this, what difficulties do people with
only a singular given name face in a society

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.240
so built to favour the duonymous and trinymous
(which Google tells me aren’t actually words

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.710
but I now officially declare such), and is
there anything stopping polynymous people

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.530
from having a name-change operation to become
mononymous?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.030
To begin with, the idea of surnames, while
popular today, is not universally held on

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.720
Earth and there are still cultures where children
are simply given a singular name at birth.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.740
An example of this is Indonesian and Javanese
culture where the mononymous are common.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.750
The most well-known example of this is likely
Indonesia’s first ever President, Sukarno.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.960
Despite having only a singular given name,
Western journalists in the 1960s sometimes

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.889
felt it necessary to make up some random second
name when writing about President Sukarno

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:25.399
to save having to take the time to explain
that mononymous people are common in Indonesian

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.450
culture.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.450
As you can imagine, within cultures where
a singular name isn’t unheard of, the government

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.909
has no problem issuing IDs to mononymous individuals
and there exist examples of Indonesian passports

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.969
with only one name listed.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.159
Their systems also easily account for the
polynymous among us.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.609
For instance, in their passports, rather than
having separate boxes for a last name and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.740
any other given names, they only have a singular
box in which a person’s full name, however

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.529
many distinct entities it might include, is
written.

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:59.079
In places like America or the UK, such forms
are not always so accommodating.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.420
This is particularly an issue that impacts
foreign students wishing to study in the West,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.700
especially when they’re asked to fill in
digital forms that don’t allow you to proceed

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.580
without filling in all the boxes.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.330
So what do mononymous people do in these cases?

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.360
Since not all digital forms are created equally,
there’s not really a singular, all-encompassing

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.540
answer we can give about what happens in these
situations.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.180
However, the general methods employed here
seem to be the tedious route- people are required

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.880
to either call the institution personally
to explain and have an administrator bypass

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.410
the restrictions manually, or alternatively
for some forms a standard character set like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.770
“NFN” can be put in, understood to stand
for “No First Name”.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.780
That said, this seems to be more of an issue
for those in the US more than the UK as many

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.410
places, like British universities, allow foreign
students hailing from cultures where singular

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.880
names are common to simply write their full
given name in one of the available boxes and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.310
leave the others blank without the back end
coding complaining to the user about it.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.860
Given such difficulties for the mononymous,
most probably would avoid wanting to switch

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.890
from a perfectly form-acceptable duonymous
name to a mononymous.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.640
But if you wanted to, could you legally trim
the fat of your name and go it solo?

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.940
As it turns out, in many cases, yes, though
with some stipulations.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.110
For instance, in the UK where the rules are
a little less nebulous than, say, the United

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.980
States, the official website of the Deed Poll
Office explains to readers that …

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.950
You are free to change any part of your name
— you can change your first name, your middle

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.530
names, and your surname.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.460
You can add or remove names, and you can change
the spelling of names.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.980
The website goes on to acknowledge that while
British Citizen can change their name to virtually

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.010
anything they like, whenever they want, for
any reason by simply filling in a form and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.650
paying a small fee, they strongly advise people
to not change their name for frivolous reasons.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.319
Then again, they note in the same paragraph
that there’s not really anything they can

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.410
do if you do choose to do this.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.590
As for what an individual can choose to call
themselves, there are only a handful of official

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.371
rules in place and they’re basically the
same rules enforced when you choose to name

00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:05.430
a baby.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.710
Basically, as long as you don’t choose a
name that is intentionally offensive or promotes

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.700
hatred or illegal behaviour or the like, you
can change it to whatever you want.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.410
On top of this, the website notes that for
technical reasons names can’t be over 300

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.560
characters long, contain numbers or symbols
or feature diacritical‌‌‌‌ ‌‌‌‌marks‌‌‌‌

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.410
(umlauts, accents, etc).

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.370
This isn’t to say that they can’t contain
these things in terms of if you want to write

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.940
them that way, it’s just that they won’t
appear that way on official documents like

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.940
passports.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.840
As for choosing to go by a singular name,
again the Deed Poll Office acknowledges that

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.770
it can do nothing to stop a person choosing
to go mononymous, stating:

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.760
There is no law preventing you from being
known by a single name, or mononym — that

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.820
is, a surname only, with no forenames — and
HM Passport Office should accept such a name,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.060
although they may be more sceptical of your
application.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.160
In such cases, individuals will be issued
passports in which the field for forename

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.560
will contain three large X’s and an official
observation explaining what’s going on.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.919
Though the HM Passport Office is a different
and distinct entity to the Deed Poll Office,

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.620
British Citizens wanting to change their name
who hold British Passports are required to

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.500
convince both offices that their name change
isn’t frivolous and as such, changing your

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.460
name to a mononym is more difficult in these
circumstances unless you hail from a culture

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.790
where it is common.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.250
In which case, the Passport Office should
process your application without issue.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.650
The Deed Poll Office also advises citizens
that while it’s not illegal to go by a single

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.790
name, it makes the process of identifying
oneself substantially more difficult and asks

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.830
people to consider the difficulties they will
face in day-to-day life before making a decision

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.540
to go by a mononym.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.980
Across the pond in America, changing your
name is a more complicated affair, in part

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.160
because each US state has its own rules about
how one should go about this.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.331
That said, for the most part, the rules are
similar to the ones in the UK, in that you

00:05:56.331 --> 00:06:00.550
can generally change your name to whatever
you want, within reason- don’t be offensive,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.110
don’t try to change your name to something
unintelligible, don’t try to change your

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.320
name to a trademarked phrase or a celebrity’s
name (unless you can convince the powers that

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.040
be that you have a legitimate reason for doing
so), etc.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.130
The process of changing your name, however,
is an altogether more litigious and complex

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.490
affair, usually requiring you to appear in
court and have the details of your name change

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.490
published to become official.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.560
Exceptions to this latter rule include cases
where an individual has been a victim of domestic

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.750
violence.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.430
As for changing your name to a mononym, this
is generally impossible in the US in all but

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.120
the most exceptional of circumstances.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.630
As a result, only a handful of US citizens
have Passports listing a single name.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.610
Along with natives of cultures where singular
names are common, people known to be legally

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.590
recognised by a single name include the singer
Cher and latter (silent) half of the magician

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.070
duo, Penn and Teller.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.840
The reason changing your name to a mononym
is so difficult in the US is because (in most

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.720
States), as mentioned, changing your name
requires you to physically appear in front

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.320
of a judge and justify the name change.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.120
Such a judge is unlikely to grant a request
to allow a person to go by a mononym due to

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.160
the inherent difficulties having such a name
can cause.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.449
For people like Cher and Teller, who’ve
been near-universally known by their respective

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.560
mononyms for decades, this isn’t as much
of an issue as for those of us who can’t

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.590
just throw lots of money at any problems that
subsequently pop up; the fact that they’re

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.240
both famous also probably helped their case
with their respective judges.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.320
For those curious about what Cher and Teller’s
passports say in the box listing their first

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.860
name, rather than a series of X’s like in
the UK, US passports instead put the aforementioned

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.960
abbreviation “NFN” (No First Name).

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.400
Interestingly, 46 states allow a citizen to
bypass part of this process and change their

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.810
name “by usage”.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.240
This basically means if you go by a given
name for long enough and can prove that fact,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.680
you can adopt that as your new name, though
you’ll still need a court order to make

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.740
it official for a passport or the like.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.389
When this happens, similar difficulties to
those mentioned above can arise.

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:29.720
So all things considered, it’s probably
just easier to stick with the names we’re

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:56.680
given.
