00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.440
Oh wow, look at that!

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.820
Look at those big red bubbles.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.100
Looks beautiful doesn't it, mama?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.200
This is a home-made lava lamp. It's a bit different

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.100
to the ones you buy in a shop

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.680
but it works in a similar way.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.129
In the glass here I've got oil and
water

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.190
with red food colouring in it. To get the lava lamp effect you just drop

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.450
pieces of alka-seltzer tablet into the
glass.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.070
The alka-seltzer reacts with the water
at the bottom to create bubbles of gas.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.320
Because the bubbles are less dense than both the oil and the water,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.140
they float to the top.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680
When the bubbles burst at the top, the water sinks back down,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.960
which is what gives us this circulating effect.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.880
It's a great make just on its own,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.380
but you can also use it as part of a
slightly longer activity

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.760
investigating floating and sinking.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.460
So what do you think we're going to do
with all this stuff today?

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.140
Put it into the water, and see what happens?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.170
So, let's try... 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.800
Tomato!

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.840
Floating or sinking?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.500
It's sunk and it's turning around and making a different colour.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.480
This one's smaller, what do you think this one's going to do?

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.540
I don't know let's see.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.840
Oh, but they're both spoons...

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.420
It's because this one's a bit lighter and it's made of plastic.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
Ah, okay.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.570
And this one is made of metal and metal is really heavy.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.950
Viola's right that the metal spoon is
heavier in the plastic one,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.579
but it's not always the case that light
things float and heavy thing sink.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.619
Otherwise ships and boats wouldn't float.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.710
Whether or not an object floats depends
on its density,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.700
and that depends on its mass and its volume.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.420
The mass of an object is a measure of how much stuff it contains.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.480
The volume is a measure of how much space it takes up.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.180
The density of an object is defined as
the mass of the object

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.220
divided by its volume. 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.480
If something is more dense than water, it will sink. If it's less dense, it will float.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.060
Using tinfoil is a really great way to explore the idea of density in more detail.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.340
With the same size piece of foil, we can scrunch it up into a larger ball

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.560
and it floats on the water, but if we really squish it down

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.240
it will sink. You might have to have a bit of a bash at it first, though.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.200
So this is the same bit of foil, and we've really squashed it. What do you think...

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.420
Sinks!

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.620
Did you think it was going to sink or did you think it was going to float?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.519
Sink!

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.750
Did you? Why did you think you it was gonna sink? 
Because it was squashed all together,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.830
And what were we squashing out?

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.290
Water.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.989
Yes, there was water. What else?

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.589
Air.

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:26.180
Viola what would you like to drop in next? The big fruit!

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.160
I'm not going to drop it.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.720
It floats! I thought it might sink!

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.160
Why did you think it might sink?

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.099
Because it's really heavy!

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.579
If we peel the skin of the fruit what do you think is going to happen?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.040
It might sink.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.380
Why do you think it might sink?

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.720
Because it'll be losing some of its air

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.980
like the tinfoil.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.980
The first time I saw this I was really surprised! You can make an orange sink

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.990
just by peeling it.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.320
The reason for that is because

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.670
the skin of this orange, and most citrus fruits,

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.960
has lots of trapped air inside it.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.030
When you take off the skin you're left just
with the denser part of the fruit,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.370
which is why it sinks.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.550
So Vi-vi, we've got some oil here, and oil is less dense...

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.280
Lighter? Yes you can also think of it as lighter

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.160
than the water in the glass.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.760
It might go on top of the water.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.060
You think it's going to float on the water?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.540
Bubbles!

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.640
Is that empty glass?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.840
No it's got water in.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.520
So what's this up at the top? Oil.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.500
Now I've got some red food colouring. 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.520
Do you think it's going to float on top of the oil, float on top of the water, or just sink into the water?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.790
Um, maybe one of those three things.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.880
I think it might be one of those three things, yes.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.470
So you just pour it really slowly.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.050
That's enough, thank you.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.180
So what's it done? Mixing up with the water, 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.360
it's made a few red bubbles in here.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.360
We've got here these tablets. These make bubbles. 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.700
Can you break that one into a little bit? We just need them into quarters.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.860
Do you want to drop one in and see what happens?

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.100
Oh now they're rising up through the oil! The red bubbles are travelling through the oil aren't they?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.720
It's pretty isn't it? What's falling back down, by the way?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.039
Air.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.199
No the air is floating to the top.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.680
Oh yeah, the water. That's it.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.520
It's not always obvious which things will float,

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.759
and which things will sink, and the
science behind it isn't always that

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.589
straightforward.

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:56.879
But activities like this are a great way to
look at floating and sinking

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.579
and introduce the idea density.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.879
They're also a really fun way to encourage children
to look closely at the world around them

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.859
and to expeRiment.
