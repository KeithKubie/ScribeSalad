00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.036
To celebrate Christmas,
we tried to book Santa,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.838
but he's at Book Soup
doing a signing

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:07.241
for his new coffee table book
of tasteful elf nudes.

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:08.609
-Luckily...
-(laughter)

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.978
we <i>were</i> able to get
his Austrian counterpart.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.547
He appears at homes and hovels
all over Europe,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.750
and his biopic <i>Krampus </i>
has 65% on Rotten Tomatoes.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.520
All the way from the Teutonic
forests of Middle Europe,

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.488
Krampus is here, everybody!

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.891
-(cheering)
-(Krampus growling)

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.832
(growls, chuckles)

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.800
(growling)

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:36.803
(growls)
Hey, Chris,

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.872
your audience probably
doesn't recognize me,

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.308
because Americans aren't aware
of anybody's traditions

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.478
but their own.
(growls)

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.315
Yeah, I... What an authentic
Austrian accent you have.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.184
-Uh, so...
-(laughter)

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:54.054
-why are you here, Krampus?
-It's 2016 now, Chris.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.690
Better accent? Almost 2017.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.959
Santa Claus is on the way out.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.161
Too old, too jolly--

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.829
it makes you wonder...

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:04.598
what is he hiding?

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.500
He's crooked!

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.101
Crooked Santa.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.071
All right, so you're saying
that Santa Claus is corrupt.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.341
Yes. He's too nice.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.711
He rewards children
for being "good"!

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.348
And that's not what
real Americans just voted for.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.783
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Oh.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:26.320
They voted for kids
to be punished!

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.989
Punished with bundles of sticks.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.157
(laughter)

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.992
That's where I come in.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.528
Every year I go around
to people's homes

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.864
and thrash kids with sticks.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.966
That's my thing.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.534
-(cheering)
-MAN: Yeah.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.503
It's what I do.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:49.243
Isn't that what Christmas
is all about, Chris?

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.912
The thrashing children
with bundles of sticks?

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.547
Well, I don't... I don't know.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.948
Comedians,
that is a good question.

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:57.451
What is Christmas
all about? Milana.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.686
The thrashing of children
with bundles of sticks.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.156
Okay, all right.
Uh, points for that.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.926
Uh, con... that confirmation.
Nick, what is Christmas about?

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.028
Uh, Christmas is about
my Uncle Rod

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.931
taking too many close-up
creepy pictures of my wife.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:14.568
All right. Uh, points.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.471
I mean, no... no offense,
Krampus, I'm not being judgey,

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.640
but you seem to be particularly
obsessed with this idea

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:22.809
of thrashing children
with bundles of sticks. Why?

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:26.780
Uh, it's just so practical.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.116
Think of the money
you'll save on toys.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.851
You buy a Hatchable, right?

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.954
60, 70 bucks-- whatever
they cost, I don't know.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.489
I don't go to toy stores.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.525
I'm a grown man.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.328
I send my assistant Michelle
to the toy store for me.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.829
HARDWICK:
Okay.

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:45.365
Then you give the toy to the
kid, and they start screaming

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:49.269
because of your horns
and sulfur breath.

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:53.140
Wouldn't it just be cheaper
to buy one bundle of twigs

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.877
that you can use to thrash them?

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.679
Well, I mean,
I guess... I guess,

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:00.614
if you lay it out that way,
then-then yeah.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.583
-Thank you.
-All right.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.852
I mean, it seems like
you're spending a lot of time

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.720
collecting small sticks
when you could really

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.689
just grab one big stick.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.993
That is a good point.
100 points for that.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.528
KRAMPUS:
You know, you got a point.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.264
Hey, come on, Krampus,
you cannot... First of all,

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.665
you're so obsessed with sticks.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.401
-You cannot go around
hitting children wi... -Wrong.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.636
-...with sticks and...
-Wrong.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.837
-No, you can't. -Wrong.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.173
No, I'm right.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.742
You can't just go around
swatting kids with sticks.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.110
I mean...

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.779
Hi, Billy.
Hi, Billy. Whack!

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:35.148
-What did Billy do? -Oh, hey,
Darren, what's up? Whack!

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:38.285
Why are you hitting these fake
invisible kids in front of you?

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.786
There has to be a better way.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.589
Comedians, what's a better,
modern punishment for a child?

00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:43.857
Aparna.

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.125
Giving them gluten.

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.094
All right, points.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.033
Milana?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.202
You, uh, you take away
their PokÃ©mon

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.504
and then you tell them that
the divorce is their fault.

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:59.173
Okay, good, yeah.

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:01.008
Listen, that's what
my parents did,

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.043
and I turned out fine. Uh...

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.978
So, what is your point
with all this, Krampus?

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:08.615
Uh, my point is
Santa Claus is a cuck.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.983
-What?
-Wha... -What?

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:12.152
You heard me.

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:13.787
Google it.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.822
America needs
to upgrade this year

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.558
to a new Christmas guy:

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.459
me, Krampus,

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:23.363
the alt-Santa.

00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:26.767
I... I...

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.204
I'm going to make... I'm going
to make Christmas great again.

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:31.605
I can tell you that.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:33.507
I'm going to make Christmas
great again.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.176
All right.
So, comedians...

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:40.747
rather than, uh,
beating people with wood,

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.250
there's got to be a better way
to make Christmas great again.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.752
Uh, so how do we do that?
Aparna.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.921
Putting... putting
the Christ back in

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:50.390
"Jesus Christ,
this country is (bleep)!"

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:53.393
All right, points.
Points.

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:56.563
I was going to say thrash
your children with bundles!

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:57.898
But whatever.

00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.833
If you were wan...
really want to... their children

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:01.635
thrashed with sticks
on Christmas?

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:02.903
Uh... (scoffs)

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.739
Not <i>a</i> children, Chris.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:09.676
Just <i>most</i> children.
(cackles)

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.912
My elves will start a database

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.481
to keep track
of all the naughty kids

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:16.216
and to make sure
they're all rounded up

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.484
and sent to camps...

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:19.520
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
hey! -Hey, no.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:21.955
-No, you whoa, you hey.
-No, you!

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:24.324
-Let me finish.
-Okay.

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:26.059
Send them to summer camps.

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:27.828
Oh, okay, all right, that's...

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:29.630
There we go.
Where they will be sorted

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.632
according to religion
and sexual orientation.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.467
-All right, that's it,
we're done. -What?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.170
We're done with you, please.
Thank you, Krampus.

00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.705
-Not thank you.
-You! You!

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.805
Don't hit anyone on the way out.
