00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.260
Now, this very strange structure here
is called a domatium.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.560
And what it is, is a house for ants.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.960
And this plant has built this little structure.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.140
It's sort of like a barracks for the ant army.
They live inside.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.060
And when herbivores arrive, the ant army
comes out of the domatium

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.340
and attacks the herbivores.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.300
And we can see, I think, if I get this,
put this in the light, you can see

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.300
these little holes and that's where the ants
live.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:01.540
And the plant can spend up to 20% of all it's
resources housing and feeding its army.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.680
And each plant has a relationship
with a particular kind of ant species.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.720
And each kind of ant signals
to its plant and vice versa.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.780
So this is a system where
the ants and the plants talk to each other.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.300
Now, this system of defence
takes a lot of resources.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.440
Ants are quite fussy, they like
nice big houses, thank you very much.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840
And they like lots of food.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.560
You've got to keep your army loyal
by feeding it well.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.980
So, this is an expensive kind
of defence so it's got to work.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.400
And now we're going to see
this defence in action.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.640
We're going to see what happens
when caterpillars and ants meet each other.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.560
Now, in here, we've got our resident ant army.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.640
Now hopefully you can see these
guys running about. They're on patrol.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.960
They're waiting for something to attack.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.020
And we've got some caterpillars.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.200
So I'm now going to see

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.800
what happens when I put a caterpillar
into the middle of this ant army.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.360
Now what are the ants going to make of that?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.760
Ooh.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.720
They're not very happy at this intruder.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.980
So they're going to come and bite our caterpillar.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.820
Ooh yes.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.180
They're on the attack.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.900
You can see that, oh dear,
yes this Colin the caterpillar

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.220
and I don't think
he's enjoying that very much.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.120
Yes, the ants are busy
trying to kill poor old Colin.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.180
And they're very, very aggressive as you can
see.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.160
Lots of them are surrounding
the caterpillar and poor old...

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.060
Should we rescue Colin?
- Yes!

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.520
It's a bit hard actually,
the ants don't want to let go.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.100
Now ants are very, very fierce.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.710
Don't worry, I think Colin will recover in
the end.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.660
I'll go and rescue him properly in a moment.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.360
But ants are some of the fiercest predators
and they are very aggressive.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.930
About a third of the trees in
tropical countries are protected by ants,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.020
as I discovered when I took a party of students
into the forest in Uganda a couple of summers

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.020
ago,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.069
and we accidentally walked into trees protected
by ants.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.330
They poured out of the tree and attacked us.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.490
And the only thing we could do,
because it was so painful and horrible,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.490
was run away as fast as we could and
then we discovered the ants were in our clothes.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.560
So we had to take all our clothes off.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.590
Which wasn't a pretty sight on lots of levels,
and we had to take all the ants off.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.250
And they were so aggressive they wouldn't
let go.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.590
So is this a very, very good defence.
And the ants are an incredibly loyal army.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.280
They don't just kill herbivores like Colin
and attack people like me,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.120
what they do is they kill other plants.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.430
So they make sure that their own plant
has all the best resources

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.819
and they kill all the plants surrounding their
home.
