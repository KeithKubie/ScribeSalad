Another feature of Acme that goes beyond the basic vocabulary of what

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.400
are called Families. And

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.390
Families are what you would use within Acme to describe architectural styles.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.400
That is they're defining new terms that describe sets of architectures. You can

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.320
encode style rules as properties, that describe how to use a particular family.
