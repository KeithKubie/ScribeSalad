00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.279
&gt;&gt; ALLEN: I'm Peter Allen. And I'm the director
of Google University. And Meng asked to me

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.150
introduce Daniel Goleman to you. Daniel Goleman
presents a challenge to us at Google. Having

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.699
recently been hired here myself and having
worked on hiring others, I know how sharply

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.570
we focus on the quantitative evidence of intellect.
We look hard at grades and standardized test

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.150
scores because we believe they demonstrate
ability and predict success at Google. Now,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.320
IQ matters, of course, but Daniel Goleman
has based his career as a writer and psychologist

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.880
on the argument that IQ is only a part of
what makes people succeed in their work and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.751
personal lives and not necessarily the most
important part either. In his books, Dr. Goleman

00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:55.210
addresses the role that emotions such as anger,
humor, anxiety, optimism, melancholy, and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.450
happiness play in all aspects of our lives.
He argues also that people can learn how to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.900
manage these emotions and that we therefore
have the power to transform our relationship

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.750
with our emotions and through them the relationships
we have with our colleagues, our families,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.940
and our friends. Perhaps most interestingly,
he also argues that relationships have the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.659
power to mold not only human experience, but
also human biology. In his belief that the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.000
power of education and in his belief in the
power of education that--in his belief that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.620
positive characteristics like empathy are
innate, Dr. Goleman reveals that he is fundamentally

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.440
an optimist. What distinguishes Daniel Goleman
from old line proponents of positive thinking,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.950
however, is his grounding in psychology and
neuroscience. Armed with a Ph.D. in psychology

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.170
from Harvard and a first-rate journalism background
at the New York Times, Dr. Goleman has authored

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.770
half a dozen books that explore the physical
and chemical workings of the brain and their

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.490
relationships with what we experience as everyday
life. His most recent book is called "Social

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.439
Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships."
In addition to his writing, he has also played

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.950
important roles in numerous organizations,
including the Collaborative for Academics,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.529
Social and Emotional Learning and the Mind
 &amp; Life Institute. The American Psychological

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:29.810
Association has given him its career achievement
award for journalism and he's also been elected

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.819
a fellow of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. Dr. Goleman's talk

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.730
today draws on recent data from cognitive
and brain science to show how emotional intelligence

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.269
adds to the IQ intelligence of which most
of us today here are more familiar. He will

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:57.599
show that skills such as self-awareness, emotional
mastery, motivation, empathy, and social effectiveness

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:04.079
have a greater impact than raw intelligence
on career success, outstanding individual

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.319
performance, leadership, and the creation
of successful teams. I'm feeling myself become

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.840
smarter, more empathetic and more self-aware
already, and I'm delighted to introduce Daniel

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.269
Goleman to Google and Google to Daniel Goleman.
Let's hear what he has to say.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:32.639
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Thank you, Peter, for that very
kind introduction. But, first, a disclaimer,

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.870
just hearing about this is not going to make
anybody more emotionally and socially intelligent.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.989
It might interest you in pursuing some of
this. What I want to do is build the case

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:55.900
that these soft skills have hard value in
an environment, of work environment like this.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:08.900
Even though the culture of tech may not necessarily
explicitly value things like empathy or other

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.969
elements of emotional intelligence, implicitly,
this is what makes people highly effective

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:23.159
no matter what they do. And I want to give
you the neuroscience behind this and some

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:29.919
concepts that might help you rethink what
the elements of success are in the work place.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:39.940
So here is the question. What is the relationship
between raw intellect, IQ, and the other metrics

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.349
of IQ, and emotional intelligence? So, by
emotional intelligence, I mean how we handle

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:54.470
ourselves, how we handle our relationships,
the soft side ability. I'm going to argue

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.900
that, because of the way the brain is structured,
these soft skills have hard consequence because

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.449
they are catalytic for whatever other abilities
we have. They allow us to make the best use

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:16.830
of them, to apply them, and to leverage them.
Now, here's an interesting way of thinking

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:28.020
about it. If you were to do a scatter plot
of a large population sample and you did IQ

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.110
against emotional intelligence, they're roughly
independent, so, you get a kind of a random

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:42.919
distribution. Now, if you take this pool and
you map it on Google, or any other company

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:50.659
that hires, that places a premium on cognitive
abilities, this is the total sample. What

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:57.480
you've done is really interesting because
you're skimming the top. Okay, let's say this

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.650
is IQ of 150 or whatever, it's very high.
What you have now done is to make a very small

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:13.540
difference for IQ, a very little variation
in the population at the very top and a very

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.600
large difference for emotional intelligence.
That means that whatever emotional intelligence

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:28.139
contributes to success in an environment like
this, it matters more per unit than IQ does.

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:36.810
So there's actually a floor effect here for
IQ. You wouldn't expect that IQ alone is going

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.659
to help you be highly effective in this work
environment because it's not that much different

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:53.009
from every other IQ on the floor. Interesting.
I was having a conversation with a guy on

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:58.849
a plane next to me once. He turned out to
be on the board of trustees at MIT. And he

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:05.759
said, "You know, the real job of the board
of trustee at a place like MIT is fundraising.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:13.090
And we did an internal study of alumnus of
MIT to see who are our biggest donors and

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.849
what did they look like as students." And
he said, "You know what we found? It wasn't

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:23.969
the quants, the 4.0s, the people who were
absolutely brilliant all the way through school

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:30.849
who ended up being so successful that they
could give us hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:36.740
It was people who were good enough to get
in and good enough to stay and then get through,

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.999
who had other abilities already. They were
team captains, club presidents. They were

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:47.629
starting their own businesses on the side
already as undergrads. Those were the people

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:53.229
who became the founders and heads of companies
that grew to be big enough that they could

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:59.090
afford to become our biggest donors at MIT."
When I was at the graduate school at Harvard,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:09.039
they did a study, interesting study of how
well your graduate school entry exams predicted

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:15.930
success in that career. They did that in the
business school, medical school, law school,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:23.599
ed school. And does anybody care to hazard
a guess as to what the correlation is between,

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:28.230
say, GMATs, GREs and career success?
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.350
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Negative... what?
&gt;&gt; Low.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:40.150
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Low. Random. It's random. It's
zero, because graduate school entry exams

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:46.330
are designed to predict one thing only--that
is, how well you'll do your first year in

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:57.130
graduate school. They do that very well. The
predictive power of IQ for career success

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:02.320
that's been found in hundreds of studies is
somewhere around 0.2. That means that it accounts

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:10.370
for four percent of the variation. It's a
very small factor. But to look at it in another

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:16.560
way in an organization like this, I'd like
to introduce you to a concept that was developed

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.400
by a professor of mine in Harvard named David
McClelland that's a notion of a competence.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:30.090
He said--back in the ‘70s, he wrote what
was then a very radical paper in the main

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:35.630
psychology journal--he said, “If you want
to hire the best person for a job, any job,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.950
don't look at their GPA, don't look at their
IQ, don't look at their personality test.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:48.160
Instead, begin by looking in your own organization
people who now or in the past held that job,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.440
the one the person is applying for, identify
it by any metric that makes sense, the top

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.340
10 percent, the star performers, compare them
to people who are only average in the systematic

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.930
method. Identify the traits or competencies
or abilities you find in the stars and not

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:10.430
in the average and hire people who look like
the stars.” That's called competence modeling

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:18.180
now. It's a very widespread methodology among
world class organizations who use it to find

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.680
out who should be—who should we be hiring,
who should we be promoting, what should we

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.850
help people develop so that we can be successful
as a company. When I wrote a follow-up book

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:35.040
to Emotional Intelligence, I looked at a couple
of hundred of those models and I was interested

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.100
basically in one thing only, and that was
how many of the competencies that have been

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:48.450
developed, identified independently by companies
around the world and in many different sectors

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:59.740
are purely cognitive, IQ-like abilities, and
how many mix cognitive and emotional capacities?

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.570
And those are the emotional intelligence ones.
And I found that for jobs of all kinds at

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:11.310
basically at every level, these emotional
intelligence competencies were more important

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.080
in predicting who would become outstanding.
That ratio was about two to one. The higher

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.520
you went in the organization, the more it
matters. So, for top leaders, you look at

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:27.010
a competence model of the abilities that we've
identified in outstanding leaders. Here, 80

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:33.910
to 90 percent of them are in the emotional
intelligence domain. IQ turns out to be a

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.890
threshold ability--particularly, of course,
here with Google, it's explicitly so. You

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:45.480
need to be smart enough to get in the game.
Once you're in the game however, what is it

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.870
that is going to allow you to become an emergent
leader and going to allow you to become the

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:58.920
person who is most effective? And, here, it
turns out these other abilities start to factor

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.220
in a major way. These are what are called
distinguishing competencies. And I'll read

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:10.080
you the top six distinguishing competencies
among star performers. This is for individual

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.540
contributors in the tech sector. And is kind
of an aggregate of studies that's been done

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:21.660
in many different tech companies. And you
can tell me if it makes any sense here. The

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:31.990
number one competence that distinguishes stars
from average is the singular drive to achieve,

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:37.940
to improve performance, to make whatever I'm
working on better, faster, quicker, more powerful,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:46.500
more effective. And the sign of this competence
is that people who have it have very high

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:53.260
internal standards for success. They're not
really driven by what other people say matters;

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:59.100
it's that they themselves know how good something
should be. And they hold themselves to that

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.500
standard. You work long hours to achieve that
standard. It's very compelling. People who

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.570
have this like to keep score. You like metrics.
You want to know where you are now: Are you

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:17.221
better or worse? How much better can you be?
Well, doing this help make it better. Another

00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:22.931
sign of this is setting challenging goals.
People who are innovative have this ability.

00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:31.630
Does this make any sense? Yeah? It resonates.
Okay, that's number one. Number two is impact

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:37.530
or influence. And this is being able to make
persuasive arguments, being able to hold your

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:45.070
own in a debate, being able to marshal data
well, to tailor a presentation to the audience

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.630
when, you know, if people are starting to
glaze over one thing, you can shift to another

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:54.471
mode, maybe tell and compelling story or something
like that. Does that make difference? Do you

00:13:54.471 --> 00:14:00.000
think that manifests here? Not that important?
I'm not going to ask for a vote, just you

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.660
can nod or no.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:08.620
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Say again?
&gt;&gt; I think it's more consistent across the

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.620
[INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: More consistent? It's more a standard?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Okay, so it's not a distinguishing

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:17.070
competency here at Google, necessarily. That
could well be. This is for tech, generally.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:23.780
Google is, you know, in a sense, a universal
on its own. Not exactly an alternative reality,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:30.730
but quite close to it. Number three has been
called "conceptual thinking," but it really

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:36.500
means pattern recognition, seeing what matters,
being able to pick up in dare and patterns

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.480
what's crucial, to make essential connections
to identify the underlying problems and fix

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:49.410
them, to recognize what will make a difference,
what can I do that will make a difference.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:55.010
Number four is analysis--breaking problems
down systematically, anticipating obstacles,

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.830
seeing the implication within a complex system
of making a change here, how it will ripple

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:06.190
through and ramify over there, for example,
drawing logical conclusions. By the way, number

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:13.670
three and four are purely cognitive abilities.
Number one and two are within the emotional

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.240
intelligence domain. The next two are also
within the emotional intelligence domain.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.240
Taking on challenges without being told to
do so, being persistent in tackling problems

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.110
and in being self-confident, trusting your
own judgment, for example. Or my friend, the

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:34.420
guy who graduated at 12, he was like supremely
self-confident, oh my god. It also means liking

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.170
to operate independently, not being told what
to do, but having freedom and autonomy. Now,

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.230
these may be more normative than distinguishing.
It would be—it's an interesting question

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:51.870
here at Google where you have kind of the
cream of the cream to look around at the culture

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:59.440
and look around if you can identify what makes
someone outstanding in any way, what the qualities

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:06.560
are here that make people outstanding versus
people who are outstanding in other universes,

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.551
but kind of just normal every day here. And
I'm not claiming to know that, but I think

00:16:12.551 --> 00:16:17.860
you would be using the same methodology I'm
telling you about. So, let's look at the neural

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:26.490
basis of emotional intelligence versus IQ
just to give you a sense of why this matters.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:35.620
And if you humor me, this is like a side view
of the brain, just go along with that, okay?

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:43.070
The brain of all from the bottom up in evolution,
and the brain is basically an elegant machine

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:49.860
for survival and has been shaped by what works
in survival, it turned out that among mammals,

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:56.510
once we got to mammals, you needed to have
a brain that registered emotions because emotions

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:04.400
have in evolution the primary survival function.
There's one structure in the midbrain that's

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:10.140
called the amygdala, which has the brain's
[INDISTINCT], has a privileged position in

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:18.040
perception. Everything we see in every moment
goes mostly to the sensory cortex, but a small

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.240
part of it goes to the amygdala, not to other
structures but to the amygdala, which scans

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:30.400
it to see is this a threat. That's a constant
question in evolution: Is this a threat? Or,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.850
more generally, the amygdala has presumably
been structured in answer to one critical

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:41.920
question for survival: Do I eat it or does
it eat me? This is not a question you want

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.760
to go Google, because in evolution, if you
do, it just ate you. And so you didn't pass

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.310
on this design of brain to us. The amygdala
is a hair trigger. In other words, it would

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.821
rather be safe than sorry. It gets a very
fuzzy picture of what's going on, but if it

00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:07.340
thinks it has a match, it has the ability
to trigger what is called the HPA axis, the

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:14.600
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This
is--this creates a rush of stress hormones,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:22.810
it changes the entire way the brain prioritizes
information. Once this axis has been triggered,

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:32.770
it means that, for example, if the emotion
is fear, everything relevant to what's scaring

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:40.090
us is what preoccupies attention. It captures
attention. It changes the hierarchy within

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:45.500
the memory so that we remember and think about
only what pertains to the thing that is scaring

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:52.770
us at the moment. And it does all the other
things of the classic stress response. It

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.520
takes--it sends energy to the limbs so we
can run or fight and flee or freeze, whatever.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:08.970
So, it's the classic fight-flight-freeze trigger.
The problem is that the amygdala functions

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:15.870
today the way it always has, and we don't
operate in a world now that has actual physical

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:23.370
threats. We have--we operate in a complex
symbolic reality where what we face are complex

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:34.140
symbolic threats. He is not treating me fairly.
She is dissing me. Whatever it may be, these

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:42.800
threats today trigger the HPA axis, the amygdala.
And, so, when we are caught in the grip of

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:51.520
a distressing emotion, it means that attention
narrows and fixates and we get into a state

00:19:51.520 --> 00:20:01.010
which is suboptimal for most of life in ways
I'll unpack for you. Now, one of the things

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:06.870
that the amygdala does is create--when it
really thinks something is urgent--create

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:11.780
what is called an "amygdala hijack," the signs
of which are three. We have a very strong

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:22.140
emotional response. It's very sudden and intense,
and you do something or say something--or

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:32.050
send an email that when that that settles,
you really regret. Right? That is a sign of

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:37.980
an "amygdala hijack." And it happens to really
intelligent people because we get really dumb

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:45.890
when the amygdala takes us over, because we're
being run by our fears and our anger, by emotional

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:53.290
repertoires that were learned unconsciously
in childhood. We become very childlike. Now,

00:20:53.290 --> 00:21:02.040
the good news is when we have an impulse from
the amygdala that goes up to an area just

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:12.500
behind the forehead, which is the prefrontal
cortex. How did that happen? Did you do that?

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:19.750
It's okay. No problem. Sorry.
&gt;&gt; He's nothing but trouble.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:26.970
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: You know the guy. So, the prefrontal
cortex is very important. It's the brain's

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:33.770
executive center. The PFC draws together information
from all over the brain. So when you're having

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:40.540
amygdala hijack, like these guy is not treating
me right, I'm so pissed off, I could slug

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:46.111
him--I'm sure it never happens here, but just
hypothetically, if it ever did--that impulse

00:21:46.111 --> 00:21:52.741
goes up to the executive center and it scans
all other incoming information. It kind of

00:21:52.741 --> 00:21:58.920
Googles the brain very quickly and it tells
and it comes up with that crucial fact you

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:06.460
need to know now, like, "Oh, but this is your
boss."

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:13.150
"So, I'm not going to slug him. I'm going
to smile and change the subject." And that

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:20.440
is exactly the difference between cortical,
purely cortical abilities, which operates

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:26.380
solely in the top of the brain, the neocortex--that's
where the IQ resides--and emotional intelligence

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.980
abilities, which integrate the executive center
and the emotional centers because it's not

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:36.130
just the amygdala, it's an extended network
through the hippocampus and other elements.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:41.570
The amygdala is very widely connected throughout
the brain. So, when I talk about emotional

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:46.680
intelligence at the neural level, I'm talking
about this cortical, neocortical, actually

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:55.900
prefrontal, subcortical integration of abilities.
Now, there are four parts to emotional intelligence.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.220
There are four different domains. The first
two--oh, I forgot something really important.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:07.240
Prefrontal cortex, while I'm on the subject,
it turns out that when the amygdala hijacks,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.790
it drives and takes over the right side of
the prefrontal cortex. If you do a brain imaging

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.480
when someone is having a hijack, someone is
really scared or angry, you see a lot of activity

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:23.790
in the amygdala and related circuits and a
lot of activity on the right. When we're feeling

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:32.110
good, we're having a great day, we're... good
energy, I could take on anything, very enthusiastic

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:36.490
and so on, you see a very different picture
in the prefrontal cortex, the right is quiet

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:42.870
and the left is hardly active. Each of us--it's
been discovered by a fellow named Richard

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:49.760
Davidson at the University of Wisconsin--each
of us has a resting ratio of right to left

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.400
activation that predicts quite accurately
our mood range day to day. There's a bell

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.929
curve for it. Most of us are in the middle.
We have good days, we have bad days. If you're

00:24:00.929 --> 00:24:06.850
very far to the right, it means that you are
probably clinically depressed or have an anxiety

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:13.480
disorder. If you're very far to the left,
things just roll off you. You hardly ever

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:22.120
have a bad day. And what the left does that
the right does not do is have an inhibitory

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:28.420
circuit for the amygdala. So, the amygdala
sends out these thoughts that could become

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.860
what are called depressogenic thoughts, something
really upsetting or that could provoke an

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.360
anxiety or make you really angry. And the
left prefrontal cortex basically says, "Shut

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:46.050
up. I don't want to... I don't need to hear
that now," and it clams the amygdala. So,

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:55.059
people who have this ability have more good
days, more high energy, more self-confidence,

00:24:55.059 --> 00:25:05.050
more enthusiasm and better moods, basically.
So, the first two elements of emotional intelligence

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:11.140
have to do with self mastery. And they are
based--this circuitry is the neuro platform.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.330
The first of these is self-awareness--knowing
what I'm feeling, knowing why I'm feeling

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:24.890
it. Self-awareness is very important for decision-making,
particularly personal decision-making, but

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.730
also business or even technical decision-making
for quite an interesting reason. There was

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:39.950
a study done by a man named Antonio Damasio.
He is now at UCS. He's an expert on this circuitry.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:51.980
And because he is an expert on this circuitry,
a very bright corporate lawyer who unfortunately

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:58.970
had a prefrontal brain tumor which was operated
on quite successfully and early but during

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:06.900
surgery they snipped the connection between
the amygdala and the PFC. This lawyer went

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:17.720
to see Damasio because his life was collapsing.
And Damasio tested him and couldn't see anything

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:25.900
wrong. The lawyer's life had collapsed in
this way. He seemed to be able to function

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:31.460
just as well after surgery as before, but
he couldn't keep his job. He lost his job.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.900
He couldn't keep any job. His wife left him.
He lost his house. He ended up living in his

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.720
brother's spare bedroom. And, in despair,
he goes to Damasio. He says, "Well, you're

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.429
an expert on the circuitry, can you figure
out what's wrong with me?" Damasio gives him

00:26:43.429 --> 00:26:48.650
a battery of neuropsychological tests. Nothing
wrong. Attention, memory, just as good as

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:56.990
before surgery. IQ was very high still after
surgery as it was before. But he couldn't

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:03.111
keep a job. And then Damasio got a clue. He
asked him this question: When shall we have

00:27:03.111 --> 00:27:08.800
our next appointment? He realized that the
lawyer could give him the rational pros and

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.510
cons of every hour for the next two weeks,
but he didn't know which was best. In other

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:23.240
words, Damasio argues, when we have a thought,
our emotional centers valence it for us. When

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:32.670
we're making a decision, our emotional centers
prioritize for us. He no longer had that ability.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:38.910
Damasio argues that in order to make a good
decision--you know, which strategy should

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:48.530
we follow, should our team go for plan A or
plan B, how does this guy compared to the,

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:53.910
you know, X other guys I've dated, should
I marry this guy or not, should I leave this

00:27:53.910 --> 00:28:02.990
job for another--all of those decisions depend
on our ability to draw on the wisdom of the

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.911
emotions. The wisdom of emotions is not just
a pretty phrase. It actually refers to something

00:28:06.911 --> 00:28:16.360
that goes on very low in the brain, in the
basal ganglia, its base brain. The basal ganglia

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:23.290
absorbs everything we do in life, every situation
and extracts decisions rules. That worked,

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.500
that didn't work. When I said that, I really
blew it. When I said that, it really worked.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:34.760
Our life wisdom on any topic is stored in
the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is so

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:41.980
primitive that it has zero connectivity to
the verbal cortex. It can't tell us what it

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:47.670
knows in words. It tells us in feelings, has
a lot of connectivity, the emotional centers

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:54.429
of the brain and to the gut. And it tells
us this is right or this is wrong as a gut

00:28:54.429 --> 00:29:02.850
feeling. So part of self-awareness is the
ability to tune in to those subtle feelings.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:08.910
And this is very important for example, not
just in decisions but when it comes to ethics

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:14.070
and integrity. The answer to the question
is what I'm about to do in keeping with my

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.830
sense of ethics--meaning, priorities, values
or whatever. It doesn't come to us verbally.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:25.170
It comes to us through the same nonverbal
neural system. And we've got to be able to

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:36.500
attune to feeling to read yes or no. So it's
a kind of moral rudder, too, in life. The

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:45.490
second ability in emotional intelligence is
managing emotions. And managing emotions really

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.160
has to do with our inhibitory ability. I don't
mean managing all emotions. I mean managing

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:58.170
the disturbing, crippling, dysphoric emotions,
the ones that get in the way, because emotions

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:03.490
of course are what make life rich. You want
to mobilize your passions. In fact, the center

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:11.480
for motivation for maintaining goal and pursuing
it is in the left prefrontal cortex. The left

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:19.890
prefrontal cortex with the connection to the
hippocampus as a node for memory is what helps

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:24.770
us keep in mind how good we're going to feel
when we finish this. And that's probably very

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:30.970
important around here, I think, because if
you don't have that capacity to keep reminding

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:38.490
you about how it's going to feel, you give
up. So, motivation very much depends on this

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:48.240
circuitry. Another ability has to do with
how--with the relationship between emotionality,

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.679
impulsiveness and learning. There was a study
done just down the road here, at Stanford,

00:30:53.679 --> 00:31:00.110
many years ago with four-year-olds, kids in
Stanford preschool. And these are children

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:06.299
of professors and graduate of Stanford. And
each kid was brought in the room one by one,

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:12.523
sat down at a small table, and a big juicy
marshmallow was put in front of them. And

00:31:12.523 --> 00:31:16.880
the experimenter says to the kids, “You
can have this marshmallow now if you want,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.861
but of you wait to eat till I come back for
running an errand, you can have two of that.”

00:31:22.861 --> 00:31:29.710
Then the experimenter leaves the room. This
is a situation, a predicament really that

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:35.160
tries the souls of any four-year-old, I think.
&gt;&gt; Or for the rest of us.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.390
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Or the rest of us for that matter,
yeah. And I've seen the footage. It's very

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:44.130
funny. Some of the kids will smell it and
then jump away like it was very dangerous.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:50.960
Some kids go off in the corner and sing and
dance to distract themselves. About a third

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.620
of the kids wait out the endless four or five
minutes till, you know, the experimenter comes

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.450
back and they get the two. And about a third
couldn't stand it. They just gobble it down

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:07.040
on the spot. But the payoff finding came fourteen
years later. These kids are tracked down as

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.000
they're about to graduate high school. And
the two groups are compared--the kids who

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.340
grabbed and the ones who waited. Very interesting,
kind of, staggering differences it turns out

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:23.110
from such a small data point. The kids who
waited compared to the ones who grabbed get

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:28.160
along better with their friends. They're still
able to defer gratification and pursue their

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:36.370
goals. And the stunner was this. On their
SATs, they scored 210 points higher. It's

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:41.290
at 16 or more than standard deviation. I told
this to the people at Princeton who make up

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:48.480
the SAT, they were stunned. They said that's
as big as the difference we see between kids

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.920
whose parents have--one parent has a graduate
degree, at least, and kids whose parents have

00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:00.179
no education. It's a huge difference. But
these were all children of Stanford folks,

00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:07.669
very high IQ family, so what's going on here?
What I think is going on is that impulsivity,

00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:16.250
agitation is the sign of the amygdala being
poorly inhibited. And kids who can't inhibit

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:23.720
the amygdala do something or have a predicament
in learning situation which handicaps them.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:30.870
And, that is--remember what I said that when
the amygdala fires up, attention focuses on--and

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:36.419
fixates actually on what is disturbing us,
you know, those other girls won't play with

00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:44.809
me. The melodramas of, you know, late elementary
school, whatever it may be. When that happens,

00:33:44.809 --> 00:33:50.630
it occupies the space of what's called the
“working memory.” Working memory is attention.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:56.430
You may remember from cognitive science the
working--the capacity of working memory is

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:01.290
a magic number seven plus or minus two bits
of information. Well, if six of those bits

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.410
of information have to do with those other
girls on the playground, it means you have

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:11.669
one bit of information left for what the teacher
is saying to you. In other words, the SAT,

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:16.069
which is an achievement test--it's not an
IQ test, an achievement test, it's a test

00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:24.149
of how much you learned over the course of
school--shows that if you are chronically

00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:32.039
handicapped in this ability, you will not
be able to learn. That's the bottom line from

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:37.500
that study. And I think it's true in any situation,
in any work situation no matter what you're

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:44.129
trying to do. The extent to which your mind
is preoccupied by distressing emotions is

00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:51.450
going to shrink cognitive capacity and make
it harder for you to do the work at hand.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:57.700
On the other hand, you could say that the
ability to inhibit distressing emotions from

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:06.829
the amygdala is an enabler of cognitive capacity
because it leaves full attention available

00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:17.549
for what you're trying to do. So, let's look
at this from another angle, and that is if

00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:23.510
we were to--this is the way to map what's
happening with that HPA axis, the amygdala

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:35.039
reactivity against performance in any domain.
So, here's

00:35:35.039 --> 00:35:48.920
performance and here's high and low HPA actively.
And the function between them is an inverted

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.710
U. This has been known for a hundred years
in psychology. But what this really means

00:35:53.710 --> 00:36:03.700
is that when your HPA axis low, that's another
way of saying you're really bored. You're

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:10.550
just not into it, not engaged. And if you
look at what's going on the brain, there is

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:17.769
a very fuzzy pattern of activation. Basically,
your daydreams are as strong as your, okay,

00:36:17.769 --> 00:36:24.700
work cortex or whatever is going on. However,
the more engaged you get, the more motivated,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:30.369
the closer the deadline, the more interesting
the challenge, et cetera, the more cortisol--that's

00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:39.890
an indicator of HPA level--goes up and performance
goes up. There is an optimal zone here which

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:46.109
is where you want to get and stay. This is
marked by what's called "flow." I don't know

00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:50.849
if you know the literature on flow. Some of
you do. But for those who don't, a study by

00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:56.920
a guy named [INDISTINCT] Mahalia--Mahalia
[INDISTINCT], actually. We call him Mike,

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:03.650
for short. And he did something really interesting
several years ago. He studied people who were

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:10.020
from many, many domains like brains surgeons,
basketball players, ballerinas, chess players,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.030
and so on, and he asked them to describe the
same thing. Tell me about the time you outdid

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.770
yourself. Even you were surprised by how well
you did. And he realized that they're all

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:27.099
describing phenomenologically the same brain
state. And it's a state in which your attention

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:36.380
is fully focused, it's unbreakable, undistracted.
Your skills are really challenged by the demand

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:42.150
but adequate, able to handle it and it feels
really good. He argues most of the things

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:47.229
we do in life voluntarily we do because they
get us in a kind of a flow state. People who

00:37:47.229 --> 00:37:57.049
are--you know, when you really have--you know,
you're feeling buzzed and on, that's flow.

00:37:57.049 --> 00:38:05.609
One of the signs of it is feeling good. Damasio,
the same guy who consulted with a lawyer says

00:38:05.609 --> 00:38:14.039
that the feeling of enjoyment during an activity
is an indicator or proxy for optimal cognitive

00:38:14.039 --> 00:38:20.049
functioning. Optimal cognitive functioning
means your IQ is going as much as it can.

00:38:20.049 --> 00:38:24.390
You know, you can be creative. You can be
innovative. You can make associations. You

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:34.609
can figure--solve problems at your best. Then,
however, if this continues, HPA activity continues,

00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:39.359
like you've got too much to do, too little
support, too little time, your life is falling

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:48.569
apart, you feel frazzled. The neurophysiology
of frazzle is not--is that the HPA axis has

00:38:48.569 --> 00:38:56.430
gotten to a point where you're not only secreting
huge amount of cortisol but a big dollop of

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:03.930
adrenaline and things fall apart cortically
because you're completely preoccupied by what's

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:09.190
causing the frazzle, with just dealing with
the problems of life. So, the best place to

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:16.819
be for cortisol effectiveness, to leverage
IQ skills is right there. And that is an emotional

00:39:16.819 --> 00:39:23.979
place. It's a place that is determined by
the emotional brain. So, in this sense, I'd

00:39:23.979 --> 00:39:31.079
argue that the self-mastery aspect of emotional
intelligence is catalytic for whatever cognitive

00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:37.880
abilities or talents you may have. Now, the
second two elements of emotional intelligence

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:46.249
have to do with what's called the social brain.
The social brain is actually quite newly discovered.

00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:51.839
The discovery occurred when neuroscientists
decided to go beyond studying one brain and

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:58.819
one body and one person and to look at what
happens in two brains, when two brains and

00:39:58.819 --> 00:40:03.140
two bodies and two people are interacting.
And they discovered circuits that they didn't

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:08.630
even know existed. They discovered that the
brain is designed to connect, are wired to

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:13.710
connect with the social brain of the other
person. It's the only part of human anatomy

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:20.670
that is designed to attune to and regulate
itself according to the internal state of

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:26.609
the other person. The big, the first big breakthrough
was something called "mirror neurons." Mirror

00:40:26.609 --> 00:40:35.420
neurons were discovered one day when some
Italian neuroscientists were mapping the motor

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:41.549
cortex of a monkey and they're doing single
cell recordings. And, one afternoon, they

00:40:41.549 --> 00:40:49.599
were watching a neuron which only fired when
the monkey raised its arm. And, one day, the

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:55.729
cell fired and the monkey hadn't moved. The
monkey's arm hadn't moved. And then they realized

00:40:55.729 --> 00:41:00.430
what's going on. It was a hot day and a lab
assistant had gone out to get an ice cream

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:06.210
cone and every time he took a lick, the neuron
in the monkey's brain for doing that fired.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:13.069
That's what mirror neurons do in our brains.
It turns out that we have a diffused set,

00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:20.570
a ray of neurons, that elicit and activate
in us a mirror image of what the other person

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:26.799
is doing, feeling, or intending. And this
is what allows us to synchronize interactions.

00:41:26.799 --> 00:41:37.550
This is what lets all the tacit, the tacit
decision rules that let an interaction go

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:43.170
smoothly occur without our having to think
about it. The social brain operates from the

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:47.640
unconscious level, beneath consciousness,
but it tells you when a conversation is about

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:54.670
to end. In a room, when you got a group trying
to make a decision, social brains know the

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:59.650
moment before someone announces it that we've
got a consensus here because we're reading

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:04.729
everyone else's non-verbals all the time.
And then somebody says, “Oh, I guess, it

00:42:04.729 --> 00:42:09.660
looks like this," and everybody nods and then
you can leave, but it's done by the mirror

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:17.739
neurons. Another thing that's very important
they find is that this means there is an emotional

00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:25.650
subtext to every human interaction. No matter
what's going on explicitly, tacitly, we're

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:31.739
making each other feel a little worse or a
little better, or a lot worse or a lot better

00:42:31.739 --> 00:42:37.270
at this sign off level. They've looked at
top leaders in many different organizations,

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:42.469
people who are identified by some hard metrics
within the organization that they're on top

00:42:42.469 --> 00:42:49.559
ten percent, and they watched how they interacted
with other people. And they found, interestingly,

00:42:49.559 --> 00:42:54.690
those most effective leaders laughed three
times more. In both, there was laughter three

00:42:54.690 --> 00:43:00.630
times more in that interaction than the mediocre
leaders. It turns out there are mirror neurons

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:06.930
whose sole task is to spot a smile or a laugh
and make us smile and laugh in return. It's

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:13.150
like an intimate brain to brain connection.
It builds rapport. If you look at what's going

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:19.150
on during moments of rapport, you're seeing
the social brain in action. If you maunder

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:24.729
the physiology and neurology of two people's
bodies while they're having a conversation,

00:43:24.729 --> 00:43:30.920
if things are awful, just not connecting,
we're not communicating here, the two bodies,

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:36.400
the physiology is independent. But when people
feel really connected, this is really, you

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:41.279
know, had a good rapport, we had good chemistry,
you see the bodies are going like this. And

00:43:41.279 --> 00:43:44.710
I'm talking about [INDISTINCT]. I'm talking
about physiology. I'm talking about autonomic

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:53.749
function. We're on the same page. The ingredients
of rapport, a moment of rapport are three.

00:43:53.749 --> 00:44:00.489
Both people are paying full attention. You're
really attuned. The non-verbals look like

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:07.150
a choreographed dance. You know, when I do
this, you do that. It's not anything we decide

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:12.710
to do unless we're doing each other or offering
salsa lessons here, but other than that. But

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:20.739
this is what creates a feeling of being well
connected. And the third thing that happened

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:27.349
emergent from that is it feels good. So, the
key to rapport is to pay full attention and

00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:33.739
let the social brains do their dance. That
creates that chemistry. Some other interesting

00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:43.640
findings from the social brain, one has--I
find very fascinating. People--women, one

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:49.080
by one are having the brain's image and they're
just been told they're going to get an electric

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:57.920
shock. You see the HPA axis light up. If someone
comes and holds some woman's hand, it quiets

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:05.339
down. If a little bit, however, if her husband
comes and holds your hand, it goes completely

00:45:05.339 --> 00:45:12.660
calm. In other words, we are biological allies
for the people in our lives who love us and

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:19.920
who we loved. Your mere presence for someone
who you care about, who's distressed, does

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:26.940
something inside their body which is healthful.
On the other side of the equation, of course,

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:36.150
it can work quite the other way. I was talking
to a woman who had a death of a sibling and

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:41.190
she's very upset and she got a condolence
call, a phone call from someone who had a

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.489
brother died and she thought she could really
open to him by how she felt, so, she's kind

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:50.479
barring her feelings of loss and grief. And
then she noticed, in the background, she could

00:45:50.479 --> 00:46:00.319
hear the clicking of a keyboard. Really? Are
you kidding? No way. And she realized that

00:46:00.319 --> 00:46:05.450
this guy was doing his e-mail, and she said
she felt like she'd been punched in the stomach.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:16.740
And the circuitry for emotional hurts, social
rejection is identical to that which registers

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:23.440
pain. So, because we don't have enough time,
I won't tell you how old this manifest is

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:30.009
in text stars, but it's in the books or--and
you're all getting the book for free, right?

00:46:30.009 --> 00:46:34.479
Yeah. Some of you. Okay. That's beyond my
control.

00:46:34.479 --> 00:46:40.619
&gt;&gt; The rest must [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Yeah. Well, I just punch on the

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:51.969
stomach, so I guess that's the end of my time.
Let me fast-forward here to say that the good

00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:58.599
news is that the circuitry which manages these
emotional intelligence abilities is malleable

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:04.410
through life. It's called neuroplasticity.
And we can continue to strengthen and build

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:11.180
this circuitry if we have the right learning
situation. It turns out one of the ways to

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:18.430
build this platform generically, and this
is kind of a surprise, is through meditation.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:22.340
Davidson, who discovered the left-right racial
has been studying Olympic-level meditators

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:26.680
and he finds that there's a [INDISTINCT] response
relationship. The longer you've been meditating,

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:33.369
the stronger the circuitry in the left prefrontal
cortex becomes for managing and inhibiting

00:47:33.369 --> 00:47:38.161
distressing emotions, and the better you feel.
And it's not just Olympic-level meditators,

00:47:38.161 --> 00:47:46.849
he's found in studies--study in a high pressure
tech company, which will not be named, that

00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:53.240
if you start to meditate, you see the beginning
of strengthening of that very circuitry within

00:47:53.240 --> 00:48:04.489
the first eight weeks. So, the neural basis
for all of this can be generally upgraded.

00:48:04.489 --> 00:48:10.049
It's the bottom line. And the Meng tells me
that there's a meditation group here once

00:48:10.049 --> 00:48:14.940
a week and I think there's going to be a course
at Google University for those of you who

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:23.719
are interested. But let me end with a finding
from this study of advance meditators. There

00:48:23.719 --> 00:48:31.640
was one guy and he was actually here, Matthieu
Ricard. He was being studied and they wanted

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.420
to see, those that kind of studying the social
brain aspects of it, they want to see how

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:45.229
he did in a kind of a debate, a confrontation.
And they used a paradigm that's familiar from

00:48:45.229 --> 00:48:50.829
marital research were a couple will have a
talk about something they disagree about and

00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:56.990
have their neurophysiology measured, [INDISTINCT],
and so on during the conversation, but because

00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:02.071
he was a monk, they couldn't ask to do it
with his wife. So they did kind of a quiet

00:49:02.071 --> 00:49:07.990
survey in the UC system of who the most abrasive
confrontational professor might be and, oddly

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:12.740
enough, everybody agreed right away. So, they
called that guy and said in the interest of

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.711
science would you take part in this. They
didn't say why he'd been selected. And he

00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:24.130
said sure. And--but then as the day grew near,
he kept making demands, which became more

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:28.299
and more unreasonable. So they had to dump
him and go with the second most confrontational.

00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:37.049
So the day comes and Ricard, who gave up his
promising career in microbiology at the Pasteur

00:49:37.049 --> 00:49:44.279
Institute, his mentor actually won a Noble
Prize, he decided to drop that and go meditate

00:49:44.279 --> 00:49:50.229
in a hut, in Nepal for 25 years. The proposition
was that this professor should give up his

00:49:50.229 --> 00:49:55.680
ten-year position and do the same thing. So
the measures, the blood pressure, and so on

00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:01.219
show that--or heart rate rather, and so on--showed
that at the beginning of the debate, the professor

00:50:01.219 --> 00:50:07.450
was really worked up, really agitated. His
HPA axis was flipping out. Ricard was very

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:13.400
calm. Over the course of the 15-minute debate
on a topic, Ricard stays completely calm and

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.369
the professor gets more and more, and more
calm. At the end of 15 minutes, he's having

00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:26.719
such a good time, he didn't want to stop.
And what this says is that if we have a very

00:50:26.719 --> 00:50:33.239
well-groomed, left prefrontal cortex, we can
spread that good feeling as part of every

00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:52.269
interaction with everyone during the course
of the day. Thank you very much. Do we have

00:50:52.269 --> 00:50:53.479
time for questions?
&gt;&gt; I think we do a time for questions, if

00:50:53.479 --> 00:51:07.001
you like to take some. Shall we?
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Yeah. Any questions? Yes. There's

00:51:07.001 --> 00:51:11.039
a mic there actually. It may be...
&gt;&gt; We have to take only one or two questions.

00:51:11.039 --> 00:51:12.189
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: One or two. We need to vacate
the room.

00:51:12.189 --> 00:51:20.609
&gt;&gt; So, there's a recent book by Al Gore, Assault
on Reason, and the first, you know, 20, 30

00:51:20.609 --> 00:51:25.819
percent has a lot to do with research like
this, about, you know, how people make decisions

00:51:25.819 --> 00:51:29.940
and fear drive things. Have you seen that?
And do you have any comments on, you know,

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.969
if he's taking too many liberties or if it's
fairly straight off.

00:51:32.969 --> 00:51:36.519
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: I'm afraid I haven't read the
book, so I can't comment.

00:51:36.519 --> 00:51:41.529
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
&gt;&gt; Hi. I've read that one of hallmarks of

00:51:41.529 --> 00:51:44.441
people with ADD is they're more impulsive...
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: True.

00:51:44.441 --> 00:51:53.119
&gt;&gt; ...and that the same level of stress which
would be productive for typically, typical

00:51:53.119 --> 00:52:00.769
people can send them into... grow the HPA
overall...

00:52:00.769 --> 00:52:05.259
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Besides meditation, are there things that...

00:52:05.259 --> 00:52:10.950
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Well, you could say that meditation
is a non-pharmaceutical [INDISTINCT] for those

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:20.289
kids because what it does is strengthen their
own capability to calm that impulsivity. And

00:52:20.289 --> 00:52:26.359
I personally feel it makes more sense to give
kids--to have kids do some internal skill

00:52:26.359 --> 00:52:32.989
building than to medicate them.
&gt;&gt; Do you have any advice for parents if you

00:52:32.989 --> 00:52:37.929
have children who are--don't seem to have
a lot of emotional intelligence?

00:52:37.929 --> 00:52:41.190
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: First of all...
&gt;&gt; And can pets help?

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.139
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: And what?
&gt;&gt; And can pets help?

00:52:43.139 --> 00:52:50.569
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Can pets help? Well, a really
emotionally intelligent pet probably can.

00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:54.369
First of all, the thing about kids is by definition,
they don't have a lot of emotional intelligence.

00:52:54.369 --> 00:53:00.930
The--there's the learning, the reason is that
this PFC amygdala circuitry is the last part

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:07.059
of the brain to be put in place, atomically
doesn't fully mature until mid-20s. So you

00:53:07.059 --> 00:53:13.769
have to be patient with kids because they
don't have from the get-go the inhibitory

00:53:13.769 --> 00:53:22.289
abilities that we do. And when you help them
empathize, when you help them--they use something,

00:53:22.289 --> 00:53:27.469
there are programs called social emotional
learning which teach these skills in schools,

00:53:27.469 --> 00:53:32.390
and one thing they have is on the wall of
every room, a stop light that says, "When

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:37.410
you're upset, remember the stop light, red
light, stop, calm down, think before you act."

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:42.640
Yellow light, think of a range of things you
could do. Green light, try out the best one.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:48.459
And any time you as a parent can help your
kid do some analogue of that, you're strengthening

00:53:48.459 --> 00:53:53.760
the inhibitory circuitry left PFC, which--and
the other thing you can do for the social

00:53:53.760 --> 00:54:00.600
brain is to help kids understand why they
feel the way they do and how, what they do

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:07.430
makes other people feel. And you need to teach
those lessons repeatedly at the right cognitive

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:14.170
level as kids change and develop mentally.
So, just wait. You know, by their 20's, it

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:20.910
would be fine.
&gt;&gt; Professor, thanks for coming. I'm a big

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:22.519
fan of all your work.
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Thanks.

00:54:22.519 --> 00:54:30.350
&gt;&gt; Have you ever study people that are in
love, whether or not the EQ or IQ, you know,

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:38.219
function of the brain work a little bit better?
I'm trying to understand my girlfriend better.

00:54:38.219 --> 00:54:47.779
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: Well, is your girlfriend here?
&gt;&gt; No, she isn't.

00:54:47.779 --> 00:54:56.259
&gt;&gt; GOLEMAN: I can't help you understand your
girlfriend. In the book Social Intelligence,

00:54:56.259 --> 00:55:01.539
I talk about the three different brain systems
that are involved in love. One of them is

00:55:01.539 --> 00:55:08.040
an attachment system, which is who you care
about and miss when they're not present. The

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:13.719
other is a caring system, care taking, the
people you want, the person or people in your

00:55:13.719 --> 00:55:20.559
life you wanted to take care of or nurture.
And the third is sex. When all three of those

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:26.949
things are activated and aimed at the same
person, you've got a really strong relationship.

00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:32.479
But the one of those three that most strongly
determines whether the relationship will last

00:55:32.479 --> 00:55:38.210
is caring. So that's just a general advice.
I don't think it has anything to do with your

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.559
girlfriend particularly, but just in general.
