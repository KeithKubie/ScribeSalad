1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,370
I'm going to jump right off into
a different train cart here.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,390
Has Law enforcement ever asked you to
keep certain people on the platform even

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:07,530
after they violated your rules?

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,443
Uh,

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,200
not that I'm aware. So then
this, you know, to the,

6
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:15,980
to the next question pertaining to bias,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,140
you have the issue of Antifa versus
the proud boys and Patriot prayer and a

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,680
Twitter permanently excised anyone
associated with the proud boys antifa

9
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:28,060
accounts who have broken
the rules repeatedly branded
known cells that have been

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,470
involved in violence all still active.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,120
Okay.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,660
Is there a reason? Well, with the proud
boys, what we were able to do was, um,

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,820
actually look at documentation
and announcements that, you know,

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,210
the leaders of that organization had made
and their use of violence in the real

15
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,930
world. So that was the war we were focused
on. And subsequent to our decision,

16
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:50,410
I believe the FBI also designated that's
not true. It's not true. That's not true.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,090
No. Okay. No, that's not true.
Yeah. You know, the proud
boys started out as a joke.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,450
Gavin McInnes, Anthony [inaudible],
who was a part of Opie,

19
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:01,480
and Anthony knows his own show,
tall told me about it.

20
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:05,530
It happened on his show because there
was a guy that was on the show and they

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,170
made a joke about starting a gang
based on him, cause he was a very,

22
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:13,330
a feminine guy. And they would call
him the proud boys. And I'm the,

23
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:18,331
they went into detail about how this
thing became from a joke and saying that

24
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,460
you could join the proud boys
and everyone was, you know,

25
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:26,290
it was like being silly to people joining
it and then it becoming this thing to

26
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:31,291
fight antifa and then becoming infested
with white nationalists and becoming

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,990
this thing well in, in, in
many ways it hell it was,

28
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,290
but it's been documented how it started
and what it was and misrepresented as to

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,193
why it was started.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,930
I think there's some things that
should be clarified about them,

31
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,450
but Gavin has made a bunch of
statements that crossed the line.

32
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:53,080
He claims he claims to be joking. And so
that's, that's what he did on my podcast.

33
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:55,060
He was talking to me about Antifa,

34
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:58,960
the Antifa was blocking people like
Ben Shapiro's speeches and things along

35
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,970
those lines and stopping
conservatives for speaking,

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,860
you should just just
punched him in the face.

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,080
We're going to have to start kicking
people's asses. And I was like, oh,

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,890
this is the risk,

39
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,340
not just irresponsible but foolish and
short sighted and it's just a dumb way to

40
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:13,270
talk. So then you have the antifa groups
that are engaging in the same thing.

41
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,420
We've, we, you know, the famous bike lock
basher incident where a guy showed up,

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,860
hit seven, uh, he hit seven people
over that with a bike lock. Um,

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,060
they subsequently release his name.

44
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,330
I'm going to leave that out for
the time being. You have, uh,

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,650
other groups like by any means, by
any means necessary. You have in, um,

46
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,210
uh, Portland for instance, there
specific branded factions. There is a,

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,200
the tweet I mentioned earlier where
they doxed ice agents and they said,

48
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,990
do whatever inspires you with
this information. And I mean,

49
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:42,850
you're tagged in it a million times.
I know you probably can't see it,

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,760
but you can actually see that some of
the tweets and the threat are removed.

51
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,290
But the main tweet itself,

52
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,830
from an antifascist account linking
to a website straight up saying like,

53
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:52,030
here's the private home details,

54
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,640
phone number addresses of these law
enforcement officers is not removed since

55
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,090
September. So here's what
you end up seeing is, uh,

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,210
again to point think one of
the big problems I have in
this country is the media

57
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,350
because it was reported that
the FBI designated probably
was an extremist group,

58
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,540
but it was a misinterpretation based,
uh, a sheer wrote a draft saying with,

59
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,670
you know,
the FBI considers them to be extremists.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,270
The media then reported hearsay from the
sheriff and the FBI came out and said,

61
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,980
no, no, no, we never meant
to do that. That's not true.

62
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,940
We are just concerned about violence. So
the proud boys all get purged. And again,

63
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,560
I think, you know, Gavin's
a different story, right?

64
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,930
If you want to go after the individuals
who are associated with that group

65
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,050
versus the guy who goes on the show and
says outrageous things and goes on Joe's

66
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,870
show.
But then you have antifa branded sells.

67
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,540
Like what I mean by that is
they have specific names.

68
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,560
They sell merchandise and they're the
ones showing up throwing mortar shells

69
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,060
into crowds.
They're the ones showing up with,

70
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,860
with crowbars and bats and
whacking people. I was in, uh,

71
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,140
Boston and there was a rally
where conservatives were
planning on putting on a

72
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:47,321
rally.

73
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,740
It was literally just like Libertarians
and conservatives antifa shows up with

74
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:54,730
crowbars bats in balaclavas
with weapons threatening them.

75
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,580
And so I have to wonder if,
if you know,

76
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,410
these people are allowed to
organize in your platform.

77
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,910
Are you concerned about that?

78
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,940
Why aren't they being banned when they
violate the rules? Yeah, absolutely.

79
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,070
We're concerned about that. Has the FBI
designated them? That's a domestic terror,

80
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,350
yes. Oh, I'm sorry.

81
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,240
Homeland Security in New Jersey has listed
them under domestic terrorism. Okay.

82
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,840
So, so here, here, I understand
there's a conundrum in that.

83
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,170
The general concept of Anti
Fascism is a loose term.

84
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,700
That means you oppose fascism,
but antifa is now they have a flag,

85
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,410
they've had a flag since the Soviet,
you know,

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,500
so a Nazi Germany in the Soviet era
and they've brought it back there.

87
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,920
Specific groups that I'm not going to
mention by name that have specific names

88
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,200
and they sell merchandise. They have
appeared in various news outlets.

89
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,170
They've expressed their desire to
use violence to suppress speech.

90
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,230
There was a centralized
organization the same way that I,

91
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:43,450
I hear you on proper ways but like where
they have like tenants that are written

92
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,240
out and there was a leader in like uh,

93
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,030
no it's not the same but there
are specific brand itself.

94
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,580
So that's why I bring them up.
Specifically I realized, you know,

95
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:54,160
someone showing up to a rally wearing
a black hoodie and sunglasses.

96
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,053
We who are you gonna ban?

97
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,190
But there are groups that
organize specifically call
for violence. They, they,

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,890
they pushed the line as close
as, as, as lightly as possible.

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,730
They advocate sabotage and
things like this. And you know,

100
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,990
when the proud boys go
out and get into fights,

101
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,860
they're not getting in fights with
themselves. They're, you know, so, uh,

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,900
I should point out that the,

103
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:16,901
they decided to call for violence based
on Antifa calling for violence based on

104
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:21,430
Antifa actually actively committing
violence against conservative people that

105
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,400
were there to see different people's,

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,410
it partly started because in
Berkeley there was a Trump rally.

107
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:29,190
So actually after my low got chased
out of the Berkeley, they were,

108
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,000
there was $100,000 in damages.
I mean,

109
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,220
there's a video of some
guy in all black cracking.

110
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:35,830
Someone on the back was on the ground
looking like they're unconscious.

111
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,580
So these conservatives see this and they
decided to hold a rally saying we won't

112
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:43,750
back down. They hold a rally in
Berkeley and then Antifa shows up again.

113
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,910
I understand. You can't figure out who
these people are. For the most part,

114
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,230
they're decentralized, but
then a, this insights, uh,

115
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:53,350
an escalation. You then get the rise of
the base to stick. Man, they called it,

116
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:56,050
this guy shows up in armor with a
stick and he starts swinging back.

117
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,890
And now you have two forming.

118
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,960
So while I recognize it's much easier
to ban a top down group, there are,

119
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,380
you know,

120
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,990
the difference I would get I guess is
why when you look at the proud boys,

121
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,310
it's straight,
top down vertical.

122
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,550
You look at Antifa and there's different
cells of varying size and their

123
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,880
different accounts. So
I have to, uh, to like,

124
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,670
I guess the argument I could make as if
you're going to bend the proud boys by

125
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:18,320
all means for under your justification.

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,850
But if you look at a specific channel
that's got 20,000 followers that cheers

127
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:25,640
them on, right? These are people
who throw mortar shells into crowds.

128
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,840
Isn't that advocating for,
you know, terrorism and
incitement to violence? Yeah,

129
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,220
absolutely. So I guess the question
is how come they don't get removed?

130
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,390
Well, in the past when we've
looked at, um, Antifa, we, it's,

131
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,100
we ran into this decentralization issue,

132
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:43,400
which is we weren't able to find the same
type of information that we were able

133
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,540
to find about proud boys,

134
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:49,430
which was a centralized leadership base
documentation of what they stand for.

135
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,290
Um,
but absolutely.

136
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,480
I mean it's something that we'll continue
to look into and to the extent that

137
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,540
they're using Twitter to organize any
sort of offline violence that's completely

138
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,310
prohibited under our rules and
we would absolutely take action.

139
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,970
Why Gavin was band did,

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,300
was there a specific thing that he did
or was it as an association with the

141
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,070
proud boys association with the problem,
you know,

142
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:11,480
he's a abandoned that he's not only that
he's disassociated himself with it and

143
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,010
said that he'd completely got out of hand.

144
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,390
He doesn't want to have
anything to do with it.

145
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,560
Yeah. And I think this is a great again
test case for how we think about getting

146
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,820
people back on the platform.

147
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,010
Yeah.
In the long term.

148
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,390
He's an interesting case because he's
a really a provocateur and he fancies

149
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:29,470
himself, you know, sort of a punk rocker
and he just, he likes stirring shit.

150
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,380
I mean [inaudible] when he came
on my show last time he was on,

151
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:36,130
he was dressed up like a Michael
Douglas and falling down, you know,

152
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,040
he did it on purpose. He brought a
briefcase and everything. I'm like,

153
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,100
what are you doing? He's like a Michael
Douglas, some falling down like he's,

154
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,370
he's a showman in many ways and he did
not mean for this to go the way it went.

155
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,030
He thought it would be this
sort of innocent fun thing
to be a part of and then

156
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,510
other people got involved in.
And then when people call for violence,

157
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,510
the problem is they think that that,
you know,

158
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,970
you're going to just hit people and
that's going to solve a problem.

159
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:07,210
It just creates a much more,
much more comprehensive problem.

160
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,730
I, I, it's important to point out,

161
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:12,060
Gavin said has had meant like he said
things way worse than than Alex Jones ever

162
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:15,600
did. Sure. Whether whether you want to say
it's a joke or not, he said things like,

163
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,890
you know, choke him, punch him
directly. Uh Huh. Yup. But he did.

164
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,920
But I guess was the primary reason for
getting rid of them was what you thought

165
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,570
that the FBI had designated
them an extremist group?

166
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,090
No, cause we did it many months in
advance. Oh, okay. Yeah, I was just

167
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,680
so he just, it was just his
association with the proud boys.

168
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,160
I don't recall. And I would have to go
back and I don't want to misstate things.

169
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:38,070
I don't recall whether those statements
that you're referring to you have

170
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,090
Gavin's we're on Twitter

171
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,130
so they weren't, um,
there's another, you know,

172
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:45,160
when it comes to the
weaponization of rules against,

173
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,870
like Gavin isn't creating a compilation
of things he's ever said out of context

174
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,460
and then sending them around
to get himself banned.

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,900
Other people are doing that to him,

176
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:55,650
activists who don't like him
and it's effective. In fact,

177
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,160
I would actually like to point out,
um,

178
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,870
there's one particular user
who has repeatedly made
fake videos attacking one of

179
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,190
your other high profile conservatives.

180
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,130
So much so that he had to file police
reports, harassment complaints,

181
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:09,780
and it just doesn't stop, you know? So
I guess I'll ask this to this regard.

182
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,330
If someone repeatedly makes
videos of you out of context,

183
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,030
fake audio accusing you of
doing things you've never done,

184
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,580
at what point does that bantible yeah.
Again,

185
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,680
if it's targeted harassment
and we can establish that,

186
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:23,100
it's just a really hard thing with a US
determining whether something is fake or

187
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,620
not. Well, it's also when
things are out of context,

188
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,350
you still have video of the person saying
that I agree that it's out of context,

189
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,510
that it's disingenuous,

190
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,870
but it's still the person saying it
and you're making a compilation of some

191
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:40,590
preexisting audio or video.
So I think in the instance of Gavin,

192
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:42,840
like one of the things he said
was like a call to violence,

193
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,460
but he was talking about,
uh,

194
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,030
like it was in the context of talking
about a dog and being scolded. Yeah.

195
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,920
So he was like, hit him, just
hit him. And then it's like,

196
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,320
it turns out he's talking about dog,
like we're doing something wrong.

197
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,110
And they take that and they snip it and
then it goes viral and everyone talks

198
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,320
flaggings and you got a band. This guy
still got, I understand. Like, you know.
