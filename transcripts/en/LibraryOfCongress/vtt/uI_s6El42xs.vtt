&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz:
Good afternoon.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.940
Welcome to the African and
Middle Eastern Reading Room.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.500
On behalf of the music division
and the Hebraic section,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.520
let me thank you all for
coming to today's program.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.510
My name is Sharon Horowitz.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.950
I'm a reference librarian
in the Hebraic section.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.040
The Hebraic section marks
its beginning in 1912

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.900
with the receipt of 10,000
Hebrew books and pamphlets,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.220
whose purchase was
made possible by a gift

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.360
from New York philanthropist,
Jacob Schiff.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.330
From those humble beginnings,
our collections have grown

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.060
to around 250,000 items in
Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.400
Judeo-Persian, and other
Hebraic-script languages.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.630
The Hebraic section also
includes an important collection

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.450
of books in Ge'ez, Hark
[phonetic], and Tigrinya,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.640
the languages of
Ethiopia, past and present.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.550
Our sections' holdings are
particularly strong in the areas

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.810
of bible and Rabbinics, liturgy,
Hebrew language and literature,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.500
[inaudible] and Jewish history.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.970
Two of our missions
in this division are

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.770
to publicize our collections

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.910
and to bring people
into the library.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.280
One way we accomplish
this second goal is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.360
by holding lectures
and having programs

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.820
such as the one we are
hosting here today.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.260
And now, a word about
our speaker.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.300
Vivi Lachs is a social
and cultural historian,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.290
a performer as well
as an academic.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.220
She completed her PhD in 2015

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.370
from Royal Holloway
University of London.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.320
She has given many academic
presentations focused

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.990
on ethnomusicology
and the acculturation

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.610
of Jewish immigrants
to English life.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.690
She has written both
academic and popular articles

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.310
and has performed
throughout Europe.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.800
She has a wide experience
performing

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.780
as a Yiddish vocalist,
dance leader,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.830
and among her
performance-related

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.240
accomplishments, she has
organized a marching band

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.780
and chorus performing
Yiddish songs of protest

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.280
from the late 19th Century by
the late Morris Winchevsky.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.090
Vivi has been called the Yiddish
London folk song detective.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.330
She collects, performs,
translates

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.060
and records Yiddish
songs about London.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.980
In her book, White Chapel
Noise, Jewish immigrant life

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.380
and Yiddish song and
verse, London 1884 to 1914,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.260
Ms. Lachs researched
points to the similarities

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.730
between these Yiddish folk
songs and English musical songs.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.620
Layers of cultural references

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.950
in the Yiddish text are closely
analyzed and quoted to draw

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.510
out the complex, yet intimate
histories they contain,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.270
offering new perspectives

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.010
on Anglo-Jewish histography
in three main areas.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.170
Politics, sex, and religion.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.670
Two items of business,
before we begin.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.940
Vivi Lachs' book, White Chapel
Noise, will be available

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.740
for sale after the program, and
she will be happy to sign books,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.150
and this event is
being videotaped

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.090
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.690
There will be a formal
question and answer period

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.910
after the lecture, at which
the audience is encouraged

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.440
to ask questions
and offer comments.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.000
Please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.480
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.830
By participating in the
question and answer period,

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.460
you are consenting to the
library's possible reproduction

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.210
and transmission
of your remarks.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:37.490
And now, please join me in
welcoming Dr. Vivi Lachs.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.790
[applause]

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.090
&gt;&gt; Vivi Lachs: I've
just [inaudible].

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.390
Thank you very much, Sharon.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.870
It's lovely to be here
in this amazing building,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.250
which I haven't been in before.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.860
I mean, obviously I've been
in the British library many,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.420
many times, so I know
exactly what people do

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.720
in these sort of buildings.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.660
So, I'm going to tell you
a little bit about my book

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.020
and hopefully entertain
you with it

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.510
and give you some ideas
from what it's about.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.410
So the book is called
White Chapel Noise,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.440
and the White Chapel is
an area of East London.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.080
It's in the East End where
the immigrant population came

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.190
to from the mid-1880s.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.970
So Jewish immigrants
from Eastern Europe came

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.930
over to White Chapel,
and they spoke Yiddish,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.120
and that Yiddish culture
just infused the area

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.570
in this time from the mid-1880s.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.170
And this is a picture from 1897,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.050
and it's showing the
noise that's going on.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.540
And by noise, I don't
just mean the hubbub.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.770
I don't just mean the sort
of like the horses' hooves

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.750
and the whirring of wheels
and the new motor cars.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.350
It's people talking and people
shouting and people arguing

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.410
and people crying and
laughing and all that.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.310
But in particular, the noise
is people having arguments

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.270
with each other because there
were huge arguments going

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.540
on at this time.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.180
And one of the big issues for
all of these people was how

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.360
to acculturate to
English society.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.950
Because they came
from Eastern Europe,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.330
and the culture was
very, very different,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.870
and they wanted obviously
to become English.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.170
Not only did they, the
immigrants, come over and want

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.560
to be English, but also the
settled Jewish communities,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.950
who had been there for
some decades already,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.140
they really wanted these
immigrants to become English

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.420
because they were a source
of acute embarrassment

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.640
to the Jewish community for
these very poor immigrants

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.360
to come along when they

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.780
as a middle class society
had got Jewish emancipation,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.510
and they wanted to hold onto
the gains that they'd made.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.460
So, the book is, it's in
two parts, essentially,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.890
and the first part gives
you some contextual history.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.050
So the first part gives you
two particular histories.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.880
Firstly, it lays out the
labor history of the time,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.170
and it looks at the radicals

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.490
or the socialists
and the anarchists.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.530
However, the particular
difference

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.360
in this history is it's looking
at the way poetry was used

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.160
as a strategy by the socialists.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.800
The second history
is the history

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.080
of the Cockney Yiddish musical

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.080
as it was rather
affectionately known.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.120
And this is the musical
in Yiddish

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.930
in the east end of London.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.820
And then, the second part
of the book is analysis

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.030
of what are called Kuplatan
[phonetic] couplets.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.060
And these couplets come from
three genres, socialist poetry,

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.000
music-hall song,
and satirical verse,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.230
which I'll tell you
about in a minute.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.300
There are three overarching
perspectives that cut

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.860
across this, and I've
just looked at the idea

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.840
of anglicization of people
wanting to become English.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.530
The second large perspective
is that of transnationalism.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.380
So although I chose material
that is very much about London

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.520
and about England, in fact,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.460
it's also about a much wider
Yiddish-speaking world.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.710
And the third one is the culture
controversy, is the noise

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.200
of the argument of the
[foreign language spoken]

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.580
and the shouting and
the crying and those,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.370
it's what were they arguing
about, what was going on there.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.330
And then the themes,
politics, sex, and religion.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.920
You might think have been
written about quite a lot

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.950
but not from these sources
because from taking things

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.990
from Yiddish is, first of
all, there's been a lot

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.580
of Anglo-Jewish history
written, very,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.110
very few Yiddish
sources have been used.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.070
So using those sources, you
get a very different view.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.280
But secondly, the source I've
chosen are from popular culture.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.260
And if you're taking
sources from popular culture,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.090
you're getting a
view from below,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.270
and you're really getting
into those arguments.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.090
So you're not getting
the official line.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.570
You're not getting minutes of
synagogue meetings or various,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.360
not they weren't arguments
in synagogue meetings,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.820
but you are getting the things
that people are making fun of.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.040
And if you look at what
people are making fun of,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.040
you can see actually what's
really touching people,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.120
especially the satirists.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.840
So, I'll start up
with the three genres.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.630
The first one is socialist
poetry, and I found this

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.730
in all sorts of publications.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.280
So we have the newspapers, the
Polish Yid or The Polish Jew,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.920
[foreign language spoken],
The Worker's Friend.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.960
We have pamphlets.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.620
For example, the one in the
top middle, I don't know

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.140
if anyone can read that,
Mary [inaudible] you read it.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.440
&gt;&gt; This Vetting System.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.960
&gt;&gt; Vivi Lachs: This
Vetting System.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.840
So, we've got, so pamphlets
about politics going on,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.280
and then we've got
song sheets as well,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.690
like Yiddish [foreign language
spoken], which is a serious

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.660
of Yiddish freedom, which is
a series of different songs.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.700
So this is, and I've
found lots and lots

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.590
and lots of this material.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.620
I'll tell you how
many in a minute.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.330
The second genre
is musical songs.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.950
And these were produced in
song sheets and song books.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.480
So at the top left
you'll see a song sheet,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.200
so this is a little bit
of a tattered one there.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.680
That's from the National
Library of Israel.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.130
In the middle you see a
program, a theater program,

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.680
which has got a cross-dressed
actress on the front.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.580
On the bottom right,
you have a song book

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.580
which tells us there are
150 pages and 100 songs.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.740
Actually they can't count, there
are 102 songs in that book.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.380
And that was because
it was pulling lots

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.930
of pamphlets together, which
is sort of what they did.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.230
And there are some pages
from that at the bottom.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.470
So these are all the songs
that were being song,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.420
and when we start getting
into them, we can have a bit

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.510
of a laugh and possibly a bit
of a cry as well over them.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.410
And finally, the third
genre is satirical verse,

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.120
and people were writing
satirical verse everywhere.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.320
Satire is a fantastic genre
to look at for a historian,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.530
because although you have
to go digging a bit to find

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.980
out actually what's going on
there, you really get to see

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.010
where people are really
like having a punisher,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.800
of having a go at each other.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.610
So, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to have a look at all

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.840
of these three perspectives
and show you where they come

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.430
in to a couple of texts.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.960
So I've mentioned
Anglicization, Transnationalism,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.090
and the cultural noise,
and now I'm going to look

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.130
at two different texts.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.810
The first one is a poem
by Morris Winchevsky,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.670
who we'll come across a
little bit later, again,

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.930
and this is a poem
called London bay nakht.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.230
And I'll start off
by looking at it.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.700
In fact, I'll start off
by singing it to you.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.000
How about that?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.400
And then we'll have a
look at what's going on.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.510
So it's about street lights.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:46.040
[ Singing ]

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.680
And it goes on so all the
things that the streetlights see

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.300
and the streetlights don't see.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.290
So they don't see, they see
the streets, but they don't,

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.930
and the walls of the buildings,

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.210
but they don't see the
unemployment and the poverty

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.940
and the homelessness,
and the difficulty

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.620
of being a new immigrant
in the city.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.200
And the song then
compares these streetlights

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.760
to the London committee
and the London committee

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.080
who were the Jewish board
of guardians were people

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.910
who were supporting
the immigrants.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.580
However, what you'll see is
there's a line that goes,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.960
have you seen a greener
Jew wandering alone.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.530
In verse two, the last line of
that verse, too new an immigrant

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.050
to be helped by the
London committee,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.720
and that too new an immigrant
is because the London Board

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.510
of Guardians wouldn't support
immigrants until they'd been

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.190
in Britain for six months.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.860
So if you came to Britain
and you didn't have a job

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.340
and you didn't have family
there and you didn't have a way

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.900
of keeping yourself, then in
fact, you would have fallen

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.220
into a huge poverty gap because
there would be no support

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.660
for you on an institutional
level.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.420
So, looking at that
content, it's very,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.370
very much about England
and about Anglicization

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.020
because it's engaging
with English culture

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.330
and English [inaudible].

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.600
However, there's also a very
interesting transnational part

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.650
of this, and that is this poem
was written by Winchevsky,

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.080
who wasn't really a poet
when he was writing this.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.870
He was just a beginning
poet, and he wrote this

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.370
in the structure of a poem
by Mietlev [phonetic],

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.910
who was a Russian poet,

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.600
and Mietlev wrote a poem
called Fonarichi [phonetic],

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.930
Street Lights.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.780
And Mietlev's poem also had
street lights see some things

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.080
and don't see other things.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.230
The things they saw though,
the things they didn't see

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.090
that were sort of hidden to
the street lights were a couple

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.240
in love, a woman who's
just been abandoned.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.800
They were things that
were socially important,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.840
but they weren't
politically important,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.590
and so Winchevsky came along
and threw a punch behind it,

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.020
putting some political
importance to this.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:04.590
So, in a way that was a
criticism of Mietlev's poem,

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.170
but it also like
gave him a structure

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.860
to write a better poem too.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.070
The other things
that's transnational

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.890
about this that's very
interesting is this poem was

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.860
published in New York, but you
couldn't really publish a poem

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.180
in New York called
London bay nakht.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.620
I mean who was going to read it?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.740
So they changed the name of it

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.810
to [foreign language
spoken] street lights.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.090
And they couldn't really
have the London committee.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.260
So that was changed to [foreign
language spoken] street light.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:41.900
The New York Eighth Street folk,
which is on the lower east side.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.270
The interesting thing about this
is that if you can have a poem

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.820
or a song that is written
and published and performed

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.340
in Britain and then in a
completely different place

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.380
in New York, you can
make some claim to saying

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.590
that the experience in
both these places is very,

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.890
very similar.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.750
So we have a transnational
culture of immigrants going

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.530
to different places and actually
absorbing the same popular

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.100
culture, being given that
same popular culture.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.530
I also look at one other
song that also engages

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.160
with these different
transnationalism cultural

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.770
controversy and Anglicization.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:26.740
And this one, I'm
actually only going

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.450
to look particularly
and Anglicization.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.110
And that is that term Cockney
Yiddish that's used and just try

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.450
and describe what
Cockney Yiddish is.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.980
Now, first of all in
the transnational front,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.280
this is a song called
[foreign language spoken].

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.950
It's rather a curious
Yiddish name.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.330
I'm not going to go into that at
the moment, that's in the book,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.490
but I will say is that the
original [foreign language

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.510
spoken] was written by a man
called Abraham Goldsfaden,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:59.530
and Goldsfaden was a father
of the Yiddish theater.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.490
Now, he wrote this
about a decade before

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:07.980
or actually probably more, and
this was written around 1900's.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.900
It was probably written in
about 1880 by Goldsfaden,

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.120
and Goldsfaden's song,
everybody would have known,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.460
people loved Goldsfaden.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.780
So if you produce a song
in London with a title

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.190
that everyone knows, everyone's
already got some expectations,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.700
so they sort of know
what's going to happen.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.790
Now the Goldsfaden's song is
about a tired, dispirited Jew

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.670
who is wandering around
looking for a homeland,

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:38.930
this archetypal figure
of the wandering Jew,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.190
and his answer is,
[foreign language spoken],

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:46.370
go back to the Jewish
homelands of Zion.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.670
The [foreign language spoken]

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.400
in London is not saying
anything of the sort.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.960
But that also has an
archetypal Jew that's wandering

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.940
around homeless and penniless,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.090
but what the [foreign
language spoken] the world

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.450
to go back is Eastern Europe.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:06.400
So it's a curious poem that
again, a song that really

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.320
like is part of British
culture and talks about Britain.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.140
But let's have a look
at the Cockney Yiddish.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:20.630
Git a blik in der leyn vet

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.380

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.120
a dzhob.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.100
So we've got a few words here
in fact, but particularly,

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.050
the first line git
a blik in der leyn,

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.000
der leyn was Petticoat
Lane, which was the market.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.590
Okay. But of course you're
going to use a word like leyn.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.490
You wouldn't change that,
but we've got in der--

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.790
I'm sorry, what am I knocking--

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.710
we've got in der korner
of goldston strit.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.090
Well the words for corner

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.230
in Yiddish [foreign
language spoken].

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.730
It's not korner.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.230
Korner is an English word.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.640
And so they're throwing
in an English word

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.460
for no particular reason really.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.070
Have another look
at the next verse.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:19.240
A yolk hot bald derkent az
a griner dort gayt un hot

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:26.290
oysgetsoygn zayne hent un
hot im bavelkomt mit a fayt.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.490
So here you can see quite
clearly there's lots of words

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.530
for welcome in Yiddish.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.930
[Foreign language spoken]
is not a Yiddish word.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.030
It's an English word being
Yiddish-sized by putting a sort

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.120
of Yiddish inflection on it.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.490
The word fight is also
not a Yiddish word.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.010
It's an English word,
and in fact,

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.800
the word [foreign language
spoken], which it rhymes

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.110
with is changed from gayts
to giyts to make it rhyme,

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.080
which is a different way
of pronouncing the Yiddish.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.050
So this sort of Englishness
creeping

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.730
into the songs makes
them very much

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.430
as a part of English culture.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:10.540
So, I'm now going to talk about
the themes of politics, sex,

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.430
and religion, and I'm going to
give you a couple of example

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:18.560
on each of them by looking at
a couple of different songs

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.870
and get a sense of what
we can sort of glean

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.470
from the history in these songs.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.970
So we're going to stay
with Morris Winchevsky,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:33.170
who wrote a poem called
Akhdes, and this poem, Akhdes,

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.850
became very popular later.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.780
It became a very popular poem,

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.630
and in fact in the
1920's it was made

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.230
into a song called
[foreign language spoken].

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.510
Some of you might have heard--

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.040
[ Singing ]

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.720
So, but that was
a completely song.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.930
The [foreign language
spoken] is a nice happy,

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.340
clappy song that they claim
came from the Winchevsky.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.790
Winchevsky's poem is a satire.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.610
It's very funny, but
it's not happy clappy.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.630
And we'll have a
look at the poem

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.880
and see what it's telling us.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.860
So the poem says,
we are all united.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.100
Whether we've got
a lot or a little.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.780
We all pray from the
same prayer book.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.310
We're all united whether
we're cutting coupons

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.000
or we're cutting trousers.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.730
I mean whether you're poor
or rich, we're all united.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.630
We're all united whether
you've got short [inaudible],

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.300
the sidecurls, the [inaudible]
and other groups have

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.170
or whether we've got long ones,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.750
or whether we put
them behind our ears

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.830
or whether we have
them hanging straight.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.900
Whether we're hungry or
whether we're satisfied,

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.640
we're all united just like all
these things that are united.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.810
But when you look at
it a bit more closely,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.360
you say well actually
what's going on there

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.590
because there's something
very specific going on here.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.060
Winchevsky is writing in London.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.570
He was in London for 15 years,
and he's writing about politics.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.620
So, first of all, anyone
recognize this chap?

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.230
Karl Marx.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:12.000
Karl Marx was the inspiration
to many of the socialists,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.230
and his famous line about unity
was workers of the world unite.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.530
It's particular important

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:26.980
because what Winchevsky
is saying in his poem is

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.920
that actually it's not workers.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.980
No, the aristocracy and
the workers are united.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.310
It's very antisocialist because
what Winchevsky is saying

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.070
and the socialists say is
the unity does not come

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.370
from ethnicity.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.650
Just because you all happen to
be Jews, that creates no unity.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.680
The unity is across class,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.060
and it doesn't matter
what religion you are.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:54.120
So, in that sense, we can see
that what this is going to do

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.490
as soon as he has a poem called
united, we know it's going

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:57.960
to turn everything on its head.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:03.370
We all pray from the same
prayer book is a phrase,

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.040
we all sing from the same hymn
sheet, but actually he's using

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.120
that phrase but being
quite clever about it.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.750
A month prior to this poem being
written was the publication

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.240
of the Single's Pray Book.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.860
And the Single's Prayer
book was published

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.100
for the Anglo-Jewish
community who were established

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:28.160
in middle class, and
they spoke English.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.450
The immigrants largely
didn't speak English,

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:33.750
they spoke Yiddish.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.060
So a brand-new translation,
beautiful as it was,

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:43.480
and a really important new
addition to Anglo-Jewish

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.650
and Anglo-Jewish orthodoxy
wasn't particularly a very

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.680
useful addition to
the immigrants

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:55.150
so they certainly
didn't create unity.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.800
So we're also united if
you're cutting trousers

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.120
or you're cutting coupons.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.420
Well cutting trousers means
that you are what most Jews

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.600
in the East End were at this
time, a large percentage worked

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.490
in sweatshops as tailors
[foreign language spoken].

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.820
So, these people,
they're cutting trousers,

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.380
they're being manufacturers,

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.940
they're using their
hands and producing.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.920
Cutting coupons refers

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.800
to the Jewish [inaudible]
guardians giving handouts.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.480
So they, later on they gave
money, but at this stage,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.800
in fact two years after
this had changed to money,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.660
so we can really see
how much it was topical

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.810
that this time they're
giving coupons.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.330
So the socialists are
saying don't take handouts.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.850
That is not the way
to be a worker.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.110
The way to be a worker is
to work with your hands

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.570
and to be a part of
the working class.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:57.880
Finally, using the word unity
is particularly important

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.470
because six months
before this, there was a,

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.480
six months before this the
chief rabbi, Nathan Adler, died,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.910
and there was a lot of talk
about who was going to take over

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.470
and where they would live and
what sorts of position they'd do

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.760
and what they'd be involved
in, and under the title

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.960
that was the letters page,
unity not uniformity.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.160
And under that title, there
were lots and lots and lots

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.790
of letters about what was going
to happen, and it's almost

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.790
like Winchevsky in his
poem, he's adding to that.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.090
This is his contribution.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.860
Those letters were produced
in the Jewish chronicle.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.920
Winchevsky's letter was produced

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.550
in the [foreign language
spoken], The Worker's Friend,

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.210
but essentially it is if you

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.890
like his contribution
to that debate.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.740
So when you look at a song like
this, you can see all the layers

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.790
of satire, and then when
you sing, when you go back

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:57.120
and sing [foreign language
spoken], again, you can bear

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.270
in mind that it comes from
a good strong history.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.490
Morris Winchevsky, in terms
of strategy for the poetry,

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.550
so we saw earlier on that he
wrote a poem called London bay

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.580
nakht, which was part of what
was called London [inaudible].

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.560
He wrote another poem called
[foreign language spoken],

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.490
Three Sisters, about
three girls in poverty.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.960
One's selling shoelaces.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.540
One is selling flowers.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.230
And the other is
selling herself.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.280
And he puts a socialist message

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.680
by the girls not blaming each
other but blaming society,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.150
by blaming devout and
[foreign language spoken].

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:38.810
They blame the society for them
having to do this sort of work

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.480
because of their poverty.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.450
So these are poems about
terrible properties

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.960
and getting people
to feel something.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.860
The poem that we have
about London bay nakht

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.500
as well was also about
people in poverty.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.690
Then we have the satirical
poem, but he had other poetry

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.270
that he wrote as well.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.980
And this is one called
Tsum arbayter fraynd.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.820
And as you see from the lyrics,

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.460
this is really socialist
polemic.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.190
It's about alienation.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:13.640
People who are producing are
not the same people who consume.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.510
So, I'm going to
sing you one verse.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:46.260
[ Singing ]

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:54.180
It's particularly interesting in
terms of the melody of the song

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.200
because [foreign language
spoken] who was a Yiddish sort

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.950
of like critic and
writer came across girls

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.070
in a factor singing this song.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.580
This is actually a picture
of a factory in Leeds,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.140
but he came across girls
singing this song in a factory

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.690
in Belarus, and this
is what he said.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.870
He said the tune was
haunting, solemn and haunting.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.010
The machines knocked and
the song carried, demanded,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.910
punished, and welcomes
the arbayter fraynd.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.280
I heard this song many
times in the factories.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.270
It was sung heartily
and with feeling.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.650
At times, a factory girl
would get a tear in her eye,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.610
but after they finished
singing the atmosphere,

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:40.050
it was continuously oppressive,
would simply become cleansed.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:44.760
So another strategy that
he has was to create songs

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.240
that were going to help people
through the day, that were going

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.820
to encourage them to keep going.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.830
And finally, the sort of songs
he wrote were also hymns to go

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.610
out onto the streets for
union action and to march the

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.910
in di gasn, tsu di masn.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.110
Fun badrikte feltker-rasn
ruft der frayhaytsgayst.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.730
Ikh bring vafn far dem shlafn.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.560
Ikh bafray di arbet-shklafn
un ikh makh zey drayst.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.770
So they're out there chanting
and singing the songs,

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.470
and again, they refer to
things that are going on,

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.630
in particular strike
action in London.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.070
So Albert [inaudible] asking
for systematic work was

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.880
because they wanted
to end out work,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.640
which meant that
people would take work

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.410
in and cut union rates.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.710
And also [foreign
language spoken]

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:38.150
because on these strikes
they weren't solely strikes

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.890
from the Jewish tailors or the
Jewish shoe and bootmakers,

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.200
but they were actually strikes
where the non-Jewish dockers,

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.610
the English dockers were
also, and the Irish dockers,

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.210
were also coming
in to join them.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:56.620
So, moving on now
to the theme of sex.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.750
And I found about
80 musical songs,

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.690
and out of those 80 musical
songs that mentioned London,

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.910
around 47 of them mentioned sex.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:09.930
Now, you might say, that's
obvious in the musical

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.640
because let's have a
look at this picture

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.940
that we've got in front of us.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.880
On the stage, we have a very
stereotyped Jewish man and woman

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.470
who looked like they're in
a [foreign language spoken]

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.830
or in a very sort of stereotyped
version of the [inaudible].

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.750
Up in the gallery, we've
got some rather drunken lads

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.880
who clearly aren't being
terribly entertained

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.070
by what's on the stage.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.920
The orchestra seems to me
not keeping very good time,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.890
and instead of sitting on chairs
as one would in the theatre,

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.790
the front row is full of beds

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.850
that people are camoodling
[phonetic] on.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:49.320
Now this is a satirical cartoon
that's on the front cover

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.770
of a journal called [foreign
language spoken], the blofer.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:58.420
It was produced between 1911
and 1913, and all the things,

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.580
you know, obviously you take
satire with a pinch of salt,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:07.770
but there's always
an element of truth.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:12.270
But not everyone is writing
silly songs for the music call

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.930
to entertain those lads.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.320
Some of the songs are actually
very, very moving songs,

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.230
and this song by Joseph
Markevitch tells a story

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.080
of a woman in Eastern Europe

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.260
who has been abandoned
by her husband.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.680
He comes over to
London, and he disappears

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.290
into the 150,000 immigrants
that are in the streets

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:37.340
of London's east end, and she's
writing to him, getting more

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.220
and more upset, saying,
you know, help me,

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.510
we need help, and
the chorus goes--

00:30:44.510 --> 00:31:03.070
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.370
And what you'll find
is that everyone

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.890
in the audience would
have been in tears.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.190
They would have been crying

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.540
because they all knew
people like this.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.650
They knew people that
were abandoned in Russia.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.770
They knew people that
were abandoned in Britain

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.600
as their husbands came
over here and disappeared

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.720
into a much larger low east side

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.940
or anywhere else
those immigrants came

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:30.110
to in the U.S. However,
most of the songs

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.410
that were being performed

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:35.730
in the music hall were pretty
much geared towards those lads

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.140
in the audience, and one

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.950
of these songs was a song called
Vus geyst nisht aheym sore-gitl.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.770

a chap looking frightfully silly

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.690
on the stage, and the
question that we have

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.690
to ask then is why is Norger
[phonetic] who wrote this song

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.930

something that makes him look

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.230

about cathartic experience.

and people being able
to get their emotions

out when they're living in a
situation that's actually very,

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.950
very difficult, that's
struggling to make ends meet.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.540
So let's have a look at
what might be the cathartic

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.770
experiences for the
men in the audience

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.220
and for the women
in the audience.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.750
So a man comes over
from Eastern Europe,

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.370
and he can't keep
his family there.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.590
They haven't got enough to eat.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:06.370
They come over to London
or indeed to New York,

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:11.130
but to London, and they still
can't make ends meet in London.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.170
So they, the wife also
brings work in at home,

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.250
and they still come, and they
bring in a lodger, a boarder,

they're still not making enough.

They're really struggling
just to make ends meet.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.230
And so the man, who is the wager
earner and the bread winner,

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.920
is feeling like his position
as head of the household is

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.750
in danger, that he is like
no longer the patriarch

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.920
as he can't actually do what the
head of the household is meant

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.080
to do, which is to be
able to feed his children.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.120
And then he comes to the music
hall, and he sees someone

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.720

more pathetic than he is.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.350
And what about women?

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.400

extremely hard,

the household,

after the children.

So, we're setting up a situation
where people can feel something,

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.150
and it gives us a sense of
this is not just mimicking the

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.850
English musical, but it's
saying something very specific

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.430
about the immigrants'
experience.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:39.520
Okay, so I'm going to move
now to the theme of religion.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.750
And everybody is
writing about religion.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.110
The socialists are
either haranguing religion

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.970

structures to make lots

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:57.670

of really quite moving points

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.450
about people becoming
more secular

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.940
and losing their
connection to religion

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.470
and the [inaudible]
writers, the satirists,

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.450
are having field days around it.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:15.330
So, I'm going to have a look
at two texts around this.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.860
So, the first text is by a
guy called Avrom Margolin,

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.840
Dr. Avrom Margolin, who is
the editor of Der blofer,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.960
but he was actually a
doctor, a medical doctor.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.100
And he wrote something
called A pekl neviyes.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.410
Now the connection with religion
is a little bit tangential,

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.710
but we'll see.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.510
A pekl neviyes means a bunch
of prophesies or a bundle

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.460
of prophesies, and it's based
on a chapter from Ezekiel,

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.560
which describes the
war to end all wars,

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.100
and it starts off like this.

to happen in White Chapel.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.800
There's going to be a
war to end all wars.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.740
So let's have a look at what
that war was going to be.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.430
And he continues
his 166-line stanza

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.390
which has 18 people
in the community.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.820
We have the chief
rabbi, Herman Adler.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.960
We have a whole range of people.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.780
We have [inaudible]
my list of them.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:40.400
We have a 66-line stanza
with all these people on it,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.220
with the chief rabbi, with the
Zionist Ahada Ahm [phonetic],

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.330
with the anarchist
leader Rudolf Rocker,

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.310
and it tells them what will
happen to all these people

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.500
at the end of time when White
Chapels turns upside down.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.050
So the chief rabbi will
stand down and questions

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.970
and rulings will be taken to
the secular Zionist Ahada Ahm.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:03.260
Anarchist leader Rudulf Rocker
will become an inspector

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.900

Winston Churchill and so on.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.750
So it's a big satire.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.970
Now what connection this
has to religion, as I say,

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.230
it's pretty tangential, but
what it's doing is it's using a

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:24.050
structure and it's saying
really that, first of all,

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:29.450
it's saying it's belittling the
tone of the Ezekiel [inaudible]

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:33.130
but it's also, if you like,
saying that if you use a tone

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.950
like that on these silly
little happenings happening

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.360
in White Chapel, then
White Chapel is already

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.200
such a topsy-turvy place where
everything is going wrong,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.370
there should really be a war to
end all wars to turn it right.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.480
But finally, I'm going to
finish on one more musical song.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:59.690
And this is a musical song by
Nager, and people use religion

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.040
in lots of different ways,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.850
but this is a particularly
interesting use of it

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:08.100
because in the musical you
have a mixture of people who go

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.260
to the music hall,
they're not all atheists

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.000
like the socialists.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.300
Possibly very few of
them are, in fact.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.520
Some of them have
become secular.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.250
A lot of them would have had
a real feeling of nostalgia

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:25.760
for religion and would have
had a real feeling of loss,

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.530
and so what they did in the
musical was they did two things.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.910
They sort of engaged with
that loss at the same time

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:38.040
as making fun, but also engaging
with the fact that the religion

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.980
that the immigrants have was
very different to the religion

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.520
that the Anglo-Jews had and
that they couldn't connect.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.690
So, I'll just have a look
at the first verse of this

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.540
and then sing a couple
of verses of it,

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.510

going to join in.

but what happens is
it's just too difficult.

The religion sort of like
doesn't fit in with English life

have to be in the sweat shops.

There's no where to pray.

You're praying there,

[ Singing ]

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.940
And then we have the
neighbor again repeating it,

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.120
come on, this is England.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.620
So you see, the nature
of what's happening

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.540
to religion is brought up, and
I guess the way it brings it

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.470
up both by making fun
of it and treating it

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:59.280
in a more serious way is sort
of shows the double things

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.750
that are going on for people.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.460
Maybe they move their
religion because they're having

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.760
to work all the time
and [inaudible]

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.690
and maybe they feel a
little bit guilty about it.

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.530
You've got a lot
of varying degrees

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.680
of what people are
feeling about it.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:20.030
So, this has been a tiny
little glimpse of what you got.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:23.000
There are a hundred
texts analyzed or looked

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.550
at in the book that engage
with British culture.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:31.430
During that time, I found 300
texts, and all these texts are

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:37.180
in rhyming couplets,
and it's an archive

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.470
that has barely been touched,

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.580
and as any Yiddish [inaudible]
will tell you here in the states

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.480
as well, that there's a huge
archive here in America as well,

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.190
and again, the sort of research
that has been done on it is only

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.310
like touching the surface
of it, and that, you know,

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:56.290
there's lots and
lots more to do.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.450
So a lot of encouragement
for people, please,

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.190
to become Yiddish and
do some of this research

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.600
because the social histories
they give us are very real

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.060
or very interesting, and
there are lots and lots

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:10.470
of connections, both
with Jewish immigrants

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.880
in just different places and
with immigrant culture in London

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.280
between the different,
or but in other places,

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.800
between the different immigrant
communities in those places.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.470
So I feel that this sort of work
actually does lay the ground

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:26.520
work for a lot of
other things to come.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.510
And thank you for being
a lovely audience.

[ Applause ]

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.000
Yeah, so are there
any questions?

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.800
Yeah?

00:47:37.800 --> 00:48:00.150
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:01.600
Oh, well that's very,
very interesting,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.130
because I haven't heard
what you just told me now.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.110
So, first of all der blofer.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:10.140
The word blofer in Yiddish
has got a stronger meaning

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.440
than in English.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.980
So the word blofer is
like to hoodwink someone.

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.110
It doesn't have the same clout.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:17.810
Now, sometimes it's used gently,

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.390
but actually blofer
means cheating and lying.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.580
So, yeah, it's a bad thing.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.170
And I mean a pretty
bad thing in English,

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:25.820
but it's got a gentler
side to it.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.260
But in Yiddish it's
not a nice thing.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.800
And der blofer the
magazine had a byline

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:36.520
which read [foreign language
spoken], everyone lies,

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.820
[foreign language spoken].

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:44.360
The blofer comes
to tell the truth.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.020
And so it's very
curious, you saying,

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.910
because obviously a blofer
can't really tell the truth,

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.000
they're bluffing people, so
it's sort of saying like, okay,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.310
so we're now going
to have double bluffs

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:57.620
and triple bluffs going on here.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:01.310
But the nature of that magazine
was to expose hypocrisy,

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:05.060
and in fact, there's a very
interesting column that happens

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.470
on a number of issues called
[foreign language spoken],

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:08.380
the blofer laughed.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.840
And what it does is it picks
out all these instances

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.890
of hypocrisy, and then the
blofer goes ah ha ha ha ha.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:18.170
And throws his head
back and laughs.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:23.530
So, the instances of hypocrisy
might be someone is getting

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:27.970
married and the people in the
family go to Eastern Europe,

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.950
bring their wife
over and bring her

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.430
to the [foreign language
spoken].

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:37.440
Or the blofer is saying, what
you get a sense of in this,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.880
so that's [inaudible]
that's generic yeah,

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.270
but then you get the blofer
talking about a certain lord

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.420
who will pay his coachman,
his non-Jewish coachman,

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:53.080
substantial bonuses but will
not support a Jewish hospital.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.720
And this was a particular story.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.240
Maybe not that he was paying
his non-Jewish coachman service,

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.570
but was saying that he won't
support Jewish things even

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:04.320
thought he is a Jew,
Lord Rothchild,

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.600
but he will support
non-Jewish things because he was

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.590
so terrified of anti-Semitism
that he was, or the situation

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:14.190
of Jews in England, that
he would sort of fall

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:18.050
over backwards not to
support Jews was what this

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:19.350
statement said.

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:20.650
And the blofer is laughing.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:25.050
So, they're making fun of things
that are real in the community,

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:28.200
and they're making
fun of generic things.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.450
So, yes, the concept of
blofer, being a blofer,

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:35.860
I think is really, really
important, and I get the sense

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:40.140
that there's a huge amount of
satire being written in Yiddish,

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:44.080
and in a way, satire is trying
to do that, is trying to show

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.420
where the hypocrisy
lies, is trying to show

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.460
where people are being too
[inaudible] and double minded

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.750
and saying one thing
and doing another.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.430
And so it's coming up
over and over again.

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.340
So I think it's very
interesting that you say

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.870
that England is being seen
as the land of hypocrisy,

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:04.100
and certainly the Yiddish
satirists are pushing, you know,

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.140
trying to show where that is.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.150
In fact, even in very
interesting stuff in the '40s

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:11.930
and '50s, they're still
writing Yiddish satire.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.730
Yeah?

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:25.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.340
All right.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.640
So there's different publishers

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.940
for all these different
things, yeah.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.490
So the socialist publishers,

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:33.660
they are producing
their own presses,

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.490
because they really
can't get anyone else

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:36.790
to publish their material.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:39.880
So they're getting their press,
they've got, for example,

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.180
the [foreign language spoken],

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.660
which was the main
socialist paper,

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:47.000
was being published
by their own press.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.450
Then it would get defaced,
and people would break in

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.360
and smash the printing presses

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.340
and they'd have to
like get new ones.

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.890
So that's what's
happening there.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:01.410
So what that shows and what we
write about is there's loads

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:03.790
of politics around publishing.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:08.260
Then, the more mainstream
papers are also having their

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.560
own presses.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.620
The smaller things, so
the socialist pamphlets

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.640
and stuff are also
being published

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.940
by the [foreign language
spoken] press.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.760
So all of that is in one place.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:22.020
The Song Book, there are a
number of different publishers.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.660
So there's a publisher
called Mazin [phonetic].

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.210
There's a publisher
called Josef [phonetic].

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:26.660
There's a publisher called
Wooderman [phonetic].

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.860
And they're all producing
song sheets.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.700
And they're selling them
sort of for a penny.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.210
And then Josef the
publisher, in fact,

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.690
there's another song called
[foreign language spoken],

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:42.440
which was what we saw earlier,

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:47.970
and he uses that to advertise
his publishing services

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:53.310
for songs, and he says, I've
go this great, new invention.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:56.290
I've got a song book,
not just a song sheet,

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.930
and he's connecting all of these
and putting them into a book.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:02.170
So, these people are realizing
there's a commercial market

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:03.470
out there, okay.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.200
So there's the song sheets
that people get for a penny,

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.770
but if you do it in a
book, you get even more,

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.280
and they're putting
little pictures

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.060
of people's faces on them.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:13.330
So they're really
playing to the market.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:19.500
And I guess that what's
happening quite a lot is a lot

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.710
of these publications will run
for quite short lengths of time

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:26.910
because financially it's really
hard to keep them viable.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:30.660
So you've got lots of
competing presses and small ones

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.520
and slightly larger ones.

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.300
The thing about like
Mazin, so ones, and Josef,

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.120
the ones who are
producing the song sheets,

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.880
on one side they're
producing these song sheets.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.660
On the other side they're
producing like Zionist songs

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:49.810
about sort of the new Zionist
movements that produces,

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:54.200
for example, Josef produces
a series of songs to the tune

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.020
of [foreign language
spoken] in Yiddish.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:01.600
A and then also they're
producing religious stuff

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.900
as well.

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.510
So, I mean I find it sort
of like quite strange

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.090
that at the same time this
publisher is producing these

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:10.990
silly sexy musical lyrics

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:13.860
and then also producing some
quite religious material.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.160
But that's what's happening.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.940
There are a number of
publishers doing that.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.510
Yes?

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.590
Well, I mean it's interesting

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:40.960
because [inaudible] has always
tried to be quite trendy,

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.430
and so it's set in the present
time, but it is in the east end,

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.560
so it is in this area or a
little bit further east maybe.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.780
The trendiness has meant
that it has sort of brought

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.610
in immigrants occasionally
because [inaudible] it was

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:57.470
like a very much a non-immigrant
population as it was engaging

00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:02.310
with sort of the white east
enders who had been born there

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:04.650
and had lived there
for generations.

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:09.910
But it's certainly in this area,
and so it's engaging with some

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.200
of the issues around work.

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:18.580
And I think it's interesting you
bring that up, because in a way,

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.300
I think it became very popular

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:25.590
because the east end has been
home to all sorts of waves

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.190
of immigrants as they came
in and then often they moved

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:31.290
out as they became
more upwardly mobile.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.940
So the here were the
Irish before the Jews

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.880
and then the Jews, and then
we've had Banglandeshian,

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.180
Somolian.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.970
And so it's become an
area that has been sort

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:46.770
of an immigrant area as well
as an indigenous population

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:49.040
of white British people.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.280
So there's a sort of
sentimentalism that goes

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.290
with the east end
and that has sort

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.680
of like been drawn around it.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:02.760
And I think that in a
way that's why something

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.070
like east enders has got such a,

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:09.970
just by its title has got quite
a powerful resonance for people.

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.440
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: My friend,

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.650
Jane Petzler [phonetic] has done
research on the little booklets.

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:24.950
&gt;&gt; Vivi Lachs: Yep.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:26.250
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz:
I find it ridiculous

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:29.450
that people would sing
along with the performers.

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:31.820
I mean if I was a performer,
I don't think I would like it.

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.190
But anyways, so she's done--

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.490
&gt;&gt; Vivi Lachs: Yep.

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:38.090
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: [Inaudible]
was a publisher [inaudible]

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:42.580
but anyways, she was able to
find a lot of these booklets.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.610
Many of them she found in
the Library [inaudible].

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:45.970
&gt;&gt; Vivi Lachs: Oh really!

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.700
I didn't know that.

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.850
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Apparently
they sent them to the Library.

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:53.590
They were unopened, but
of course she found them.

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:55.050
They allowed her to open them.

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:56.350
&gt;&gt; Vivi Lachs: Wow.

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.650
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: But
anyway, I just was going

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.870
to mention that's also an
American musical things,

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.170
these little booklets
[inaudible].

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:02.470
&gt;&gt; Vivi Lachs: She's fantastic.

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:03.770
Jane Petzler has done
like wonderful work

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:06.580
in collecting a huge
number of American musicals,

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.260
and what people now need to do
with her work is to have a look

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.170
at some of the social
histories that come from them,

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:16.380
but she's done a fantastic
job of bringing them to life.

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.860
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Great,
anyway, thank you very much

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.420
and thank you all for coming.

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.420
