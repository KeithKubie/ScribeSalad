00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.979
being far too literal I think oh yeah
absolutely so let's go ahead and take a

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989
absolutely so let's go ahead and take a
 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.569
absolutely so let's go ahead and take a
look at being appropriate as the oh nice

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579
look at being appropriate as the oh nice
 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.699
look at being appropriate as the oh nice
rato don't know it's until I've got an

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709
rato don't know it's until I've got an
 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.199
rato don't know it's until I've got an
unlocked that's what I preview with us

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209
unlocked that's what I preview with us
 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.250
unlocked that's what I preview with us
for now sweet that's okay retaking it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260
for now sweet that's okay retaking it
 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.800
for now sweet that's okay retaking it
back in the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810
back in the
 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.810
back in the
in many ways because I completely

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820
in many ways because I completely
 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.759
in many ways because I completely
screwed up his engineering on the last

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769
screwed up his engineering on the last
 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.340
screwed up his engineering on the last
one it was actually kind of funny so why

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350
one it was actually kind of funny so why
 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.920
one it was actually kind of funny so why
don't we start with comedy and with a

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930
don't we start with comedy and with a
 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.600
don't we start with comedy and with a
head and veil is that how you say that

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610
head and veil is that how you say that
 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.320
head and veil is that how you say that
Aaron Vale Herondale so um Heron bells

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330
Aaron Vale Herondale so um Heron bells
 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.710
Aaron Vale Herondale so um Heron bells
is a game that was obviously one of the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720
is a game that was obviously one of the
 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.240
is a game that was obviously one of the
nominated ones on our Friday reviewed it

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250
nominated ones on our Friday reviewed it
 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.700
nominated ones on our Friday reviewed it
falls into oh we need to rotate the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
falls into oh we need to rotate the
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.320
falls into oh we need to rotate the
display on this one yeah so yeah so

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330
display on this one yeah so yeah so
 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.230
display on this one yeah so yeah so
first off I not really tablet-friendly

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240
first off I not really tablet-friendly
 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.980
first off I not really tablet-friendly
because the display forces itself into

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990
because the display forces itself into
 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.129
because the display forces itself into
portrait i I'm going to make the

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139
portrait i I'm going to make the
 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.350
portrait i I'm going to make the
argument that this is unnecessary I

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360
argument that this is unnecessary I
 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.850
argument that this is unnecessary I
don't think that the display has to be

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860
don't think that the display has to be
 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.640
don't think that the display has to be
portrait I think that this is a port

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650
portrait I think that this is a port
 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.950
portrait I think that this is a port
from a web game that probably did not

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960
from a web game that probably did not
 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.409
from a web game that probably did not
run in portrait in a browser yeah you

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419
run in portrait in a browser yeah you
 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.850
run in portrait in a browser yeah you
know it's interesting it's actually a

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860
know it's interesting it's actually a
 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.600
know it's interesting it's actually a
game that's been built using the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610
game that's been built using the
 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.460
game that's been built using the
marmalade SDK and I'm actually used to

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470
marmalade SDK and I'm actually used to
 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.750
marmalade SDK and I'm actually used to
seeing you know really high-end games

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760
seeing you know really high-end games
 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.010
seeing you know really high-end games
that are built with marmalade so this is

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020
that are built with marmalade so this is
 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.450
that are built with marmalade so this is
this is an interesting thing it's

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460
this is an interesting thing it's
 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.090
this is an interesting thing it's
actually a game that akin to mafia wars

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100
actually a game that akin to mafia wars
 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.560
actually a game that akin to mafia wars
a lot of a lot of those kinds of games

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570
a lot of a lot of those kinds of games
 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.350
a lot of a lot of those kinds of games
it's a bit more complicated than mafia

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360
it's a bit more complicated than mafia
 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.020
it's a bit more complicated than mafia
wars in terms of the game mechanics

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030
wars in terms of the game mechanics
 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.230
wars in terms of the game mechanics
itself it's very very deep you know from

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240
itself it's very very deep you know from
 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.750
itself it's very very deep you know from
from my perspective the biggest issues I

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760
from my perspective the biggest issues I
 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.750
from my perspective the biggest issues I
have is that it just doesn't feel at all

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760
have is that it just doesn't feel at all
 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.820
have is that it just doesn't feel at all
like an Android native experience sure

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830
like an Android native experience sure
 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.920
like an Android native experience sure
and and I think I think that's the

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930
and and I think I think that's the
 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.450
and and I think I think that's the
biggest the biggest thing which is just

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460
biggest the biggest thing which is just
 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.950
biggest the biggest thing which is just
looking at this screen and if we could

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960
looking at this screen and if we could
 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.330
looking at this screen and if we could
bring that go back to the game screen

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340
bring that go back to the game screen
 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.879
bring that go back to the game screen
itself you can see that we that we

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889
itself you can see that we that we
 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.680
itself you can see that we that we
actually have things which basically

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690
actually have things which basically
 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.379
actually have things which basically
your tabs on the bottom of the screen

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389
your tabs on the bottom of the screen
 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.020
your tabs on the bottom of the screen
right and and on Android because we have

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030
right and and on Android because we have
 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.490
right and and on Android because we have
other things on the bottom of the screen

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500
other things on the bottom of the screen
 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.159
other things on the bottom of the screen
such as buttons in this case I'm on the

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169
such as buttons in this case I'm on the
 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.290
such as buttons in this case I'm on the
tablet or as even capacitive buttons on

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300
tablet or as even capacitive buttons on
 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.020
tablet or as even capacitive buttons on
the bottom um it's a design decision to

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030
the bottom um it's a design decision to
 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.450
the bottom um it's a design decision to
put a lot of button type things or tabs

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460
put a lot of button type things or tabs
 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.680
put a lot of button type things or tabs
on the bottom actually makes the

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690
on the bottom actually makes the
 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.180
on the bottom actually makes the
interface look kind of unnecessarily

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190
interface look kind of unnecessarily
 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.520
interface look kind of unnecessarily
busy and so it's always been a design

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530
busy and so it's always been a design
 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.650
busy and so it's always been a design
decision from Android to take those

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660
decision from Android to take those
 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.400
decision from Android to take those
place those on top and and so when

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410
place those on top and and so when
 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.510
place those on top and and so when
they're on the bottom like this it

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520
they're on the bottom like this it
 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.800
they're on the bottom like this it
really does make it look like it came

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810
really does make it look like it came
 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.330
really does make it look like it came
from another platform which actually

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340
from another platform which actually
 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.279
from another platform which actually
prefers us at the bottom the other thing

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289
prefers us at the bottom the other thing
 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:22.960
prefers us at the bottom the other thing
you'll notice that the resolution of the

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970
you'll notice that the resolution of the
 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.040
you'll notice that the resolution of the
artwork is kind of random

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050
artwork is kind of random
 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.820
artwork is kind of random
on this screen you'll see actually that

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830
on this screen you'll see actually that
 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.820
on this screen you'll see actually that
as you go through the game there are

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830
as you go through the game there are
 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.809
as you go through the game there are
because we get we're really looking at

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819
because we get we're really looking at
 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.219
because we get we're really looking at
everything through a magnifying glass

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229
everything through a magnifying glass
 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.409
everything through a magnifying glass
quite literally on this device you'll

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419
quite literally on this device you'll
 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.230
quite literally on this device you'll
actually see that the the graphics

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240
actually see that the the graphics
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.770
actually see that the the graphics
actually have different levels of

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780
actually have different levels of
 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.529
actually have different levels of
artifacts from anti-aliasing and so

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539
artifacts from anti-aliasing and so
 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.640
artifacts from anti-aliasing and so
you'll see it really really puts the

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650
you'll see it really really puts the
 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.640
you'll see it really really puts the
whole thing under a pretty significant

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650
whole thing under a pretty significant
 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.080
whole thing under a pretty significant
microscope but in any case we can

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090
microscope but in any case we can
 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.149
microscope but in any case we can
actually go we actually go to playing

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159
actually go we actually go to playing
 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.939
actually go we actually go to playing
the game itself and we can attack and

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949
the game itself and we can attack and
 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.149
the game itself and we can attack and
you know it's it is what it is you know

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:05.159
you know it's it is what it is you know
 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.959
you know it's it is what it is you know
I think there's there's a whole group

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969
I think there's there's a whole group
 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:08.330
I think there's there's a whole group
people who actually adore these kinds of

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340
people who actually adore these kinds of
 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.700
people who actually adore these kinds of
games the music is actually pretty epic

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710
games the music is actually pretty epic
 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.189
games the music is actually pretty epic
within the game I wish we could actually

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199
within the game I wish we could actually
 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.800
within the game I wish we could actually
let you guys hear that but if we can't

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810
let you guys hear that but if we can't
 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.010
let you guys hear that but if we can't
do that for copyright reasons and UT

people get mad at us but but there there

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330
people get mad at us but but there there
 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.480
people get mad at us but but there there
we go but you can imagine the epic music

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490
we go but you can imagine the epic music
 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.180

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.190
that might back a sort of text based
 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.430

python's holy grail that that's that's

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340
python's holy grail that that's that's
 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.490
python's holy grail that that's that's
that's good so yes exactly exactly that

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500
that's good so yes exactly exactly that
 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.200
that's good so yes exactly exactly that
that's that's actually a fantastic one

very minimalist design which I like so

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880
very minimalist design which I like so
 

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.970
very minimalist design which I like so
you know I I i think you know on that

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980
you know I I i think you know on that
 

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.230
you know I I i think you know on that
you know there's definitely some issues

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240
you know there's definitely some issues
 

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.490
you know there's definitely some issues
wanted to kind of show how the

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500
wanted to kind of show how the
 

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.020
wanted to kind of show how the
navigation work that's the exit go back

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.030
navigation work that's the exit go back
 

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.090
navigation work that's the exit go back
so this game does actually have music on

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100
so this game does actually have music on
 

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.590
so this game does actually have music on
the lock screen as you know that's one

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600
the lock screen as you know that's one
 

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.850
the lock screen as you know that's one
of one of the things we always look at

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860
of one of the things we always look at
 

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.130
of one of the things we always look at
so i wish i could actually demonstrate

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:19.140
so i wish i could actually demonstrate
 

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.570
so i wish i could actually demonstrate
that for you guys but you just have to

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:20.580
that for you guys but you just have to
 

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.350
that for you guys but you just have to
trust me on that one and we've got this

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360
trust me on that one and we've got this
 

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.530
trust me on that one and we've got this
kind of swiping menu that's kind of cool

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540
kind of swiping menu that's kind of cool
 

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.060
kind of swiping menu that's kind of cool
yeah it's right and it's nice way you

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.070
yeah it's right and it's nice way you
 

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.890
yeah it's right and it's nice way you
know the fate yeah the ones that are not

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:30.900
know the fate yeah the ones that are not
 

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.300
know the fate yeah the ones that are not
selected fade out like I think that's

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:32.310
selected fade out like I think that's
 

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.750
selected fade out like I think that's
really cool I've got this where yeah you

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760
really cool I've got this where yeah you
 

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.060
really cool I've got this where yeah you
go to a locked thing yeah the set is

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.070
go to a locked thing yeah the set is
 

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.950
go to a locked thing yeah the set is
very cool yeah the way the way the way

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:39.960
very cool yeah the way the way the way
 

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.720
very cool yeah the way the way the way
and you can see it's actually a nice

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:41.730
and you can see it's actually a nice
 

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.010
and you can see it's actually a nice
transition effect they're actually

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.020
transition effect they're actually
 

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.410
transition effect they're actually
following the of the menu item and

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420
following the of the menu item and
 

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.090
following the of the menu item and
actually as they fade the menu item out

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.100
actually as they fade the menu item out
 

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.590
actually as they fade the menu item out
there actually fading the balls white

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600
there actually fading the balls white
 

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.820
there actually fading the balls white
which i think is I think it's really

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:49.830
which i think is I think it's really
 

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.460
which i think is I think it's really
beautiful as I said I I you know this

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:52.470
beautiful as I said I I you know this
 

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.140
beautiful as I said I I you know this
this this is not as flash use a lot of

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:54.150
this this is not as flash use a lot of
 

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.730
this this is not as flash use a lot of
games in terms of the fonts the

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740
games in terms of the fonts the
 

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.380
games in terms of the fonts the
presentation but i think it's so

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:57.390
presentation but i think it's so
 

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.820
presentation but i think it's so
distinctive and unique i have a hard

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:58.830
distinctive and unique i have a hard
 

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.890
distinctive and unique i have a hard
time telling the mate to make even make

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:00.900
time telling the mate to make even make
 

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.450
time telling the mate to make even make
changes to it because it is it's kind of

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:02.460
changes to it because it is it's kind of
 

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.110
changes to it because it is it's kind of
cool and let's just go back i'm gonna

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120
cool and let's just go back i'm gonna
 

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.430
cool and let's just go back i'm gonna
actually want to walk people through the

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440
actually want to walk people through the
 

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.330
actually want to walk people through the
other thing that's really great about

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:08.340
other thing that's really great about
 

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.110
other thing that's really great about
this games actually has a

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120
this games actually has a
 

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.100
this games actually has a
a complete tutorial and tutorial is

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.110
a complete tutorial and tutorial is
 

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.710
a complete tutorial and tutorial is
actually pretty rich so one of the

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720
actually pretty rich so one of the
 

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.970
actually pretty rich so one of the
things it's a little bit confusing to

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:17.980
things it's a little bit confusing to
 

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.320
things it's a little bit confusing to
see it actually you actually play the

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.330
see it actually you actually play the
 

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.120
see it actually you actually play the
game with sort of a slingshot mode here

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.130
game with sort of a slingshot mode here
 

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.329
game with sort of a slingshot mode here
by tapping and then I can obviously I

00:15:24.329 --> 00:15:24.339
by tapping and then I can obviously I
 

00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:26.730
by tapping and then I can obviously I
didn't drag farther enough tapping there

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:26.740
didn't drag farther enough tapping there
 

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.040
didn't drag farther enough tapping there
you can actually you don't actually have

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.050
you can actually you don't actually have
 

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.260
you can actually you don't actually have
to tap on the ball that's at that's that

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:31.270
to tap on the ball that's at that's that
 

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.970
to tap on the ball that's at that's that
that's that's this is somewhat confusing

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:32.980
that's that's this is somewhat confusing
 

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.970
that's that's this is somewhat confusing
part so if I want if I want ended yeah

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:35.980
part so if I want if I want ended yeah
 

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.470
part so if I want if I want ended yeah
it was beautiful but you're clearly much

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480
it was beautiful but you're clearly much
 

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.940
it was beautiful but you're clearly much
better than sat i'm so if i actually

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:38.950
better than sat i'm so if i actually
 

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.290
better than sat i'm so if i actually
want to make a really hard shot i can

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:40.300
want to make a really hard shot i can
 

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.320
want to make a really hard shot i can
actually tap like here and you can see

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.330
actually tap like here and you can see
 

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.660
actually tap like here and you can see
that's that's that actually is going to

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:45.670
that's that's that actually is going to
 

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.579
that's that's that actually is going to
do the shot okay not you see as you can

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:47.589
do the shot okay not you see as you can
 

00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:50.970
do the shot okay not you see as you can
see not bad so so that's that takes a

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:50.980
see not bad so so that's that takes a
 

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.560
see not bad so so that's that takes a
little bits a little bit confusing and

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:52.570
little bits a little bit confusing and
 

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.000
little bits a little bit confusing and
it tries to explain that to you in the

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.010
it tries to explain that to you in the
 

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.410
it tries to explain that to you in the
tutorial but it definitely is one of

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:55.420
tutorial but it definitely is one of
 

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.390
tutorial but it definitely is one of
those things where you know it's not

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:57.400
those things where you know it's not
 

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.370
those things where you know it's not
it's not a mechanic that I think that I

00:15:59.370 --> 00:15:59.380
it's not a mechanic that I think that I
 

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.519
it's not a mechanic that I think that I
said I think I've seen exactly before

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:01.529
said I think I've seen exactly before
 

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:04.200
said I think I've seen exactly before
but you know it's I don't think I'm

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:04.210
but you know it's I don't think I'm
 

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.370
but you know it's I don't think I'm
gonna be able to quite do this but let's

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:05.380
gonna be able to quite do this but let's
 

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.450
gonna be able to quite do this but let's
try I don't really see how lucky um yes

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:09.460
try I don't really see how lucky um yes
 

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.370
try I don't really see how lucky um yes
I intended that um that's why I said

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:11.380
I intended that um that's why I said
 

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.260
I intended that um that's why I said
lucky um so you can you can actually but

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:16.270
lucky um so you can you can actually but
 

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.670
lucky um so you can you can actually but
so it was a little bit unintuitive the

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680
so it was a little bit unintuitive the
 

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.190
so it was a little bit unintuitive the
controls but once I got it I got it so

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:20.200
controls but once I got it I got it so
 

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.750
controls but once I got it I got it so
you just drag from from anywhere

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:21.760
you just drag from from anywhere
 

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.579
you just drag from from anywhere
basically yeah I drag it anywhere I make

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:23.589
basically yeah I drag it anywhere I make
 

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:24.870
basically yeah I drag it anywhere I make
sense okay and then you can add the

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880
sense okay and then you can add the
 

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.760
sense okay and then you can add the
length of this line has two so i'll just

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:26.770
length of this line has two so i'll just
 

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.860
length of this line has two so i'll just
do what I always do in pool just just

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:28.870
do what I always do in pool just just
 

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.840
do what I always do in pool just just
hit it as hard as I possibly well yeah

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:30.850
hit it as hard as I possibly well yeah
 

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.040
hit it as hard as I possibly well yeah
right yeah you we are always that was

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.050
right yeah you we are always that was
 

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.040
right yeah you we are always that was
that was well done alright so pool match

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.050
that was well done alright so pool match
 

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.290
that was well done alright so pool match
I now know not to not to challenge you

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:40.300
I now know not to not to challenge you
 

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.630
I now know not to not to challenge you
on a pool especially especially when

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:42.640
on a pool especially especially when
 

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.710
on a pool especially especially when
you've got a beer in your hand like that

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720
you've got a beer in your hand like that
 

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.610
you've got a beer in your hand like that
and all right so let's try one more I'm

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:47.620
and all right so let's try one more I'm
 

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.500
and all right so let's try one more I'm
gonna try actually doing is open a shot

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:49.510
gonna try actually doing is open a shot
 

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.329
gonna try actually doing is open a shot
here we'll see about how I like I don't

00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:51.339
here we'll see about how I like I don't
 

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:52.920
here we'll see about how I like I don't
think we've really been able to figure

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:52.930
think we've really been able to figure
 

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.310
think we've really been able to figure
out how good or bad that physics are I

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320
out how good or bad that physics are I
 

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.930
out how good or bad that physics are I
mean obviously there's some things that

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:57.940
mean obviously there's some things that
 

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.120
mean obviously there's some things that
mmm you'd like to be able to do in pool

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.130
mmm you'd like to be able to do in pool
 

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.130
mmm you'd like to be able to do in pool
in terms of them back spin and things

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:02.140
in terms of them back spin and things
 

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.990
in terms of them back spin and things
like that that you aren't necessarily

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000
like that that you aren't necessarily
 

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.850
like that that you aren't necessarily
getting here now you see you can okay so

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:05.860
getting here now you see you can okay so
 

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.770
getting here now you see you can okay so
you can you can change the elevation of

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:07.780
you can you can change the elevation of

ball or to get your spin okay so that
it's actually it's a beautiful interface

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:12.970
it's actually it's a beautiful interface
 

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.520
it's actually it's a beautiful interface
like I said I've never quite seen this

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:14.530
like I said I've never quite seen this
 

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.799
like I said I've never quite seen this
approach taken to pull and I like it so

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:16.809

yeah I can see myself playing this yeah
absolutely it so um anyways I think our

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:22.660
absolutely it so um anyways I think our
 

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.750
absolutely it so um anyways I think our
general thought is you know it really

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760
general thought is you know it really
 

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.490
general thought is you know it really
sums up beautiful job I mean yeah I

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:26.500
sums up beautiful job I mean yeah I
 

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.260
sums up beautiful job I mean yeah I
don't know awesome game in fact honestly

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.120
don't know awesome game in fact honestly
at this point the only thing that I'm

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.130
at this point the only thing that I'm
 

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.030
at this point the only thing that I'm
kind of disturbed about is the way that

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:33.040
kind of disturbed about is the way that
 

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.410
kind of disturbed about is the way that
they've gone into light top mode which

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.420
they've gone into light top mode which
 

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.620
they've gone into light top mode which
is awesome mm-hmm but then they put an

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:37.630
is awesome mm-hmm but then they put an
 

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.900
is awesome mm-hmm but then they put an
extra back button yeah well I know it's

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:39.910
extra back button yeah well I know it's
 

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.640
extra back button yeah well I know it's
like yeah you know make up your mind

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:41.650
like yeah you know make up your mind
 

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.260
like yeah you know make up your mind
don't because it almost as if you

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.270
don't because it almost as if you
 

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.770
don't because it almost as if you
replicated the I would actually love to

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:46.780
replicated the I would actually love to
 

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.680
replicated the I would actually love to
see this actually implemented we've

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:49.690
see this actually implemented we've
 

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.720
see this actually implemented we've
gotten so far I would love to see it

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:51.730
gotten so far I would love to see it
 

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.610
gotten so far I would love to see it
actually be implemented with with an

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:53.620
actually be implemented with with an
 

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.200
actually be implemented with with an
action bar pattern like I think it could

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.210
action bar pattern like I think it could
 

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.060
action bar pattern like I think it could
I think it would be really really nice

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.070
I think it would be really really nice
 

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.470
I think it would be really really nice
to actually have just an action bar on

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480
to actually have just an action bar on
 

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.390
to actually have just an action bar on
top have the action on top the other

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400
top have the action on top the other
 

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.919
top have the action on top the other
things the back he doesn't quite do what

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:01.929
things the back he doesn't quite do what
 

00:18:01.929 --> 00:18:03.480
things the back he doesn't quite do what
I expected to do it does something which

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.490
I expected to do it does something which
 

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.700
I expected to do it does something which
is good but as you can see it all it

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:05.710
is good but as you can see it all it
 

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.919
is good but as you can see it all it
does is is swap that title there to exit

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:07.929
does is is swap that title there to exit
 

00:18:07.929 --> 00:18:10.050
does is is swap that title there to exit
right and i can now I can get back to

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.060
right and i can now I can get back to
 

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.610
right and i can now I can get back to
exit so that's yeah which is this which

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:11.620
exit so that's yeah which is this which
 

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.380
exit so that's yeah which is this which
is not what that he does like I expect

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:13.390
is not what that he does like I expect
 

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.210
is not what that he does like I expect
these to be approximately the same and

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:15.220
these to be approximately the same and
 

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.250
these to be approximately the same and
they're not now while you're you're

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:17.260
they're not now while you're you're
 

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.290
they're not now while you're you're
talking I'm just gonna switch us into

the mode where you can actually see
 

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.730
the mode where you can actually see

screen yes sometimes that screws up
 

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.290
screen yes sometimes that screws up

little sad that with the
tablet-optimized view we still have the

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260
tablet-optimized view we still have the
 

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.990
tablet-optimized view we still have the
zoom panel available but I will point

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000
zoom panel available but I will point
 

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.670
zoom panel available but I will point
out is if you're going to do if you're

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:04.680
out is if you're going to do if you're
 

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.070
out is if you're going to do if you're
going to leave the zoom on make it work

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080
going to leave the zoom on make it work
 

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.780

go to settings and actually change that

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760
go to settings and actually change that
 

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.520
go to settings and actually change that
and so rather than I'd rather see this

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:28.530
and so rather than I'd rather see this
 

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.180
and so rather than I'd rather see this
still targeting at least SDK level 11 it

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:32.190
still targeting at least SDK level 11 it
 

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.860
still targeting at least SDK level 11 it
does actually use the menu key though

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:33.870
does actually use the menu key though
 

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.080
does actually use the menu key though
right right so so yeah this is it is a

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.090
right right so so yeah this is it is a
 

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.730
right right so so yeah this is it is a
it's not a button of shame it's a button

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740
it's not a button of shame it's a button
 

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.490
it's not a button of shame it's a button
of does what's supposed to exactly

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500
of does what's supposed to exactly
 

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.260
of does what's supposed to exactly
that's fine and I I may want to think

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:45.270
that's fine and I I may want to think
 

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.090
that's fine and I I may want to think
about other ways to do it but yeah I

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100
about other ways to do it but yeah I
 

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.650
about other ways to do it but yeah I
mean I'd loved I'd love to see this game

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660
mean I'd loved I'd love to see this game
 

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.720
mean I'd loved I'd love to see this game
actually you know take advantage of the

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:50.730
actually you know take advantage of the
 

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.070
actually you know take advantage of the
action bar pattern I think that

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080
action bar pattern I think that
 

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.540
action bar pattern I think that
especially since this is you know this

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:53.550
especially since this is you know this
 

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.210
especially since this is you know this
is a game that really feels very very

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220
is a game that really feels very very
 

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.680
is a game that really feels very very
native like I think it makes a lot of

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:57.690
native like I think it makes a lot of
 

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.260
native like I think it makes a lot of
sense to use that pattern that's uh you

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:00.270
sense to use that pattern that's uh you
 

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.240
sense to use that pattern that's uh you
know and especially since there are some

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:02.250
know and especially since there are some
 

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.650
know and especially since there are some
great there's some great software out

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660
great there's some great software out
 

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.850
great there's some great software out
there that's been written by the guys

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860
there that's been written by the guys
 

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.590
there that's been written by the guys
over at actionbarsherlock that make it

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600
over at actionbarsherlock that make it
 

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.970
over at actionbarsherlock that make it
really really easy to implement that

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980
really really easy to implement that
 

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.760
really really easy to implement that
pattern across different platforms that

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:09.770
pattern across different platforms that
 

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.380
pattern across different platforms that
being said you know I think that if

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:12.390
being said you know I think that if
 

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:13.670
being said you know I think that if
you're if you're not implement this

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:13.680
you're if you're not implement this
 

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.200
you're if you're not implement this
pattern this is the way to do it I mean

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.210
pattern this is the way to do it I mean
 

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.270
pattern this is the way to do it I mean
this is absolutely big runs and 88 runs

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280
this is absolutely big runs and 88 runs
 

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.590
this is absolutely big runs and 88 runs
and really nice kind of ways you can

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600
and really nice kind of ways you can
 

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.210
and really nice kind of ways you can
actually really see when we wouldn't

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220
actually really see when we wouldn't
 

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.740
actually really see when we wouldn't
play one round here and we should also

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:21.750
play one round here and we should also
 

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.470
play one round here and we should also
know while you're geeking out about that

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480
know while you're geeking out about that
 

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.769
know while you're geeking out about that

this turns out to just be a much better
 

00:22:41.879 --> 00:22:44.960
this turns out to just be a much better
implementation I think yeah I decide

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:44.970
implementation I think yeah I decide
 

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.430
implementation I think yeah I decide
this absolutely i mean i think well

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440

see the game board on the other side and
 

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.779
see the game board on the other side and
then once the game ends it ends you know

00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:02.789
then once the game ends it ends you know
 

00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:04.129

for almost everyone you can see if
there's a counter a clock down countdown

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:06.570
there's a counter a clock down countdown
 

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.720
there's a counter a clock down countdown
clock on the left hand side so it's

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:08.730
clock on the left hand side so it's
 

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.369
clock on the left hand side so it's
actually a really really nice tablet

00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:10.379
actually a really really nice tablet
 

00:23:10.379 --> 00:23:12.049
actually a really really nice tablet
feel here and you can see also the ad

00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059
feel here and you can see also the ad
 

00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:14.090
feel here and you can see also the ad
actually fits into a nice place as well

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100
actually fits into a nice place as well
 

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.989
actually fits into a nice place as well
so yeah it's really really well done and

00:23:16.989 --> 00:23:16.999
so yeah it's really really well done and
 

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:19.369
so yeah it's really really well done and
and i can see that i also got you pegged

00:23:19.369 --> 00:23:19.379
and i can see that i also got you pegged
 

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:22.159
and i can see that i also got you pegged
uh well the anybody assumption is if you

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:22.169
uh well the anybody assumption is if you
 

00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:24.440
uh well the anybody assumption is if you
play this game a lot that you probably

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:24.450
play this game a lot that you probably
 

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.149
play this game a lot that you probably
need a date out wow that i think i think

00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159
need a date out wow that i think i think
 

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:30.379
need a date out wow that i think i think
that's what this part is that that's

00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:30.389
that's what this part is that that's
 

00:23:30.389 --> 00:23:31.879
that's what this part is that that's
what this targeting means but i'm not

00:23:31.879 --> 00:23:31.889
what this targeting means but i'm not
 

00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:33.739
what this targeting means but i'm not
sure so Richard what can you tell us

00:23:33.739 --> 00:23:33.749

this is this is really impressive I i
think the the font size on it so if you

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:51.730
think the the font size on it so if you
 

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.540
think the the font size on it so if you
look at yeah the font size over here on

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:54.550
look at yeah the font size over here on
 

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.730
look at yeah the font size over here on
the on a gameplay screen you see there's

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:56.740
the on a gameplay screen you see there's
 

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.870
the on a gameplay screen you see there's
letters and there's these little numbers

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880
letters and there's these little numbers
 

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.410
letters and there's these little numbers
in the corner that the font that you're

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:01.420
in the corner that the font that you're
 

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.270
in the corner that the font that you're
using phone numbers is about what I

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:03.280
using phone numbers is about what I
 

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.910
using phone numbers is about what I
would want to see over on the right on

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:05.920
would want to see over on the right on
 

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.710
would want to see over on the right on
the words yeah so it just means on the

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720
the words yeah so it just means on the
 

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.390
the words yeah so it just means on the
tablet you should i when you did when

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:09.400
tablet you should i when you did when
 

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.280
tablet you should i when you did when
you detect a large screen like that it

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:11.290
you detect a large screen like that it
 

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.950
you detect a large screen like that it
makes sense to bump the font size a

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960
makes sense to bump the font size a
 

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.700
makes sense to bump the font size a
little bit

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:14.710
little bit
 

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.310
little bit
think on those as well but just because

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.320
think on those as well but just because
 

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.450
think on those as well but just because
of me especially there's also just an

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:18.460
of me especially there's also just an
 

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.980
of me especially there's also just an
enormous amount of white space here and

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:19.990
enormous amount of white space here and
 

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.779
enormous amount of white space here and
you know that's really the only other

00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:21.789
you know that's really the only other
 

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:23.399
you know that's really the only other
thing is that you know it'd be cool to

00:26:23.399 --> 00:26:23.409
thing is that you know it'd be cool to
 

00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:26.789
thing is that you know it'd be cool to
figure out ways of me there's a ton of

00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799
figure out ways of me there's a ton of
 

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:29.039
figure out ways of me there's a ton of
white space because you know we suck it

00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.049
white space because you know we suck it
 

00:26:29.049 --> 00:26:31.230
white space because you know we suck it
getting words right well that's true

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240
getting words right well that's true
 

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.330
getting words right well that's true
we're good at this game and actually if

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:33.340
we're good at this game and actually if
 

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.490
we're good at this game and actually if
I'd like if I if I could get some words

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:35.500
I'd like if I if I could get some words
 

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.080
I'd like if I if I could get some words
that were like you know 50 characters

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.090
that were like you know 50 characters
 

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.269
that were like you know 50 characters
long oh actually the biggest word you

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279
long oh actually the biggest word you
 

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:42.539
long oh actually the biggest word you
can get is actually I guess you know 24

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:42.549
can get is actually I guess you know 24
 

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:44.610
can get is actually I guess you know 24
carries over sorry 20 characters long

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:44.620
carries over sorry 20 characters long
 

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.210
carries over sorry 20 characters long
but wait I'm Brian brain-dead 16

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:48.220
but wait I'm Brian brain-dead 16
 

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.720
but wait I'm Brian brain-dead 16
characters are on but any case you know

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:51.730
characters are on but any case you know
 

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.360
characters are on but any case you know
had really really long long words you

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.370
had really really long long words you
 

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.669
had really really long long words you
know then they would still obviously be

00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679
know then they would still obviously be
 

00:26:56.679 --> 00:26:58.049
know then they would still obviously be
like this you can see that those words

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:58.059
like this you can see that those words
 

00:26:58.059 --> 00:26:59.639
like this you can see that those words
actually fit into this little column on

00:26:59.639 --> 00:26:59.649
actually fit into this little column on
 

00:26:59.649 --> 00:27:01.860
actually fit into this little column on
the left hand side so that's just so

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:01.870
the left hand side so that's just so
 

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.510
the left hand side so that's just so
that just means the font can be larger

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520
that just means the font can be larger
 

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.639
that just means the font can be larger
the white space you know white space can

00:27:05.639 --> 00:27:05.649
the white space you know white space can
 

00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:06.960
the white space you know white space can
be a little argue but also people do

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:06.970
be a little argue but also people do
 

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.100
be a little argue but also people do
want to see the number boards it'd be

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.110
want to see the number boards it'd be
 

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.149
want to see the number boards it'd be
very cool to actually be able to do

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159
very cool to actually be able to do
 

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:11.340
very cool to actually be able to do
something like actually zoom in and out

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:11.350
something like actually zoom in and out
 

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.350
something like actually zoom in and out
like actually peanut like hey you know

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360
like actually peanut like hey you know
 

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.180
like actually peanut like hey you know
I'd like to see the list a little larger

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.190
I'd like to see the list a little larger
 

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.220
I'd like to see the list a little larger
or smaller is is if I'm trying to just

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:17.230
or smaller is is if I'm trying to just
 

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.570
or smaller is is if I'm trying to just
go quickly and figure out what's worse

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:18.580
go quickly and figure out what's worse
 

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.919
go quickly and figure out what's worse
or it might be fun to make can may have

00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:19.929
or it might be fun to make can may have
 

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:21.419
or it might be fun to make can may have
play with that but you don't want to say

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:21.429
play with that but you don't want to say
 

00:27:21.429 --> 00:27:23.730
play with that but you don't want to say
that list kicked ass that was that's so

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:23.740
that list kicked ass that was that's so
 

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.590
that list kicked ass that was that's so
cool because yeah not only did I show

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600
cool because yeah not only did I show
 

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.299

you what words the other people found
 

00:27:27.309 --> 00:27:30.180
you what words the other people found
but actually the pattern it really gets

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:30.190
but actually the pattern it really gets
 

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.340
but actually the pattern it really gets
that sort of competitive thing I'm

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:32.350
that sort of competitive thing I'm
 

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.060

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.170
is I I do love the artwork it's a little
 

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.350

confusing at first it seems to have some

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360
confusing at first it seems to have some
 

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.620
confusing at first it seems to have some
some real issues up here in the corner I

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:17.630
some real issues up here in the corner I
 

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.660
some real issues up here in the corner I
don't have any ideas on that down I do I

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:19.670
don't have any ideas on that down I do I
 

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.460
don't have any ideas on that down I do I
actually I think that the issue is it's

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:21.470
actually I think that the issue is it's
 

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.280
actually I think that the issue is it's
just not really really happy at this

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:24.290
just not really really happy at this
 

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.840
just not really really happy at this
aspect ratio it actually is doing better

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:25.850
aspect ratio it actually is doing better
 

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.610
aspect ratio it actually is doing better
now that we have our displaying it an

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:27.620
now that we have our displaying it an
 

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.950
now that we have our displaying it an
HDMI if you acted because it actually

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960
HDMI if you acted because it actually
 

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.299
HDMI if you acted because it actually
helps the aspect ratio you get a little

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:31.309
helps the aspect ratio you get a little
 

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:34.799
helps the aspect ratio you get a little
closer I'm saying so if I were to go to

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:34.809
closer I'm saying so if I were to go to
 

00:29:34.809 --> 00:29:38.710
closer I'm saying so if I were to go to
crop mode for instance on this which we

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720
crop mode for instance on this which we
 

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.180
crop mode for instance on this which we
didn't do before because we wanted to

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:40.190
didn't do before because we wanted to
 

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.930
didn't do before because we wanted to
show off buttons of shame yes but now I

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:43.940
show off buttons of shame yes but now I
 

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.850
show off buttons of shame yes but now I
go back to blitz mood so and so now it's

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:45.860
go back to blitz mood so and so now it's
 

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.520
go back to blitz mood so and so now it's
cropping off the system bar hmm um and

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:48.530
cropping off the system bar hmm um and
 

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:52.299
cropping off the system bar hmm um and
that is yeah it's actually worse yeah

00:29:52.299 --> 00:29:52.309
that is yeah it's actually worse yeah
 

00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:53.919
that is yeah it's actually worse yeah
that's that's why it so it's just I

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:53.929
that's that's why it so it's just I
 

00:29:53.929 --> 00:29:55.210
that's that's why it so it's just I
think there's just issues with aspect

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:55.220
think there's just issues with aspect
 

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.860
think there's just issues with aspect
ratios and we're then how that shows up

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:56.870
ratios and we're then how that shows up
 

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.820
ratios and we're then how that shows up
how the ad shows up but that was my my

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:00.830
how the ad shows up but that was my my
 

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.650
how the ad shows up but that was my my
initial take on that

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:03.660
initial take on that
 

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.380
initial take on that
but let's go back to the game itself so

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:07.390
but let's go back to the game itself so
 

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.870
but let's go back to the game itself so

actually more akin to doodle jump as far
 

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.180
actually more akin to doodle jump as far
as other games are concerned and you

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:21.190
as other games are concerned and you
 

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.940
as other games are concerned and you
know it in place it plays pretty well

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:22.950
know it in place it plays pretty well
 

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.560

you know you know right wouldn't you say

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:37.660
you know you know right wouldn't you say
 

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.660
you know you know right wouldn't you say
that you know just immediately we are

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:39.670
that you know just immediately we are

sure so too and that's how we know

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:46.420
sure so too and that's how we know
 

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.980

exactly Nick we are ok but so let's take

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:49.990
exactly Nick we are ok but so let's take
 

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.640
exactly Nick we are ok but so let's take
a look at that's the game itself now one

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:53.650
a look at that's the game itself now one
 

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:54.630
a look at that's the game itself now one
of the really interesting things about

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640
of the really interesting things about
 

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.260
of the really interesting things about
this game so it didn't ship with AI but

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:57.270
this game so it didn't ship with AI but
 

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:02.040
this game so it didn't ship with AI but
if you download the new go you AI

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.050
if you download the new go you AI
 

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.220
if you download the new go you AI
partner you can you can install it and

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:05.230
partner you can you can install it and
 

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.500
partner you can you can install it and
it will play with you so it which is

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:07.510
it will play with you so it which is
 

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.440
it will play with you so it which is
pretty is so unix right like yeah let's

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:10.450
pretty is so unix right like yeah let's
 

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.540
pretty is so unix right like yeah let's
modularize the whole thing absolutely I

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:12.550
modularize the whole thing absolutely I
 

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.609
modularize the whole thing absolutely I
I know is there is there is that you

00:37:14.609 --> 00:37:14.619
I know is there is there is that you
 

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:16.470
I know is there is there is that you
know you almost want a kind of robot API

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480
know you almost want a kind of robot API
 

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.569
know you almost want a kind of robot API
so you can design your own go robots

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:18.579
so you can design your own go robots
 

00:37:18.579 --> 00:37:20.549
so you can design your own go robots
basically now I'm gonna switch this to a

00:37:20.549 --> 00:37:20.559
basically now I'm gonna switch this to a
 

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:22.020
basically now I'm gonna switch this to a
nine by nine board too so it's a little

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.030
nine by nine board too so it's a little
 

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:25.620
nine by nine board too so it's a little
easier to see mm-hm um but no it also

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:25.630
easier to see mm-hm um but no it also
 

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.809
easier to see mm-hm um but no it also
matches my go abilities so I think that

00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:27.819
matches my go abilities so I think that
 

00:37:27.819 --> 00:37:29.339
matches my go abilities so I think that
actually that actually works what not

00:37:29.339 --> 00:37:29.349
actually that actually works what not
 

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:31.710
actually that actually works what not
look how beautiful these stones are now

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720
look how beautiful these stones are now
 

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.200
look how beautiful these stones are now
they are all the same I like I could

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.210
they are all the same I like I could
 

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.410
they are all the same I like I could
really go for a set of stones with a

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:37.420
really go for a set of stones with a
 

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.599
really go for a set of stones with a
little bit of graphical variation and it

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:39.609
little bit of graphical variation and it
 

00:37:39.609 --> 00:37:41.789
little bit of graphical variation and it
would be fun yeah but hey look a that's

00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:41.799
would be fun yeah but hey look a that's
 

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:45.599
would be fun yeah but hey look a that's

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:47.530
my teeth that might be the case where it
 

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:49.920

may be that that's really the crap did

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:49.930
may be that that's really the crap did
 

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.810
may be that that's really the crap did
it is to me is to make us really make it

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:51.820
it is to me is to make us really make it
 

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.150
it is to me is to make us really make it
tonight that's fascinating in any case

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160
tonight that's fascinating in any case
 

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.370
tonight that's fascinating in any case
on you know there's so there's a couple

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:56.380
on you know there's so there's a couple
 

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.690
on you know there's so there's a couple
of little things we could quibble with

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:57.700
of little things we could quibble with
 

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.980
of little things we could quibble with
and that's definitely one of them I

00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:58.990
and that's definitely one of them I
 

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.520
and that's definitely one of them I
actually don't mind that having the

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:01.530
actually don't mind that having the
 

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.840
actually don't mind that having the
titles there if there is space you know

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:03.850
titles there if there is space you know
 

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.160
titles there if there is space you know
on this tablet version there certainly

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:05.170
on this tablet version there certainly
 

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.780
on this tablet version there certainly
is I think it just makes it a little

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:06.790
is I think it just makes it a little
 

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:10.950
is I think it just makes it a little
clearer and overall you know I think

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960
clearer and overall you know I think
 

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.560
clearer and overall you know I think
it's a really nice use of the action bar

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:13.570
it's a really nice use of the action bar
 

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:16.200
it's a really nice use of the action bar
i'm sure that Roman would would you know

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:16.210
i'm sure that Roman would would you know
 

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.150
i'm sure that Roman would would you know
have potential things about ordering um

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160
have potential things about ordering um
 

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.160
have potential things about ordering um
I would say though that that and I don't

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:20.170
I would say though that that and I don't
 

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.480
I would say though that that and I don't
think it's even a problem to put the

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:21.490
think it's even a problem to put the
 

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:23.370
think it's even a problem to put the
status up in the in the action bar I

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:23.380
status up in the in the action bar I
 

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.590
status up in the in the action bar I
think that's actually reasonable

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:24.600
think that's actually reasonable
 

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.700
think that's actually reasonable
reasonable use of that space you know

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:26.710
reasonable use of that space you know
 

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.620
reasonable use of that space you know
that's there is this kind of extra area

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:28.630
that's there is this kind of extra area
 

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.480
that's there is this kind of extra area
here I'd be curious to see what it looks

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:30.490
here I'd be curious to see what it looks
 

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.280
here I'd be curious to see what it looks
like on a phone I didn't try it did we

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.290
like on a phone I didn't try it did we
 

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.200
like on a phone I didn't try it did we
try a rotate into the portrait is that

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:34.210
try a rotate into the portrait is that
 

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.600
try a rotate into the portrait is that

the point where it's just it's starting

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:27.460
the point where it's just it's starting
 

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.650
the point where it's just it's starting
to push the olive pits starting to be

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:28.660
to push the olive pits starting to be

noticeably blurry yeah it's it's tough
 

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.010
noticeably blurry yeah it's it's tough
it's yeah this is high I'm tempted to

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:35.020
it's yeah this is high I'm tempted to
 

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.310
it's yeah this is high I'm tempted to
give it a pass but no and hopefully on

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:38.320
give it a pass but no and hopefully on
 

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.080

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.220
rotated it so the the YouTube screen is
not going to be exactly what we're

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:50.230
not going to be exactly what we're
 

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.720
not going to be exactly what we're
seeing here yeah but just right over

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:51.730
seeing here yeah but just right over
 

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.090

here for instance there's some very

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:54.100
here for instance there's some very
 

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.510
here for instance there's some very
noticeable aliasing around the edges of

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520
noticeable aliasing around the edges of
 

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:57.930
noticeable aliasing around the edges of
the

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:57.940

when when I see texted is that is that
 

00:45:08.079 --> 00:45:10.260
when when I see texted is that is that
anti aliased and blurry that actually I

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:10.270
anti aliased and blurry that actually I
 

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:12.390
anti aliased and blurry that actually I
find it actually be kind of a little bit

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400
find it actually be kind of a little bit
 

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.640
find it actually be kind of a little bit
of I straining to look at yeah yeah I

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:14.650

the gasolina is great permanently
 

00:45:21.339 --> 00:45:22.920
the gasolina is great permanently
unfocused so that's not that's when you

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:22.930
unfocused so that's not that's when you
 

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.329
unfocused so that's not that's when you
get to that level you know that's that's

00:45:24.329 --> 00:45:24.339
get to that level you know that's that's
 

00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:25.650
get to that level you know that's that's
when you know you need to actually go

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:25.660
when you know you need to actually go
 

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.329
when you know you need to actually go
for the higher higher rest house at or

00:45:27.329 --> 00:45:27.339
for the higher higher rest house at or
 

00:45:27.339 --> 00:45:28.530

you be honest what you could do in this

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:28.540
you be honest what you could do in this
 

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.950
you be honest what you could do in this
case is actually embed a font and use

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960
case is actually embed a font and use
 

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.500
case is actually embed a font and use
that for the text and and place it and I

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:34.510
that for the text and and place it and I
 

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.089
that for the text and and place it and I
think if that was done it would the

00:45:36.089 --> 00:45:36.099
think if that was done it would the
 

00:45:36.099 --> 00:45:37.620
think if that was done it would the
graphics would still be a little blurry

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:37.630
graphics would still be a little blurry
 

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:39.300
graphics would still be a little blurry
but it would help them so i think

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:39.310
but it would help them so i think
 

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:40.770
but it would help them so i think
there's def there's several options on

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:40.780
there's def there's several options on
 

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.569
there's def there's several options on
how to tackle that but i think low res

00:45:42.569 --> 00:45:42.579
how to tackle that but i think low res
 

00:45:42.579 --> 00:45:46.470
how to tackle that but i think low res

and we'll really start if you do zoom to

00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359
and we'll really start if you do zoom to
 

00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:23.210
and we'll really start if you do zoom to
fit screen which is better than crashing

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220
fit screen which is better than crashing
 

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.970

getting restarted its handling the
 

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:29.660
getting restarted its handling the
activity getting restarted that's great

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:29.670

and actually the funny thing is when you
 

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.910
and actually the funny thing is when you
zoom to fit screen you can't actually

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920
zoom to fit screen you can't actually
 

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.250
zoom to fit screen you can't actually
tell the difference yeah looks a little

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260
tell the difference yeah looks a little
 

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.109
