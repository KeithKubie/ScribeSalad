00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:13.705
- Thanks to the first two speakers

00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:16.998
and now our third speaker on the panel

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:20.303
is Doctor Yvonne Bonnie Maldonado,

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:23.162
who is Professor of the
departments of Pediatrics

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:25.115
and Health Research and Policy,

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:27.756
Chief of Division of Infectious Diseases

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:30.930
and Senior Associate Dean
of Faculty Development

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.722
and Diversity at Stanford
University School of Medicine,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.565
down the road from here.

00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:39.982
And Doctor Maldonado's research interests

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.822
are the epidemiology and prevention

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:45.508
of viral vaccine preventable diseases

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:48.284
such as measles, polio, rotavirus.

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:52.117
And she is internationally
known and published

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:57.115
in Zimbabwe, in Mexico,
and in the United States.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.069
A fellow of the American
Academy of Pediatrics

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.642
and the Infectious Disease
Society of America.

00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:06.220
And on and on and on and on.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.458
And we are privileged to have you join us

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:12.502
for this discussion of
Zika, thank you Bonnie.

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:14.728
(applause)

00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:16.336
- Thank you Lucy sorry you were so so busy

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:17.910
I didn't get a chance to.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.147
Thank you everybody and
hopefully I'll be able

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:22.647
to keep you awake after lunch.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.863
Thank you for inviting me.

00:01:24.863 --> 00:01:27.269
We are all colleagues even
though we are right down

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:30.372
the street we are not, we're
all trying to get along,

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:33.510
so I always am happy to be at UCSF

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.806
and represent my colleagues here.

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:37.244
Because we're all in this together,

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:38.951
especially for a disease like this

00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:41.473
that as you've heard already
we don't know much about

00:01:41.473 --> 00:01:45.676
and we need to work together
to figure out what to do.

00:01:45.676 --> 00:01:48.899
So I have no disclosures for this.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.407
I am on an advisory board, data
safety and monitoring board

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:54.907
for a vaccine trial by Pfizer.

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:58.287
I'm also by the way on
the red book committee

00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:00.278
for the American Academy of Pediatrics,

00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:01.340
I'm the vice chair of that committee,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.047
I'm also the AAP representative
on the Zika CDC guidelines.

00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:07.698
So I can maybe explain
a little bit more about

00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:09.850
what they mean by consider
which means they don't know.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.293
(laughter)

00:02:12.293 --> 00:02:13.956
So yeah they don't know but they also

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:16.891
don't wanna discourage people
from not doing anything

00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.405
so they just say well if
we say MRI then they won't

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.623
do anything so maybe we'll
just say if you want to,

00:02:21.623 --> 00:02:24.023
go ahead and do it but
don't let that stop you

00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:25.366
from doing all the other stuff.

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.464
So I think they're really
worried about people.

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:31.689
In fact about 25% of
practices aren't doing any

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.581
of the evaluations that
we're recommending.

00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:35.651
Because they don't, we
know why but they're just

00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:37.041
not doing them, so.

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:38.834
Anyway you saw this wonderful slide.

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:42.834
Actually it's not true
that other viral diseases

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:46.572
transmitted by mosquitoes
have caused this.

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.266
We have seen for example
chikungunya, dengue,

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:52.133
and others have actually
caused congenital malformations

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:54.737
of the brain so they're not very common.

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.585
And that's what's very
striking about Zika,

00:02:56.585 --> 00:03:00.731
is that it does cause a
very substantial proportion

00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.720
at this time.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.675
Now remember we're looking
at a very early onset

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:06.609
of a virus that came into a population

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.177
that was completely susceptible

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:10.842
with lots of crowding et cetera.

00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:13.832
And so we don't really know
if this is gonna continue

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:16.382
to be a pattern or if this
is really just hitting

00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:19.372
all of the susceptible
populations all at one time

00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:21.060
and maybe we'll see it slow down.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.899
So right now we're in a slow
period all around the world.

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:27.669
Especially in tropical
areas where right now

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.723
they are not yet in the rainy season.

00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:31.783
They're gonna start coming
back into the rainy season.

00:03:31.783 --> 00:03:33.655
I was just in the Yucatan Peninsula

00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:36.115
and also in Puerto Rico
talking about cases

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.613
and it's been very quiet
right now but we're heading

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:40.038
into the rainy season.

00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:41.337
So we don't know whether this,

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:44.391
cause this is the first year
we really are looking at this

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.016
and we won't know what's gonna happen.

00:03:46.016 --> 00:03:48.141
You already saw most of these case counts

00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:51.614
are a little bit more up to
date but only a weeks more.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:53.171
I think the important
thing here to remember

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.042
is you need to know the local transmission

00:03:56.042 --> 00:03:57.838
even if you don't have any.

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.579
But also be aware of transmission
because there are a lot

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.020
of people who travel.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.641
About 40 million people
a year go to places

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:08.039
where there might be Zika transmission

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.465
or where there's definitely mosquitoes.

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:11.512
So you will actually start seeing people

00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:14.259
who have traveled to areas
and may be concerned.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.146
So these are the numbers
that you've already seen.

00:04:16.146 --> 00:04:19.375
It's really important to note
here that there are a lot

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.243
of cases in the Caribbean.

00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:24.603
Over almost 40000 cases
now locally acquired.

00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:26.867
It's really hard to look
at sexual transmission

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.351
in an area where there's
so much local transmission.

00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:31.689
So we really don't know the impact there.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.683
When you look at aggregate
cases in pregnant women

00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:39.072
as you heard is about
almost 1400 in the US

00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:41.025
and the District of Columbia.

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:43.891
About 3000 in Puerto Rico
and they keep their own

00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:47.008
separate data so their
numbers vary depending

00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:48.767
on who you ask in Puerto Rico.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:51.727
But they're certainly
seeing a lot of cases there.

00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:53.501
Now in the US and the
District of Columbia,

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.973
we have about 1000 completed pregnancies

00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:58.668
with 38 liveborns with birth defects

00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:02.021
and five pregnancy losses that
we know with birth defects.

00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.220
Not all of these have been
confirmed to be Zika though

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.809
around the losses.

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:10.328
And in the US territories
the Puerto Rican data's

00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:12.207
not available online
but when I was talking

00:05:12.207 --> 00:05:16.645
to a health department there
they said that they'd had

00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:19.300
about 50 pregnancy loses
but they didn't actually

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.927
look for Zika in all of them
so we don't know that those

00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:23.240
are related to Zika.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.202
And about five children who
were born with birth defects.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.656
The virus again as you heard about

00:05:28.656 --> 00:05:31.907
was identified in 1947
but what's really striking

00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:35.236
is that it really just took
off when it came to Brazil.

00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:39.264
It's been circulating for many many years,

00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:41.026
primarily in central Africa.

00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:44.045
And then in the early
2000s it started migrating

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:46.241
into Asia and Southeast Asia,

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.019
primarily because of infected individuals

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:52.460
coming into countries and then
infecting local mosquitoes.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.565
So there is that cycle there.

00:05:54.565 --> 00:05:56.917
We do have that opportunity unfortunately

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:59.060
here in the southern part of the US.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.210
But not as high as the risks in Brazil

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.735
or other places in the world because

00:06:03.735 --> 00:06:05.915
we have better screening
and air conditioning.

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:10.775
It is a virus that's related
to yellow fever and dengue

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.610
which actually is endemic
now in the Caribbean

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.777
and parts of northern Latin
American and it's a flavivirus.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.485
These viruses are
arboviruses which stands for

00:06:22.485 --> 00:06:26.418
arthropod-borne viruses
or mosquito borne viruses.

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:28.494
They're usually transmitted primarily

00:06:28.494 --> 00:06:31.030
by the bite of an infected arthropod.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.988
It's the Aedes species in
this situation, Aedes aegypti

00:06:33.988 --> 00:06:37.738
and Aedes albopictus is
the secondary vector.

00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:42.424
Ticks obviously no transmission for Zika

00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:44.644
but for the other arbos it can be.

00:06:44.644 --> 00:06:47.255
And there can be a cycle
primarily of just mosquito

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:49.154
to human to mosquito.

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:53.593
But as you know we also have
transmission in other routes

00:06:53.593 --> 00:06:54.756
as we'll talk about.

00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:56.052
So these are the two culprits.

00:06:56.052 --> 00:06:58.273
Here this is Aedes aegypti up here.

00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:01.563
This is the most common vector for Zika.

00:07:01.563 --> 00:07:05.382
This is Aedes albopictus
which also can transmit.

00:07:05.382 --> 00:07:10.272
We don't have a lot of
these mosquitoes in the US

00:07:10.272 --> 00:07:14.263
but they can be imported in
cargo containers et cetera

00:07:14.263 --> 00:07:17.604
that have small bits of
water where larvae can grow.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.799
They can also transmit dengue
and chikungunya viruses

00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:24.268
which are also prevalent now
in the Caribbean as well.

00:07:24.268 --> 00:07:25.931
And these are nervous feeders.

00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:27.885
That is as opposed to Anopheles mosquitoes

00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:31.612
which transmit malaria and
only bite one person at a time

00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:32.994
and then move off.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.128
Aedes are very nervous biters.

00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:37.341
They'll bite and feed for a little bit

00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:38.216
and then they'll jump around.

00:07:38.216 --> 00:07:41.710
So they can feed on up to
five to 10 people a day

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.876
so the risk of transmission
from multiple people

00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:45.126
is much higher.

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.895
As you heard before there are
other modes of transmission,

00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:53.062
sexual, mother to fetus,
and possibly breast milk,

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:57.648
blood transfusion, lab
exposure and organ transplant

00:07:57.648 --> 00:07:59.165
also are theoretical.

00:07:59.165 --> 00:08:02.054
The question around sexual
transmission's not clear yet

00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:03.957
because again in the areas
where there's most Zika,

00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:06.515
it's hard to detect the difference between

00:08:06.515 --> 00:08:11.321
sexual transmission and locally
acquired from mosquitoes.

00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:14.595
In the US we have seen cases as you know.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:16.316
And this is just a schematic showing you

00:08:16.316 --> 00:08:18.937
that we have an infected person here,

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:21.027
they can transmit to a mosquito,

00:08:21.027 --> 00:08:22.612
and then the mosquito
can live in households.

00:08:22.612 --> 00:08:25.448
And by the way these
mosquitoes love biting humans

00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:27.720
as opposed to the Anopheles
which transmit malaria

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.246
which prefer to bite large animals,

00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:33.591
not that we're not large, but
big and like cows and horses

00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:35.508
and that kind of thing.

00:08:36.977 --> 00:08:40.221
Aedes love biting humans and
so they love to live inside

00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:43.033
houses and they can live in
up to a teaspoon of water.

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:46.190
So doesn't take a lot of
liquid for them to grow.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.062
And then you can see the cycle here.

00:08:48.062 --> 00:08:51.390
But again we talked about
mother to child transmission,

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.499
sexual transmission and
other blood borne methods

00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:56.029
of transmission.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:57.578
Where is Zika now?

00:08:57.578 --> 00:09:00.241
It's reported in 70 countries
now and here's a list.

00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:02.392
Just looking at the western hemisphere

00:09:02.392 --> 00:09:05.856
you can see the western
hemisphere is quite impacted.

00:09:05.856 --> 00:09:08.135
You notice that Chile doesn't
seem to have any cases

00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:10.784
and it may be that with the Andes there,

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:14.253
they may not have as
many cases or any cases

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:16.922
that have been reported to date.

00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:19.109
Now what about in the US?

00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:21.705
Zika has been reported in 49 states

00:09:21.705 --> 00:09:23.335
and the District oF Columbia.

00:09:23.335 --> 00:09:26.563
The one state that has not
reported Zika cases is Alaska.

00:09:26.563 --> 00:09:29.053
There has been local
transmission in Florida

00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:32.661
and in the very very southern
tip of Texas as well.

00:09:32.661 --> 00:09:35.837
And we've seen it in
American Samoa, Puerto Rico,

00:09:35.837 --> 00:09:38.224
as I mentioned which is really accounts

00:09:38.224 --> 00:09:41.794
for most of the transmissions
so far in the US territories

00:09:41.794 --> 00:09:44.544
and of US Virgin Islands as well.

00:09:45.854 --> 00:09:47.843
We talked about symptoms already.

00:09:47.843 --> 00:09:49.717
I think what's really
important to point out here

00:09:49.717 --> 00:09:53.000
from the epidemiologic
perspective is that 80% of people

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.653
are not symptomatic.

00:09:54.653 --> 00:09:56.297
Even when you look going forward,

00:09:56.297 --> 00:09:58.403
you do not see evidence of symptoms.

00:09:58.403 --> 00:10:00.739
So you could have silent
transmission and circulation

00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:03.948
of this virus and not
know what's going on.

00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:06.237
So this is what worries
us in particular around

00:10:06.237 --> 00:10:07.237
a pregnancy.

00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:11.542
We had talked about congenital disease.

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:15.066
This is just a schematic
showing that you really do have

00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:17.795
a drop out of neuronal cells.

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:21.441
And this really is very
much in parallel to rubella,

00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:24.135
which really does kill these cells.

00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:26.527
And if you take these
cells in tissue culture

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:29.004
and you grow them, they will just die.

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:31.093
They completely just get devastated.

00:10:31.093 --> 00:10:33.842
And we know that the Zika receptor,

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:37.468
and that stated from the ECSF
actually was the first report

00:10:37.468 --> 00:10:39.343
and then some from Hopkins later,

00:10:39.343 --> 00:10:43.749
demonstrated that the Zika
receptor exists in many

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:45.634
of the neural progenitor cells,

00:10:45.634 --> 00:10:48.489
that is the cells that
become the brain later on.

00:10:48.489 --> 00:10:50.482
But also all over the placenta.

00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:52.352
Both on the maternal
side and the fetal side.

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:56.406
So there's lots of opportunities
for this virus to infect.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.703
CDC and other labs confirmed
Zika in fetal tissues.

00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:03.870
And theses are pictures showing
evidence of Zika virus here,

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.250
products of fetal demise.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.411
And also has been identified
in amniotic fluid, placenta,

00:11:12.411 --> 00:11:15.257
the brain and other
products of conception.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:18.537
You heard a little bit about
the evidence of causality

00:11:18.537 --> 00:11:22.117
but there is very very rigorous
data now coming from CDC

00:11:22.117 --> 00:11:25.067
and others looking at many
not only just the evidence

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:28.811
of teratogenicity but also
causality for microcephaly.

00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:30.841
And both of those Shepherds criteria,

00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:32.100
the Bradford Hill criteria,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.139
which are the classic
epidemiological criteria

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:38.006
to establish causality have been met.

00:11:38.006 --> 00:11:39.988
It was in very short period of time

00:11:39.988 --> 00:11:42.081
people have really
looked at this carefully

00:11:42.081 --> 00:11:44.398
and this is a paper summarizing that.

00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:46.631
I would encourage people
who are interested

00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:50.480
to look at the CDC.govt/Zika website

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.989
and you can find anything you need to know

00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:54.917
including resources and we'll
talk about that in a bit.

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:57.544
But this study also, as you heard earlier,

00:11:57.544 --> 00:11:59.685
emphasizes the fact that even children,

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:02.191
so we don't think that
Zika is a latent virus,

00:12:02.191 --> 00:12:03.609
that means we don't think it incorporates

00:12:03.609 --> 00:12:06.779
into the human genome and stays forever.

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:09.529
But we do think that it can hide.

00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:14.066
But we don't know how long
it can hide in the body.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.678
We do know that it can
stay in semen for example

00:12:16.678 --> 00:12:18.323
for several months.

00:12:18.323 --> 00:12:20.897
It can be in the cervical
secretions of pregnant women

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:23.143
for many many weeks.

00:12:23.143 --> 00:12:26.141
And we don't know how long that can be.

00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:29.492
So we do think at some point
the virus does get killed.

00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:33.028
We also think that
immunity could be lifelong

00:12:33.028 --> 00:12:34.699
if we think about it from the standpoint

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:36.918
of other flaviviruses.

00:12:36.918 --> 00:12:38.420
But the important thing is that

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.910
when a child looks asymptomatic at birth,

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.983
it doesn't mean they're not infected,

00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:45.008
and that that infection may not set up

00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:47.008
long term complications.

00:12:51.073 --> 00:12:53.823
Oh I'm going the wrong way sorry.

00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:58.372
So this is a study that
is really not based

00:12:58.372 --> 00:13:02.259
on actual transmission data in patients.

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:04.621
This is really looking at an
aggregate of what's happened

00:13:04.621 --> 00:13:08.196
so far primarily in Bahia,
Brazil which is where

00:13:08.196 --> 00:13:11.081
the original outbreak was
thought to have started

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.591
in the western hemisphere, the big one.

00:13:13.591 --> 00:13:17.674
And it is estimated
that between one and 13%

00:13:20.144 --> 00:13:22.775
of Zika infections can
lead to microcephaly.

00:13:22.775 --> 00:13:24.979
And it's thought also from this model

00:13:24.979 --> 00:13:27.077
that it's most likely to
occur in the first trimester

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:30.223
but we don't know that for sure.

00:13:30.223 --> 00:13:31.912
And you heard about Zika in pregnancy.

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:33.613
One of the important
things to note is that

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:36.209
it's not worse in women who are pregnant.

00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:38.998
We don't think that they're at
higher risk for bad symptoms

00:13:38.998 --> 00:13:43.491
or for prolonged, well maybe
prolonged transmission,

00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:46.924
because as we know we just
found out that there can be

00:13:46.924 --> 00:13:49.982
prolonged shedding in the
cervical and vaginal tracts.

00:13:49.982 --> 00:13:53.982
So there may be increased
shedding of the virus.

00:13:54.955 --> 00:13:56.305
And transmission through breast milk

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:58.486
has not been documented
but it has been found

00:13:58.486 --> 00:14:01.347
in samples of breast milk.

00:14:01.347 --> 00:14:03.897
And we know about the
clinical manifestations

00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:06.569
around neurologic disease.

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:10.870
So severe microcephaly and
also I would like to point out

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.202
that some of the peripheral findings

00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:16.123
at this point appear to be related

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:19.380
to actual direct infection
of the spinal cord,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.729
or effect of the spinal cord not just

00:14:21.729 --> 00:14:22.875
the central nervous system.

00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:26.286
So you're not only having CNS
disease but also peripheral.

00:14:26.286 --> 00:14:29.251
And in that case that
may account for some of

00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:30.662
the contractions that we're seeing

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.638
but we don't know that for sure yet.

00:14:33.638 --> 00:14:35.509
There are post natal
infections in children.

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:37.962
And it's important to point
out that in these post natal

00:14:37.962 --> 00:14:41.033
infections the children
actually just get symptoms

00:14:41.033 --> 00:14:44.097
that are similar to those
in adults and older children

00:14:44.097 --> 00:14:47.689
and appears to be mild and
does not seem to be associated

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:51.856
with any of the severe outcomes
that we see in children

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.537
who have transmission
from mother to child.

00:14:56.537 --> 00:15:00.287
And the question is at
what point after birth

00:15:01.246 --> 00:15:04.212
do you have this relatively mild course

00:15:04.212 --> 00:15:05.510
compared to the severe ones.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.494
So for example if you're exposed
during breast feeding only

00:15:09.494 --> 00:15:13.661
or if you're exposed during
the labor and delivery process

00:15:14.837 --> 00:15:17.254
will that always lead to just

00:15:18.368 --> 00:15:20.430
mild infection or no infection?

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.003
And we don't know that either.

00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:24.180
So who should be tested?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.259
I think you heard all of
the guidelines already.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:28.565
Patients obviously with symptoms

00:15:28.565 --> 00:15:32.437
who have been in areas where we know that

00:15:32.437 --> 00:15:34.182
Zika transmission is occurring.

00:15:34.182 --> 00:15:37.275
Or who have been linked
epidemiologically to a case.

00:15:37.275 --> 00:15:40.083
Or other people who are asymptomatic

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:42.133
who've traveled to these areas or who have

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:44.663
a sexual partner at risk.

00:15:44.663 --> 00:15:47.033
It is nationally notifiable as you heard

00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:49.222
as well as congenital infections.

00:15:49.222 --> 00:15:51.289
And infants should be tested for Zika

00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:56.059
if they have microcephaly or
intracranial calcifications

00:15:56.059 --> 00:15:58.602
and were born to women
who traveled to or resided

00:15:58.602 --> 00:16:01.604
in areas with Zika
transmission while pregnant.

00:16:01.604 --> 00:16:04.805
Or born to mothers with
positive or inconclusive testing

00:16:04.805 --> 00:16:08.805
especially with the IGM
test for Zika infection.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.382
Communicating test results,

00:16:11.382 --> 00:16:12.827
I think you already heard about this.

00:16:12.827 --> 00:16:17.725
It's really important to get
the data to the local or state

00:16:17.725 --> 00:16:20.057
health department because
there are a number of national

00:16:20.057 --> 00:16:22.122
and international registries
'cause we're trying

00:16:22.122 --> 00:16:24.032
to figure out how to aggregate these

00:16:24.032 --> 00:16:26.017
and figure out what the natural history

00:16:26.017 --> 00:16:28.417
of the disease would be.

00:16:28.417 --> 00:16:30.863
There is no specific
treatment and you're gonna get

00:16:30.863 --> 00:16:34.410
the usual kind of advice
around getting plenty of rest

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.670
and drinking fluids to
prevent dehydration et cetera.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.587
But really nothing specific
about this disease.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.036
There are vaccines that are in the process

00:16:45.036 --> 00:16:47.100
of being developed and
the assistant secretary

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.902
for preparedness and response
for the federal government

00:16:51.902 --> 00:16:54.197
as well as another
organization called BARDA

00:16:54.197 --> 00:16:56.612
which also develops interventions

00:16:56.612 --> 00:16:58.400
for the Department of Defense,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.627
are working on a number of vaccines.

00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:02.543
And there are quite a few.

00:17:02.543 --> 00:17:06.241
And they are looking at
potential general use

00:17:06.241 --> 00:17:08.367
and commercial distribution by 2020

00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:10.701
which I think is very optimistic.

00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:13.784
But they are starting to look
at doing some early studies

00:17:13.784 --> 00:17:17.918
and at least in primates
of candidate Zika vaccines

00:17:17.918 --> 00:17:20.246
appeared to be pretty
effective in preventing

00:17:20.246 --> 00:17:25.140
not only disease but even
the spread of virus and blood

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.653
in other body fluids.

00:17:27.653 --> 00:17:31.471
And so here's a landscape
of Zika vaccine development.

00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.961
And the further to the left you see

00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:36.565
the more early in stages are the vaccines.

00:17:36.565 --> 00:17:39.576
So there are two vaccines, two or three,

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:42.346
I think it's two vaccines
now that are ready

00:17:42.346 --> 00:17:44.059
for human clinical trials.

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:46.141
And we're looking forward
to seeing the results

00:17:46.141 --> 00:17:48.724
of those trials coming up soon.

00:17:49.749 --> 00:17:51.235
So we don't know a lot.

00:17:51.235 --> 00:17:52.149
And what don't we know?

00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:54.315
We don't know if there's a
safe time during your pregnancy

00:17:54.315 --> 00:17:56.239
to travel to an area with Zika.

00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:58.869
If a person travels and gets bitten,

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.978
how likely are you to get Zika?

00:18:00.978 --> 00:18:02.794
Or that your baby will have birth defects

00:18:02.794 --> 00:18:04.470
from the infection.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.892
Trimester of pregnancy
appears that earlier

00:18:06.892 --> 00:18:09.045
is more important but we have seen babies

00:18:09.045 --> 00:18:12.932
who we think have been
exposed during later trimester

00:18:12.932 --> 00:18:15.265
and can be affected as well.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.876
And we don't know if previous infections

00:18:18.876 --> 00:18:21.880
provide immunity or
whether previous infections

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.868
will have an impact on future pregnancies.

00:18:24.868 --> 00:18:27.616
I won't go thought the evaluation
and outpatient management.

00:18:27.616 --> 00:18:29.874
I just wanted you to see
that there is an algorithm

00:18:29.874 --> 00:18:32.968
as was pointed out earlier
that the CDC will provide

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:34.164
and it's in your booklet.

00:18:34.164 --> 00:18:36.099
If you really really need to do that,

00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:38.295
you should probably really
talk to a specialist

00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:41.103
who can help you because it's
really multidisciplinary,

00:18:41.103 --> 00:18:44.016
involving neurologists,
ophthalmologists, et cetera,

00:18:44.016 --> 00:18:46.046
many other people.

00:18:46.046 --> 00:18:49.412
We really need to make
a very clear statement

00:18:49.412 --> 00:18:51.713
around family and psychosocial support.

00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:55.298
And there are a number of
resources at the CDC website

00:18:55.298 --> 00:18:57.886
where you can look at
information for families

00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:00.699
when you're communicating the disease.

00:19:00.699 --> 00:19:03.476
There are pediatric
evaluation and follow up tools

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:06.993
as well at the CDC
website which you can use

00:19:06.993 --> 00:19:08.721
for management.

00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:10.675
There are a number of
studies as you can imagine

00:19:10.675 --> 00:19:12.282
that are being done now.

00:19:12.282 --> 00:19:15.492
The main questions are
what is the level of risk

00:19:15.492 --> 00:19:17.383
during pregnancy?

00:19:17.383 --> 00:19:21.550
When during pregnancy is
the risk at highest peak?

00:19:23.144 --> 00:19:25.771
What is the full range of
health effects on babies?

00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:29.020
Is there mild neurologic
disease or severe?

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.845
And I'm sure there is but
how to we determine that?

00:19:33.845 --> 00:19:35.053
And what other infections?

00:19:35.053 --> 00:19:37.088
For example in these areas that have Zika,

00:19:37.088 --> 00:19:39.866
they already had dengue virus
which is a related disease.

00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:43.852
And there's lab based
evidence that when you have

00:19:43.852 --> 00:19:46.824
antibody to dengue it might
actually make the Zika virus

00:19:46.824 --> 00:19:48.387
infection worse.

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:52.191
But we only know that because
of lab studies using cells.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.585
So if you grow cells and
you put Zika virus in them,

00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:59.368
and you add antibody to dengue,
the cells get more infected,

00:19:59.368 --> 00:20:00.764
and they get more disrupted.

00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:02.995
But we don't know if
that's true in humans yet.

00:20:02.995 --> 00:20:04.551
So in some studies have suggested that

00:20:04.551 --> 00:20:06.271
that may not be true in humans.

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.752
So that would just be
a horrible thing for us

00:20:08.752 --> 00:20:13.033
and we would really need to
ramp up our prevention efforts.

00:20:13.033 --> 00:20:15.078
Not that we shouldn't do
it anyway but that would be

00:20:15.078 --> 00:20:16.648
important to know.

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:19.794
And then of course all of
the late onset problems

00:20:19.794 --> 00:20:22.375
that we might see as well.

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:26.252
There are a number of
pregnancy registries.

00:20:26.252 --> 00:20:29.169
There's the CDC pregnancy registry,

00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:32.292
the Zika active pregnancy
surveillance system

00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:33.469
in Puerto Rico,

00:20:33.469 --> 00:20:35.270
there's one in Columbia.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.626
There's birth defects surveillance here

00:20:37.626 --> 00:20:39.110
and then there's an Arbonet surveillance

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.158
of children with Zika.

00:20:40.158 --> 00:20:43.539
So quite a number and last
week one of my faculty members

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:46.147
who works on Zika in Grenada

00:20:46.147 --> 00:20:48.285
went to a World Health
Organization meeting

00:20:48.285 --> 00:20:50.587
where they have every
organization they could think of

00:20:50.587 --> 00:20:52.818
who had children that they were following

00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:54.623
because they really are
trying to get this data

00:20:54.623 --> 00:20:56.941
together as quickly as possible.

00:20:56.941 --> 00:21:01.339
So I will just say that what
you can really do at this point

00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:05.506
is report cases if you
suspect them to the registry.

00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:08.721
And also to really take advantage

00:21:08.721 --> 00:21:11.722
of all of the resources to
get more educated about this

00:21:11.722 --> 00:21:14.343
in case you find children
who might have evidence

00:21:14.343 --> 00:21:17.112
of microcephaly or if a pregnant woman

00:21:17.112 --> 00:21:18.766
has been at risk of traveling.

00:21:18.766 --> 00:21:20.355
So know the basics.

00:21:20.355 --> 00:21:22.675
Diagnose and test if you can,

00:21:22.675 --> 00:21:24.641
and if you don't have
that capacity yourself,

00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:27.044
know who you can refer to.

00:21:27.044 --> 00:21:28.674
Understand the assessment and management

00:21:28.674 --> 00:21:30.225
should you come upon it.

00:21:30.225 --> 00:21:33.361
Many many of these academic
centers will have that

00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:35.338
capability to help you out.

00:21:35.338 --> 00:21:38.605
And really what you can
do on an individual level

00:21:38.605 --> 00:21:41.525
is provide support in
your respective fields

00:21:41.525 --> 00:21:42.899
for these families.

00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:46.341
And inform your state and local
health department as well.

00:21:46.341 --> 00:21:51.201
So these are my references
and I will stop there.

00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:52.596
And thank you so much for your attention.

00:21:52.596 --> 00:21:54.846
