00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.509
There are 196 countries in the world.
25 of them are very rich, defined as having

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.929
an average wealth per person of over $100,000
a year.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.339
They are:

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.690
But far more countries are quite poor, and
some - which we’re considering here - are

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.410
very very poor.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.510
These are the 20 poorest countries in the
world: where the per capital wealth is under

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.520
a $1,000 a year, or under three dollars a
day.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.120
Every country is now more or less on a path
to growth, but the poor ones are growing very,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.469
very slowly. If Zimbabwe continues at its
current growth rate, it will qualify as a

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.349
‘rich country’ in 2722 years.

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:45.179
What we want to know in this film is why some
countries prosper and others stagnate:

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.759
- so we can understand what rich countries
are doing right

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.940
- and get a better grip on the challenges
and hurdles facing poor countries.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.420
There are basically three factors that determine
whether a country will be rich or poor.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.489
The first is:

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.720
INSTITUTIONS

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.069
Institutions are beyond important.
Broadly speaking, rich countries have 'good

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.810
institutions' and poor ones have very, very
bad ones.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.560
The correlation between poverty and corruption
is direct. The richest countries in the world

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.720
are quite simply invariably also the least
corrupt ones.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.220
And the most corrupt countries are also the
poorest.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.360
When countries are corrupt, they can’t collect
enough taxes to get the good institutions

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.080
they would need to escape the poverty trap.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.640
Half of the wealth of the world’s poorest
20 countries goes into offshore accounts.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.940
Lost revenues in these countries totals between
$10 and $20 billion dollars a year

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.100
Meanwhile, without an adequate tax base, poor
countries can’t invest in police, education,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.420
health, transport.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.630
Now, a more generous way to look at corruption
is that it’s really a case of clan-based

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.680
thinking. Say you’re hiring someone. In
the rich countries, you’re meant to do so

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.420
simply on merit, interviewing lots of candidates
then picking the best one irrespective of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.640
any personal connection.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.270
But in poor countries under the sway of clan-based
thinking, that approach would itself be corrupt:

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.599
it’s your duty to disregard the so-called
best candidate from an anonymous bunch, in

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.890
order to pick someone from your own team:
your uncle, your brother, your second cousin,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.870
the guys from the same tribe.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.769
As a result, poor countries don’t allow
themselves access to the intelligence and

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.579
talent of the whole population.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.879
There’s a second thing that keeps countries
poor:

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.079
CULTURE

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.069
- what goes on in people’s minds, their outlooks
and beliefs...

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.760
A striking statistic pops up here in relation
to religion.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.849
If there’s one generalisation you can make
about religion and wealth, it’s that the

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.139
less people believe, the richer they stand
a chance of being.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:47.430
19 of the richest countries in the world have
70% or more of their populations saying religion

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.349
is not at all important to them.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.939
The exception here is - unsurprisingly - the
United States, which manages to combine great

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.489
religiosity with huge wealth (more on that
in a second).

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.099
And conversely, the poorest nations in the
world are also extremely believing ones. Here’s

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.439
how many people think religion and the supernatural
is deeply important in the following countries:

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.280
In the world’s poorest country, simply everyone
is a believer.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.519
Why is belief quite so bad for wealth creation?

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.540
Because in general, religiosity is connected
up with the idea that the here and now can’t

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.939
be improved, so you should focus on the spiritual
and look forward to a next world instead.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.480
It makes quite a bit of sense when you live
here.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.430
In the rich world on the other hand, people
are generally great believers in their capacity

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.599
to alter their destiny through effort and
talent.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.389
Incidentally, to explain the anomaly of the
United States, religion seems not to slow

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.950
down economic growth here because it is a
particular sort of religion: an overwhelmingly

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.510
Protestant and exceptionally materialistic
kind. The American god

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.019
doesn’t want
you to think of building the new jerusalem

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.999
in the next world, He wants it here and now
in Kansas or Houston.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.800
There’s another big factor that determines
the wealth and poverty of nations:

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.200
GEOGRAPHY

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.189
Poor countries are overwhelmingly located
in the tropical regions. This isn’t a coincidence.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.809
Life is, in many ways, simply far far tougher
there.

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.259
The problems begin with agriculture:

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.709
Tropical plants are generally a lot less packed
with carbohydrates.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.330
Poor countries have worse soil too.
Also, and perhaps surprisingly, a tropical

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.910
climate can be disadvantageous to photosynthesis.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.720
Historically, a key determinant in the likelihood
of societies growing rich was their possession

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.930
of large domesticated animals (such as horses
and oxen) which liberated a huge part of the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.759
workforce from having to plough by hand.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.650
But in tropical africa, domesticated animals
have throughout time been devastated by a

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.500
further appalling scourge: the Tsetse fly.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.979
This small fly—exclusively present in Africa
because of its heat and humidity— knocks

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.030
out animals on an enormous scale, making them
sleepy or inactive - and has had a profound

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.340
effect on the ability of Africans to develop
technology, increase agricultural productivity

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.389
and amass wealth.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.270
--
It isnt just plants and animals that suffer

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.280
in the tropics. In the middle latitudes, humans
are open to a terrifying array of diseases

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.960
including

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.360
100% of low-income countries are affected
by at least five tropical diseases simultaneously.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.889
The magical temperature which has helped to
make rich countries rich is 16 degrees centrigade.

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.740
However superficially unpleasant, that drop
below 16 degrees as autumn starts to bite

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.900
is quite literally, a foundation stone of
civilisation.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.400
Geography also encompasses transport and poor
countries are, on the whole, very badly connected.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.050
Landlocked Bolivia and semilandlocked Paraguy
are the poorest nations in South America

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.620
Africa has only one major navigable river,
the Nile and hosts 15 landlocked nations,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.669
11 of which have average incomes of $600 or
less.

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.069
Not coincidentally, the poorest country in
Asia, Afghanistan, is also landlocked.

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.210
Then there’s the matter of natural resources.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.889
Natural resources (like oil or precious metals)
can be real trouble - and, paradoxically,

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.511
poor countries tend to have them in spades.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.970
These natural resources are what economists
call intensifiers: they will help to make

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.860
a country with good institutions richer, but
one with bad institutions get even poorer,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.389
precipitating what’s called the resources
trap.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.449
So the Democratic Republic of the Congo is
one of the world’s most mineral rich countries;

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.280
holding most of the world’s Coltan, which
every mobile phone has a bit of inside.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.169
But natural resource wealth helps elites to
grab money without requiring the cooperation

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.330
of the whole society. If the only way to grow
wealthy is to assemble high tech aeroengines,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.039
for example, you’re going to need your whole
society to buy into the project but if you

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.789
just need to extract a few minerals, you can
do so with a small labour force, guns and

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.099
an airstrip long enough to ferry your loot
out to market.

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:06.099
The wealth from Coltan keeps DRC armed rebels
in guns and corrupts every level of society.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.050
So how should one weigh up the relative importance
of all these different factors, institutional,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.699
cultural and geographic, in determining the
wealth of a nation.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:18.240
There’s no hard and fast rules, but as a
guide, one can suggest that:

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.990
50% of a nation’s wealth comes down to its
institutions

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.599
20% is due to its culture.
and 10% each can be allocated to latitude,

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.530
connectivity with the rest of the world, and
geological good fortune.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.449
If you’re a policy maker, this discussion
has wide practical implications. But at a

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.449
more personal level, one might take away two
things from it;

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.840
Firstly, Modesty: you should have a better
idea of what you owe your individual success

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.539
to - which is not so much your own hard work
or fine mind, as the broader society you live

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:55.129
in which was produced over centuries and which
you now draw benefit from unknowingly.

00:07:55.129 --> 00:08:00.360
And at the same time, Sympathy: an ability
not to see failing societies just as basket

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.360
cases, but rather as countries facing comprehensible
and hugely difficult problems. Our sympathy

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.060
can be enhanced by reflecting that the troubles
of desperate lands are to a considerable extent

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.699
to do with malaria, a lack of navigable river
and the horrific buzzing of the tsetse fly

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:24.080
- rather than always some more intimate human
failing which we would ourselves never manifest.
