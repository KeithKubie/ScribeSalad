00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.410
- Here we are, flying above the
Monterey Bay National Marine

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.690
Sanctuary.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.430
Spectacular view today.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.720
We've been studying this
region for some time.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.160
And what we've learned is that
the largest migration on earth

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.968
occurs beneath the sea here.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.426
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.460
We're keeping alive a
tradition of tagging

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.360
that goes back
almost 40 years now,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.890
to when I was a
young student working

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.240
with Dr. Frank Carey of Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160
Dr. Carey was
pioneering deployment

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.310
of acoustic technology
on large predatory fish

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.440
when a crisis struck
the shark world.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.290
- Something's going
on, what's going on?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.240
[WHISTLE BLOWING]

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.140
- Everybody out.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.420
- It was 1975, when the
world's first summer

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.235
blockbuster was released.

00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:04.900
"Jaws" smashed
box office records

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.980
and unleashed an
irrational terror

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.230
the idea that the only good
shark was a dead shark.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.380
"Jaws" author, Peter
Benchley, was horrified

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.070
and became a dedicated
shark conservationist.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.910
He joined forces with Carey on
the first scientific expedition

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.260
to study white sharks
in the Atlantic.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.350
- This will give us
water temperature,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.823
the depth of the fish, and
his muscle temperature.

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:35.115
- He's coming up to the boat,
he want to bite the boat.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.240
- Dr. Carey believed white
shark's hunting ability,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.520
endurance, and intense
bursts of speed

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.050
were enhanced by
being warm bodied.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.600
- Nice place?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.336
- Nice place, terrific.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:46.840
Let's see what his
temperature is.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.330
It's 23.2.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.135
The water is 17
degrees, so the fish

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.140
is 23, that's a six
degree difference.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.700
That's really warm.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.980
- This important
revelation was followed

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.300
by a stream of
scientific firsts,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.760
including Stan Waterman
shooting this first footage

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.690
of a white shark
below American waters.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.460
Carey collected biological
data as the shark swam

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.650
for 110 miles over five days,
showing that electronic tagging

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.140
was the wave of the future.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.130
Barbara Block was
Frank's technician.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.610
She was inspired and took
Carey's pioneering science

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.755
into the future.

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.100
- Some 40 years later, with some
of the world's most advanced

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.860
technology that you can put
on an animal in the sea,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.560
and what we're hoping
to get is a lot more

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.020
of the undersea
behavior, what's really

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.140
happening from the white
shark point of view this year.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.920
- Shark up.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.740
- Shark's right here.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.360
- We really designed
this process

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.270
to be a noninvasive
tagging process,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.100
but it requires that the
animals come close to you.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.510
And the idea is that they
come within five or six feet

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.140
of the boat.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.130
And that's when you
clamp that tag on.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.588
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.410
- What our entire
program is about

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.980
is figuring out how do we
really see beneath the sea

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.830
and capture what's
not very transparent?

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.920
How many sharks there are,
how many tunas there are.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.050
And how do we
prevent the poaching

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.490
that our generation has
unleashed upon the oceans, that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.430
will guarantee that
future generations see

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.976
these great predators.

00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:02.570
DAVID HELVARG: The media
is not a substitute

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.790
for social movements, but
obviously, social movements

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.760
depend on it.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.570
It's the oxygen.
Growing communications

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.810
tools that link young people
around our blue planet

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.830
and create social movements
out of common, shared values.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.750
These are the
moments and movements

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.120
that one waits a
lifetime to experience.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.390
And young people in every
part of our blue ocean planet

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.760
are beginning to come
together and say,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.790
if we just take the extractable
resources, we extract them all,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.860
and we end up with a wasteland.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.480
It's also a product
liability issue.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.260
This product, oil, used as
directed, overheats our planet

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.630
and acidifies our seas.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.000
Each of us can act
at so many levels,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.420
as consumers, as citizens,
to really change the tide

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.420
and to become part
of something larger.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.860
It's an opportunity.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.370
We really can build a
kind of citizen movement

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.513
and engagement that
changes everything.

00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:58.968

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.730
MICHIEL BAKKER: All righty,
good afternoon everybody.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.930
So let's dive right in.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.960
So maybe as a first
opening question,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.650
whoever wants to take it.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.380
So why should we care
about the oceans?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.320
So what role does
oceans actually

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.680
play for us human beings?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.168
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: Small question.

00:05:25.168 --> 00:05:26.940
Go ahead.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.712
Take a breath or two
and talk about it.

00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:30.420
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: Well,
it's good that you

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.700
say that, take a breath.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.490
One of the things that
we say is about 50-80%

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.680
of the oxygen in our
atmosphere that we breathe

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.160
is as a result of the oceans.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.900
We used to-- my career,
I started in the Amazon.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.290
And the reason I went
to work in the Amazon

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.990
was because it was the
lungs of the planet.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.230
And deforestation was this
massive concern at that time,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.480
that we thought was
contributing and driving

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.800
a lot of climate change.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.210
That's true.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.610
But I think what we've
learned since is that the--

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.237
and just even in
the last five years,

00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:02.820
we're learning more
and more about how

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.700
the ocean is the underpinning
for the global climate system.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.660
We think of it as
like maybe the beating

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.220
heart of the climate system.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.120
So it's hard to underestimate
the role of the ocean

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.620
in creating a habitable planet.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.848
So I'll tee that up
for everyone else.

00:06:18.848 --> 00:06:19.890
BARBARA BLOCK: Great job.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.970
I mean, oceans literally
cover 70% of our planet.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.730
And the oceans provide us
both with a blue economy,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.710
that we are dependent
upon as humans,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.170
as well as, Kyle said,
the oxygen we breathe.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.240
We're actually jeopardizing
right now our sustainability

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.100
on this planet by putting
heat into the ocean,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.840
putting CO2 into the sea, making
it much like a Coke warming up

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.280
on your desk.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.610
Bubble off oxygen, that's
vital for animals in the sea,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.290
and more corrosive because of
the absorption of CO2, which

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.350
means the gills of the sharks
and the tunas will be affected.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.770
DAVID HELVARG: Yeah, I mean
it's respiration, recreation,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.010
transportation, trade,
energy, protein, just

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.190
that sense of awe and wonder
when you look out to sea

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.620
and realize you're part of
something larger than yourself.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.930
And always that sense that the
sea was too large to impact,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.105
and yet in a blink of an
eye that's been my lifetime,

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:22.680
we've totally begun an
alteration of the largest

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.970
living system on the planet.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.150
MICHIEL BAKKER: Birgitte,
any other comments?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.880
ANA BLANCO: We're doing so
much to harm our oceans.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.700
And we depend on it so much
like everyone has already said.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.190
But I think one of the
most important things

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.810
is bringing awareness to how
vital and how critical it is.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.720
And I'm hearing a lot more
people talking about the ocean,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.900
especially with climate change.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.290
And it's a good thing.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.060
But there's still a
lot of work to do.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.910
And I think it can be
done on a broad scale.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.560
It can be done on a
legislative scale.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.550
It can be done on
an individual scale.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.140
So the mission is really
to get the word out.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.587
Because it's critical and
it's vital to our survival.

00:08:05.587 --> 00:08:07.170
MICHIEL BAKKER: So
what signals do you

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.930
see that really make
you believe that we

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.583
are at great risk for
the future of the oceans?

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:14.250
So are there things
that you really see,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.910
here are the clear elements that
you should see, loud and clear,

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.730
of why we're at risk.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.590
DAVID HELVARG: Florida
just had a red tide,

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.910
of harmful algal bloom that
killed hundreds of manatees,

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.060
thousands of marine
mammals, billions of fish,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.360
and created harmful
impacts for human health.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.549
People were actually
coughing and getting sick.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.039
That was on the Gulf
Coast of Florida.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.500
At the same time, you
had your green-blue algae

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.270
repeating on the
east coast, which

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.740
is called green gunk by the
locals, destroying the economy,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.180
threatening society.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.800
And globally, we're
seeing increase

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800
of these harmful algal blooms.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.690
It's just one of the indicators
of a sick ocean, when what

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.120
we need is a healthy ocean.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.920
BIRGITTE RASINE: And The other
one is also coral bleaching.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.170
I mean, that's been on
an exponential increase

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.520
unfortunately.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.130
And that's like the
canary in the gold mine.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.790
DAVID HELVARG: And this is the
largest living system on earth

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.310
that you can see from space,
the Great Barrier Reef.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.520
And we're seeing, if you get a
chance to see "Chasing Coral,"

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.410
it's a good documentary film.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.410
We wouldn't show it.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.150
Ana's Ocean Film Fest introduced
our March for the Ocean

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.650
in June.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.918
And we decided that we
wouldn't show certain films

00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:29.460
like "Chasing Coral"
because I didn't

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.100
want people crying while
we were marching for power.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.850
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: I would
say, one of the things,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.460
we know so little
about the ocean.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.410
And that's increasing
with all the technology,

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.050
and the sensors, and the
capability we have to explore.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.930
The problem of ocean plastic
has gotten a lot of attention

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.670
in the press.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.107
We've often been wondering
about that as ocean scientists,

00:09:50.107 --> 00:09:51.690
because we're like,
we've been talking

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.180
about climate change,
which is literally melting

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.850
the planet, for decades.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.020
And this has not gotten as much
attention as ocean plastic.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.670
But what I can tell you
is that most of what

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.990
we know about the ocean,
we know about the surface.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.910
If you heard Barb
in that first clip,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.830
she showed one of the
fascinating things

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.720
about these electronic
tags is they tell us

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.057
about the real lives
of tuna and sharks,

00:10:14.057 --> 00:10:15.640
that are traveling
all sorts of places

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.310
that we've never really been.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.210
One of the things we've
learned about plastic

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.270
in the ocean, which through
our work with the Monterey Bay

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.690
Aquarium Research Institute, is
that most of the microplastic

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.435
that's in the ocean is
far below the surface.

00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:31.810
It's several hundred meters
below the surface, about four

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.490
times the surface level.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.343
And everywhere we
looked, we found plastic.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.760
We found it at the
deepest places.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.590
We found it at the
surface, obviously.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.060
But everything that
you pretty much

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.460
know about ocean
microplastic is from studies

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.670
done at the surface, which
is an accessible place.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.970
And what we learn, the further
deep, the farthest we go,

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.620
is that it's everywhere.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.600
And so one of the
alarming things for us

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.090
is that, if you thought
microplastic in the ocean

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.490
was a problem, it's a
lot worse of a problem

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.750
than you probably knew.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.520
Because the further you go,
the further deep you go,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.210
the more you find.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.870
DAVID HELVARG: What you
don't want with technology

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.520
for observation
is you don't want

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.360
to have real time digital
imagery of ecosystem

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.740
in collapse.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.090
So when you use good technology
for fisheries enforcement,

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.520
as Google is working on,
when you use it for tracking

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.070
and science, as Barbara's
doing, developing

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.710
those kind of applications
that bring engineers together

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.900
with biologists, as MBARI
does, then hopefully,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.720
and in places like California,
the discoveries then,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.160
the science actually
gets applied to policy.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.450
Unfortunately, that's not true
at the present time in DC,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.290
where even the basic
science is denied.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.860
But I think we have a
moment with the technology

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.740
that we can transform
it into policy

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.330
with enough popular will.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.902
And we'll talk about that.

00:11:50.902 --> 00:11:52.360
BARBARA BLOCK: I
think what we have

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.700
to think about is
as a scientist,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.310
we're asking some really
big picture questions.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.820
What is Earth going to
look like without ice caps?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.550
What is the
consequence of melting

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.720
our polar and Antarctic caps?

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.920
What is going it to do in terms
of submergence, ocean currents

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.950
changing, the entire
biosphere that we live on,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.610
Earth, becoming different?

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.000
We're in the sixth
mass extinction.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.235
So how many of you
like to eat sushi here?

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:23.595
You can admit it.

00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:25.390
I see hands going up.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.500
Brian, of course.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.435
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
was up too.

00:12:30.435 --> 00:12:31.810
BARBARA BLOCK:
Yeah, the capacity

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.100
of humans to eat our way through
both land and sea is enormous.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.790
So we're actually destroying
our ocean environment

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.220
by not being sustainable
about what we eat.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.130
Sushi, Poke, all those
type of restaurants

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.110
are contributing
to this problem,

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.140
killing not only tunas,
but killing sharks,

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.630
and sea turtles, and seabirds.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.960
I think that there's hope, in
the sense that we have places

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.530
like Google, which are using
their tremendous resources

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.320
right now, not only
to do searches that

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.000
help us understand
what we're looking for,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.630
but also creating
transparency in the ocean

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.960
through Google Oceans
and Global Fish Watch,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.740
creating a capacity to now
see where humans are impacting

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.110
the planet in a way that we've
never been able to see before.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.110
So we're able to turn
on the light switch

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.310
and see where humans are.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.910
And if we can use
big data crunching

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.190
combining fish and ships
as well as fish and chips,

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.260
we'll be able to
potentially get our hands

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.920
on some of these problems.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.640
DAVID HELVARG: And I think
with my background 30 years

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.310
as a journalist, I
can't be eco-optimist,

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:44.110
but what I do say is, we're
now at this stage of triage.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.450
That we're going to save
what we can while we can.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.260
The IPCC report in
2018 says that if we

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.850
can keep temperatures
to 1.5 degrees Celsius,

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.990
we can save perhaps 10% of
our living coral reef systems.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.340
If it goes over two
degrees, we lose it.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.690
And so, with existential
threats like this,

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.130
we need big responses.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.500
I mean, right now I'm
working on the Blue New

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.267
Deal, the ocean
and coastal aspects

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:11.350
that we want to integrate.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.350
And I'm going back
east to DC on Wednesday

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.590
to talk to the people who
introduced the Green New

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.130
Deal, which is a great concept.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.970
By the time there's hopefully
a change in government,

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.930
and we hit the road, hit the
ground running in January 2021,

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.350
with real legislation to really
do the transition that science

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.300
tells us we have to.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.800
ANA BLANCO: And
then to add to that,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.030
I think we're very well-versed
and knowledgeable about what's

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.400
happening in the ocean,
and really appreciate

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.740
this opportunity to
share what we know.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.420
And one thing that
keeps popping up

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.510
that I'm reading
a lot more about

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.113
is the increase in population.

00:14:48.113 --> 00:14:49.780
Because, we as humans,
are the ones that

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.660
are doing most of the damage.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.810
And we are the ones that
need to be educated.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.190
But with the increase
in population, and just

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.000
it's taking its toll
on the finite resources

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.060
that this planet has to offer.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.070
So I think that is
another component that

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.750
plays into all of
this, that we need

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.587
to start talking about as well.

00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:12.670
MICHIEL BAKKER: You are
the experts in this field.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.040
As a layperson on
the outside, what

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.040
do you think we should know
being the three largest

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.323
challenges we're faced
with with the oceans?

00:15:21.323 --> 00:15:22.240
I know there are more.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.920
But if you would say, if we
could only fix the first three,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.600
what would those first three be?

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.490
ANA BLANCO: Should we
huddle first, and then

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.282
decide which ones we want--

00:15:32.282 --> 00:15:34.240
BIRGITTE RASINE: I think
that one thing that we

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.835
have to fix, or not fix,
but actually establish

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:40.540
is a relationship
between us and the ocean.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.240
I think, Kyle, you brought
up the point of how

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.403
come we didn't really
have so much pickup

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.820
in the media about
climate change,

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.110
and now plastic pollution?

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.590
Well, the reason is because
every one of us uses plastic.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.030
It's something that-- it's
our children's birthday toys.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.840
It's our plastic knives.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.820
It's lots of--
chairs in this room.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.570
So unless and until we can
start connecting those dots

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.708
and make it very
personal, something

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:05.750
that we care-- because
what do people care about?

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.040
They care about their health.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.460
They care about their
finances, our children,

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.860
things that are near
and dear to us, right?

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.610
So we have to find those
things that make the ocean near

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.270
and dear to us.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.250
So that would be--

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.667
DAVID HELVARG: Not
three, but when

00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:21.900
I wrote "50 Ways
to Save the Ocean,"

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.770
number one is go to
the beach, because you

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.340
protect what you love.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.210
And I think that's why
things work in California,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.790
because Californians have
the sense of entitlement

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.330
to the beach and ocean,
because we have the access.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.438
BARBARA BLOCK: I think we
have to eat sustainably.

00:16:36.438 --> 00:16:38.230
So we've got to figure
out what that means,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.940
both on land and sea.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.080
And when you see that brand new
Poke restaurant down street,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.530
start asking the question,
when you put a piece of tuna

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.230
in your mouth, where
did that tuna come from?

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.320
We don't put beef in
our mouth and do it

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.740
without knowing where's this
beef from, what type of animal

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.240
is it.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.030
And yet, we do this with
ocean food all the time.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.599
So I want everyone
to take a moment

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.480
and think about what
is it I'm eating.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.532
And has it been
caught sustainably?

00:17:09.532 --> 00:17:10.990
Is it something I
should be eating?

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.270
And what kind of waters
did it come out of?

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.369
DAVID HELVARG: I was at
the Our Ocean Conference

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.099
that John Kerry put on when
he was Secretary of State.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.190
Sylvia Earle came late
to the lunch table.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.274
And there's just one
tray left with sort

00:17:23.274 --> 00:17:25.015
of fillets labeled fish.

00:17:25.015 --> 00:17:26.140
She goes what kind of fish?

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.265
I go, oh, there's the
Assistant Secretary of State,

00:17:28.265 --> 00:17:29.410
let's go ask her.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.915
Drag her over,
and she goes, um--

00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:33.940
Sylvia's like,
it's labeled fish.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.050
She goes, well, I
asked the caterers

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.480
to make sure it was sustainable.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.110
She says, but it's labeled fish.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.662
The chicken's not labeled bird.

00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:44.125
BARBARA BLOCK: [LAUGHS] The
chicken's not labeled bird.

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:46.000
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: I think
what everyone's said

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.010
is obviously important.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.760
Climate change, I think
we probably agree,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.630
is the number one threat facing
the ocean and the planet.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.870
Sustainable fishing is
absolutely up there.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.710
And I think that just from a
sheer scientific standpoint,

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.050
I would say marine
pollution, and sewage,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.930
and plastic as part of that,
has got to be up there.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.850
And Aldo Leopold
said that we love--

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.100
we grow to love
what we understand.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.260
And by engaging California--

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.070
I mean, I'm not from California.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.610
But one of the fascinating
things about coming here

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.610
a couple of decades ago is
that the dream of California

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:28.330
seems to me, the coexistence
of relatively pristine nature

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.670
and the most advanced
technological society

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.920
that we have right
here in the Bay Area.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.660
We have this
wonderful open space.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.500
And we didn't have
that by accident.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.530
We had that on purpose,
because people loved

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.943
the open space and the coast.

00:18:39.943 --> 00:18:41.860
And we have this California
Coastal Commission

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.630
who vehemently defends that.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.030
And that is the essence of
like Surfrider Foundation

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.350
and organizations like that.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.365
I'm a surfer.

00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:49.990
I don't surf on
certain days, because I

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.500
don't want the pollution in the
water, to get sick from that.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.480
And just engaging and
taking care of the place

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.300
where you are, I think,
is absolutely critical.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.430
DAVID HELVARG: And when I
wrote "The Golden Shore,

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.305
California's Love Affair
with the Sea," which

00:19:02.305 --> 00:19:04.750
I won't flash up here.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.900
But basically, I'd been in DC
nine years, and I came home.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.120
And a lot of what we did
with Blue Frontiers, how

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.080
do we scale up
solutions in time.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.830
And I realized, California
is a solution at scale.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.360
We're 40 million people.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.660
We're the world's
fifth largest economy.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.620
And we do pretty good
with our coast and ocean,

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.090
because there's that
sense of entitlement.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.810
And I also think there's this
democracy of blue interest,

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.780
because you have
conservationists, and surfers,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.780
and fishermen, and the
Navy, and the ports,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.912
and all these different
interests that value.

00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:36.370
And when you do
right by the ocean,

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.350
you find out it does
good by your economy

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.075
and everything else.

00:19:41.075 --> 00:19:42.200
Ask yourself this question.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.750
To Barbara and to
Richard as well.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.120
So this notion of does what I
eat really make a difference,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.760
and does one person
really make a difference.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.270
So when you talk about
knowing what you eat,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.802
sushi, poke, you
it might be, how

00:19:57.802 --> 00:19:59.260
would you deal with
an individual's

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.960
who's going to pose you the
question, my individual actions

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.420
don't really make a
difference, because I'm one

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.710
of know seven billion people.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.630
How do you ultimately
touch that individual,

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.270
and make him or her believe
that his or her actions do

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.367
make a difference?

00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:16.450
BIRGITTE RASINE: Well, I
would say that you're not

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.470
just one person.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.150
You're one of seven billion.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.750
So the more of us
that think like that,

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.802
it's going to be seven billion
people thinking like this.

00:20:24.802 --> 00:20:25.760
BARBARA BLOCK: I agree.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.430
I mean, we've lost
our connection

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.030
to the natural world.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.030
It's happening
all the time as we

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.570
evolve on this planet
as a human species.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.200
I think that the more that we
can understand that individuals

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.870
make a difference
through both education,

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.130
such as the aquarium, or through
youth programs, connecting

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.730
humans to the sea, humans
to the land, the better

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.140
off this planet will be.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.770
Because that's what we've
lost across the globe.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.020
And the more we interact
with technology,

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.730
the less we interact
with the world around us.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.855
BIRGITTE RASINE: And that's
why like, you guys know

00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:01.780
that Instagram egg?

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.460
How many of you have seen that?

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.950
The one that garnered more, like
the most Instagram likes ever.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.200
And so I think, well, if I
were that one person liking

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.492
that egg, I could have said,
well, I'm just one person.

00:21:11.492 --> 00:21:14.090
I'm not going to make a change
in how many likes this egg has.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.530
And yet, we've got 35 or
50 million likes, right?

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.060
So we've just got to
find that thing that

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.040
makes us hit like on the ocean.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.830
DAVID HELVARG: In French, they
say that one egg is enough.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.120
But it's really, it's
this false dichotomy.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.420
I can't help myself.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.670
People say, well, is it the
personal or the political?

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.210
And it's like saying do you quit
smoking or fight big tobacco?

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.220
I mean, I don't eat sushi.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.650
And then we had a
healthy ocean hill day

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.700
where we lobbied and helped
pass an IUU pirate fishing bill,

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.040
so that we don't
deplete the ocean.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.880
I mean, your individual
acts, the things you do,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.470
inspire you to engage
with the larger world.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.700
MICHIEL BAKKER: So how do
you engage your audience?

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.408
So how do you get
people actually excited

00:22:01.408 --> 00:22:04.460
about your world versus
so many other worlds

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.840
that are screaming for attention
and for activism as well?

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.150
Maybe, for you, David.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.650
DAVID HELVARG: Start
with people who

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.390
love the ocean, who
live by the ocean.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:18.780
We try and build a constituency.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.810
We bring every two
years, except this year,

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.040
because it's useless.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.700
Bring people together in
DC from around the ocean,

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.920
connect Maritime
conservationists

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.780
with Maritime communities.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.900
Realize they have allies in
places like big institutions,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.270
like the Monterey Aquarium,
the National Aquarium.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.020
That they have allies with the
Commandant of the Coast Guard,

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.050
or with Senators
Whitehouse or Markey.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.260
And go on the Hill.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.500
We've had Healthy
Ocean Hill Days,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.510
where we've had 26
state delegations,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.880
and the third biggest
was from Colorado,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.230
because in April, we're going
to have an inland ocean Action

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.310
Summit in Dallas.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.770
And we're going to try and
grow the inland ocean movement,

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.680
and make people realize every
state's a coastal state.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.880
You connect up.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.140
It starts, like I say,
number one's go to the beach.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.680
It starts with people who
love, and care, and depend

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.690
for their livelihoods
on the ocean.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.570
And then you just try
and do whatever you can,

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.320
and use whatever tools you
have, to connect with people.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.020
Tools like the International
Ocean Film Festival

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.120
and the tools of science.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.360
And make science
exciting, the way Barbara

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.340
gets to commune with
great white sharks.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.255
And one of the
things in California

00:23:27.255 --> 00:23:28.130
is, we're not afraid.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.588
There's a sense
that if there's not

00:23:29.588 --> 00:23:31.760
something bigger and
meaner than you out there,

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.710
it's not really wilderness.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.720
And I think that just
making those connections.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.570
I always talk about
our job in the US

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.390
is to restore the blue and
our red, white, and blue.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.860
It's patriotic not to
pollute our living seas.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.640
ANA BLANCO: And I
want to add to that.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.400
I actually went with
David to Washington, DC,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.960
for one of his Blue
Vision Summits.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.918
I can't remember how many
years ago it was now.

00:23:52.918 --> 00:23:55.890
But there were so many people
from all over the country.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.520
And we had the opportunity
to meet with our legislators.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.540
And we were discussing the
ocean policy back then.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.830
And we had three things that
we wanted to talk about.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.360
And it was my first time,
actually, being on the Hill.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.470
And actually being able
to talk to my legislators.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.950
And I was so impressed
with the impact

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.940
that we had as a group, coming
from across the United States,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.720
and having a voice, and
communicating our interests

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.560
and what we needed.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.700
So getting people together and
getting that voice out there

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.260
is what David does.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.690
And we do it with the
film festival as well.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.240
So we provide a
platform for people

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.730
to come together and
talk about the ocean.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.680
And we show films
from around the world.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.160
And film is incredibly
powerful for telling a message,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.613
whether it's a 30-second PSA.

00:24:45.613 --> 00:24:48.950
The "Blue Serengeti"
film that we showed,

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.680
Barbara's film that we showed,
and had a wonderful panel

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.170
discussion about
that afterwards.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.670
DAVID HELVARG: Well, when and
where might you be doing this?

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.230
ANA BLANCO: Thanks, David.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.350
The festival is coming
up in March 7 through 10.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.960
And it's at Cowell
Theater in San Francisco.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.110
So it's really an
opportunity for us

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.960
to raise awareness
about the ocean.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.060
And there's something
for everyone,

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.330
in terms of the myriad
topics that we cover.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.820
Because there's so many
issues in the ocean that

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.240
need to be talked about, not
only climate change, sea level

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.490
rising, overfishing, mining,
drilling, sand dredging,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.390
marine wildlife.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:30.680
But we also show films that are
how we engage with the ocean,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.770
and appreciate it, and have
fun with it, from surfing,

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.860
and sailing, and the
joy that it brings us,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.530
and the peace and tranquility
that it brings us,

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.200
which is all the more
reason to protect it.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.240
But again, it's just like David
said, bringing people together

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.760
who are like minded, who
have a common interest

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.410
and want to do something.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.110
And until you learn
about what you can do,

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.580
you're kind of at a
loss, so to speak.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.480
And so the films,
and David's Summit,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.460
it's really just a
matter of getting engaged

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.410
and finding out what's out
there and what's available.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.660
DAVID HELVARG: And last June
9th, Ana brought the film

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.980
fest the night before, in DC.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.870
We had a first ever
march for the ocean.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.650
And the anchor march in DC
was only like 3,000 people,

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.680
but there were 114 other marches
that happened around the world.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.160
And we discovered that there's
this whole youthful cohort,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.340
this sort of year class
of 10 to 18-year-olds,

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.350
who are very engaged
round plastic.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.750
And so the Dublin march,
and 11-year-old activists

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.850
led 500 people in Dublin.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:33.910
And out in the Pacific, there
was a 12 and a 16-year-old

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.870
who organized that Chamorro
was on their island that

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.910
then got hit by a typhoon
three months later.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.890
So people are-- and
we'll do it again

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.360
on World Oceans Day, June 8th.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.090
But people are marching
for something that's

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.290
immediately on top of them.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.950
I mean, what we saw with the
hurricane season of 2017,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.670
and then the climate
impacts with--

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.490
I mean, I think 2018
was sort of the year

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.160
of no denial between
Mexico Beach, Florida,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.230
and Paradise, California.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.010
And the ocean's the driver
of climate and weather,

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.470
and takes it 90% of the
heat that we put out there.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.790
So it's key.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:16.425
Any climate solution has to
also be an ocean solution.

00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:18.300
BARBARA BLOCK: I mean,
there's another aspect

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.600
that we have to think about
that maybe someone in the Google

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.400
environment can help us with.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.620
We're hunters and gatherers.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.200
And I ask my
students at Stanford

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.680
all the time, how many are
planning your dinner a week

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.740
from now?

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.062
Anybody?

00:27:34.062 --> 00:27:37.195
I see one hand, one
hand in the audience.

00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:40.530
So how can we as a
species, that's really

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:44.355
been focused on a very
short-term future,

00:27:44.355 --> 00:27:46.230
how do we get people to
worry about something

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:51.660
that's going to be a disaster
less than 30 to 50 years away.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.960
And that's the challenge we
face as a species worldwide.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.852
And I think about this a lot.

00:27:58.852 --> 00:28:01.210
MICHIEL BAKKER: So maybe
just building upon this.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.650
So I believe that all of you
know extraordinarily well what

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.310
the challenges are we're
faced with with the oceans.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.100
You probably have
clarity as well

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.880
about what needs to get done.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.910
So maybe for the
audience, if you

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.800
were in control, if you
had your magical wands,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.880
what three elements
would you do?

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.805
And how would you go about?

00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.180
So to me, it's a
question of what

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.370
needs to get done,
but at the same time,

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.950
how do you get it done
in today's very polarized

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.370
environment?

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.430
BARBARA BLOCK: I'll start.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.540
I'm a researcher.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.960
And I get flabbergasted
at how small

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.640
amount of money that is needed
right now to do some major push

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.710
forward in our ocean knowledge.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.960
So imagine a planet
where we haven't really

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.080
explored the entire planet.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.250
We've got new technology in
DNA technology, bioinformatics,

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.650
that allows us to
actually go in, take

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.640
a Ziploc full of water,
and figure out who swam by.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.860
So we need to develop
these types of technologies

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.110
to better census our oceans.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:08.160
We've got companies
across the planet that

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.460
are able to manage
data, like Google,

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.240
and do an outstanding job of
bringing together big data.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.340
Right now, there's not
a big data platform

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.520
for the oceans that
combines information

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.610
in a way that makes it
accessible to both scientists

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.300
and the public.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.600
We need that big data
platform for our oceans

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.620
as soon as possible.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.770
We need to develop
sensors, sensors

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.440
that allow us to know
how the oxygen is

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.010
changing in the ocean, how the
pH is changing in the ocean.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.110
And we need to have
these tomorrow.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.370
And they need to be cheap.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.730
And they need to be everywhere.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.780
So we have this
sort of bio-sensor

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.970
in the planet telling us what's
happening before it's too late.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.980
KYLE VAN HOUTAN:
Just to jump on that.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.580
Having automated
networked sensors,

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.590
taking the research
that we do and applying

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.650
the Internet of Things to it,
is desperately what we need.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.960
We just recently-- I'm
a researcher as well,

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.760
and we just recently
put together

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.010
an analysis which is in
review right now, which

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.730
is, in our view, is the
first ever global map

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.150
of where all species
are on the planet,

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.800
in land and in the ocean.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.720
Usually, when you see
something like this,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.400
you see a picture of the land.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.960
And then the ocean
is grayed out.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.690
Or you see the picture of the
ocean, and land is grayed out.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.720
And what we've done, because
of data availability,

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.670
is we've been able to
bring together something

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.090
like 100,000 different species
and their distribution.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.450
And then, crucially, not just
say this is where they are,

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.270
but use all the available
environmental data

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.020
to explain why those
species are where they are.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.440
Now this is a first step.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.300
This is, historically, this has
been a question for scientists

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.020
for hundreds of years.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.290
But we've just had to
make progress iteratively

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.110
by focusing on
certain species we

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.128
know, like birds in certain
places, like South America.

00:30:58.128 --> 00:31:00.420
But we don't have to limit
ourselves that way any more.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.090
We can integrate everything,
like Barb's saying.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.120
But we certainly need the
data streams, the satellites,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.130
and to do that.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.360
Barb mentioned
environmental DNA,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.480
like having a
Ziploc bag of water.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.510
We're just about to install
essentially a robot,

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.683
but it's a 50 gallon drum.

00:31:17.683 --> 00:31:20.100
And we're putting this in a
stream on the California coast

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.390
to count salmon as they go by
and using environmental DNA

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.320
to do that.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.460
This is revolutionary
technology that we desperately

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.840
need to put on mobile
autonomous platforms and survey

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.570
to the places that aren't
so near to the coast.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.360
Now we could send divers to
snorkel these streams and count

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.860
fish.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.402
But wouldn't it be a lot easier
just to put a sensor in there

00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:43.030
and do that?

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.460
And that's where
we are right now,

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.793
the technology that we can have.

00:31:45.793 --> 00:31:48.215
And we're just starting to
scratch the surface with this.

00:31:48.215 --> 00:31:50.340
DAVID HELVARG: In a sense,
space technology's easy.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.130
There's a vacuum up there
and some micro meteorites.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.160
You know, the ocean is
this unbreathable corrosive

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.100
liquid medium, with
upwellings, and surges,

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.970
and storms, inaccessible,
biologicals,

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.300
and all these challenges.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.830
We're reaching
that technology now

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.490
and the media to actually
make the vast, everlasting sea

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.140
accessible to us.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.330
But we're reaching it right
at that critical moment,

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.750
where we're facing an
existential threat.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.840
And in the last century, we
faced two, the rise of fascism

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.670
in the nuclear
balance of terror.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.380
And we got past them.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.850
Right now, because
of what Barbara

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:27.060
said, because we don't
respond to long-term threats,

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.430
we're seeing that it's
all foreshortened.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.710
And we're seeing the
threats in real time now.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.740
And so we need big,
dramatic responses.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.710
We need to respond to the
threat of climate change,

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.760
and marine pollution, and
loss of habitat at the level--

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.820
I live in Richmond Marina.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.790
My sailboat marina's where
they had Kaiser Shipyard Number

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:52.690
Two, where they built 734
Liberty Ships in four years.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.620
So that kind of
industrial mobilization,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.660
the Manhattan Project, is
what we need right now.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.440
And what this new wave of young
women coming into Congress

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.630
is proposing with
a Green New Deal.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.450
So we have to take all of
science, all the technology.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.160
And quite frankly, if
you look at our economy,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.370
we've got three major
sectors, sort of.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.580
The financial sector that
crashed the world economy

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.110
in 2008.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.450
We've got the oil and gas
industry, the fossil fuel

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.090
industry, that's literally
crashing the world.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.500
And then the tech
industry, based

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.400
in California, which for
all the problems you've got,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.060
is producing goods and services
with technological capability

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.530
to understand threats.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.800
And now we need to mobilize
large parts of our population

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.580
to respond to those threats.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.300
We did it twice in
the last century.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.377
We'll do something in this one.

00:33:41.377 --> 00:33:43.710
MICHIEL BAKKER: Birgitte or
Ana, any additional thoughts

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:44.340
from you?

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.340
BIRGITTE RASINE: Yes, some
years ago, I wrote a report

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.720
on responsibility in the media.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.490
And I actually got to interview
Andy Rifkin of "The New York

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:51.990
Times."

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.140
He's a top scientist,
science reporter.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.227
And I asked him, because
I was at the time

00:33:58.227 --> 00:33:59.310
working on climate change.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:02.130
And I asked him
why is it that we

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.490
find we find it so
hard to understand

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.530
and kind of embody in
ourselves an understanding

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:08.400
of climate change?

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.679
And he said, it's very simple.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.190
We don't teach our young
people how to think critically.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.159
We do not teach at the
elementary school level

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:20.820
or up until you, basically
until you get to university,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.610
we don't teach basic scientific
understanding and thinking.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.440
He said, if we can-- so if I
had my magic wand, I would do--

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.540
can I have two magic wands?

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.659
I would do two things.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.770
I wouldn't first introduce a
study of maybe scuba diving

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.350
as a required curriculum in
coastal states, something

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:38.850
like that.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.900
We need to bring it
down to that level.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.020
And second, popular culture.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.260
Popular culture, like can we
have a Blue Panther movie?

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:52.110
Can we have Coral Sponge Bob,
or coral whatever his name is?

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.862
So I think we need
to tell more stories.

00:34:53.862 --> 00:34:54.945
DAVID HELVARG: Carl Coral.

00:34:54.945 --> 00:34:55.330
BIRGITTE RASINE: What?

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:55.690
DAVID HELVARG: Carl Coral.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.000
BIRGITTE RASINE: There
you go, Carl Coral.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.280
Hollywood, you listening?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.600
So I think we need
to tell more stories.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.200
And I don't mean kind
of didactic, beat them

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.600
over the head
about, maybe there's

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.560
a movie about coral bleaching or
something like that, not that.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.740
But somehow find
stories that take

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.190
the mythology and the
fascination with the ocean,

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:19.440
because God knows, you
go down deep enough

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.137
and it's all science
fiction down there.

00:35:22.137 --> 00:35:23.970
BARBARA BLOCK: You're
raising a great issue.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.910
It's one that just Friday we
were discussing at Stanford.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.150
So there really is an
ocean literacy problem.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.280
I'm working on a
project right now trying

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.010
to think about at
the collegiate level

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.420
how to bring about
ocean literacy.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.230
We also are working
with Aspen High Seas,

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.040
trying to figure out if we could
do an ocean conservation corps.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.690
So what if there
was a way to get

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.670
youth engaged at a very
early age, that was global.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.700
So I think that we've done a
lot of that in our land ethic.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.560
But we've done a
little less, because

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.050
of its inaccessibility,
the high seas,

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.030
places like that, for oceans.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.840
But it really begins
at the basic problem

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.480
of teaching how oceans work.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.700
So if you went down the
street in a beautiful place

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.180
like Monterey, and I asked
four individuals, well,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.465
what's the basic concept of
how oceans and atmosphere

00:36:15.465 --> 00:36:17.910
or oceans, and
climate, or even just

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.670
oceans, what do you think
about how they work?

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.170
And I don't think we'd get very
clear answers, because we leave

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.640
it out of our basic education.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.160
We leave biosphere
out of our education.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.410
So what we're thinking
about at our university is,

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.060
how do we get it back in?

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.310
And how do we make it so
accessible that a business

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.670
student, an English major,
or anybody who wants

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.020
to learn about the planet.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.470
We do it right now through a
course called Stanford at Sea.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.860
It's related to Sea Education
Association of Woods Hole.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.040
These are opportunities for
high school, college students

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.890
to actually have an
immersion experience.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.815
But we need more people to
engage in that immersion.

00:36:55.815 --> 00:36:57.940
ANA BLANCO: And along those
lines, at the festival,

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:01.530
like when you mentioned
that, Barbara, you just

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.790
made me think.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.890
Ocean literacy is
kind of a new concept.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.720
And it's not introduced in
middle school or high school

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.670
level.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:14.970
And it's such an important
part of our education.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.480
And I think it's becoming more
and more critical to reach kids

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.770
at that particular age.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:24.110
And like you said, it needs
to be on a global level.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.960
At the festival, we do a free
program for middle school

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.590
and high school students to
come and see the films for free.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.230
And so many of the teachers
are so excited about it,

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:38.550
because they just don't have
the time or the bandwidth

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:42.400
to include something like ocean
literacy in their program.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.970
So they use the films
as an opportunity

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.410
to get the kids
excited about that.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.230
We also have a student
film competition.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.670
Kids all over the world send in
a film, five minutes or less,

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.780
that tell us about the ocean.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.780
We use the Monterey Bay
Aquarium, has great career

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.810
online for ocean literacy.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.300
But I don't think
we can stress enough

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.500
how much we need to start
engaging really young kids,

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.690
at the middle school
and high school level,

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.330
to start thinking about this
and make it a part of our core

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.180
curriculum.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.805
DAVID HELVARG: And
one of our projects,

00:38:13.805 --> 00:38:15.500
Blue Frontier
projects in this year,

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.500
2019, is a Blue
Beat program, which

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.550
is just basic idea that the
only resource not fully explored

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.700
in the ocean is
good storytelling.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.050
And to do media
trainings for scientists,

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.230
like we've done at IUCN.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:33.740
Also just grassroots
activists, to understand

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.110
how to talk to a journalists,
how to tell stories,

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:39.860
how to use the tools
at hand, our phones

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.170
and otherwise, to produce.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.120
Not to do campaigns,
to tell stories.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.830
Because that's what
connects with people.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.650
And it's instinctual
with our young activists,

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.230
they're all using those tools.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.820
But it's a challenge.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.060
I want to translate "50 Ways
to Save the Ocean," to Spanish,

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.750
as one of the immediate needs.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.890
So it's not Carl,
it's Carlos the Coral.

00:39:02.065 --> 00:39:03.440
KYLE VAN HOUTAN:
The storytelling

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.650
is absolutely critical.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.220
I mean, I'm a
researcher at heart,

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.100
but I try to be, I
try to tell stories.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.330
And anything from the "Book
of Jonah" to "Moby Dick,"

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:18.050
the ocean has captivated our
imagination for millennia.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:22.010
And obviously, it's our goal at
the aquarium to inspire people

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:23.220
about the ocean.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.650
We get about two
million visitors a year.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.995
And most of them,
geographically,

00:39:27.995 --> 00:39:29.870
or because of their own
physical limitations,

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:32.370
cannot actually
go into the ocean.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.590
They're from Kansas.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.700
Or they have
physical limitations.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.290
And so one of the
amazing things for us

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.960
is to see the transformation
that people have

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.570
when they go in the
door to when they leave.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.780
And yesterday, two days
ago, Saturday morning,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.140
I was speaking to a hundred
elementary and middle school

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.628
science teachers in the
State of California.

00:39:53.628 --> 00:39:55.670
And everything that we've
been saying right here,

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:59.330
we just need to inculcate
these ideas into curriculum

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.020
in public schools.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.690
So that is not
like an exception,

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.560
but it is the norm, that people
have a first-hand experience

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.440
of the ocean and what it is,
as well as strong curriculum

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.910
in math and science.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.200
It absolutely has to happen.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.570
DAVID HELVARG: And I
apologize, I was, I think,

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.255
insulting your sea
otters earlier.

00:40:16.255 --> 00:40:17.880
But we're sort of
unique in California.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.800
We've got these two apex marine
predators, white sharks and sea

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.470
otters, that are vital
for the environment.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.710
And it's one of the only places
where one apex predator will

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.337
occasionally eat the other.

00:40:30.337 --> 00:40:31.670
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: Bite the other.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.295
BARBARA BLOCK: It
probably happens more

00:40:33.295 --> 00:40:35.150
than you think in the ocean.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.650
MICHIEL BAKKER: All right, I
have one more hopeful question.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.760
And that we'll open up
the room for our Q&amp;A,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.720
as well as the Dory.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.440
So let's maybe end
on a hopeful note.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.140
Are there around
the world societies

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.380
that you believe are
really getting it,

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.450
and where actually society,
a combination of governments,

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:56.660
local groups, are
actually taking action?

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.223
DAVID HELVARG: California,
Portugal, Palau.

00:41:00.223 --> 00:41:02.390
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: I think
we hit on something earlier

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.210
when we said, we are
in a very ideal place.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:09.560
California is not normal with
respect to the United States.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.840
I think that we are
leading the charge

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.940
in a lot of ways with
environmental legislation

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.020
and preservation,
especially with the ocean.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.150
Our Marine Life Protection Act,
the Monterey Bay Fair Lawns

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.070
Natural Marine
Sanctuaries, these

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.300
don't exist in a lot of
places around the country.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.300
So we're very fortunate.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.440
I think we need to replicate
the California model

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.780
in other places.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.630
MICHIEL BAKKER: All right,
questions from the audience.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.480
AUDIENCE: Given the volume
of plastic currently produced

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.140
in the world, which is about
300 million tons per year,

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.660
since the 1950s, it
just went exponentially,

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.240
I heard that it's probably
going to double by 2050.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.050
So has anyone kind of
modeled out what an ocean's

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.135
going to look like in 2050?

00:41:51.135 --> 00:41:52.760
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: I'll
jump on that one,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.280
because we've been
looking at this question.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.610
So if you remember, one of
the first scientific sort

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.550
of pieces of
information which led

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.290
to our understanding
of climate change

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.410
was Charles Keeling's
CO2 curve from the top

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.330
of Mount Aloha in Hawaii.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.760
And that showed the
oscillating annual atmospheric

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.440
concentration of CO2.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.510
And it wasn't just
seasonally moving around,

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.920
it was trending upwards.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.510
That started about 1958.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.620
And I think that was a very
important piece of science

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.790
that led us to say, wait a
second, this is a problem.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.070
We don't have that
right now for plastic.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:29.840
We don't have a Keeling Curve.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.890
We're working on
understanding that.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.830
But one of the things
that we toss around

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:35.990
is, with respect
to climate change,

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.600
if we could magically turn off
the spigot of carbon dioxide

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.100
and greenhouse gas
equivalents, we'd

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.010
probably be dealing with climate
change for about 1,000 years,

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.860
just because of how convoluted
the earth's climate system is.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.560
If we could magically turn
off the spigot for plastic,

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.960
how much longer would we
have plastic in the ocean?

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.840
I think it's far less,
probably around 50 years.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.520
So I'm much more
hopeful about the change

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.930
that we can make with plastic.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.705
Yes, you are correct
that we are--

00:43:00.705 --> 00:43:02.830
and by the way, the plastic
and the climate problem

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:03.760
are not unrelated.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.500
Because plastic is made
out of petrochemicals.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.260
So it is an oil based,
for the most part.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.280
There is a recycled and there
is agricultural based products.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.792
But probably around 50 years,
if we could cut it off today.

00:43:15.792 --> 00:43:17.750
But there's more and more
going into the ocean.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.020
So it's clearly a very
significant problem.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.935
But we don't yet know how
big a problem that is.

00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:25.060
We need that Keeling Curve.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.143
DAVID HELVARG: But they're
all linked to rock oil.

00:43:27.143 --> 00:43:28.510
They're all linked to petroleum.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.580
The off shore
drilling, the plastics,

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.280
the protection of
our shores at risk.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.680
We just need to move on.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.930
I mean coal and oil were
great energy systems

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.660
for the 16th and 19th century.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.840
Now it's, as I said,
it's a product liability,

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.880
used as directed it
spoils everything.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.960
So let's move on and
do what we did after--

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.320
when Rockwell replaced whale
oil, the economy expanded.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.690
With the Green New Deal,
it's going to expand again.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.855
We'll have jobs and clean
future if we choose to.

00:43:58.855 --> 00:44:01.480
BIRGITTE RASINE: And there's an
upstream and downstream problem

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:01.980
too.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.453
So it's how much plastic
are we producing?

00:44:04.453 --> 00:44:06.870
From what I understand, some
of the big plastic producers,

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:10.180
all the single use cups, and
tubs, and all that stuff,

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.840
apparently they want to produce
more, which is a big problem.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.720
And on the other side is,
let's clean up what we've got.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.830
So you guys probably heard
of Boyan Slat and System 001.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.430
So he's trying right now to
clean up the Great Pacific

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.310
Garbage Patch.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:28.095
And there's controversy,
meaning, well,

00:44:28.095 --> 00:44:29.470
why are you focusing
on that when

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.970
you should be focusing on
upstream and the manufacturer?

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.760
I think we really
need to do both.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.640
Because you need-- it's like
you've messed up your room.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.320
Well, you've got to
clean up your room

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.380
and then see if you can find
more sustainable toys to fill

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:41.880
it with.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.672
MICHIEL BAKKER: One
question from the Dory.

00:44:43.672 --> 00:44:45.630
When it comes to
sensing ocean data,

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:47.380
can you talk a little
about the difference

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.410
in data needed in comparison to
what we can measure with Earth

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.480
observation satellites?

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.970
What is the role of EO
satellites in building

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.130
our understanding of the ocean?

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:59.410
BARBARA BLOCK: So the
Earth's satellite system

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.810
has done a fantastic
job of telling us

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.740
about the skin of the
ocean, the surface.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.110
But the volume of the
ocean is much larger.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:13.682
And so we know a lot about
the top portion of the ocean,

00:45:13.682 --> 00:45:15.390
but we don't know a
lot about the depths.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.200
And part of the mystery
of Earth's circulation

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.120
is that without knowing the
conditions beneath the sea,

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.330
and by not having a complete
sensor system on the planet,

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.500
we have surprises that
are going to happen.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.360
So I believe that it'll
be in this next 50 years

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.360
that we do a very remarkable
job of instrumenting

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.850
the oceans, which has been
behind the rest of the planet.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:47.040
And we're going to do it
with cheap, small sensors,

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.890
that we have to figure out how
to seed the ocean currents,

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.985
without creating, if
you will, pollution.

00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:54.360
We're going to do it with a
series of buoys, and gliders,

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.080
and all sorts of instrumentation
we could only imagine.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.980
And we're going to need
big data companies who

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.980
are committed to
making it public data,

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.220
being behind these efforts,
and then contributing

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.280
to this incredible analysis
that has to happen,

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.792
that will increase our
understanding of our planet.

00:46:13.792 --> 00:46:16.250
AUDIENCE: I'll just build on,
because the original question

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.757
was about earth
observation data.

00:46:17.757 --> 00:46:19.590
And so that's kind of
traditional satellites

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:20.500
in that way.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.960
And I think in the
last five years,

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.060
we're doing things
that were impossible

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.080
seven years ago in that way.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.290
And so a lot of what we're
doing with satellites

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:31.440
at sea, ship positions,
such as with Fishing

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.410
Watch and emissions that are
coming off of sulfur plumes,

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.300
we're doing air
quality measurements

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.200
from those large cargo vessels,
that's all available now.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.980
And now the next thing is
a lot of the public radar

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.650
systems that are available.

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.150
We're measuring all the dark
fleets that aren't broadcasting

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.025
and things like that.

00:46:49.025 --> 00:46:51.032
So that continues to evolve.

00:46:51.032 --> 00:46:52.740
But I was curious,
Barbara, you had said,

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.980
what you really want is a big
data system for the ocean.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.700
Are there big data systems
for the land that you think

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.780
are great models?

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.240
Or other ones that
we could really

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.690
look to, to say, well how do
we take that for the ocean?

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:10.200
BARBARA BLOCK: Good
question, tough one, Brian.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.425
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
something else right

00:47:12.425 --> 00:47:14.800
after that, though I wasn't
familiar with the name of it.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.258
BARBARA BLOCK: But
I think you want

00:47:16.258 --> 00:47:19.320
to keep in mind that when we
say fish and ships or fish

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.910
and chips, what we
really want to do

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.900
is bring these big
data sets together.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.470
So what we need to do
is in a public forum,

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.590
where it's not being
monopolized by a company,

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:29.777
to be sold back to us.

00:47:29.777 --> 00:47:31.860
There's a little bit of
that going on in the world

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.950
right now.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.358
So what we need, I
want to just emphasize

00:47:35.358 --> 00:47:37.650
that, one of the more important
papers in ocean science

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.770
came out last week in
"Science," by a Duke team.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:43.440
It was about really
basic aspects

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.730
of how the Atlantic
circulates and creates

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:52.140
what we call the bottom order
that's critical for pushing

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.490
the system.

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:56.220
And it isn't working like
we think it's working.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.800
And they found that out
by seeding the ocean

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.415
with buoys that we're
able to go very deep

00:48:01.415 --> 00:48:02.790
and then come back
to the surface

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.000
and transmit their data.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.360
So what do we really need
to solve on planet Earth?

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.863
Communications across the globe.

00:48:08.863 --> 00:48:10.530
One of the challenges
we have in sending

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.770
ocean data, working
sensors in the ocean, is we

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:17.190
don't have the ability right
now in the 21st century

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:19.860
to communicate from
everywhere on the planet.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.930
Solving that
communication problem

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:25.000
is the key to solving,
in part, getting

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.770
some of these
sensors in place that

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.580
will tell us about the planet.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.270
So we need to take
some of the economy

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.490
that we're spending
across this planet

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.532
and put it towards increasing
our knowledge of earth.

00:48:36.532 --> 00:48:37.990
And as soon as we
do that, we'll be

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.312
stepping towards our future
in a positive direction.

00:48:40.312 --> 00:48:41.770
DAVID HELVARG:
Yeah, like Thursday,

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:46.448
I'll be in DC covering the AAAS,
that's the American Association

00:48:46.448 --> 00:48:47.740
for the Advancement of Science.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.540
Biggest science
gathering on earth.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.360
And if you question whether
scientists and nerds,

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.458
they have it every year
on Valentine's Day.

00:48:56.458 --> 00:48:58.000
BARBARA BLOCK: That's
right, they do.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.750
DAVID HELVARG: But
it's interesting to see

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.390
this contrast of
this great excitement

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.180
with the hard scientists and
the natural scientists are like

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.890
ready to slit their wrists.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:10.060
And I think that taking
those hard scientists

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.530
and hard sciences that involve
data gathering and big data

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:17.950
and all, and putting the
natural scientist in charge,

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:22.587
or having the access to use them
to identify these challenges.

00:49:22.587 --> 00:49:24.670
BARBARA BLOCK: As long as
they're not eating sushi

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:25.628
while they're doing it.

00:49:27.523 --> 00:49:30.190
MICHIEL BAKKER: What's one thing
you think Google is doing wrong

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.360
that's harming the oceans?

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.480
What can we do differently?

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.558
We like feedback.

00:49:34.558 --> 00:49:36.850
KYLE VAN HOUTAN: Well, I will
say that Google Earth has

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:38.440
been transformative.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.570
And I'd like more of that.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.017
I think even they started
off with just basic imagery.

00:49:43.017 --> 00:49:45.100
And then they started with
time series of imagery.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.550
And then you could download it,
and then with added features.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.670
I think that has been
transformative for people,

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:53.500
especially the user interface.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.450
And I think providing
more platforms

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:57.633
for large data sharing,
like Barbara's has

00:49:57.633 --> 00:50:00.175
been talking about is actually
critical, Local Fishing Watch.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.510
One of my favorite
websites is called

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:06.820
Null School, which is
just a visualization

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.800
of environmental data, like
wind and real time temperature.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.980
It's amazing, if you
guys have seen it.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.020
We just need more
tools like this

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:18.340
and make them accessible for
non-technical data people, that

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.010
can use them in
intuitive formats.

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:24.970
BARBARA BLOCK: Yeah, shout out
to our Google Oceans friends.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:27.430
They are a small unit
here that basically

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.040
have done more for the
oceans in the last decade

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.700
than people realize.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.650
So we really need more of
that type of quality effort

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.960
that is inviting the
community from the globe

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.960
to sit down with them and create
the type of databases and data

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.910
sets that are distributed
publicly that we

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.637
need to improve our planet.

00:50:47.637 --> 00:50:49.720
DAVID HELVARG: And I'll
just second or third that,

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.390
to say we gave one of our
Peter Benchley Ocean Awards

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.580
to Google Ocean early on.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:55.870
And we're seeing an evolution.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:59.230
And I'm just hoping, if Silicon
Valley could get it as excited

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:04.840
about using it its capabilities
to save the living salty heart

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.360
of the planet as they are
about self-driving cars,

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.720
then I'd be really--

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.930
so more of the same,
is what we'd say.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.130
And on a larger scale.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.540
Scale it up to the challenge.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.930
ANA BLANCO: So maybe more of
that and less Google buses

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:19.520
maybe, on the roads.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.430
MICHIEL BAKKER: All
right, before we close,

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:23.320
anything from you?

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:28.355
BIRGITTE RASINE: I say more
Google Doodles about the ocean.

00:51:28.355 --> 00:51:30.247
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:37.380
- We'd been planning for this
voyage for over three years.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.580
I've been thinking about
it for over a decade.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.330
And would we're going to
do is depart from Honolulu

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:44.070
for the white shark cafe.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:47.160
This is a place, the
only way we know about it

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.060
is white sharks took us there.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.720
And in this region,
there's a gathering place.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.505
And why these animals
gather here, we don't know.

00:51:54.505 --> 00:51:56.630
- I mean all of us out here
are incredibly excited.

00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:01.250
And this white shark cafe is one
of those last real expeditions.

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.360
We know very little about it.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.390
We have no idea about why this
massive predator is leaving

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:10.530
California and coming here.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:14.140
- There must be something
so important here.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.210
Part of this is about
discovering what's in the ocean

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:21.600
and the white sharks
are leading us there.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.760
- Why do the sharks come out to
this remote part of the ocean?

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.170
One of the ways we approach
answering that question

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:31.510
is to characterize the habitat.

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:36.760
And we've put together a
variety of tools and approaches

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.070
to let us do that.

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:42.550
What are the conditions
in the water column

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:46.400
itself, temperature,
oxygen, salinity?

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.600
We're going to be sending sound
waves into the water column

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.110
to see what reflections
of that sound

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:57.100
tell us about the concentrations
of animals versus depths.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.870
We're using EDNA to tell us how
different species of animals

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:04.790
occupy this space.

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.185
- We got some white shark hits.

00:53:06.185 --> 00:53:08.510
- Yeah, we got [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:10.143
- What's the breaking news here?

00:53:10.143 --> 00:53:11.060
- Breaking news, yeah.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.250
- Oh, my god.

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:14.180
The first try.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.858
- The first try.

00:53:15.858 --> 00:53:16.358
- Wow.

00:53:16.358 --> 00:53:16.858
- Yeah.

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.270
- We've been using the
sail drones as scouts.

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.930
The sail drones have been
out here surveying the region

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:27.760
in advance of our arrival.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.600
And they will continue to
survey it while we're here.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.600
And they can alert
to things that

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.760
may be just over the horizon.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:41.080
- It communicates to us
a lot of the sensor data.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.560
We get summaries to give us
an idea, for example, where

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.020
we should be sampling
on this vessel,

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.050
based on what the
sail drones have seen.

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:53.950
- For me there's no substitute
for direct observation

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:55.880
I want to see what's there.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:59.010
And if I can't go down myself,
then the best thing to use

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:03.947
is an underwater vehicle, a
remotely operated vehicle.

00:54:03.947 --> 00:54:05.943
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.894
- [INAUDIBLE] 182.

00:54:52.894 --> 00:54:54.980
- 182, it's right here, guys.

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.190
It's in visual
range, right here.

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.490
- [INAUDIBLE] 182, [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:02.830
- Yeah, bridge, I might
have eyes on it here.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.970
About 100 meters going straight.

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:07.550
- And we're now recovering
each of these instruments

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:08.480
as it comes up.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.160
When we get the tag
back, it has second

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.430
by second behavioral data
and environmental data

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.198
on what the white sharks do.

00:55:16.198 --> 00:55:18.618
- Nice one, mate.

00:55:18.618 --> 00:55:20.070
- Great.

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.840
- It's a female.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.580
It's been on for five months.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.390
Three second interval data.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.660
Wow, we got a bite on
it too, look at this.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:31.965
Look at these deep chips.

00:55:31.965 --> 00:55:33.120
- Whoa.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.630
- Look at that, a lot of
rapid [INAUDIBLE] data here.

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:40.800
This is spanning one, two,
three, four, five days

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.758
of intensive diving.

00:55:41.758 --> 00:55:42.675
And it just continues.

00:55:42.675 --> 00:55:43.295
- Wow.

00:55:43.295 --> 00:55:43.920
- Look at this.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.380
- Wow, that's incredible.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.810
- Oh, my god, look at this.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:48.210
- This guy is active.

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:51.240
- So this is right up
until the tag popped off.

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:56.040
It's got the most intense
diving about here.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.110
That's really cool.

00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:00.630
We're in a spot where
[INAUDIBLE] diving

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:01.850
is really intense.

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:02.350
- Yeah.

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:03.430
- Look at this, day and night.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:04.070
- Gold.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:07.860
- You guys, this is gold
in the form of data.

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:15.050
- Although Otis is mainly
focusing on the oceanography

00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:18.650
and measuring what's going
on underneath the surface

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:22.970
of the ocean, Otis can
also listen for tags

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.240
that are in different species.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:30.920
So we can kind of use Otis as a
sentinel underneath the ocean,

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.860
spying on who's down there for
us, while we're up on the ship

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:35.645
doing all the other
amazing science.

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:42.640
- The high seas covers
almost half this planet.

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.220
And in the high seas,
there are very few rules.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.780
It's almost a Wild West.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.540
So if we're going to
save white sharks,

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:55.220
and other iconic animals, such
as tunas, and other sharks,

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.533
for the next generation,
we have to start

00:56:57.533 --> 00:56:59.450
thinking about where the
boundaries should be,

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:01.100
where the protection should be.

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.950
This cruise is
actually a beginning

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:06.560
in which we're going
to go out, offer

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:10.730
the opportunity for policy
changes that protect a region,

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.440
that no one would
think about needs

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.360
protection for white sharks.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:17.450
Through new knowledge, we
can reduce ignorance and then

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:18.691
translate that into action.

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:29.493
[END PLAYBACK]

00:57:29.493 --> 00:57:31.980
MICHIEL BAKKER: All right,
and I think with that,

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.350
we're at the top of the hour.

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:35.540
I want to thank you very
much for your participation

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.760
and for, frankly, being here.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.520
The audience, for
spending an hour with us.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.470
And I think to be
continued, there's

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:43.910
a lot of work to be done.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.003
Thank you very much.

00:57:45.003 --> 00:57:45.920
ANA BLANCO: Thank you.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.070
