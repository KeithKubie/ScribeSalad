1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.750
Just just like silence.
We just wait for the Magic to happen.
Ari,

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:08.430
sometimes I don't want to prepare your ego's magic trust.
Trust in the muse.

3
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.730
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] straight as they come.</v>

4
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.650
You go about Shawntay they all had from this

5
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.880
[inaudible] [inaudible] we would

6
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.820
ask for,
uh,
you could die.

7
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.680
[inaudible]
but the baby

8
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.440
[inaudible] [inaudible] this

9
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.350
<v 0>song makes me feel like I walked down a,
a gay couple arguing.</v>

10
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.940
It actually sounds like the credits of Jennifer Aniston movie.
Yeah,

11
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:59.300
right at the end.
Like she's jumping up and down in the fall leaves,

12
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.110
they're frozen in the air and her dog is barking and then it freezes and then a

13
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:06.790
song comes on and you go,
okay,
now I can take her home and fucker.

14
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.660
Cause I took her to a Jennifer Aniston movie.

15
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.560
Say Jennifer Anderson got a good job.
She did.
No,
whatever that movie was.

16
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.760
Ladies and gentlemen joining us today on the podcast,

Aka Joe Diaz,
Aka Planet Rock.

22
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.080
You would plant it Ron for like a month.
Remember the like let it rot.

23
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.050
I like it too.
I'm waiting.
I'm waiting for you to bring it to pass that out soon.

24
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:42.884
You know what I'm saying?

25
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.530
What Berkeley's doing well out there in podcast land pop,

26
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.350
planet rock will come out on new years.
Fuck yeah.
Well we don't,

27
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.460
we're not doing a new year's show folks.
The Mandalay Bay and the,
uh,

28
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.200
the ticket people that put up the link,
you,

29
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.200
it got complicated and it didn't look like there's going to be enough time to

30
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.980
sell tickets.
So we bailed and then we're coming back February on

31
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.900
<v 2>the Superbowl weekend.
So cancel your tickets.</v>

32
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:04.540
All you people get your fucking miles back.
Yeah.
I don't know what happened.

33
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.030
If you bang them,
you could see anybody bought any tickets.

34
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:10.030
I don't think the linkedin go up yet,
so I'm pretty sure it wasn't available.

35
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.000
It just was too close.
It was too close where it was too annoying.

36
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.600
So we got it back.
Uh,
four February 4th.

37
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.150
It looks like have all weekend for a weekend.
Wow.
It should be fun.

38
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.570
We don't allow full,
and this is Silva Rich Franklin.
Who else?

39
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.720
And we'll have a link up for that in a couple of days on Superbowl weekend cause

40
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.890
rich frankly,
I don't know.
I don't know.
Beta and Jon Jones.

41
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.090
Really?
Yes.
That's the three of the car.
Yes.
Check it out.

42
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.170
I don't know that because this is what I do.
I call you on the ground.

43
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.050
You know what I'm saying?
I hear you're a soldier soldier.

44
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.160
It's Franklin against the other guy.

45
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:46.630
I think this show is sponsored by one of my favorites.
Drop it.

46
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.480
The fleshlight lationships.
No recipes.
This,

47
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:53.260
we'll talk some real company that pays money to get to keep the show rolling and

48
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:56.290
we appreciate them and it's an excellent product.
Okay.

49
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.550
It's an embarrassing situation.

50
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:00.070
A lot of people don't want to admit the masturbate,
but if you're,

51
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.050
if you're a fan of aliens and that one definitely you like this one,

52
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:06.460
that's a good one.
That's my favorite one.

53
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.400
For your penis or your tractor from urban assembly.
Tell me more.

54
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.970
It just as a little bit better texture than the other ones I have inside cars.

55
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:15.420
Inside there's actually like three different alien texture.

56
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.010
Makes sense because you're,
you know,
you're really into technology.

57
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.330
It would make sense.
You'd really be in a fucking line alien.
Yeah.

58
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.760
If you go to Joe rogan.net there's a link for the fleshlight.
You get 15% off.

59
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.210
Like I said,
I endorse it is a good product.
It's an embarrassing product.

60
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:29.560
You know,
let's say a coffee mug.

61
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.670
It's probably kept me from getting an audition or two,
but that's okay.
It's fun.

62
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.540
It's good.
It's fun.
When you're by yourself,
you stone,

63
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.190
you don't want to call nobody.
And when I talk to nobody there,

64
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.530
you want a hotel room,
you take it to the hallway,

65
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.980
we your role bothering you slip as you fill it up with ice,
you come back,

66
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:49.180
you put the fucking little artificial monkey back in there and you're bang one

67
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.450
out with some ice cubes and he gets a Mescalin well pussy and you go to bed and

68
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.570
you come in the cup and then you fucking wait till the melts and whatever you
do.

69
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:58.930
You know he come to the cup.
What?
I'm gonna fuck it.
You have a good time.

70
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.020
Everybody wants to have a good time.

71
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.500
<v 3>I have this big problem with my animals right now.
After I masturbate,</v>

72
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:06.730
not using the flashlight,

73
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.510
I out like come in like a Napkin and put it on my nightstand.
And that means,

74
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.920
oh my cat loves napkin balls and paper balls.

75
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:16.940
So the cat throws on the ground where the dog likes to eat toilet paper.

76
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:17.950
So then the dog eats it.

77
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.330
So it's like this whole teen tag of eating my com and it ends up in my dog's

78
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:27.800
mouth.
Goes pregnant,

79
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.240
comes out with a fucking iPhone cop stuff.
Dirty bastard.

80
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:34.450
You got the call fucking America's most wanted you to fill be fucked.

81
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.490
I don't do it on purpose.
Come on it already.
Fuck.

82
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.550
Well,
all right,
so you're so you just shoot loads and just immediately blackout.

83
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.550
Yes.
Yes.
3:00 AM I'm saying,

84
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:47.520
you know this is only when I don't use the flashlight,

85
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.660
like 3:00 AM come home drunk,
put it in a Napkin,

86
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:53.770
put it on my nightstand next day I hear cat shuffling like that and then next

87
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:57.380
thing I know dog grabs ball off the ground or we're letting me there.
Not Bad.

88
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.060
Why don't you come and

89
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.200
<v 2>your fucking hands,
they wipe it on the sheet.
I'm on your pillow case like guys,</v>

90
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.140
I'm that's gross or come in a sock or something.
But you can't come on that.

91
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.120
Do you want us off?
They're going to recycle that shit.

92
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.890
Somebody going to wipe their fucking at you know what I'm saying?
I'm if,
well,

93
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.210
if the,
if it's the cat's fault though,
the cat one cat things.
It's hilarious to,

94
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.560
if the dog eats my comments,
your resistance to sleep after you shoot your loads,

95
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.350
that's the issue.
You just,
that's what I pictured you shooting along.

96
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.380
Why Lingo and the last thing I want dog cleanup crouching for food dogs got

97
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:31.730
nine.
No,
you don't do much.
All right.
When you walk off,

98
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.300
that's what that mother stays in.

99
00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:36.440
You lay on it and you wake up and put a shirt over it.

100
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:38.990
Like fucking nothing happened.
Like,
Hey,
wake up.
You don't give a fuck.

101
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.153
I don't blame you.

102
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.780
The inside out sock and I throw it next to the bed and it just,
it just,

103
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.280
you have like 20 socks would fucking [inaudible] and trees and mushrooms that,

104
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.880
you know,
there was a line in my act,

105
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:53.300
but it's so true that I can't remember how many times did I shot a load on my

106
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:56.570
stomach.
I just put my shirt on and just left,
took off,

107
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.390
pull my shirt down and you know,

108
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.060
never bothered wipe myself off the fucking food in your belly button.

109
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:02.894
You know what I'm saying?

110
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.290
Bats are flying out of there at the store with the fucking calm.

111
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.410
Kicked all of your stomach and how many times have you done that?
All Day.

112
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.170
All Day.
If I'm lazy,
if I've worked too hard,
I got too much shit I got to do.

113
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.930
I'll just wipe it up,
shoot loads of my chest hairs and leave them there.

114
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.300
Don't give up.
Like I said,
that's what's good about being uncircumcised.

115
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:24.620
Sometimes I whack off and I just hold it at the tip and it swells up like a Boa

116
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:26.420
constrictor and I just sit there for like a minute.

117
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.440
I can go on and unloaded in the fucking toilet [inaudible] meeting and it comes

118
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:33.920
right out.
One fucking shot you file.
So if you uncircumcised do that,

119
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:36.110
just whack often common and just hold the tip.

120
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.960
You can watch TV till the next bucket commercial.
You know what I'm saying?

121
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.140
It swells up like a Boa constrictor.
He got ahold of tight.

122
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.660
Everybody's looking at me like it looks like a balloon.
Like hello.

123
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.350
You know what I'm saying?
I got the Cuban egg one I just looked at.

124
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.400
It comes all out.
I pulled the skin back.

125
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.290
I dry off the helmet and somebody that lay his drinking my fucking so I get a

126
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:59.120
full picture.
What color is your sperm?
Like yours,
I guess.
I don't fucking know.

127
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.000
I don't know.
Your loads would be like normal Cuban.

128
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:08.920
I like 10 like if you got that mic again.
Yes.
All right.

129
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.600
Don't worry.
I won't touch it.
I won't touch it.
Maybe it's not connected,

130
00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:14.600
right Brian?
Well hold on.
We're all right.
I won't touch that.
I'm good right here.

131
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.410
Right off.
Joey Diaz is Mike Right now.
Grab it and try to push it up.

132
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.383
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

133
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.550
<v 2>son of a bitch.
What is happening</v>

134
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.820
every time someone touches that last week may him was,
oh,

135
00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:31.920
it was killing my ears because every time he just accidentally bump into it,

136
00:08:31.921 --> 00:08:34.120
it makes this really loud pop.
That's amazing.

137
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:37.050
You're actually doing this with studio style microphones in your home and we

138
00:08:37.051 --> 00:08:38.010
don't fuck around dog.

139
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.540
<v 4>Okay.</v>

140
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.470
<v 2>I like zone.
Well,</v>

141
00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:44.850
we started out with this bald that was this like stupid thing that you buy USP

142
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.650
check.
Is that good?
Yeah.
Nah Man,
I ain't got to touch it.

143
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.880
I ain't got to talk.
Are It going?

144
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:54.420
It's not going to touch on it now we're good right there.

145
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.370
Put the things like Jesus Christ.

146
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.050
<v 5>That's good right there.
I won't touch it.</v>

147
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.880
All right now I got help me fucking helmet juice healthy.
How much is no blood?

148
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.660
No,
no.
One time.
I had a couple of years ago.
What does that four what does that,

149
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.060
I went right to Bob hope.
Dope the next day.

150
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:12.310
Cause don't doctor the is the best doctor at Blah Blah dope.

151
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.650
And I told them right off the bat,

152
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.220
I said Doctor [inaudible] and I looked at him straight in the face and I came

153
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:19.350
last night and it was a little blood and he looked at him.
He goes,
so what?

154
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.730
He goes,
that happened Jay once in a while in the party so you can come.
Yeah,

155
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:28.320
no,
no,
no,
no.
Everything was good.

156
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.410
It happened sometime you cut a lot of fucking blood.
That's when it's bad.

157
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.850
It's bad if you come,
how much is a lot?
Well,
I came one time,

158
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:37.080
the amount of blood tack,
you know,

159
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:40.050
maybe you get kicked in the nut and concluded were telling him about the time I

160
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:42.980
came home and my Dick was broken us.
Oh,
you went

161
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.710
<v 6>did Jujitsu.
Right.
And I'm rolling.
My friend Einstein and he,
uh,</v>

162
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.490
Scott Epstein and he goes to pass my guard and slams his knee right into my
dick.

163
00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.170
I didn't have a cup back then.
I didn't wear a cup.

164
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:57.220
This is the incident that made me wear a cup,
not my balls button.

165
00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:00.620
My Dick like Bam,
sorry.

166
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.690
Right on my deck.
Very,
very painful.
Right.
So I deal with it,
you know,

167
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.580
and then I go right back to Roland.
You know,
I,

168
00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:09.980
I take a couple of minutes off and then once I'm okay,

169
00:10:09.981 --> 00:10:13.370
I get back in there and it really rocked me though.
So then I get off,

170
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.950
I get out of Jujitsu class and I go to take my,

171
00:10:15.951 --> 00:10:20.720
a jock strap off and there's blood in it.
It's like all blood and I'm like,
oh,

172
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:24.320
fuck soaked.
Yeah.
Was soaked.
Yeah.
The whole thing's red.

173
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.570
And then I'm looking down,
I'm like,
oh fuck.

174
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.860
And then I look at my Dick and my dick is bleeding out a tip.
So I piss okay.

175
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.490
And when I pissed,
I see all kinds of blood and shit in my pants and I'm like,

176
00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:38.780
God,
fuck.
So now I'm thinking,
what do I do now?
Do I go to the doctor?

177
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.600
Because if it was you know,
my nose,
what would I do?
I would just go home.
I just,

178
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.230
what am I going?
What are they going to do?
They're not going to do anything.

179
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.290
So I said,
well am I being over sensitive cause this is my deck.
Yeah,

180
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:51.710
I am so just go home.
So I got home and then it was freaking me out.

181
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:54.320
Like what if my Dick is broken?
What if something,
some serious damage.

182
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:59.260
So I forced myself to jerk off the dessert.
No,
it didn't hurt that bad.

183
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.150
What were you thinking?
I just want her to see if I could still get a hard on,

184
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.170
if I could still get a hard on.

185
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:06.470
I was sure that there was nothing wrong with my deck and yeah,
it was fine.

186
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.590
I shot a load and my load was like,

187
00:11:09.591 --> 00:11:13.010
it was like pinkish red streaks in it and shit.

188
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.180
<v 3>I did beautiful.</v>

189
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.920
I did a bottom zipper thing where you does it the bottom of your Dick one that

190
00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:23.570
I've done that and it was so fucking bad that it just was like this big scar for

191
00:11:23.571 --> 00:11:27.210
awhile and know chick,
but the river wants to believe that either.
By the way,

192
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:28.044
I had the old,

193
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.410
no chick wants to just hear.
Oh yes,
it's a zipper.
My zipper guy.

194
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:36.900
How

195
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.780
<v 5>about circumcised?
You don't know what it is to catch your fucking Dick in music.</v>

196
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.350
My Dick looks like limitation of my little's for skin.

197
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.880
Looks like Frankenstein's forehead dog.
Got Stitches in that mother fucker.

198
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.980
Everything I show you right now,

199
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.340
I got a fucking scar on my helmet from like when I was about eight.

200
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.150
I caught that turtleneck.
I left it there for two days I think one time.
Oh God.

201
00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.310
I was pissing sideways.
I'll leave my pants on.
Took like two days.
I taught them.

202
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.970
I was a soldier.
Even Ben on his show bombed.
He got with crawling up,

203
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:07.680
losing your mom,
put peroxide.
I lived those shorts.
My mom could say,
well,

204
00:12:07.681 --> 00:12:08.590
how come no shortcuts though?

205
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:11.340
I leave it there and he's like a little buckle like this.

206
00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:13.810
Put your keys in it so I can totally,
if I don't have this,

207
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:17.170
I'll lose my fucking keys a little.
Did she know I had the Zipper?

208
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.690
That's when they put a big flap over your zipper.

209
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.580
I had the zip across the fucking flap.
So you left [inaudible] I couldn't,

210
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.050
I couldn't pull it out of pain was fucking awful.
So you just left it.

211
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.480
I love when I watch some about Mary,

212
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:34.000
that guys one fucking day called the ambulance.

213
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:36.760
I walked around for two fucking days.
I still got a scar.
That dog,

214
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.080
she's crushed it on zip it.
I didn't want to show nobody.
That's embarrassing.

215
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.690
When you're writing,
you've got to go to your mom and say,
you know,

216
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.050
<v 0>have you ever jumped off so much or obsessively to the point where you got a</v>

217
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:47.884
blister on your deck?

218
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.580
<v 3>No.
No,
no,
I haven't.
I haven't had a lot of still a blister.</v>

219
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.750
I'm a chronic masturbator.

220
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.120
<v 5>Yes.</v>

221
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.500
<v 3>Fleshlight company understands me more.
Wait time.
How many times?</v>

222
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:04.630
I want to know how many times you've had blisters.

223
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:07.030
I've done it and then a couple minutes later go go.

224
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.520
I can remember going to mass weight.
I just masturbate.
Like what's like,

225
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.930
what's in a normal week for you though?
Like three a day.

226
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.690
Three every day.
Sure.
What are your loads look like?
Mornings,

227
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.620
mid afternoon.
Nightmare today for everyone.
So what do your loads look like?

228
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:27.370
Please describe your loads.
Uh,
pretty watery.

229
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.290
It's mostly just power aid orange.
After a while

230
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.280
it looks like power eliminated probably.
Oh No,
patty.
Yeah.

231
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.880
I want to know how long it takes to refuel your helmet after you shoot a logo.

232
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.270
It's like 10 minutes.
Soldiers.
All right,

233
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.670
let's look that up.
Joe Rogan and your first,
your first load.
Most

234
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.790
<v 0>the,
the the most loads are to kill other sperm.</v>

235
00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.820
That's what most of your sperms for most of your sperm is to go and seek out

236
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.900
other people sperm inside the girl's vagina and kill it.
Wow.
That's pretty crazy.

237
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.980
They say that the PR,

238
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:12.010
the rate of promiscuous women is directly proportional to the men with big balls

239
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:14.900
and the men with big balls.

240
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:19.010
The reason why they're growing big balls around all these women is because these

241
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:22.640
women are promiscuous and so they have to develop more killer sperm that go in

242
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:24.020
and assault all the other sperm.

243
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.580
I've always had a giant balls you fear from a family of whores,

244
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.260
whores and sluts and you just constantly run chicks and one extra dick.

245
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.260
And when you're around that,
that's a different level of competition.

246
00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.940
I don't have big balls.
Nice.
I read science journals,

247
00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:45.590
brother read.
Uh,
it's all fascinating stuff,
man.
Well they don't say big balls.

248
00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:48.980
I say Tufts.
That's a,
that's the case with animals as well.

249
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.010
The case of the animals in the kingdom,
the animals that have

250
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.880
<v 6>the biggest balls are the ones that are in fierce competition with other males</v>

251
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.530
to get laid.
Yeah.
The you,
your,
your loads will actually kill other loads.

252
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.920
Is refugees trying to get them pregnant?
There's yeah.

253
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.890
Soldiers in your loads are soldiers and they're not even there to make babies.

254
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:10.760
There's a bunch of them that are specifically there to find other sperm and put

255
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.600
the beaten on them.
It's a war.
It's a war inside her pussy.

256
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.130
That's what it is,
man.

257
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.640
The reason why manners so fucking competitive with each other constantly.

258
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.500
It's because we have where we have a factory of sperm killers that were grown

259
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:26.810
inside of our body to combat other dudes.

260
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.200
So I don't want the other loads are already there.

261
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.130
What if your loads and their loads got together and became friends who shot like

262
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.570
peaceful loads?
What if they came out?
We don't have any load.
He tastes.
Yeah,

263
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.350
and they're just constantly dripping loads out.
The fuck is wrong with them.

264
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.230
Grew in this huge bubble of loads.
It's out of her ovaries.

265
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:51.770
She's developed a whole colony of loads.
Yeah.
Just living together.

266
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:54.440
They've figured out how to survive off moisture.

267
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.870
Have you heard that thing about life?
That they found a new form of life?

268
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:02.990
NASA found a form of life that's arsenic based,

269
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.520
so it evolved in a completely different environment than human beings and it

270
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:11.000
just changed their whole picture of what life can be like.

271
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:14.950
They never thought that that would be possible.
So explain more,
well,

272
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.930
I'd have to go and read it.
It's a whole new form of life.

273
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.360
Did send in La,
they live with arsenic.
Arsenic is a part of their being.

274
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:27.980
I think it replay,
I forget what it replaces.
I think phosphorus,
I'm not sure,

275
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.400
but it replaces something that our life is based on.

276
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:34.790
But basically what the idea is,
it's not a parallel growth.

277
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.710
It's like these things evolve on their own.

278
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:40.070
It's a different form of life that evolved on its own and it's only like a

279
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:42.890
bacteria,
but it's still,
it's a different form of life.

280
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.420
It means that if life got more complicated with,
you know,
the,

281
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:50.390
the carbon based life that we have could get more complicated with their life as

282
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:50.541
well.

283
00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:55.541
There could be some sort of super intelligent life that's totally outside of our

284
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:58.460
realm of imagination.
We can never guess it.

285
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.430
So they have to relook at all of these other planets that they thought wasn't

286
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:03.900
suitable for life.
Now they have to kind of re look at it and go,

287
00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:06.170
well maybe it is.
It's a different kind of life.

288
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.620
We're assuming that the only kind of life that gets to be super intelligent and

289
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:14.300
can control the world,
his life like us,
but so it says who says fucking who we,

290
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:18.320
there could be some crazy shit on Venus.
There can be not probably not Venus,

291
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:20.430
but you know,
and some other planets that we,
you know,

292
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.270
that has a totally different alien atmosphere and it's totally,

293
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.620
totally different.
You know,

294
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:28.370
a food supply and totally different temperatures and the media kids,

295
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:31.520
that could be some nutty shit out there,
man.
They found a new fucking planet.

296
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.010
How about this?
They're not,
they don't know what it is,

297
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.720
but they believe there's a Jupiter size object just outside of our solar system.

298
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.020
It's a long way away,
but it's fucking huge.

299
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.120
And I tried to wrap their head around it.
Right now,

300
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.780
they don't know exactly what it is or how big it is or how far out it is,

301
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.470
but there's a very good chance that there's a Jupiter size fucking planet.

302
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.390
Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system.

303
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.620
One outside of Pluto outside that Kuyper belt,
they've been,

304
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.650
I've heard scientists talk about this in the past.

305
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.410
Apparently there's something goes on at the end of space.

306
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.370
That's something about the galactic shelf and the ideas that they can gauge like

307
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:10.200
how many objects are in the Kuyper belt.

308
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:13.370
There's like a drop off at a certain point and they think that the only way that

309
00:18:13.371 --> 00:18:16.920
that drop off would be there is if there's a large body that has a lot of

310
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:17.754
gravity.

311
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.520
And so they were thinking that at one point in time maybe there was a planet,

312
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:24.030
but now they're really sure.
Now it's getting much,
much more likely.

313
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.710
That's pretty crazy shit man.

314
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.680
If there's something out there and it's apparently whey the fuck out there,

315
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.840
like further from Pluto than we are from Pluto,
you know,
it's fucking out there.

316
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.280
But it's big.
That's close.
That's scary.
Close.

317
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:43.710
You know,
are people in there?
Tude that's,
that's,
that's an appear man.

318
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.200
When he comes into focus,
when we learn about it,

319
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:47.610
that's when we learned about the Annunaki.

320
00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.370
<v 0>Did you guys see that plan at the other day when you guys had a little bit of</v>

321
00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:54.630
fun Dunoon do the asset?
No,
I did not see that.

322
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.110
This is the saddest pink Floyd acid story ever.

323
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.450
Tell this Patel,

324
00:19:01.451 --> 00:19:05.920
this pink Floyd as to it sounded epic cause this is how I found out about it.

325
00:19:05.921 --> 00:19:09.750
I was on my message board and someone made a threat that Joe Diaz as an you fear

326
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:12.970
of dropping acid and go and see pink Floyd.
I'm like,
God damn,

327
00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:16.720
those motherfuckers are doing it.
I felt like,
I was like,

328
00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:19.270
when you hear about one of your friends,
it's about to go trip.

329
00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:24.370
It's like your friend is really literally about to get in a boat and go sale to

330
00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.830
their side of the world.
It really feels the same way.

331
00:19:26.831 --> 00:19:29.500
I'll have a good time with that.
Like Eddie called me up once.
He goes,
dude,

332
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:34.230
I'm doing five grams of mushrooms tonight.
Graham was like,
Oh shit.
All right,

333
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.020
man.
Good luck.
Good luck,
dude.
Tell me,
tell me everything.
Tell me everything.

334
00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:40.510
I'm like,
write shit down.
Write shit down.
Tell me everything.
Good luck.

335
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.780
It's so weird that Eddie's the guy that when you used to do mushrooms younger

336
00:19:43.781 --> 00:19:47.530
that he's like,
yeah,
dude,
I'm doing five grams.
You're like,
why is that guy doing?

337
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.350
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's not what it is at all.

338
00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:53.110
Brian [inaudible] depends on how you're using mushrooms.

339
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.040
He's built up a tolerance to,
right?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Your tolerance goes away.

340
00:19:57.041 --> 00:20:01.660
If you just stop for a couple of weeks,
you with,
with mushrooms,
the big,

341
00:20:01.661 --> 00:20:04.660
big doses,
like five grams,
six grams,
seven grams.

342
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.800
Those are the ones where the people have these insane transcended experiences

343
00:20:08.801 --> 00:20:12.880
where they talk about communicating with some alien lifeforms and being taken

344
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:17.110
aboard ships and being traveled to other dimensions and you know the secrets of

345
00:20:17.111 --> 00:20:18.760
the universe bestowed upon you.
I mean,

346
00:20:18.761 --> 00:20:23.200
that's where like Terrence Mckenna came up with TimeWave zero novelty theory

347
00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:25.960
based on the East Ching,
tons of mushrooms,

348
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.570
two buckets of B 12 you're going to trip and Brian,

349
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.590
Brian [inaudible],
listen,

350
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.830
these are some of the most powerful experiences that people have ever had.

351
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.110
You're just thinking of mushrooms is a silly thing.

352
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.770
I never liked these guys talking about grammar mushrooms.

353
00:20:41.771 --> 00:20:45.140
I'm tripping my ass off and I don't say go far.
There's not the same.

354
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.010
It's not the same three grams.
And what?
Smoke Pot.

355
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.810
<v 5>It's a different fucking experience.</v>

356
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:53.020
Like the Jim Morrison seen the doors when he's out in the jungle,

357
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.930
but I've also eaten regular acid.
That's been,
was that,
no,
no.

358
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.430
That's another thing.
I've also done acid where it's taken you,
you know,

359
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:04.680
it's an eight hour fucking trip.
You go up levels and different emotions,
man.

360
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.390
After you know,
you do a thousand of those mushrooms,
they go three,

361
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:11.200
four hours and at least in Tet I've taken some fucking ass that you know,

362
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.250
you just keep going in and out and you're living off your subtext.

363
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.560
Your subutex is which fuel in you.
You've seen something,

364
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.080
but your subutex is taking you somewhere else.

365
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.870
So you're thinking about why you didn't clean your room when you were fucking

366
00:21:22.871 --> 00:21:27.250
six.
But I'm talking to this,
you know,
it's amazing.
I had a wish smuggled guy.

367
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.430
I had to bring mushrooms and wants to Jersey and when I brought him to my

368
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:32.500
friend's house,
I put them on top of the table.

369
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.550
His name was Danny beyond cooler and we left and his younger brother came home

370
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:37.990
and started eating them.
Oh,

371
00:21:37.991 --> 00:21:42.991
he thought they were like French fries and we're hearing now and he's like,

372
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:45.130
the fucking shrooms.
That's my brother.

373
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.220
Oh brother was like 10 or 11 his mother fuck ate half the bag.

374
00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:53.170
We were skating to take them to the hospital.
So we just left them there.

375
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:57.140
We went out.
This is so serious.

376
00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.760
This is scary.
This is,
but you don't know this family,
this family,

377
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:02.500
the mother shot at him with a gun one time.

378
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.330
Danny was the kid that I was at his house and he would be doing a line of coke

379
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.900
while his mother was shooting steroids and his fucking Hash.

380
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.810
Do you know what that's likable?
His what?

381
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.370
His mother would shoot her with Deca once a day.

382
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.160
His mother would shit on the phone.
This was this house.

383
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.180
He'd be beyond the phone snorting a line of coke in front of his mother when his

384
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:25.420
mother putting a syringe in his that this is this house.
Really,

385
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.930
this kid being tan and eat a half ounce of mushrooms.

386
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:33.150
The shit the mother shot at him one time when that kid go,

387
00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.090
one that ate the mushrooms,

388
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.320
listen to what he's saying is that he probably made grams.

389
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.210
I brought him 14 he prolly ain't five or six and we got the stomach.

390
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.880
I just looked at it but let's go in.
This kid did years later.

391
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.300
Let me tell you how smart that acid made them years later.

392
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.330
That kid's doing 20 years right now for what?
For robbing a bank with a fish,

393
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.430
with a fish hook down at night,

394
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:58.880
deposit money out of the fucking thing like dirty large out of a back into the

395
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.600
cab to fucking New York and to get a flight to Hawaii.

396
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.000
And you know how they caught him cause he gave the cab drive a hundred dollar

397
00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:07.030
bill.
That's how they nailed the little beyond Coolo.
He's in Jersey.

398
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:08.260
He probably out by now,

399
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.490
but they nailed him robbing a bank with a fucking fishing line and a hook.

400
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.720
Do you feel responsible?
Maybe,
but fuck it.
He had a good time,
you know.
Well,

401
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.650
here's the funny thing.
He ate the mushrooms we went out to do,
I have a party.

402
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.670
We get back at three and he goes,
oh my God,
all the lights are out in the house.

403
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.550
He goes,
that's amazing.
Cause this guy's house was always rocking.

404
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.310
He had sisters that would party with drug dealers and the mother.

405
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.410
We walk in and all the lights were out.

406
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:34.270
We turned the lights on and the brothers in the living room,

407
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.480
the young ones sitting there by himself with little lights out.

408
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.150
He looks at us and he goes,
what?
I ain't tripping.
We just broke out,

409
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.860
broke.
Come fuck out.
We just grow.
God,
it's eight hours later,
right?

410
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.350
This little kid was in the living room just fucking slashed,
wet and profusely.

411
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.840
He had his shirt off.
He had the air on.
Oh,
it was fucking classic.

412
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.880
You can read that kid's mind and see what he saw at 10 years old.

413
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:02.620
Not knowing that.
That comment,
that taking that big boats coming.
Yeah.

414
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.550
Well I don't think it bodies.

415
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.400
I did ask it the first time when I was 13 I pay you right now.

416
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:10.420
I don't think I was prepared for it.
I did window paint with,

417
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.950
it was like hitting a fucking home run in my head.
You did what?

418
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:13.860
For her to show pain.

419
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.290
I've heard of so many dudes that did it real young and they just fucked their

420
00:24:17.291 --> 00:24:20.330
brain.
Come back.
I'm very lucky than shot that shit.

421
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.660
I was by a hundred hits for $90 and sell it for $3 high school and I would take

422
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:28.790
three or four of them in two or three days.
You know what I'm saying?

423
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.360
It's got the three days.
You fucking think it's going to stem.

424
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.550
You can feel your stem when you wake up in the morning.

425
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:39.500
The back barely wrecks your ass.
Oh my God.
I just had it in there.

426
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.440
I was like electro man,
I just had in the back of my neck.

427
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:45.140
You know what's the most important thing you ever figured out when you were on

428
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:50.141
drugs when I was on acid is a motherfucker cause it lets you go out and look at,

429
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.920
you know what I'm saying?
And that's why I want to see a pink Floyd again.

430
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.570
Cause I seen him the first time they came in.

431
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.930
When you go see those motherfuckers,
I mean I went to the gym this morning,

432
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:02.900
I was listening to them again.
Uh,
uh,

433
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.660
welcome to the machine or something and one of those from wish you were here.

434
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.940
Woke up my son to the machine,
whatever.

435
00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.730
And those motherfuckers tripped and then they wrote about it,

436
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.950
which is really brilliant in a musical way.

437
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.500
So that's why I was so fired up about this.

438
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.790
But when you sit there and it just takes you from one emotion to the other,

439
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:23.180
when I tripped,
I want to be Martin Sheen and apocalypse now,
that'll be gone.

440
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.790
That's it John.
When he goes,
he's fighting with the wind.

441
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.720
All that scene where he's tripping.
He bangs the fucking mirror and he's naked.

442
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.440
That's a trip.
That's the best fucking trip you'll see.

443
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.320
And the other thing was we,
we got together,
you know,

444
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:39.020
the other day we took the acid.
Yeah,
we took a half a hit.

445
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.200
Then we got on the train and then we took another hit on the train.

446
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.880
And when we got there we walked over to staples.
Why'd what?

447
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.660
Tell me the thought process.
You took one,
you waited and pop it skin popping,

448
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.750
popping.
The heroin people would do,
they always pop a little bit in this again,

449
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:56.060
just to see how strong the heroine is.
You want to test them.

450
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.510
Motherfuckers want them skin pop parents.
It's like waiting.
It's an expression,

451
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.570
a half a joint test.
The waiting time,
if I give you a bag of weed and you just,

452
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.810
instead of rolling the big blunt,
you're like,
hold on,
this is Joey.
D is,

453
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:11.330
let's just take one fucking hit you following me.

454
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.380
So we took a half a hit at four 30 just to time it out.

455
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.990
And then we took the other hole hit at six o'clock the time it out.

456
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.790
So I figured by eight o'clock I'd be in fucking Jupiter.

457
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.510
But instead we were outside trying to get tickets.
When we pulled up,

458
00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:27.890
they had tickets for a buck and a quarter,

459
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:31.190
but on the left hand side all the way on the left,
we wouldn't have seen that.

460
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:34.760
I wouldn't have mind going and to get those tickets.
But we took a gamble.

461
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:37.060
We thought we'd get something else,
but there was no scalp done.

462
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.600
Donna and then I wanted to stay in fight,
but it wasn't the applying till.

463
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:45.090
I thought I would see in a pink Floyd closet my trip that night while I was

464
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:45.924
there,
my,

465
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.770
because the acid didn't hit me on the train ride till we went to eat something

466
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.440
and that's how I knew it was good acid because I was tripping.

467
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:57.300
But we ate something.
Once we went through that fucking restaurant,
the stable,

468
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:00.300
whatever the fuck,
the name of the Pantry,
the Pantry,
that's when they kicked in.

469
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.610
That's when it kicked in.
We'd walked away.

470
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:06.820
It's probably eight 35 and 40 so how strong is that?
It's my judgment.

471
00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.320
It's like I got to pop two of them to really get the party store on an empty

472
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:14.000
stomach,
two of them and get into some excitement.
That's all I got.

473
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.190
I still got them.
I got them.
I feel like coming,
starting to kick in,

474
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:18.990
but then it would just wouldn't click.

475
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.810
It didn't go over the mountain and I think we had to get into some type of

476
00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:25.380
devious on a tricky thing though about acid.
You don't know how God stronger.

477
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.000
That's why the test the wall,

478
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:29.310
it does this thing to work comes and then goes away,

479
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.400
comes stronger and then goes away.
It goes away.

480
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:34.570
You smoke a joint and it comes all the way up minute.

481
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.970
I've had a bunch of people tell me that eating weed is a lot like LSD.

482
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.080
Is that the case?

483
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.050
<v 3>No.
No,
not even close.
Not even close.
What is,
what is the difference,
Brian?</v>

484
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.130
LSD.
If it's good LSD like Jesus.

485
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.860
We used to take Jesus Christ or Beavis and butthead acid back in the day.

486
00:27:51.861 --> 00:27:55.120
That was like the big ones,
right?
It used to actually take like,

487
00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:59.890
like be a DMT trip,
different rural,
you're not,
this is not your room anymore.

488
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.810
This is a roommate of Jello for three hours.

489
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.080
Like and then next thing you know your hands are you know,

490
00:28:06.081 --> 00:28:07.360
falling on the floor and you're like,

491
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.910
it's like in the very beginning it felt like you're on an edible or 10 minutes

492
00:28:10.911 --> 00:28:13.280
after I had it I was like,
oh my body can't fuck him.

493
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.680
I think it's got the intense part or the body like you're feeling I know intent

494
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.150
or you know tighten up like the strict nine type feel.

495
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.850
I think it has this couldn't have strychnine in it.

496
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.160
It didn't have straight tracks.

497
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.190
Why you saying strychnine those this trick inside the street?
Yeah,
the old days.

498
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.840
Why would they book strictly on the back in the day they used to say it made it

499
00:28:35.841 --> 00:28:39.440
stick to the paper more or something like weird like that.

500
00:28:39.441 --> 00:28:40.274
I don't know if that was

501
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.880
and the next day you're back you felt like a fucking Milo and there used to be

502
00:28:48.411 --> 00:28:51.710
things like if you got in a car accident that strychnine if it hits you right in

503
00:28:51.711 --> 00:28:53.120
the back,
you're foot furlough,

504
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:57.740
there's behind that you're going to go into your system.
Exactly.
But yeah,

505
00:28:57.741 --> 00:28:58.160
that's why.

506
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.210
Then I switched to doing liquid on sugar cubes where you just buy a big thing,

507
00:29:02.211 --> 00:29:05.180
a sugar cubes and just buy some liquor.
That was awesome.

508
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.210
The liquid from a mad scientist who knows you have a drawing or something,

509
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.180
you got to drop her gate to.
The Dea keeps a very close track of the precursors,

510
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.940
the stuff that you need to chemically synthesize

511
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.630
<v 5>LSD.
Well,
I'll tell you what actually is really,
I could have gone,</v>

512
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.950
I could've got the liquid for this show,

513
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:27.470
but he wanted 600 the canister and they wanted to mail it to me.
Oh No.

514
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.130
Sorry.
By won't tell you what they want to put you in jail.
No,
no.

515
00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:34.070
This is my buddy I know of a long time,
but just the male thought,

516
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.550
I don't want somebody knocking on the door and I got fucked a spike TV in front

517
00:29:37.551 --> 00:29:42.410
of my door with a camera and the DEA show on there.
You them.
Yeah.
If I,

518
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.980
if I know the guy on this cut,

519
00:29:43.981 --> 00:29:46.470
I get it from my home 20 you don't need that much anyway going,

520
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.390
well you need two drops quick.
You just can't call whatever.

521
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:51.040
And Sandy two drops flows to me.

522
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.850
They want you to buy the whole fucking container and I didn't mind buying a

523
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:58.510
container,
but then they got to contain in my house and liquid others d you know,

524
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:02.470
two in the afternoon.
I'm bored.
Ain't nothing going on.
You're just kicking.

525
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.560
It's a bad idea.
Yeah.
You find all the time.
I don't give a fuck.

526
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.920
<v 6>Do a weird thing.
Worried about being set up.
You know,
it's a weird thing with,</v>

527
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.310
with drugs,
with certain drugs,
like you have to worry about being set up.

528
00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:17.480
It seems so lame.
If you're a guy's like into coke,
especially if you sell coke.

529
00:30:17.481 --> 00:30:20.630
Man,
I know a guy who is just selling a little bit of coke.

530
00:30:20.631 --> 00:30:22.430
He was not selling a lot of coke.
Who's selling it?

531
00:30:22.431 --> 00:30:24.710
Like at clubs in here and there just,

532
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.130
you just always still like to make a little extra money.
And He,

533
00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.280
his supplier got in trouble and he got arrested and apparently he likes

534
00:30:34.101 --> 00:30:38.120
swallowed the Baggie or something.
He got off and he never had to do time,

535
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.940
but they were after him and they were on to him.

536
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:44.930
I don't remember who fucking told me his story,
but um,
so what happened was they,

537
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.900
what they did was they set him up and they said that they were going to have

538
00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:50.300
this,
this,
his supplier got popped.

539
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:54.710
So the DEA went behind his supply and they said,
listen,
this guy that got off,

540
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.120
we're going to go get him.
Okay,

541
00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:58.790
you're going to help us get him and we're going to give you some time off.

542
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.410
So what they did was they set it up.

543
00:31:00.411 --> 00:31:03.110
So they went after the little guy who was like selling a little bit here and

544
00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:05.120
there,
and he said,
hey man,
I'm going out of business.

545
00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:08.060
You can take my whole supply.
I'll give you fucking half off.

546
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.460
I'm going to give you half of what I paid for it.
I just want out.

547
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.790
You can take the whole thing,
but I need it all in cash.
Scott goes,
okay,

548
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.690
so this dummy goes and gets it all in cash,
gets this big wad of cash,

549
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.730
meets him hurt,
rip Swat guys show up a humongous amount of,

550
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.000
talked him into becoming a major dealer.
They talked him into this.

551
00:31:26.001 --> 00:31:29.210
So now the guy goes away forever.
I got were 15 years or something crazy.

552
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.380
And meanwhile what he was,

553
00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.710
he was just such a petty little drug dealer and he got fucked.

554
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.930
<v 5>Well,
little amounts seat,
you know,
Amen.</v>

555
00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:38.410
And Graham and eight ball on you and see if you have an eight ball.

556
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.240
It's not packaged up.
You're okay from my head.

557
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.510
<v 6>But one of my point was,
what?
How crazy is that?
They can do that.</v>

558
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:49.280
They can set you up with a fake.
They can make the number,
they can say,
you know,

559
00:31:49.281 --> 00:31:53.150
it's a,
it's a $500,000 or you know,
$1 million worth of coke.

560
00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:54.380
They could bring the coke,

561
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:59.420
they can set you up like it doesn't have to be anything.
That was your idea.

562
00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:00.410
It could be their idea,

563
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.100
which is not fair because if you're dealing with someone who's a criminal,
okay,

564
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:08.120
did the psychology behind a criminal is always,
this could be my last score.

565
00:32:08.121 --> 00:32:10.940
This could be a big score.
Maybe I get this and I get out,
you know,

566
00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:14.120
maybe I get this and I'll do something legit.
Like it's so tempting for them.

567
00:32:14.121 --> 00:32:16.910
If they'd done criminal shit before and they've got away with it,

568
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.830
you come to them with some crazy crap that's like you,
like you know some really,

569
00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:26.030
some guy was trying to be faithful and some chick shows up naked in his house,

570
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.390
sucks his deck and says,
ah Ha,
look what you did.
Yeah,
and it's like,

571
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.520
that's not normal.
Suck my Dick.

572
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.100
<v 5>Are you freaking out?
I said,
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.</v>

573
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.740
What happens is what happens is this the guy who rolled against them,

574
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.560
even if we went to the government still this motherfucker's smart.

575
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.590
He has to take it to trial.
If you had a half a million dollars to pay for go.

576
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.390
He's got a ton of money to pay for an attorney.

577
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.220
Nobody wants to put a snitch on the witness stand so they plea bargain him out

578
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.630
in the,
you know there's three fucking years because if you get go away that way,

579
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:59.450
that's the other angle.
They lie to you and your case though,

580
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.900
they keep rolling want,
but if they want to get you,
how did they get you?

581
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.780
They got you to this guy named Joe Rogan.
I type it up.

582
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:09.020
Joe Rogan's got more arrested.
My client,
I want to see this guy in court.

583
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:12.120
I want to see him testify.
Let's take it to trial.
Fucking let's take it route.

584
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.840
Fuck it.
Let's take it to trial.
This guy goes in the stand.

585
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:18.860
You've been arrested for everything from as mothers to smoke and fucking 20

586
00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:21.470
joints at school and you're going to come testify.
My,
my God,

587
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:24.810
they throw the fucking thing up.
Caught that coercion shit is kind of fun.

588
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.510
<v 6>Well,
it's tricky,
but that's actually true.
How could they do that?</v>

589
00:33:27.511 --> 00:33:28.670
How can they come them up with this?

590
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.860
Whatever the fuck they want and trust to what's important.

591
00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.200
You're on trap and trap.
It is,
but I don't think it is.

592
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.610
I think as long as you are,

593
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.900
you've already been dealing with that guy and it's like it's a normal situation.

594
00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:41.610
Like are they said some old lady's a cop down the street with a bag at somebody

595
00:33:41.611 --> 00:33:44.840
robs or you know,
but she's really a cup.
It's like that's not to trap.

596
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.910
[inaudible] always walked down here all the time.
That's a very good point.

597
00:33:47.911 --> 00:33:51.540
That's a very good point.
Yeah.
No,
that sounded trap meant at all.
Yeah.
That's a,

598
00:33:51.541 --> 00:33:53.400
that's an undercover cop.
Yeah.

599
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.700
I said it's a weird thing where they're allowed to come up with scenarios,

600
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.620
you know,
they're allowed to do this shit.

601
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:02.090
<v 5>Listen,
one thing,
and you know this thing could come into your house anytime.</v>

602
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.010
What are the fucking store?
They do it everywhere.
They don't just do it.

603
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.470
I mean they do Seiberling they do torrents.

604
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.940
They'll throw fucking tron on there to see if you download tron and then,

605
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:15.840
you know,
get you for that too.
I did download tron arrested.

606
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:20.580
Did you like that shit?
Oh,
sorry.
It's amazing.
You'd be surprised.

607
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.300
You'd be surprised with nothing to cover.
Listen,
let me tell you something.

608
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.280
For an undercover cop to buy coke from somebody,
they got to do coke in front of.

609
00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:30.720
That's just now.
Yeah.
You have to,
these kind of,
a lot of those guys get hooked.

610
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.870
They get hooked.
No will.
The most important thing is they buy the coke from you.

611
00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:37.110
They do a line from the,
and they pushed the trial back to nine months.

612
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.090
By the time the cop goes into trial,

613
00:34:39.091 --> 00:34:42.350
he's clean and salts out of assistance out of his system.
Right,
right.
It's not,

614
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.180
it's your word against yours.
They'd do what the fuck they want.

615
00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:48.500
If they want to come after you.
It's like just gotta be very man.

616
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.920
You just got to be under the radar.
Listen to kid came to visit me two weeks ago,

617
00:34:52.921 --> 00:34:54.930
three weeks ago from Jersey.
We didn't get the hookup.

618
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.130
This kid's been dealing blow since we were in high school.

619
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.900
He's got a plumbing business.

620
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.490
He's got three different ex wives with three houses in three different Robson

621
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.820
and a Cherry Hill,
New Jersey.
He's got six employees,

622
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:13.190
he's got bids all over and he's filled Hogan.
He's got a broad,

623
00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:16.500
he a Russian brought here,
the Strip club,
you understand me?

624
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.590
[inaudible] 47 voting age three kids,

625
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.260
three different bronze you child support,

626
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.630
but the sell and blow since eight balls since we've,

627
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:29.970
while he just know how the fuck did you do that often knows.

628
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.850
Not a lot of guys who can do that.
Almost all of them get busted.

629
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:38.050
The odds are against you.
If you go on good,
there's a way to go and stay on

630
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.600
<v 2>done.
You must finance,</v>

631
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:43.230
you know you can find it and you know when you're financing a good thing and you

632
00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.950
get 20% of their action and then make an 800,000 a month,

633
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.080
that's not too fucking shabby,
you know?
Yeah.

634
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.770
But you figure somebody who come after him.
I mean it's just amazing.

635
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.640
And he took half the dough and started up a business.

636
00:35:55.641 --> 00:35:59.450
You got six Bucklin blowers with trucks and walking the Balkans.
Louise,

637
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.790
what's his job?
What did we do?
Well,
you don't want to say no,

638
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.690
but it's just amazing that some people,
we had this,
we had this kind of,
you know,

639
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:11.070
some people go away and some people are very smart,
some people stupid about it.

640
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.040
I always thought it was bad luck no matter what.

641
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:17.010
I always thought somewhere along the line you're going to pay for it.
You know,

642
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.830
three fucking lies.
He's got three ex wives.

643
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.960
That alone psychologically is bullshit on somebody.

644
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.300
Everybody that I've ever met that sellouts fucked up sometimes become fucked up

645
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.960
and the calm is horrible.
They're always,
they're always sketchy to be around.

646
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:31.950
They're always late for it.

647
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:34.110
Don't you put on is worried about somebody robbing them?

648
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.600
Cops catch what's the most interesting [inaudible] I don't watch a lot of drug

649
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.440
drug,

650
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.450
drug documentaries and all that shit because people always try to be bigger.

651
00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.620
But I didn't watch a very interesting one where they took a rocker out of

652
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.350
England.

653
00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:51.300
It took them to Columbia and showed them what it takes to make a kilo of cocaine

654
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:55.610
from scratch.
And they took this motherfucker in the bunker with machine.
Whoa.

655
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.690
And this motherfucker was breaking down.
I'm never,
that's the fucking,

656
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.930
never did another line again.
Why He came box spreading the gospel that way.

657
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.980
How what it takes to fucking get that gram of coke,

658
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.080
what you're really doing to society,

659
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:12.990
what you're really doing to these people some way you've got to pay.

660
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.810
Look at this whole war now is about heroin.
You and I both know it.

661
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:18.810
Go to a big chunk of what this was about and no one wants to mention,

662
00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.740
nobody wants to pay.
It sounds like you're a wacky conspiracy theorist,

663
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:24.540
but here's the bottom line folks.

664
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.530
90 plus percent of the world's heroin comes from Afghanistan.

665
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:32.130
That is a multi multibillion dollar business.

666
00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:36.510
And if you think these fucking industrialists cock suckers that are running the

667
00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:39.420
world,
they're going to leave that money behind your fucking crane.

668
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:41.910
90% they've got army,

669
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.330
fucking a United States army troops guarding poppy fields.
Wow.

670
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.230
And it's still coming in.
It's still coming.
It's coming in like crazy.

671
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:51.840
They're helping these people grow it.
They're helping these people grow it.

672
00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:55.830
So the Dell get dust to the Taliban.
We have to gain their trust.
Geraldo Rivera.

673
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.820
We talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the podcast or last week there.

674
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.520
It's,
it's,
it's real proven shit that's going down.

675
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.930
There's fucking so much heroin there.
I mean,
it's incredible.

676
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:09.930
The fucking guy who is in the,
we talked about this last week as well,

677
00:38:09.931 --> 00:38:12.060
but just because you guys are here,
the president of CIA,

678
00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:14.190
his brother or the president of Afghanistan brother,

679
00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:17.550
his brother was an employee of the CIA and his brother was a known heroine

680
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:20.820
dealer.
His brother was selling heroin and getting paid by the CIA.

681
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.720
This the fucking brother of the president of Afghanistan.

682
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.540
If you don't think that there's something going on,
you're crazy.

683
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:30.720
Why would they leave that money?
The fact that they're willing to kill people,

684
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.430
which we know they are from money,

685
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.980
we know that they're willing to go to war with countries that probably do shit

686
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.840
<v 6>and they have,
there's nothing to gain.</v>

687
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:40.690
They're for America for freedom or for fucking safety.

688
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.520
It's just cause there's something there that they want.

689
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:45.280
So now someone else's or control is getting them instead of somebody in

690
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:47.920
Afghanistan getting the money,
we're getting it.
Who knows?
I don't know.

691
00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:48.870
We've gotta be partners.

692
00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:53.080
Someone was standing over there for free medical stands up here where the United

693
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:53.913
States like toilet.

694
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.120
That garden is such a big lie that you even just talking about it,

695
00:38:58.121 --> 00:38:59.110
we sound like idiots.

696
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.350
That's the amazing thing about the idea that the government is sold drugs.

697
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.910
It's such a big lie.
It's so crazy that it just bringing it up and you're like,

698
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:10.870
listen to this crazy idiot saying that the government is sold drugs and I'm not

699
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:15.370
necessarily against selling drugs.
You know,
I'm not,
I don't need,
I'm thinking,

700
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.890
fuck,
you could sell bullets.
Why can't you sell drugs?

701
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.240
I'm not afraid of you selling bullets.

702
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.360
I think you should be allowed to sell bullets.
I believe in all that stuff.

703
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:22.571
I mean,

704
00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:26.080
I think we definitely need law enforcement need to protect ourselves when people

705
00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:28.900
that abuse shit and set up laws and be very strict about shit like that.

706
00:39:28.901 --> 00:39:31.900
But I'm not for fucking controlling too much shit,
man.

707
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.320
So I'm not scared of anybody selling drugs or socialist.

708
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.170
Not really use,
it's more libertarian type comma socials.

709
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.280
I think I'll just be legal.
Even the ones I won't do,

710
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:45.430
but that's not socialists socialists as someone that thinks that all the wealth

711
00:39:45.431 --> 00:39:48.490
should be evenly distributed as well.
You're just a communist

712
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:54.790
rugs and I think that is the most dangerous fucking thing ever.

713
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:59.950
I couldn't imagine somebody in the car next to me coked up or somebody on
heroin.

714
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.450
I just couldn't imagine say that.

715
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.540
But it's been proven in other countries that it actually lowers the addiction

716
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:07.210
rates,
lowers the rates of use in,
in Portugal,

717
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:10.870
they had no drug laws in Portugal for a while.
They made everything legal.

718
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:13.720
It decriminalized everything and people have been doing it left and right.

719
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:16.780
And by the way,
that's gone on in Mexico as well as zoning laws.

720
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.440
I don't know why you wanna build there.
No,

721
00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:24.550
I'm saying sell drugs like right next to a school and stuff or they probably

722
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:26.650
have some sort of restrictions.
I don't know.

723
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.670
I think with decriminalizing means is that it's okay to have it,

724
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.880
but you're not supposed to be selling it.
That selling it.
It can be criminal,

725
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:36.790
but if you have it then it's okay.
How are you supposed to get it?
Well,

726
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.640
this is the ideas that you're not supposed to benefit or profit from other

727
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:41.770
people being addicted to something that's dangerous.

728
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:45.160
So you could do dangerous things if you want to on your own accord,

729
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.310
figure out how to do it.
But if you start selling it,
that's when you're,

730
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.233
that's when you in trouble,

731
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.550
which would make sense to me because that's like sort of,

732
00:40:51.551 --> 00:40:54.040
it's like sort of saying you should have personal freedom,

733
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:58.990
but the other person should not be doing something damaging to society willingly

734
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:00.760
and knowingly.
And if you're selling heroin,

735
00:41:00.761 --> 00:41:03.490
you're doing something damaging to society willingly and knowingly.

736
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.150
So you want it.
Yeah,
you can still get it though.
You just don't have to,

737
00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:10.040
you just don't sell it.
See,
look at the beautiful thing about drugs.

738
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.700
Here's the great thing about drugs.
Almost all the good ones,

739
00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:15.790
people are willing to give you.
You know?
That's,
that's really how it should be.

740
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:19.240
The coolest thing about weed and P and potheads.
The number one thing I said,

741
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:22.960
everyone's so generous like pods are always giving you,
here's a cookie,
dude,

742
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:24.520
have this breast trip you want to join.

743
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.500
Here's this dude's smugglers who wants some.

744
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:31.090
It's always like everyone that's part of the whole week.
Nobody giving,
you know,

745
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:33.950
coke rocks a good healthy drug.

746
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.610
<v 2>Did healthy drug is district three positive things people give me Joan in</v>

747
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:38.880
mushrooms,
people will give you my,

748
00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.760
she will give you the notion that people come to me,

749
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:42.950
give me mushrooms after shows.
I've never taken them.

750
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.640
I don't know what the fuck kind of this one dude just gave me mushrooms wants in

751
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:48.680
San Francisco and it was just weird,
creepy dude.

752
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:50.210
It was just sweat a little bit too much.

753
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.110
Just thinking probably about me taking these things and dying and I was like,

754
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:57.770
get the fuck Outta here bitch.
I taking your crazy mushrooms,
you motherfucker.

755
00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:02.570
But my point is that any drug good enough to be taken should be free.

756
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.560
You should be vulnerable.
If you can't figure out a way enough pot for free,

757
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:11.430
why not buy the seeds by the,
by the fucking the shit grow.

758
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.990
Can you go heroin herself now it's much more difficult.

759
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.000
So really you don't have to go to another climate.

760
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.860
I don't think you can grow heroin in this climate.

761
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:22.820
I think that's one of the things to the box.
I don't know

762
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:28.210
what Brian.
Um,
I think uh,
cocaine is that way too.

763
00:42:28.211 --> 00:42:31.400
You can't grow up cocaine in the United States.
You can't be grown here.

764
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:34.700
Is that a mountain thing too?
Because I know that the mountains,

765
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.870
they take it well,
most people find it very,

766
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:40.580
very useful though the actual leaves,

767
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:43.970
like coca leaves are actually healthier than coffee and these people just chew

768
00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:45.190
the leaves and they,
you know,

769
00:42:45.191 --> 00:42:47.900
they're shepherds and out there in the fucking mountains and shit and there's

770
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.360
such a high altitude,
it gives them energy.
Huh.

771
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.900
So it's actually like a beneficial plant.
Yeah.

772
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.920
It's just when you get processed with the money,
yeah.

773
00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:58.950
You process it and synthesize it and break it down.
That's when it's like,
whoa.

774
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.670
Fucking central nervous system.

775
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.560
And then what I understand is the real big problem is what they mix it with.

776
00:43:03.561 --> 00:43:05.750
Right?
Right now,
especially now,

777
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.340
I have watched a thing on 60 minutes like a year ago and it's just bad.

778
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:14.170
It's coming into the country in batches and all these people last year was in

779
00:43:14.171 --> 00:43:15.620
the Seattle area really bad.

780
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.910
Did you tell me that you've gotten some that had gasoline in it somehow?
Will.

781
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.850
The most important thing is that it's not getting out of the country is getting

782
00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:28.190
the ether alcohol into Columbia to wash away when you would get the cocaine with

783
00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:31.580
the eighth if anybody watches,
that's a cocaine that people dream about.

784
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.970
It goes down like bubblegum via you keep snowing it all my cause it tastes
great.

785
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.210
Rockstar cocaine's rock star,
shit dead.

786
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.170
What happened was they couldn't get enough ether so they started cooking it with

787
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:46.330
gasoline and Turpentine.
You snorting this shit that smells like cat piss,

788
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.090
but it's four in the morning and you don't give a fuck.
You know what I'm saying?

789
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.750
Then the next day get nose is red.
The ae your,

790
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:58.580
those has a disintegrated from textbook general
but it's just,

791
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.430
it's just that the addiction but the gasoline.

792
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:05.960
So what they would do was you get the gasoline base to make crack because nobody

793
00:44:05.961 --> 00:44:09.560
really cares about faced if you're smoking crack.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

794
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.480
So then they get the good shit to sell the stuff for that.
Ethan,

795
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.900
I told you we were talking about this before we started the podcast.

796
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:18.200
I stopped smoking out of pipes because I think when you use a lighter,

797
00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:21.470
I taste that shit.
I taste that lighter fluid that sits nasty.

798
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.480
But thinking about the gasoline,
you snore.
Yeah.

799
00:44:23.481 --> 00:44:26.720
When I started using the vaporizers and when I start smoking joints,

800
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.260
I started realizing like this tastes better.
Just doesn't taste all fucked up.

801
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.150
You know?
Ideally I think you should light

802
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.560
<v 6>a joint with a match.
That's probably the way to go.
You know?</v>

803
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:38.430
Because even when you let it show me that even good.
It's a match.
Yeah.

804
00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:40.240
Cause I got that liquid salt winter.

805
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:44.430
We have you ever heard how you should never light something off a a candle

806
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.640
because supposedly the little micro candle shit,

807
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:51.870
we'll get into your lungs wax and yet I always wonder if that was a wipey you

808
00:44:51.871 --> 00:44:55.210
can get hit the lie that touch a cigarette to a candle wants in the west and

809
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:59.370
just,
I still smoked it,
but it took so long as folksy.
That's gotta be bad,
right?

810
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.970
Oh,
do you smoke some wax?
You're fucked.
[inaudible] SAS spoke works,
but yeah,

811
00:45:03.971 --> 00:45:07.110
you promise you let a joint then that's a whole joint you have lit.
Yeah.

812
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.180
That's all a commitment.
Yeah,
but I pushed it out.

813
00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.300
I just pinch it out whenever it's done.
You know when I'm done,

814
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:15.270
I just break it off and then you've got a roach.
I like it better,
man.

815
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.630
I think that fucking those pipes are bad for your lungs,
man.

816
00:45:18.631 --> 00:45:21.060
I think they'll cigarette lighters constantly breeding that she did.

817
00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:23.010
I can taste it sometimes.
I'm like,
that ain't good.

818
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:25.110
That's my doctor said you use a vaporizer.
I love.
Yeah,

819
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.990
<v 2>take a nice bug.
You cut it with a scissor.
Nice.</v>

820
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.880
You take a paper and a half of that zigzag,
you put that mother fucker together.

821
00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.510
Edge,
right?
Like a doctor.
You flipped that mother fucker put it in their role.

822
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:39.960
That mother fuck up and let that thing dry.
And when you lie,

823
00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:44.280
did you hear that thing go from all the shit burning inside and that first to

824
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:47.750
hit that goal on why you exhale and you think on a fucking twice cooked pork.

825
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.630
You know what I'm saying?
That's how you roll.
I love that.
That's the original.

826
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:56.470
To me that's,
there's no better system than that.
Take your bomb vaporizer.

827
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.280
I'm going to live down 90 fuck you.

828
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.520
There's no better way than a paper and a half that motherfucker down and blast

829
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:05.630
off the shirt.

830
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.420
<v 6>The buddy of mine gave me look at this chick rolling a joint.
Yeah,
very.</v>

831
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:13.050
There's like there's a ritual to that.
You don't think about it.
Yeah,

832
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:16.530
you don't pull it like lighting a bomb something and hopefully it's a chicken

833
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.270
man.
Cause that would make feminine care.
Did I let a lady boy role,

834
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:23.120
my job is using a dollar bill and Ken let up.

835
00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.340
<v 2>I ain't scared you
set.</v>

836
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:33.330
<v 6>I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
Lady boys can roll my jaw.</v>

837
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:38.820
I give them hugs.
I love all that.
Feel those weird hard tits.

838
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.390
You ever give a dude who's trying to be a girl,
a hug and you feel the hard tits?

839
00:46:42.391 --> 00:46:45.750
They have hard tests.
I have not so sad.
Yeah.

840
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.260
We had a couple on the dance show them and give them out to give you a hug and

841
00:46:49.261 --> 00:46:50.850
they their,
their tits are hard as a rock.

842
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.200
It's like they're punching you in the chest.

843
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:55.350
The transvestites sexuals transsexuals when they're actually going through that.

844
00:46:55.351 --> 00:46:58.050
We had a couple of them on the man show.
Really cool one school.

845
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.380
One of them was fucking coolest shit.
What's her name?
Gea.
Is that what it was?

846
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.970
I don't know.
I think it was,
I forgot what her name is.

847
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.520
She was super,
super cool,

848
00:47:07.521 --> 00:47:10.230
like a really fun person because she was a man that became a woman.

849
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.120
Got All snippy,
snippy son,
son.

850
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.120
I don't know if she had gotten snippy or she was going to get snippy.

851
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.780
Very nice person.
Anyway,
she,
she'd give us,
she was in mother,
the,
uh,

852
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:23.400
sketches where,
uh,
Doug get to hook her and she's,
uh,

853
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.250
she has to go to the bathroom.
And while she's a,

854
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.020
Doug looks in on her while she's in the bathroom and she's standing up and

855
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:28.950
pissing in the toilet

856
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.860
<v 2>and talk,
starts to Sobrato goes,
hey,
wait a minute.
What she,
you know,</v>

857
00:47:33.861 --> 00:47:37.210
she really did piss in the toilet standing up.
So I guess she does have a deck,

858
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.260
but,
um,
it was,
uh,
she gives you a hug,
you know,
all,
thank you very much.

859
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:44.380
We had a great time.
And when you're,
you're feeling when you hug them,
you can,

860
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.970
their nipples.
No,
the whole tit.
It's like,
it's all fake.
You know what I mean?

861
00:47:48.971 --> 00:47:50.440
They don't have any breast tissue to work with.

862
00:47:50.441 --> 00:47:52.600
Like if a woman gets breast augmentation,

863
00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:56.470
she might have a BEACOPP she gets it pumped up to a c and still,

864
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:58.450
it feels like a breast for a man.

865
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:03.170
It's really just muscle tissue and a bag of water.
You know,
it's fucking strange.

866
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.860
If comedy would want it for a year and a half in Seattle.

867
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.900
Redall with a transactional on sexual.

868
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:09.910
She looked like that fucking thing like doing.

869
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.380
She had a head and she put a wig on and we send go like we go read it,

870
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:16.960
you want to drink and should we give her like a 20 she'd go and volume and we

871
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:18.250
rob approach.
You've got value.

872
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:22.930
It's rude little pills that she come back and we need to have pizza and she'd

873
00:48:22.931 --> 00:48:25.750
have a woman's voice.
When when she yelled at us you'd go back to a management,

874
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.310
put it down.
It was fucking amazing.
You know she died.

875
00:48:30.311 --> 00:48:32.080
She hit her head.
She went out dancing one night.

876
00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:34.720
The head was big and the equilibrium,
that's a true story.

877
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.250
Really equal liberty with the head.

878
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:40.540
They left the head still really fucking big like a man size had,
oh my God.

879
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:45.120
How do you somebody the head and she fell off the stage.
What the head,

880
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.060
cause her head was too big of your body shrank like hands.
Bali shrank up.

881
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.150
So the head was too big.
Shoes and big bobble bobblehead.

882
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.920
That's why she was taking all those pills.

883
00:48:53.921 --> 00:48:57.010
She was taking like perk because her head was too big for all of us and she'd

884
00:48:57.011 --> 00:48:57.910
fall all the time.

885
00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.100
Could you imagine if your head was on like a little woman's body?
They've got a,

886
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.520
I forgot about saying be a fucking night.

887
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.340
That's what I want to lose that whole longer away and I was getting headaches

888
00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:09.710
for a couple of days that I'm saying fucking body can't support your head.

889
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:10.623
You can't do it.

890
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:14.170
These people lose a bunch of weight and all suddenly got this fucking ginormous.

891
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:17.860
Ed had so trail looking at them and they don't understand that fucking head is

892
00:49:17.861 --> 00:49:20.940
huge and Jenny Craig,
Nolan got none for your fucking head.
Nobody died.

893
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.110
Nobody got none for that.

894
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.160
What happens is your head developed a size 400 pounds about Ralphie.

895
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.930
How about Ralphy?
Ralphy.

896
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.480
She's had a long way to bucket of 50 and look at his hands got away up.
Fuck.

897
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.480
It's fucking giant.
Like my head.
It's fucking huge.
That's a weird thing.

898
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:43.480
When you gain weight or going one weightlifters gain weight to your head,

899
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:47.920
gets bigger.
Your fucking chickens.
One Yard.
You should see my helmet.

900
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.440
You should see the of check answer.
He was out of order it special.

901
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:55.510
I had to go like fucking NFL Europe.

902
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.710
Only people bought up in New Jersey and the of Europe have heads this fucking

903
00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:00.580
big.
You follow me?

904
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.470
It's funny because we were talking about this last night about someone in a

905
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:06.240
Jujitsu class was talking about chicks who are bodybuilders.

906
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:10.240
They they get in large clitorises cause they just take massive amounts of

907
00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:14.170
testosterone so high and they're their dicks grow.
Well,
you know they're,
they're,

908
00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:18.520
yeah,
they grow a clit.
Their clit actually becomes like a small deck.

909
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.040
This is super sensitive.
I don't know.

910
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.610
It must be super easy to find a piece of Calamata at tough shit that they sell.

911
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:28.250
Like now I'll be in route column on a Thursday night.
The regular

912
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:32.520
<v 0>cooking,
that's all tougher pod.</v>

913
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:37.990
I've had it before when Lena got hard fucking clicks.

914
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.570
When you go down to the girl and you see a ring there,
a little piece of metal,

915
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.610
you're like,
oh Jesus,
anybody can hang out here.

916
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.300
You letting people fucking staple like metal in here parking.

917
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.410
Fucking this ain't a special place to be.
You've got to clip ring down there.

918
00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:54.160
Hooker.
Not only that,
what am I going to do to you?
I'm going to damage you.

919
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.430
You're,
you're willingly getting metal shoved through your pussy and crazy horse.

920
00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:04.460
But they um,
these,
um,
these bodybuilders that grow,
grow a click,

921
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.610
I don't think it's as big a deal.

922
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.740
I don't think they get as big a dose is when they're trying to turn a woman into

923
00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:12.110
a man.
Cause when they turn a woman into a man,

924
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:15.540
I think they give them massive doses more even probably than bodybuilders.

925
00:51:15.541 --> 00:51:19.760
This is just not lifting weights and sins.
Peaches grow beards.
Whoa.
Yeah,

926
00:51:19.761 --> 00:51:23.190
they grow beards,
man.
That's one of the,
the,
the weirdest thing about the,

927
00:51:23.191 --> 00:51:26.720
the transsexual female to male,
they grow beards.
Man.

928
00:51:26.721 --> 00:51:31.610
They started growing facial hair and shit.
That's it.
Was it

929
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:36.830
the best part is the end.
Uh,
the crazy thing,

930
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:39.920
if you think about going to believe me as some dude with a wig and a black eyes,

931
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:40.880
right?
Science,

932
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:44.180
there's probably a connection with girls that have bigger pussy boners and they

933
00:51:44.181 --> 00:51:48.050
have facial hairs.
I bet you have some kind of clinical for any facial hair.

934
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.950
<v 6>I think it's probably related to that.</v>

935
00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.650
You see like a really brawny looking woman.
There's some,
some women,

936
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.930
especially when they get older.
That's the other thing about women.

937
00:51:54.931 --> 00:51:55.980
When they get older,
they start,

938
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:59.730
their body produces more testosterone and guys err the exact opposite.

939
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.460
They start producing more.
Yes.
For Estrogen,

940
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.690
I think it's probably because at the women have to fight for their fucking life.

941
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.360
Once in the old days they became useless when they couldn't have children

942
00:52:09.361 --> 00:52:12.990
anymore.
Once they hit men and some women do.
Yeah.

943
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:16.130
There's a lot of controversy with that though,
Huh?
Oh,

944
00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.930
you're fucking with the balance of hormones and you know,

945
00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:22.560
it has to be done right.
You got to test your blood all the time.
It's,

946
00:52:22.561 --> 00:52:24.480
it's very tricky.
Yeah.
You know,

947
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:27.420
a lot of people just want to take pills and everything's going to be grooving,

948
00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:28.890
you know?
Oh Man.

949
00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:32.100
I think eventually what they're going to figure out how to do is keep all your

950
00:52:32.101 --> 00:52:35.370
hormone levels exactly the same for the rest of your life and it's going to be

951
00:52:35.371 --> 00:52:38.160
weird.
It's like,
then we get to find out like what makes your body deteriorate?

952
00:52:38.161 --> 00:52:42.140
Is it hormones?
Is it genetics?
Is it,
you know,
just some stuff inside your,

953
00:52:42.141 --> 00:52:44.490
your genome.
And it starts to fail.
Like how,

954
00:52:44.491 --> 00:52:46.500
how much can we stop that in our lifetime?

955
00:52:46.501 --> 00:52:50.310
We might see people live to be hundred 5,200 years old in our lifetime.

956
00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:53.190
This might be the first lifetime where we'll look.
It's a restaurant alone.

957
00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.360
I keep an eye on that Monday.

958
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.900
<v 0>Fucking stop was dope.
He's my canary in a coal mine.
Oh,</v>

959
00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:02.900
obsessed captain plastics.
So 64 years old.
He swole like our motherfucker,

960
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.660
but he's cutting the shit out and shooting stuff in some way.

961
00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:08.100
You got to pay for it.
I know.
I'm sure.
I just want to see how long you live.

962
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.570
This is fascinating.
Twins.

963
00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:15.230
Let's say you're abroad and you want to become a man and they give you all this,

964
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:20.220
uh,
testosterone.
Oh middle.
They take it home and stick.
Come on now you grow.

965
00:53:20.221 --> 00:53:24.570
Dick just becomes one just of a,
yes.
The clit is very similar.

966
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.250
It's very to a penis.

967
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.320
<v 6>And as your,
your um,</v>

968
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:31.680
click tourists getting gorge with testosterone as your body becomes a gorgeous

969
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:33.960
testosterone,
there's shooting it like I'm get,

970
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.770
I'm guessing that it has to be big numbers because the one they had like private

971
00:53:37.771 --> 00:53:41.620
Dick's,
it was a show,
I think it was called on Hbo.
It was all about dicks.

972
00:53:41.621 --> 00:53:43.280
And they had this one woman who was a,
a,

973
00:53:43.281 --> 00:53:46.770
a woman who was turning into a man and she said that it hurt her.

974
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:48.150
Dick is about the size of a thumb,

975
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.710
which is bigger than any like bodybuilder girl club I've ever seen on the inner

976
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.160
size of a thumb.
A thumb.
That's what she said.
And she says he gets rock hard.

977
00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:00.360
And it was fascinating too to hear her talk about how she thought she knew what

978
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:03.420
it was like to be a man until they started shooting up your testosterone.

979
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.120
And she's like,
wow,
you know,
one of the things she was talking about was um,

980
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:10.470
when you have a raging hard on like how little in control you really are.

981
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:14.670
She goes,
I had no idea.
She goes,
I had no idea.
But when you would,

982
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.640
they interviewed her and they were talking about she got a boner and was like,

983
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:21.090
well cause your clip gets hard at how obsessive she was would just fucking,

984
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.360
she said,
you know,

985
00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:25.440
primal and she was talking about how a guy with a raging hard on,

986
00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:29.400
it's just not going to listen.
Like they just want to fuck,
you know,
that's like,

987
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.640
it's like it takes over like certain areas of your brain.

988
00:54:32.641 --> 00:54:35.880
She didn't know like really you could have taken over like that.

989
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.450
It's a very interesting thing.
You know,
I,
I wouldn't want to be a woman,

990
00:54:39.451 --> 00:54:41.820
but I would fucking,
if we could like switch,

991
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.690
if you could like enter into a woman's brain for a few hours and wander around

992
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:47.880
and see what it's like,
you know,
say all right.
It's like,
you know,

993
00:54:47.881 --> 00:54:50.600
you're going to do mushrooms for a few hours or I'm going to take a pill,

994
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.190
I'm going to be a woman for a few hours.
I'm going to feel what that feels like.

995
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.190
That's gotta be so strange there.
They're balanced,

996
00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:59.580
they're whole balance of life is so different than ours.
Everything about it.

997
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:03.820
And I think it takes us until like,
we're like much,
much,
much older to you data,

998
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.640
bunch of different chicks until you,
you know,

999
00:55:05.641 --> 00:55:08.220
you see a bunch of different old women are kind of cool and you know,

1000
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:11.190
you try to get together like a kind of sense of what it is to be a woman,

1001
00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.790
but they're like a totally different species than iceman.

1002
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.670
There are totally different species that we live side to side with.
You know,

1003
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.570
we don't have a fucking clue as to how they feel and they don't have a fucking

1004
00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:24.090
clue as to how we feel,
but we want to fuck them.

1005
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.880
And because of that they want us to be a certain way.

1006
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.770
And that's one of the problems in this country.

1007
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:32.220
One of the problems in this country is it's difficult to get laid and a lot of

1008
00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:36.330
guys decide to change who they are because they want a woman to like them.

1009
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.490
That's the pussification of America.

1010
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.090
A big part of it is doing what the chick wants to do because you want to fuck

1011
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:43.650
and they don't know what you're like.

1012
00:55:43.651 --> 00:55:46.080
They don't really understand what it is to be you.
They have no idea.

1013
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:47.870
Like sometimes I'll get upset at something I met.

1014
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.440
My wife just doesn't understand.
I'm like,

1015
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:51.180
you don't understand because you're not a dude.
Okay.

1016
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:52.290
If you're a dude you don't understand.

1017
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:54.900
And I understand I don't understand shoes and now I understand bags.

1018
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:58.170
The was that like an alternative comedy party when you're talking to a girl and

1019
00:55:58.171 --> 00:56:00.990
you're like arguing or something?
Yeah,
just in a normal way.
And some,

1020
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:03.630
one of the little nerds comes over [inaudible] and talk to girls.

1021
00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.470
You don't realize I'm going to have sex with her later.
Yeah.
And you're,

1022
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.360
you're plastering cock sucker.

1023
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.560
You're trying to be the good guy side based on nothing.

1024
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.980
Talking about that is the weakest shit ever.

1025
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:17.700
I almost got in a fist fight with a guy in Manhattan who was a bartender around

1026
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:19.470
the Oj trial.
You know,

1027
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:24.500
there's this guy was the most self righteous con I think about guy still to this

1028
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.130
day.
And all he was trying to do was impress the waitress man.

1029
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:30.820
I was talking to the waitress and something came up about the Oj trial,
right.

1030
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:34.120
And she said,
you know,
well Oj,
you know,
did that.

1031
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:38.140
And he beat the shit out of his wife.
And I said,
well not necessarily.
I go,

1032
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:39.970
I don't know exactly what it did do is I put,

1033
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:42.900
they might've been like physical with each other.
Like I've had relations,

1034
00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.950
I've had friends who've had relationships where they,

1035
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:48.130
their wife would hit them and they would,
you know,
fight back.

1036
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:50.950
Like he would have to defend her and then the cops would come and then he would

1037
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:53.160
get arrested with assault and battery.
I've,

1038
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.060
I've known people where that's happened.

1039
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.350
Why I said that and all I said was we'll all we know is that there was some sort

1040
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:03.460
of restraining order and so the fucking bartender goes,
that's exactly right.

1041
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:05.680
That's what you heard and that's what it is.

1042
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.720
And the only way you get that one is if you abuse women.
And I was like,
Oh God,

1043
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:12.670
are you fucking kidding me?
I go,
dude,

1044
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.530
well all I'm saying is you weren't there and there could I?
I'm,

1045
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.280
I'm pretty sure he probably killed his wife,
but I don't know.

1046
00:57:18.281 --> 00:57:19.900
You don't know either man.
You weren't there.

1047
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.590
Like do you really know all of this is like while the case was going on while

1048
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:25.030
the trial was going on before he was convicted,

1049
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.440
this comes like ready to fight me are nowhere because he wanted to impress this

1050
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:33.580
girl with how much he supports women and how much you like his defense.

1051
00:57:33.581 --> 00:57:37.120
Women's cheesy because nobody could sell it.

1052
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.570
Don't go with guys at home.
This guy pointing and yelled at me.

1053
00:57:40.571 --> 00:57:42.070
I still remember him to this day.

1054
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.860
I still remember him to this day cause I was like,
this is absurd.

1055
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:48.220
Like this is the most ridiculous joke.
Like I don't need you.
I don't know you.

1056
00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:48.821
You don't know me.

1057
00:57:48.821 --> 00:57:52.150
I'm a nice guy and all of a sudden you're yelling at me because you think that I

1058
00:57:52.151 --> 00:57:54.940
support some guy beating the fuck out of his wife.
Like wow.

1059
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:57.700
And all just to try to be captain here and he's trying to take,

1060
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:02.380
push you into a corner where I am not with this at all.
I'm against this.

1061
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:05.050
You're like,
I wasn't even saying I'm for.
Yeah,
exactly.

1062
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:07.510
He's looking for a fight because why?

1063
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:10.990
Because I was a comic and I was talking to the waitress and he was a bartender

1064
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.600
and he probably wishes he was a comic book,
can't really pull it off.

1065
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:16.270
Maybe he's acts and you know,
maybe models or whatever.

1066
00:58:16.271 --> 00:58:19.330
You would be just some New York douche bag.
And I just wanted to be like,

1067
00:58:19.331 --> 00:58:20.620
you know,
Captain Liberal,

1068
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:24.700
save a hoe and jump in and look like a fucking superhero.

1069
00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:29.290
But the point is that shit only exists because we don't understand each other.

1070
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:33.010
Oh,
if you could,
you could understand what it's like to be a chick man.

1071
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:35.500
You would go,
oh,
all right.
If they can understand what it's like to be us,

1072
00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:38.980
they knew they would just kind of recognize like my dog and I'll try to stop my

1073
00:58:38.981 --> 00:58:42.970
dog from looking as balls because that's what he does.
Okay?
It was my,
my son,

1074
00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:45.640
and he's fingering his asshole and sucking on his fingers.
I'd be like,
Hey,

1075
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:49.810
what the fuck,
dude,
this is crazy.
You got to go to a doctor.
You know,

1076
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:52.540
but it's a dog.
I don't understand dogs,
man.
I just let it go.

1077
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:54.880
And when girls get super dramatic over nothing,
you're like,
man,

1078
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:57.400
that's who you are.
Just go,
whatever.
I'm gonna just tell you I love you.

1079
00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:00.520
Give me a hug.
Okay,
I'm gonna go watch TV.
Let's not get crazy.

1080
00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:03.460
I'm always going to be me.
You're always going to be you.
All right,

1081
00:59:03.461 --> 00:59:05.830
let's just figure this shit out.
You can't try to change me though.

1082
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.950
You know how many dudes do you ever talk to where they say,
oh,
you like to do go,

1083
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:13.450
but my wife does let me anymore.
What?
Your wife wants you to be a bitch.

1084
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:17.200
Your wife wants you to be something you'd don't even you and I can't go to

1085
00:59:17.201 --> 00:59:19.720
Jujitsu and the Mormon wife doesn't let me.
Like,
what are you talking about?

1086
00:59:19.721 --> 00:59:22.160
You can't go to Jujitsu because your wife doesn't

1087
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.730
<v 0>let you.
What kind of a relationship do you have with your keeper?</v>

1088
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:29.180
Some weird person to hear that.
Yeah.
What does she do?

1089
00:59:29.181 --> 00:59:31.280
She gives you pussy and so you,
you,

1090
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:35.090
you don't do your favorite things in life and your hobbies.
That's nonsense.

1091
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.620
What kind of person would want you to,

1092
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:39.410
could you imagine saying to a check a on what you do in Yoga anymore?

1093
00:59:39.411 --> 00:59:42.800
I think it's bullshit.
The yogas for fucking idiots.
Why?

1094
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:44.690
What was the reasoning for not wanting to go through to Jitsu?

1095
00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:48.440
She didn't like him getting involved in like fighting and being around all those

1096
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:50.990
guys and she's,
yeah,

1097
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:54.380
she just thought that they had like bad attitudes and they were,
you know,

1098
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:57.950
rough men.
Yeah.
She didn't want him being around rough men.
If she was like,

1099
00:59:57.951 --> 01:00:00.260
you hurt yourself,
you're gonna hurt yourself again.
I can't do this.

1100
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.800
I don't know what it was.
But she put the Kibosh on it and you know,

1101
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:07.100
you meet the guy and he's starts just like this shell of a man,
you know,

1102
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:10.310
hanging around with this woman who probably doesn't even like the fuck anymore,

1103
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.080
you know,
and she won't let him go to Jujitsu.
I gotta run it past my wife.
Ooh,

1104
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.530
Ooh,
let me get back to you cause I got to run it past,

1105
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:22.430
my wife had a guy in Dallas did.
He was one of these guys who would say,

1106
01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:24.640
settle on you and like do like that.
What?

1107
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:27.380
I'd like to do some weed but my wife won't let me

1108
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:33.020
do some weed.
And he was appointed one of those dudes.
I met one of those guys.

1109
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:36.930
I ain't man,
I'm with you.
I want to you buddy.
He was out.

1110
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.420
He would always point and say shit,

1111
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:41.090
but I don't know if I'll never forget that dude wife will let me.

1112
01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.900
That's how I got my vaporizer.
Don.
Carlos and the Taco shop down there.

1113
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:47.150
I guess I'm getting married.
She doesn't want me to,
whoa.

1114
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.690
She said on the edibles and I was like,
that's,
that's hilarious.
So weird.

1115
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:52.960
That's hilarious.
My wife gets weird.

1116
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.620
She hasn't been with smoke weed in a long time because of a,

1117
01:00:55.621 --> 01:00:58.790
the babies because she had,
she basically went from one baby to the next,

1118
01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:00.950
you know,
and the ones,
two and a half years old.

1119
01:01:00.951 --> 01:01:04.010
And she was breastfeeding for a year and then right after that she was pregnant

1120
01:01:04.011 --> 01:01:07.610
again with another one.
So she hasn't had any weed in any of that time.
So like,

1121
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:09.560
you know,
like just like little things.
She'll say,

1122
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.360
she'll come home smelling like weed.
Is that when I smell,
I'm like,
yeah,

1123
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.110
yeah.
You know,
I was doing a,
I smoked constantly.
The fuck question is that,

1124
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.560
don't you,
you try to pretend that I'm somebody.
I'm not,
because they want,

1125
01:01:21.561 --> 01:01:24.770
they want you to be,
you know,
hi honey,
I'm home.

1126
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:27.680
I've got my briefcase and let me take off my loafers.

1127
01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:30.140
And it's also the children bring them around.

1128
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.420
The chick can't motion should feel bad.
Yeah.
Well,
no,
it's not.
That feels bad.
No,

1129
01:01:33.421 --> 01:01:36.650
no,
no,
no.
It's like this nesting in a baby protection.

1130
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.090
She just doesn't want me to go crazy.

1131
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.760
She doesn't want me to be a crazy person and wind up doing drugs.

1132
01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:42.410
I'm going to the Amazon way back in three months.

1133
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.570
You should just know you have some person like your thinking about here,

1134
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.190
how irresponsible I am.
How far are you crazy.
I am at,

1135
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:53.360
I am the father of your children.
Okay.
Um,
um,
your,
your,
you know,

1136
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.900
I'm their daddy so I'm the one who has to be around and provide and keep a

1137
01:01:56.901 --> 01:02:00.780
stable life and raise them correctly and they're already swearing really where

1138
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:04.070
the little one,
two and a half.
She says,
she says shit all the time.
Wow.

1139
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:08.870
Like the other day I got a balloon format.
I was so pissed and the,

1140
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.780
I forgot at the supermarket you so excited.
It was a princess balloon,

1141
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.550
all these princesses on it and it was attached to a string and I pulled it out

1142
01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:20.040
of the trunk and that string unraveled and it flew away.
You.
It was

1143
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.810
<v 6>a helium balloon and I go,
dammit.
And she goes,
dammit.
Dammit.</v>

1144
01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.640
Like she immediately does what I do.

1145
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:29.760
She's two and a half and the other day she was trying to get into this bouncy

1146
01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:32.170
thing that her little sister has all those little things he'd get in,

1147
01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:36.390
it's on springs and she can't get in.
So she got one foot in it.
She's going,
shit,

1148
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.800
Shit.

1149
01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:44.690
Two and a half year old go shit.
I'm just glad it wasn't a balloon.
Not Joke.
Yeah,

1150
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.290
she just looks at me.
I'm like,
the fuck.
That's what you're supposed to say.

1151
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.990
What'd your foot gets stuck?
That's what you're supposed to sign.
She was,

1152
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:53.730
you know,
she doesn't want me to swear on the kids.

1153
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.730
It's not a good idea to swear around them.
Boat.
I mean I don't,
I don't,
I,

1154
01:02:57.731 --> 01:03:01.560
I really try to keep because I don't want them to have trouble with other kids

1155
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:04.740
and I sweat in front of you.
Oh yeah.
Those fucking mind to mind.

1156
01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:06.600
My note not only didn't mind swear in front of me,

1157
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.990
they never stopped me from swearing.
Never.
Like when people,

1158
01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:11.730
I would go over people's houses and Shit,

1162
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:22.880

He never allowed to curse.
If kids cursing you guys.
Yeah,

1163
01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.710
they wouldn't do it.
I was raised,
I was raised like a wolf.

1164
01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:28.740
I was like left in the woods.
My parents were fucking,

1165
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.330
I don't remember one piece of advice from my childhood,
not one,
not one.

1166
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.940
And everyone was always allowed to swear.
You know,
my,

1167
01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:39.170
my stepfather was a big hippie and so because of that,
like,
you know,

1168
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.120
he didn't like to put like borders and boundaries on shit.

1169
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.610
So we'd go over people's houses.
I'm like,

1170
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:45.444
What are you watching this for?

And the parents would look at me and the mom would look at me like,

1172
01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.280
I did have me over for cookies and shit and hanging out with his kid.

1173
01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:52.710
I would sweat right in front of the parents.

1174
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.130
I just wouldn't even think twice about it.
It was bearable.

1189
01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:42.720

So for you it was just being complimentary.

1199
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.450
Let them know how beautiful they look like.

1237
01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:18.530
You know when you go like this and make it go back and forth and give them a

1238
01:07:18.531 --> 01:07:22.060
hand.
Give him how long and that's an expression.
I'm like,
wait a minute.

1239
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.180
So when you you wear no underwear I guess?
No,
I had,

1240
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:30.510
you know I was like five and six moms asking you to slap your dig back and
forth.

1241
01:07:30.511 --> 01:07:33.270
I give them a hand,
give them hand white,

1242
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:37.870
give me booze and I pass out and I wake up the next fuck.
Yeah,

1243
01:07:37.871 --> 01:07:42.871
my mom was the shit like that photo that you had on your myspace page of you

1244
01:07:43.421 --> 01:07:47.050
when you were real young dancing.
Where's that fall happened at the house?

1245
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.030
Is it on your myspace page still?

1246
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:53.530
I think it's on my space kind of same that I don't have that picture and those

1247
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:55.870
are like great picture that's you.

1248
01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:58.060
Like it's so funny because even though I can see that,

1249
01:07:58.061 --> 01:08:00.490
it's like what do you like 10 in the picture?
How old are the 10,
12

1250
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.160
I could see it.
You,
I see your personality.
See the whole thing.

1251
01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:08.650
You as a kid and as Suzanne a suit.
Yeah.

1252
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.510
And the funny thing was the rest of that,
um,

1253
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:13.120
I'm making out with a girl and my 12th birthday,

1254
01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.850
my mom had a friend who were Puerto Ricans and they used to try to always hook

1255
01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:18.860
us up and shit.
He didn't even get laid to,

1256
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:21.890
it was like 24 maybe take out of this wealth.

1257
01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.570
They made us take pictures like this,

1258
01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:26.330
what I had already like eating the pussy and shit and fuck them.

1259
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:29.120
Before that we used to sleep over her house and we were kids.

1260
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.490
She had hair on a Polisci tons of hay out.

1261
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:36.290
She had to be a year or two older than me and our parents have trying to hook us

1262
01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:37.990
up.
So we got old and we fall in love.

1263
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.750
So on the weekends I sleep on the couch and she's sleeping in the bedroom and I

1264
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:45.330
go in there,
the middle to the Bronx and she'd show me a push,
you know,
you know,

1265
01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.720
pushing the next day I touch her stomach cause I told she was pregnant.

1266
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.510
I would always think I got pregnant.
That's how fucking crazy

1267
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.960
name was Yvette Rivera.
We just come inside.
If you're out there,
Facebook me,

1268
01:08:56.961 --> 01:08:59.810
you dirty freak Facebook because you're,

1269
01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.390
you are sucking Dick at 12 you were an animal now.
You know what I'm saying?

1270
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:05.180
You got a fan with fucking metals on it.

1271
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:10.250
You've probably done blowing you at 12 she didn't blow me at 12 she let me eat

1272
01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:13.400
her pussy and I think I remember like fucking them,

1273
01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:16.040
but then I would just pass out because when you're at 12 when you're fucking,

1274
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:21.200
your central nervous system just gives out.
You just tap out,
you hear shit.

1275
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:24.350
But you don't know what's happening in Asia.
You okay?
Yeah,

1276
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:27.890
that's what it's like a doors movie they ask,
are you okay?
Yeah,
I'm okay.

1277
01:09:27.891 --> 01:09:31.430
You don't know.
Fucking call me once with my pants around my ankles.

1278
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.390
I'm face down on the bed.
Uh,

1279
01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.190
and the swimsuit issue and the sports illustrated swimsuit issue at ACC right

1280
01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:40.430
above my head.
Just out past ass out.

1281
01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.080
Ah,
how old were you the first time you got to some

1282
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.200
<v 6>pussy actual pussy?
Yeah,
I was,</v>

1283
01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.280
I think it was like 15 fooling around with the weirdest thing was when I was 13,

1284
01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.980
there was this chick who was 21.
She was a grown woman man,

1285
01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.950
a grown woman and she used to play softball with us.

1286
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:06.860
This is when I lived in Jamaica Plain.
Jamaica plains,
a sketchy area.
Boston,
it's,

1287
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:10.300
it's,
you know,
it's a lot of real poor people and people are fucking nuts.

1288
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.820
And His broad,
um,
her name was Jeanette.

1289
01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:16.120
She had this boyfriend who was a construction worker and she was 21 man,

1290
01:10:16.121 --> 01:10:19.510
she was hot little piece ass and her construction worker boyfriend was out,
man.

1291
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:24.060
And he's a hairy chested,
big fucking man.
And I would see this guy,
you know,

1292
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:26.890
and the guy will be like working in the end.
I would think,
well you know this,

1293
01:10:26.891 --> 01:10:29.550
if this is her boyfriend,
you know that's a boyfriend.
Like you know the,

1294
01:10:29.551 --> 01:10:31.900
there's no way she'd be interested in me at 13 year old boy.

1295
01:10:31.901 --> 01:10:33.460
Like this is ridiculous.
I'm like a little child.

1296
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:38.200
What was coming home from fucking playing softball somehow or another we all

1297
01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:41.230
wound cause we all would hang out on this one street that I lived on,
you know,

1298
01:10:41.231 --> 01:10:42.450
it was like a real neighborhood,
you know,

1299
01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:45.610
people would play stickball in the street and people would run around and play

1300
01:10:45.611 --> 01:10:47.170
hide and go seek and all kinds of crazy shit.

1301
01:10:47.171 --> 01:10:50.230
And a lot of young kids lived in this one area and it was pretty nuts.

1302
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.370
She invites me over.
You want to listen to some pink Floyd?
Okay.
Yeah.

1303
01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.970
So we're listening to comfortably numb and all of a sudden she starts making out

1304
01:10:57.971 --> 01:11:02.770
with me.
Like I had never kissed a girl before ever.
So I went from no,
nothing,

1305
01:11:02.771 --> 01:11:03.100
no.

1306
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:08.100
Never ever anywhere to all of a sudden this 21 year old is sucking my tongue and

1307
01:11:08.591 --> 01:11:12.190
she's grabbing my dick and I'm like,
whoa.
And I totally could not get it up.

1308
01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:16.740
Not even a little bit nervous.
Total panic total like what is happening?

1309
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:19.980
Why is this woman kissing me?
Like what is going on?

1310
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.010
And then we fooled around like a bunch of times more after that.

1311
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.750
But there was never,
yeah,
it was never like sex.
I never fucked her pseudo.

1312
01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.220
It's just jerked my dick off and truck.
Wow.

1313
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:31.860
So it wasn't until I was like,

1314
01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:36.240
I think I was 15 when my girlfriend was 14 which is crazy to think that people

1315
01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:41.190
fuck at 14 but she wasn't even a virgin.
Wow.
Eh.
She had fucked up mother guy

1316
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.390
and she didn't want to admit it.
She would be like,
well,

1317
01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:46.410
we kind of did it sort of,

1318
01:11:46.411 --> 01:11:50.400
but not really do is be a rule girls always do that sort of didn't count.

1319
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:54.750
Didn't like,
if a stranger to do to you,
would you count that as rape?
Right.

1320
01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:57.180
Good point.
Yeah.
Then that should count.
The rapist is going on,

1321
01:11:57.181 --> 01:11:59.610
just sticking in for half a stroke than leaving said no,
I didn't do it.

1322
01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.640
Well this girl,
I think she might've fucked my friend to the,

1323
01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.230
the first call I had sex with.

1324
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:06.600
I think she might've fuck my friend cause she definitely made out with them

1325
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.740
cause she was like with him first and then you know back then people are like,

1326
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.040
Oh I don't like Bob Anymore.
I like Mike on Wendy's a bitch.
I'm tired of Wendy,

1327
01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:15.120
I'm going to,
you know this girl.

1328
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.690
And I liked the people would like go back and forth,
you know,

1329
01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.640
no way fuck you were doing.
You were playing relationship.

1330
01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:22.650
You know the first relationships that I ever had.

1331
01:12:22.651 --> 01:12:24.390
Like you didn't know what the fuck to do.

1332
01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:27.330
He didn't know how to behave around them.
The whole thing was weird.

1333
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:29.860
Like the get them stuff.
I don't know why or when.
Right.

1334
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:34.870
And all I wanted to do once we started fucking what's fucked cause constantly

1335
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.450
five times a day,
just,
just fuck everywhere.
I didn't do anything else.

1336
01:12:39.451 --> 01:12:41.970
I stopped working out.
I stopped playing sports.

1337
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:43.530
I stopped doing everything from months.

1338
01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:46.650
It took like I had to go back to my taekwondo instructor.
He was yelling at me.

1339
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.250
He was like,
well,
have you been,
I've been trying it out.
I got left back.

1340
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.450
Plus he told me you got left back in sixth grade.
Wow.

1341
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:56.040
That's how good that pussy was.

1342
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.370
Surely I went to summer school and then tap down on some school.

1343
01:12:59.371 --> 01:13:02.370
You can only miss three times.
I couldn't take it.
I get up in morning.

1344
01:13:02.371 --> 01:13:05.550
My head would be ready to fucking explode.
I'd watch her mother.

1345
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.840
I would struck the mother really soon as I see the mother's cargo around fucking

1346
01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:13.440
Charles Court.
It would run in there like fucking Batman after a fucking,

1347
01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:16.620
my first girlfriend,
the problem was my first girlfriend was hot.

1348
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:20.700
She was hot and she was a freak and there's some girls who are like 14 and 15

1349
01:13:20.701 --> 01:13:23.220
and they look like women and this girl looked,
she looked like women.

1350
01:13:23.221 --> 01:13:27.030
She dressed in a little mini skirts and high heels and shit and she was at dirty

1351
01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:30.570
bench.
She was came from a single family household and those girls,

1352
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:33.510
like a single parent,
like if you live with just your mom,

1353
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.460
like girls who just live with their mom,
like a lot of them it seems they,

1354
01:13:37.461 --> 01:13:41.440
they grow up with some sort of an extra need for male attention.
Oh,

1355
01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:45.240
extra need for male acceptance and validation.

1356
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:49.990
Nobody home at three o'clock.
This girl just go five.
I tore that ass up.

1357
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:53.820
She just wanted to suck cock and fuck all the time.
She was a freak.

1358
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.640
She wants me out.
What's wrong?
Would you listen to shop?

1359
01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:58.560
Like to suck my Dick and movie theaters?
Like anything.

1360
01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:03.210
What you salt the fuck that and mostly it was like,

1361
01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.600
oh here,
here,
here I go again.
Put It on again.
I,

1362
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:11.790
it's actually the DEF Leppard days.
I think I was into Leppard crashing,

1363
01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.730
<v 0>maybe pour some sugar on me or something.
But this girlfriend was a cool girl.</v>

1364
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.590
You know,
she was the first girl,
her name is Bethany.

1365
01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.900
She was the first girl that I ever,
I'm like,

1366
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:21.760
listen to what Richard Pryor tapes with.

1367
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:26.020
We would sit and sit in my bedroom and Kegel,
listen to these tapes.

1368
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.390
It was crazy,
man.
It was like I,

1369
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:33.220
that was the first person that was like not a dude that was like my friend,

1370
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:36.220
you know?
And we just bang all the time.
Like constantly.

1371
01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.860
It was like this person that you like,
that's not a,
not a,

1372
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:42.850
not a guy and it's a girl.
And I'm also no girls in your life all the time.

1373
01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:45.010
Like your whole life.
There's been no girls in your life.

1374
01:14:45.011 --> 01:14:48.190
Like I had no girlfriends.
I might've had like one or two along the way.

1375
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:50.530
Cause like girls that were nice that I went to school with,
that I would,

1376
01:14:50.531 --> 01:14:53.170
you know,
talk to or hang out with afterschool.
Yeah.
But you know,

1377
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:54.910
for the most part it's a bunch of dudes in my life.

1378
01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.520
Then all the sudden there's just some girl and you're just fucking so you go

1379
01:14:57.521 --> 01:15:02.050
from no sex at all to all of a sudden just fucking constantly do whenever you

1380
01:15:02.051 --> 01:15:06.420
want.
Fucking savagery,
man.
Those hormones,
man.
When you,
when you're,
uh,

1381
01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:11.490
when people don't understand the concept of 16 year old Dick that you are on a

1382
01:15:11.981 --> 01:15:16.750
drug man,
that's a heavy,
super powerful,
super addictive drug.

1383
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:18.910
That's physically when you're supposed to breed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1384
01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:20.560
You should be making a baby right then for sure.

1385
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:24.230
I was trying to make a baby got so lucky.
So lucky.
Woo.

1386
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.930
<v 3>You get super fucking horny.
Oh my God.
That's obsessive.</v>

1387
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.790
Mind you don't say a red band.

1388
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.670
Red Band sitting over there silent over there in the corner.

1389
01:15:33.671 --> 01:15:35.230
Like fucking precious reminiscing.

1390
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.160
He's his father's fathers and shot about 150 loads this week.

1391
01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:41.880
He's feeling kind of tired.
I'm on duty.
He's back.

1392
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:46.120
Ryan's back between masturbation and all the sexy you've been having,

1393
01:15:46.121 --> 01:15:51.040

01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:52.580
What are you saying?

1395
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:56.140
Why you sound like the Apollo 11 astronauts and it's called flight press

1396
01:15:56.170 --> 01:16:00.930
conference the last two days in bed.

1397
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:05.080

Yeah.
You've been in bed.
What was the Nivea attached to the bed?

1398
01:16:05.081 --> 01:16:08.320
Keep you rehydrated from all the fucking milky white knowledge.
You shoot.

1399
01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.570
It was a drink too much Friday,

1400
01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:14.530
like so much that I couldn't get out of Bedford today.
There Sunday or Monday.

1401
01:16:14.531 --> 01:16:17.190
Friday and Saturday.
Really?
Yeah.
Where'd you go

1402
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.850
to hell to hell.
That's what I like.

1403
01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:27.980
Narnia.
Narnia.
And actually my friend's a manager at Bevmo.
Nice King.

1404
01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.140
Nobody gets drunk like you,
Huh?
Nobody gets drunk like you.
Uh,

1405
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:37.060
you're dead wrong.
Who else gets,
I think when people get drunk just like me,

1406
01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:40.150
but when they're 36,
right?

1407
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:44.020
When you're 18 or definitely drinking more than me.

1408
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:45.063
<v 0>Saddest thing.</v>

1409
01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.920
I was in Vegas and I was sober and I ran into this chick that I know used to be

1410
01:16:48.921 --> 01:16:51.050
a ring card girl and she was super,
super drunk.

1411
01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.040
<v 3>Yeah.
Sloppy her sober and someone else is not.
And you're like,
hey,</v>

1412
01:16:56.130 --> 01:17:00.600
how are you doing?
How are you?
And they're just like,
oh yeah.
By the way,

1413
01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.500
if you see people outside of a pink Floyd concert that you know,

1414
01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.970
please don't assume that they're just fine.
You know?
Don't just say,
Hey,

1415
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:13.100
I haven't seen you in awhile.
Just fucking say hi and walk away.
Fuck Golan.
Yeah,

1416
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.910
no,
please.
What happened?
People say hi,
but it's like,
I don't,

1417
01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:18.020
I can't talk to you right now.

1418
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.680
That's supposed to be cool that you ran into somebody you know you want to give

1419
01:17:21.681 --> 01:17:22.940
you fucking hear beat.
Yeah.

1420
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.640
It's a very embarrassing thing when you're intoxicated and the other person

1421
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.520
isn't.
Yeah.
You feel like it's also such a loser with our,

1422
01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:29.990
I'm drunk or whether I'm stoned.

1423
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:34.670
I always feel like a real idiot if I'm drunk or coked up.
I feel like an idiot.

1424
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:37.160
If I'm stolen,
I feel bad for the other person.

1425
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:42.920
If it's two in the afternoon and you ain't high,
go fuck yourself.
Got On my face.

1426
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:46.400

You know what I'm saying?

1427
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:49.790
You got to come around here looking at me with your fucking wide eyes.

1428
01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.670
Pick him that you know I'm gonna.

1429
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.510
My morning starts at 5:30 AM either you're there or your square.

1430
01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.550
You know what I'm saying?
It's true.

1431
01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.030
That's my new signature on the rogue and board.
If it's still in the afternoon,

1434
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.790

1438
01:18:20.481 --> 01:18:23.360
they come to me [inaudible] like great to see you and they like talked to me

1439
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:23.910
about weeds.

1440
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:26.820
I asked him if you want to smoke and they look at me with this pain in their

1441
01:18:26.821 --> 01:18:31.160
soul can't,
but I understand your pain so you guys don't listen to this shit.

1442
01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:35.660
I love it.
On my oculus fuck.
Republicans and Democrats that walk around all day,

1443
01:18:35.661 --> 01:18:39.170
I don't get high till after work.
Go Fuck yourself lunchtime.
I don't mind.

1444
01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:42.590
You want to go on at nine and feel the fucking atmosphere and see what's going

1445
01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:45.170
on.
You don't want to run into their high into an emergency.

1446
01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:49.340
You know what I'm saying it to afford 11 if I want to at 12 o'clock when you

1447
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:53.700
slip off for lunch,
you've got to come with the kit.
Vaizey lifesavers along.

1448
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.480
Come with fuck it.
Yeah.
A one hit up that orange spray,

1449
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:59.020
that orange brand you do to into the pipes.

1450
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:03.400
Don't give a fuck what you see right here.
Yep.
We'd kill and spray.

1451
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:06.850
Tell you what is it called?
Orange what aren't chronic chronic sprain.

1452
01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:12.860
Ai got too high one time and I got the part where you're like panic attacks and

1453
01:19:12.861 --> 01:19:16.300
I was dating Katie at the time and I'm like Katie,
I think uh,

1454
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.230
I need you guys to call the ambulance.

1455
01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:22.100
I'm too stoned on my heart's pounding too hard.
She goes,
you're fine,
you're fine.

1456
01:19:22.101 --> 01:19:24.110
You're just stoned.
I'm like,
no,
please call the ambulance.

1457
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.440
And so they were coming over and I had a big bottle of that in my house.

1458
01:19:27.441 --> 01:19:28.131
Smelled like weed.

1459
01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:31.670
So I sprayed the whole bottle cause I was so scared to call the ambulance to the

1460
01:19:31.671 --> 01:19:33.280
house too.
Yeah.
How many times.

1461
01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:37.660
And so it's a payment plan with the hospital three times.

1462
01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.910
Have you called the ambulance brown to that I know of if it's a story because

1463
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:46.330
cause I don't want him to be Guam,
Guam.

1464
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:48.770
So I said,

1465
01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:52.820
so I spray a whole bottle because I'm so stoned and paranoid.

1466
01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:56.270
I didn't want to get in trouble.
And so they come in here and they were like,

1467
01:19:56.271 --> 01:19:58.910
you're fine.
You know your heart's a little little racing,
whatever.
You're fine.

1468
01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:02.720
You're probably fucked up from all this orange spray because it was so strong

1469
01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:04.040
that they had to put masks on

1470
01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:11.040
and I was too stoned to realize if you've called hospitals twice,

1471
01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:14.730
you've called an ambulance because you were too high.
There's,
I mean,

1472
01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:17.460
there's a big thing,
like when I was a kid,
I had to take stress tests.

1473
01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:21.270
I had this thing where I would run around and blackout for no reason and doctors

1474
01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:25.590
have no idea why.
So I used to have to do,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Explain that.

1475
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.370
What happened?
So like,
all right.
You used to happen like maybe four times.

1476
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:32.220
When I was a kid,
one time when I was running through the snow,
I black out,

1477
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:35.520
I wake up and I'm out laying on the ground.
Second time I'm riding my bike,

1478
01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:37.970
I fall off my bike for no reason.
I blacked out and there's been,

1479
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:39.540
there was like a couple of different times like that.

1480
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:42.180
So they used to make me to just blacked out while you were riding a bike?
Yeah.

1481
01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.860
So they didn't know why.

1482
01:20:43.861 --> 01:20:46.680
So they made me do the stress test where they put these things all over your

1483
01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:50.100
body and he had to run this treadmill for like an hour or something like that.

1484
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:54.300
And Yeah.
And they said,
hey,
we'd have no idea what's wrong with you.
You know,

1485
01:20:54.301 --> 01:20:57.840
then I black out again and all this stuff.
But then it just stopped happening.

1486
01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:01.440
And the only time it happens now is like when you jerk off.
No,
no.
When you're,

1487
01:21:01.441 --> 01:21:01.801
you know,

1488
01:21:01.801 --> 01:21:04.590
when you're drunk and you wake up real quick to go to the bathroom and you start

1489
01:21:04.591 --> 01:21:07.850
going,
okay,
I stood up too quick.
And,
um,
yeah,
I get that all the time.

1490
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.920
The blood pressure from the blood pressure,
it's just being hammered.
Well,

1491
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:14.190
it only,
it happens more when you're drunk cause of your blood pressure.
Yeah.

1492
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.170
So anyways,
um,

1493
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:19.470
I think when I was a kid that I used to always happen all the time and so then I

1494
01:21:19.471 --> 01:21:23.220
was extra paranoid with my heart,
like just freaks out all the time.

1495
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:27.300
Like they said that my heart,
uh,
extra night used to tell me yeah,

1496
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.610
after that Boone heart,
but I told the ladies,

1497
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.380
I have a bad Boone heart sweat to other girls.

1498
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:33.570
You should do a lot of cardio then.
Huh?
I shouldn't,

1499
01:21:33.571 --> 01:21:37.080
you look have a healthy strong or the exact opposite.
Yeah.
How's that worked for?

1500
01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:40.410
I don't want to use my heart at all,
you know?
Is that the case though?

1501
01:21:40.411 --> 01:21:42.900
What do they tell you?
Well,
they have no idea.
Whatever.

1502
01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.560
They never found out what happened.
Whoa.
Yeah.
But now it doesn't happen.

1503
01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:50.160
It's not like I'm blacking out anywhere,
you know,
so.
Right.

1504
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:53.340
But that's why I think in the past,
you know,
and get really big.

1505
01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:56.110
My heart starts going crazy.
A little bit different than maybe,
Huh?

1506
01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:00.660
<v 6>Okay.
So it's so freaky that you think that you might be having a heart attack.</v>

1507
01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:02.880
Right.
Because when I was a kid,
ever since I was like eight,

1508
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:07.310
I've had fucked up shit.
Yeah,
this boy,
you should know that it's hot.
The story,

1509
01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.700
I really want to give you a hug.

1510
01:22:08.701 --> 01:22:10.130
I feel like you're a little kid that needs a hug.
It's,

1511
01:22:10.131 --> 01:22:13.590
you grew up in the psychological now it's like a,
it's like his,

1512
01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:17.590
his mind playing tricks on,
I seen somebody pass out from weed.
We were,
uh,

1513
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:18.960
we were in New York,

1514
01:22:18.961 --> 01:22:22.170
we're filming fear factor and there was a bunch of people from the crew were all

1515
01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:26.330
hanging out and there was this nice lady from production and she,
you know,

1516
01:22:26.331 --> 01:22:30.210
we all had a beer or two and we're all out there in the street.
So I go,

1517
01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:32.710
you guys want to get high?
And they look at me like,
what do you guys,

1518
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:35.310
what do you got?
Like,
oh,
I got a joint.
I go,
I've got some real shit.

1519
01:22:35.311 --> 01:22:37.260
You want to get high?
And you're like,
okay,
let's do it.

1520
01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.020
I felt like I was being crazy,
like,
can't believe we're doing this.
You know,

1521
01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:41.400
they just weren't the type of people to get high.

1522
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:44.250
We're going to smoke all this street on my,
if they do,
they don't get high a lot.

1523
01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:48.040
You know,
they might do it every now and then at a party or so.
And so I uh,

1524
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:51.330
I passed this joint around and they take like two hits each,
you know,

1525
01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:52.620
which you don't realize if you,

1526
01:22:52.621 --> 01:22:56.550
if you get locked up for that medical California medical grade weed is,

1527
01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.470
that's like an alien organism that takes over your entire body and transports

1528
01:23:01.471 --> 01:23:06.010
you to a nearby immersion.
It was like half a hit was so much.
Do you remember

1529
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.880
<v 0>macguire macguire freaked out at the comedy store and was absolutely convinced</v>

1530
01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:14.620
someone dose the,
we'd give it to that.
He was like,
those guys like Pete,

1531
01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:17.230
you're like,
oh,
he must have done something to that weed.
I smoked it too.

1532
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:19.930
He ended up with some other guy,

1533
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:23.310
that guy that was from Texas and I smoked that joint too.
So I,
I,
you know,

1534
01:23:23.311 --> 01:23:25.900
we had to tell McGuire,
no,
it's just really good weed.
There's no way,

1535
01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:30.520
because wheat is less strong,
newly just don't wait.

1536
01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:33.280
So it's not,
I'm telling you man,
I'm telling you man,
I think there's a problem.

1537
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:35.050
I think it's a real agenda.
Genuine problem.

1538
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:38.200
I was like really freaked out cause he doesn't get high.
And Chris is,
you know,

1539
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:42.050
he's a small guy so it must've,
he was smoking with Joey in May in [inaudible].

1540
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.900
<v 6>We're hitting that weed,
you know,
and Wu two or three hits of your,</v>

1541
01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.690
if you're a real rookie.
So this check we're all out.

1542
01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:51.330
We're all passing joints around.
They're all freely till you want another one.

1543
01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:55.200
You sure?
All right.
Get in there,
look at you second.
Hit her eyes,

1544
01:23:55.201 --> 01:23:59.040
roll back in her head and she just collapses right there on the fucking sidewalk

1545
01:23:59.041 --> 01:24:01.710
man.
And almost cracked her head off a pole.
We had a catcher.

1546
01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:05.010
We were right there like ruck luckily was her legs gave out.

1547
01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:07.520
I thought she was kidding.
I thought she was like,
Whoa,
this is weird.

1548
01:24:07.521 --> 01:24:10.580
It's those drug a little before.
But no,
her eyes rolled behind her head.

1549
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:15.060
She went unconscious like what is it about your body that wants you to shut off?

1550
01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:18.750
Like what kind of a lack of self preservation does your body have?

1551
01:24:18.751 --> 01:24:21.350
I think about that shit.
You get hit,
you get hurt,
you,

1552
01:24:21.351 --> 01:24:24.360
your body wants to shut off.
You take a,
you smell smoke some weed,

1553
01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.690
<v 0>you get too high and your body wants to shut.
Your body's just not used to.</v>

1554
01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:31.000
It's like if you went back at a time you saw yourself like you know when Michael

1555
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.550
J.
Fox went back and saw himself and they both fainted and freaked out.

1556
01:24:33.551 --> 01:24:36.850
You know your mind just shuts off cause it's too much shock.
It's like Bam,

1557
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.460
you're,
you know,
you just first time you take care of your bar.

1558
01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.240
Why don't buy that?
Because you're,

1559
01:24:42.241 --> 01:24:45.220
you're selling saying that you never blacked out when you were on acid and acid

1560
01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:46.480
sounds way crazier than that.

1561
01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:49.720
If anything should make you black out into that blow the smoke.

1562
01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:53.830
I think you're too awake with the acid.
You can't sleep for 12 hours on acid.

1563
01:24:53.831 --> 01:24:56.710
The last thing you want to do is sleep.
Why?
But that's what I'm saying.
I mean,

1564
01:24:56.711 --> 01:25:01.000
but it's an insane experience.
Right?
It's like so overwhelming.
No,
because I mean,

1565
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:04.090
every time I black out,
it was out of the blue.
I was just riding my bike.
Bam.

1566
01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:06.960
I was,
those were running in the,
you know,
Snow.
Well,
that's the,

1567
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:08.200
that you had a weird condition.

1568
01:25:08.201 --> 01:25:10.780
When I'm talking to most like smoking weed or drinking or something like that,

1569
01:25:10.781 --> 01:25:11.950
like,
or even getting hit,

1570
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:14.530
like what a weird thing it is that if you get hit and hurt,

1571
01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:17.980
your body wants to just shut off the puzzle going to help you.
Exactly.

1572
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.900
It's gonna make you feel less pain as animals eating,
right?
Yeah,
absolutely.

1573
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.400
As his animals,
there's always set the duff.
Really?
Yeah.

1574
01:25:27.401 --> 01:25:28.690
There's kind of,
you see them like they run,

1575
01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:30.780
they run the kick and then it's like they just lie there.
You know?

1576
01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:34.900
That's how native Americans used to catch deer before they invented spears and

1577
01:25:34.901 --> 01:25:35.621
even bows and arrows.

1578
01:25:35.621 --> 01:25:39.390
They would run after them until the deer would give up and die.
Wow.
Yeah.
They,

1579
01:25:39.391 --> 01:25:43.390
they still do it in some parts of Africa.
It's like some sort of a bitches.

1580
01:25:43.391 --> 01:25:48.391
Joe [inaudible] my dog.

1581
01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:51.900
That's why they're all wearing high heels and skirts,
maneuverable.

1582
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:55.810
But that kind of outfit on how they,
uh,
they do it.
Some

1583
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:59.260
<v 6>parts of Africa,
it's like a rite of passage,
you know,
you go after a,</v>

1584
01:25:59.261 --> 01:26:02.560
an antelope and fucking run that bitch down until the thing dies or fatigue.

1585
01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:03.843
Then they stab it.

1586
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.820
<v 0>Wow.
Yeah.
They run with a knife,
carry it back,</v>

1587
01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:10.070
and then when the thing gives up and they just go over it and fucking stab in

1588
01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:12.830
the heart and that's a wrap.
It just gives up.
Doesn't,
can't run anymore.

1589
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:18.770
Do you think in Africa that,
is it Africa that has so much,
so much,
uh,

1590
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:22.550
aids,
right?
Like most people have like 75%.

1591
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:25.620
Like they have the most Kentucky Fried.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1592
01:26:25.810 --> 01:26:29.980
But it's like 75% aids there or something like that.
Right.
Not Crazy big.
Well,

1593
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:31.480
I don't know what it is,
what they've got.
There's a lot of A's.

1594
01:26:31.481 --> 01:26:35.420
So if you didn't have aids,
you would have the aids.
Right.

1595
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:39.860
Except that no one got 5% of the people at AIDS.

1596
01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.830
That's like the norm.
So if you don't have aids,
you have the aid.

1597
01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:44.420
So people are looking out the window and look at him.

1598
01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.580
He looks like he wears protection,
you know,

1599
01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:49.190
like whether it be backwards on the road.
And you know,

1600
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:53.480
well there's a lot of debate when it comes to AIDS in Africa and the let the

1601
01:26:53.481 --> 01:26:57.290
debate,
a lot of it is on what is,
how do you define aids?

1602
01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:00.590
Do you define aids by someone who has erect immune system and what does that

1603
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:01.730
immune system wrecked from?

1604
01:27:01.731 --> 01:27:05.210
Can't you just look at the music library actually wrecked from HIV?

1605
01:27:05.211 --> 01:27:09.740
Is it rec from other disease or is it racked from massive malnutrition?
You know,

1606
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:14.090
these people are like really like and terrible environments as far as like
water,

1607
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:18.470
like clean water and,
and,
and food and you know,
nutrition.

1608
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:21.680
And there's a lot of people that are dying of all sorts of crazy shit.

1609
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:25.040
And I think a lot of it gets lumped in as aids.
You know,
there's,

1610
01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:26.150
I think there's a lot of issues.

1611
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:30.020
So it's not just HIV and HIV is certainly an issue in Africa.
I mean there's a,

1612
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:32.780
it's an insane amount of people have it and on top of that,

1613
01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:37.130
one of the ways they try to cure it is they try to kill Albinos and they do

1614
01:27:37.131 --> 01:27:38.960
witchcraft and shit with Albinos.

1615
01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:43.620
Virgin and fuck virgins versions have aids.
They believe that.
Yeah,

1616
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:48.180
you can get rid of the rape,
a 12 year old version.

1617
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:51.770
I mean we talk about Africa so often because if you want to get online and start

1618
01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.310
tweaking and weird and out about the state of the world,
go look at Africa.

1619
01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:59.160
Africa is I,
I'm,
I'm not,
I'm not going to Africa now.

1620
01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:04.160
Ne got No desire.
We talked about going to Africa.
I don't think so.

1621
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.250
Probably.
Let's talk about,
I was going to Brazil,
man.
Prostitute,
just talking.
Boy,

1622
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.870
we're definitely going back to sa to Australia.

1623
01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.800
We're going all over the fucking place.
Cool.

1624
01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:17.930
There was a real bad decision at the last year I've seen that a man was talking

1625
01:28:17.931 --> 01:28:21.230
about and that's bullshit.
That is one of the,
that's just ridiculous.

1626
01:28:21.231 --> 01:28:25.360
I like how you did your speech though.
That was fucking awesome.
Perfect.

1627
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:27.380
It's exactly what I think most people were thinking.

1628
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:30.480
I said that we have to get rid of some of these judges that you can set up

1629
01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:34.220
during the what?
Threw in another fight.
Oh,
during the middle of the fight.

1630
01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:36.500
I was talking about the last fight and I was,
it was such a bad decision.

1631
01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:40.070
I've never had like that many people screaming bullshit.

1632
01:28:40.071 --> 01:28:44.780
Like the whole crowd was screaming bullshit.
They were all pissed.

1633
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:46.730
You know?
There was very few people cheering.

1634
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:51.080
It was like obviously Nam Pan one Vitor was like,
I know I lost.

1635
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:53.810
He had just lost now though.
Oh,
he doesn't know.

1636
01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.730
He thinks he wants more damage or,
yeah.
What,
what's the,
what's the count?

1637
01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.460
There's websites that deal all the camps and we beat them by a considerable

1638
01:29:02.461 --> 01:29:06.630
margin on the counts of like connecting and also,
you know,
it's not just that,

1639
01:29:06.631 --> 01:29:10.110
it's like the second round was so overwhelming for that dude.

1640
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:13.200
There's a bunch of issues and one of the issues is the actual scoring system

1641
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:16.950
that they have in place is taken from boxing and it's not a good scoring system.

1642
01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:20.790
The 10 point must system because like there's a guy named doc Hamilton and he's

1643
01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:23.350
a referee who has a,
a,
a real or is a judge rather.

1644
01:29:23.351 --> 01:29:27.570
And he was a referee as well and he has a good idea and it's a half point
system.

1645
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:31.980
And what that system would be like,
say like the first round of Nan fan and uh,

1646
01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:36.540
and um,
Leonard Garcia,
you would say nam fan one,
but how closely did he win it?

1647
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:38.250
And it'd be half a point.
Give him a half point.

1648
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.980
But the second round he took them down,
he beat him up.

1649
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.450
Like the second round was pretty clear.

1650
01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:46.020
So you'd give them a full point for that round and then the third round,

1651
01:29:46.021 --> 01:29:47.880
who won that round?
Well,
you know,

1652
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:51.420
I could see a debate either way and that would be a half point round as well.

1653
01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:53.570
That could threaten people like barely losing two round.
Yeah,

1654
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:58.440
crushing another round.
Exactly.
Machida rampage was a perfect example.

1655
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:01.200
You know a lot of people gave rampage the first two rounds because he pushed the

1656
01:30:01.201 --> 01:30:04.310
fight.
But the third round was clearly Machida because he did a bunch of damage.

1657
01:30:04.311 --> 01:30:05.280
Then they took rampage down.

1658
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:08.990
So rampage would maybe get a half a point for each of the first and then there

1659
01:30:08.991 --> 01:30:10.560
would be a third round and he would get up.

1660
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:12.090
But she didn't get a full point for that round.

1661
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.540
And then what would happen is if it was a draw,
which it would be in that case,

1662
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:20.070
they would rely on a fourth judge who only calculates damage.

1663
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:22.890
So the fourth judge through the whole fight,
like say if you take him down,

1664
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:24.780
you get them in side control,
that's x amount of points.

1665
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.880
And if you hit him with a leg kick that makes them wins,

1666
01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:29.460
that's x amount of points.
Any tallies,
all these up while the fights going on.

1667
01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.800
So this guy doesn't have to decide who wins each round.

1668
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:35.410
All this fourth guide is doing,
it's like,
yeah,
who's doing [inaudible]?

1669
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:38.930
Judge almost got a rear naked choke or almost got,
where's the,

1670
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.890
what you call them?
They would do what's called a catch.

1671
01:30:40.891 --> 01:30:44.910
And they used to do this and in Japan when a guy was really close to landing a

1672
01:30:44.911 --> 01:30:48.090
submission,
like say if he uh,
he got the back,
got the hooks in,

1673
01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.190
he's over the chin,
but he's,

1674
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.980
he's trying to choke the guy and it's not quite in yet.
It's called catch.

1675
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.770
And what catches like it's really close.
It's really close.

1676
01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:58.290
It's like this is a near submission and that counts as points.

1677
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:02.310
Why don't they make the judges have to be x fighters or at least have black

1678
01:31:02.311 --> 01:31:05.090
belts and they're not allowed to play angry birds.
I mean,

1679
01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.970
let them do something that's absolutely 100% what I've been saying,

1680
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:12.360
what I've been saying for a long time is that there's a lot of fans as well and

1681
01:31:12.361 --> 01:31:14.910
people that train as well that would love to do it.

1682
01:31:14.911 --> 01:31:18.630
But the problem is is that the waste state athletic commissions are like,

1683
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:22.650
they're just like working for the government and it's really hard to get fired.

1684
01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:25.760
Super hard to get fired.
And,
um,
they,
they,

1685
01:31:25.770 --> 01:31:30.090
everybody wants to think that there's no problem and everybody wants to say,
oh,

1686
01:31:30.091 --> 01:31:32.020
we're doing our best.
And everybody,
you know,

1687
01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.850
doesn't agree on fights and these are good judges and no they're not.
They don't,

1688
01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:38.790
there's a lot of shit they don't know.
A lot of them come over from boxing.

1689
01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:42.120
They literally have no experience and no training in this sport other than

1690
01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:45.250
people explaining to them what these moves are and then they have to judge them.

1691
01:31:45.251 --> 01:31:48.150
But it's the highest levels of the game.
It's so hard to know where you stand.

1692
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:51.630
If judge can be two rounds off,
it's terrible.
I mean,
someone could be like,

1693
01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:54.600
I won those two rounds.
Someone else,
like I won those two rounds.
Yeah.

1694
01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.810
And there's some of them,
there's some of them that really,
really suck.

1695
01:31:57.870 --> 01:32:00.160
There's some of them that really have no idea what they're doing.

1696
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.390
<v 6>Then I've,
I have friends who are judges who have told me in frustration that,</v>

1697
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:04.600
you know,

1698
01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.130
certain women judges have actually turned to them in the middle of fights while

1699
01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:10.390
guy was obviously attempting a certain position,

1700
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:13.090
like a Kamora or something like that and said,
what is this?
What is he doing?

1701
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.630
What is he doing?
Like she literally,
it's like your girlfriend judging a fight.

1702
01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:18.820
You know what I'm saying?
Like she doesn't know what's happening.

1703
01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:21.570
He's got cute hair.
He totally wins.
And what my,

1704
01:32:21.571 --> 01:32:25.150
my point audit and the reason why I said it is because one of my biggest issues

1705
01:32:25.151 --> 01:32:27.580
is that the guy who's the president of the staff,

1706
01:32:27.690 --> 01:32:30.040
the Nevada state athletic commission,
the guys were running everything.

1707
01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:34.570
He's not willing to admit that he has not done the best job possible with the

1708
01:32:34.571 --> 01:32:37.240
best intentions of the sport and its participants.

1709
01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.740
He has not done the best job possible he's at,

1710
01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.880
he's trying to pretend that the people that he has in place are fine and that

1711
01:32:42.881 --> 01:32:44.530
everything's good and it's not good.

1712
01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.090
Who says boss bad decision after bad decision after bad decision with no change.

1713
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:52.570
Because in order to make a change,
he has to admit that there's a problem.

1714
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:54.730
And if he admits it is a problem,
then he admits he's wrong.

1715
01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.500
And that's something that politicians never want to do.

1716
01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:58.300
So he tries to pretend that everything's fine,

1717
01:32:58.301 --> 01:33:02.230
so he keeps point in the same people with the same problems and we want same guy

1718
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:03.310
forever.
Yeah,

1719
01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:05.770
the State Athletic Commission Guy has been the same from Keith Pfizer.

1720
01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.320
And who's his boss?
Anybody?
I don't know.
I don't know who it is,
but you know,

1721
01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:10.450
people are emailing man,
people going crazy after this one.

1722
01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.430
We need to find out who his boss is,
get his Twitter.

1723
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:14.740
The online community is taken care of.
Everything down.

1724
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:17.460
The online community is beyond pissed that all this,

1725
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:21.160
these people are huge fans and these people appreciate what all these fighters

1726
01:33:21.161 --> 01:33:24.490
have to go through that there's a massive fucking commitment involved and trying

1727
01:33:24.491 --> 01:33:25.690
to be a professional MMA fighter.

1728
01:33:25.691 --> 01:33:29.170
And the last thing they should have to deal with at this level of the game is a

1729
01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:32.260
bunch of people judging the fights that don't know what's going on.

1730
01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:35.380
It's one thing if it's a subjective opinion and the,
you know,

1731
01:33:35.381 --> 01:33:36.220
there's one guy that says,

1732
01:33:36.221 --> 01:33:39.670
I think that leg kicks don't count as much as head punches cause head punches,

1733
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:42.100
you know,
you know,
can knock you out.
Leg Kicks,
it takes a bunch of them.

1734
01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:45.580
There's a lot of subjective,
you know,
arguments about what's more,
you know,

1735
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:49.510
what's,
you know,
what's worth more take down or you know,
a good jab.
You know,

1736
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:50.344
what is worth more.

1737
01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.630
If God takes you down and he doesn't really do anything when he gets you down,

1738
01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:55.090
but you hit him with a stiff jab and his nose is bleeding.

1739
01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:58.080
Isn't the stiff jab worth more?
What is worth more?
It's a,

1740
01:33:58.081 --> 01:34:01.000
it's an interesting debate,
but this isn't a debate man.
This is like,

1741
01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:03.450
people don't know shit.
They just don't know.

1742
01:34:03.451 --> 01:34:08.020
And it's crazy to watch and it's crazy to watch this guy who's at the head of

1743
01:34:08.021 --> 01:34:11.560
the state athletic commission pretend that it's not a problem.
It's fine.

1744
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:14.150
It's Nevada is,
look,
it's not just a lot of,

1745
01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:17.260
there's issues with other states in the other states will grow with mixed

1746
01:34:17.261 --> 01:34:20.020
martial arts is of new sport and a lot of these states they're starting to put

1747
01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:22.150
their athletic commissions together and they're trying to piece it together and

1748
01:34:22.151 --> 01:34:23.230
they're trying to do the right thing.

1749
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:26.200
Boston is doing a real good job and one of the guys in the commission is

1750
01:34:26.201 --> 01:34:29.470
actually my f my former karate teacher,
Scott Joe Esposito.

1751
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.780
So there's a lot of martial artists.
That's what you want.

1752
01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:33.850
You want people that are real,
real fans of the sport.

1753
01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:35.770
I don't believe this guy's a fan of the sport.

1754
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:38.920
I believe this guy is a politician and I don't believe it.
That's good for,

1755
01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:39.813
for what we need.

1756
01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:43.570
I think what's going on is that we have a bunch of people that were

1757
01:34:43.571 --> 01:34:45.160
grandfathered in from boxing.

1758
01:34:45.161 --> 01:34:47.380
So there are all these people that worked for the State Athletic Commission.

1759
01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.950
They're judging boxing fights and now they say,
well okay this is boxing.

1760
01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.180
But there's a bunch of other stuff going on too.

1761
01:34:52.181 --> 01:34:55.450
Like take downs and that's like you see someone coming up to me and saying,

1762
01:34:55.451 --> 01:34:59.270
hey dude,
you are a,
you are a commentator on mixed martial arts,
right?

1763
01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.750
We want you to start commentating on football.
Right?
And you'd be like,
well,

1764
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:04.640
I don't know anything about football.
Well,
they hit each other,

1765
01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:07.760
they slam into each other and it's violent.
Nothing you do do that thing you do.

1766
01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.450
Exactly.
And I'd be like,
what do I have to do?
I have to judge football shit.
Uh,

1767
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:14.780
did he do the right thing?
And you know,
you don't,
you don't fucking,

1768
01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:16.070
you don't understand the sport,
man.

1769
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.840
You've got to understand the sport to be judging it.

1770
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:20.480
You have to participate in it.
You have to have trained,

1771
01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:24.070
you have to have some experience.
You have to know the line.
It just makes sense.

1772
01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.700
There's some classes going,
got another housewives.

1773
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.540
But if they don't know this is the training,

1774
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:31.550
take them to a gym and show in the movie.
Exactly.

1775
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.130
It's not just showing the moves,
man,
I think you need to train.

1776
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:37.010
And I don't think we,
I think there's plenty of fucking people out there.

1777
01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:39.350
They have,
there's x fighters,
there's,
there's,

1778
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:42.770
there's people that are just big fans of the sport that understand all the

1779
01:35:42.771 --> 01:35:44.030
aspects of it,
the ground game,

1780
01:35:44.031 --> 01:35:47.480
the standup game and you have to have that and you,
most importantly,

1781
01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:51.620
you have to have a very deep and sincere appreciation of what these guys go

1782
01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:54.800
through and how much they're putting out there,
what they're laying on the line.

1783
01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.030
And in my opinion,

1784
01:35:56.031 --> 01:36:00.260
when you keep using week officials and you keep having problems with,

1785
01:36:00.261 --> 01:36:03.170
with judging,
you're not respecting what these guys are doing.

1786
01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:06.320
There's a sport a little bit does hurt the sport.
Kind of a bad booze was like,

1787
01:36:06.321 --> 01:36:08.780
wait,
yes,
that seems cheap.
Exactly.

1788
01:36:08.781 --> 01:36:11.660
Seed rigged and that's why I had to say it man.
And they're like,

1789
01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:13.250
well why'd you have to say that?
That's not professional.

1790
01:36:13.251 --> 01:36:16.880
It's absolutely professional.
You have to say it.
If I don't say it,

1791
01:36:16.881 --> 01:36:20.270
it's not professional.
I don't if who's going to say it,
if I don't know buddy,

1792
01:36:20.271 --> 01:36:22.700
we just going to stick our head in the sand and pretend is not an issue.

1793
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.620
These people that are watching this at home,
they'll start screaming.

1794
01:36:25.621 --> 01:36:29.040
The UFC is fixed.
It's like fucking wrestling.
It's like boxing.
It's bullshits.

1795
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:32.620
Fear can get into if you don't know who's ahead.
Exactly.
So I had to let,

1796
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:35.120
I had to let people know that it's not fixed.

1797
01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:38.660
It's incompetence and they want to continue the way it's the way it's always

1798
01:36:38.661 --> 01:36:40.670
been and they don't want me talking about it.
It's hilarious.

1799
01:36:40.671 --> 01:36:41.690
The whole thing's hilarious.

1800
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:45.660
<v 3>Picking up hilarious.
Speaking of Hillary,
I have a show tonight.
Yes.</v>

1801
01:36:45.661 --> 01:36:48.000
The Melrose Improv.
Fascinating and hilarious.

1802
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:51.260
It's a storyteller show and Joe Diaz is performing as well.
That's right.

1803
01:36:51.810 --> 01:36:52.800
<v 6>What are you talking about Joey?</v>

1804
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:57.510
It's a story when ours does these really interesting shows at the Improv lab and

1805
01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.650
what it is is that there's a,

1806
01:36:58.651 --> 01:37:01.710
the Improv on Melrose and there's another room right next to it that's the lab

1807
01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.940
and it's all like X.
I've done it a couple times.
It's all like experimental shit.

1808
01:37:06.090 --> 01:37:09.650
Like dudes just go up and tell stories about things.
Some guys try to do standup,

1809
01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:12.710
<v 3>some guys do,
but some guys just live,
live and up there at the pump,</v>

1810
01:37:12.711 --> 01:37:15.860
the fuck story ones huff because everyone has fucked stories as bits.
You know,

1811
01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:19.290
there was a few guys I walked in on,
I'm like,
this guy's like a violating this,

1812
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:20.010
the principal,

1813
01:37:20.010 --> 01:37:23.510
this guy's doing his act like with all the pauses in the right places and like,

1814
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.891
but you know,

1815
01:37:24.891 --> 01:37:27.410
some people just went up and tell stories or Tommy Chong told the story about

1816
01:37:27.411 --> 01:37:30.640
how he got arrested and held it got complacent and stuff about drugs and,

1817
01:37:30.641 --> 01:37:33.800
and you know,
in airports and stuff,
which is really interesting.

1818
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:37.770
It's on the lineup.
The lineup is Bill Burr,
Joey Diaz.
Um,

1819
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:42.560
Kathleen Madigan.
Nice.
Bobby Lee.
Nice.
Um,

1820
01:37:42.710 --> 01:37:45.560
and Steve Agee soon,
something like that.
Go wrong with that.

1821
01:37:45.561 --> 01:37:49.460
That's five bucks and it's $5.
It's only $5.
It's tonight at eight o'clock.

1822
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:50.750
And how do they get tickets?

1823
01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:54.830
You can go to the improv.com and look for the Hollywood and if you want to go,

1824
01:37:54.831 --> 01:37:56.010
don't get tickets

1825
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.680
<v 0>now cause we're talking about this shit.
A lot of people are listening.</v>

1826
01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.330
A lot of people are gonna hear about it on Twitter.

1827
01:38:00.331 --> 01:38:02.290
It's gonna sell out tonight because it's only like,
what is it?

1828
01:38:02.291 --> 01:38:04.320
Like a hundred seats at Roswell?
It's going to be the main room.

1829
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.430
Oh you're doing in the main room?
Yeah,
they moved it over.
Shit.

1830
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.950
That's how big it is.
Bitches.
This shit's getting lodge.

1831
01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.600
Could go in there and there's a code to get cheaper.
Um,
service charges.

1832
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:20.430
T.
I.
N.
H.
P.
This is not happening.
Presents,
that's the name I n.

1833
01:38:20.431 --> 01:38:23.940
H.
P.
Yeah.
How much cheaper or the drinks if they say that and other drinks,

1834
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:26.370
that service charge.
If you buy the tickets online,

1835
01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:28.530
there's an extra $3 or $5 ticket.

1836
01:38:28.531 --> 01:38:31.170
And I told you three extra per ticket and I'm like,
what the fuck is that?

1837
01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:32.960
And they were like,
all right,
well we'll offer you this.

1838
01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.640
Some sort of keep getting what w why would it cost them $3?

1839
01:38:37.641 --> 01:38:41.700
It's process.
A credit left,
settled,
anything under like 20 bucks cost that much.

1840
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:45.270
It's it's modem fee for service fees when you're using a computer.

1841
01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:48.480
No one's doing it.
Exactly.
I print out my own ticket.

1842
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:52.710
What service supposed to be the whole thing.
I mean you are paying taxes on it,

1843
01:38:52.711 --> 01:38:56.200
aren't you?
Don't you pay taxes on tickets?
Yeah.
It's part of the why.

1844
01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:59.790
I don't have to be a service fee.
Well into the ticket ropes.

1845
01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:03.770
Cops that an that was I,

1846
01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:07.740
there's people are greedy man.
People.
People just want too much money for shit.

1847
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:11.910
Yeah.
Yeah.
T you know,
you're not supposed to get rich selling tickets as whole,

1848
01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:13.180
you know you ain't [inaudible].

1849
01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.990
All you're doing is like providing people with a little piece of paper that gets

1850
01:39:15.991 --> 01:39:17.940
them into the show.
The show is where it's at,

1851
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.520
so you shouldn't be getting almost as much as the show.

1852
01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:23.910
The show's getting five bucks.
You get three.
Fuck you douchebags yeah.

1853
01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:27.390
That's when it doesn't work out.
It's ridiculous.
Is that code?
It's only a dollar.

1854
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:29.490
So this is not happening.

1855
01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:34.610
Is that happening and HP p the shows the year in or we're just doing all the

1856
01:39:34.831 --> 01:39:35.730
topics we've done so far.

1857
01:39:35.731 --> 01:39:38.850
What are you talking about tonight is I got a few ideas,

1858
01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:41.920
having a few ideas.
I haven't really,

1859
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.770
I haven't really gone deep with them.
Give them yet.
You know what I'm saying?

1860
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:50.700
You've got so many God damn stories never met a human being that has more stores

1861
01:39:50.701 --> 01:39:53.580
than you today.
You told new ones.
I didn't think you had any new ones.

1862
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:56.490
I've known you for over a decade and every fucking die we've talked to as a new

1863
01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:59.820
one comes out,
man bro.
He remembers.
I don't know how you do it.

1864
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:02.280
I don't know how you view your life.
Must've been insane.

1865
01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:05.970
Your life growing up as a kid must've been just fucking completely insane.

1866
01:40:06.170 --> 01:40:10.240
The amount of stories that you have.
I love it.
Talk Good.
I love it.
Cock sucker.

1867
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:13.870
Hey,
have you guys been paying attention to this wikileaks shit?
Yeah,

1868
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:16.960
they arrested the guy for having sex without a condom.
Is that what it was like?

1869
01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:19.710
I should so fake that he's going to be dead in like three days.

1870
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:22.180
They arrested him on a charge and sweating bullets.

1871
01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.410
It's somehow similar to rape to not,

1872
01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.070
it's something that it's like charging somebody sodomy here if you have sex

1873
01:40:29.071 --> 01:40:33.450
without a condom.
Unconsensually no,
it was consensual.
Yeah.
Twice.

1874
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.550
Two girls [inaudible] restaurants trying to kill this guy or give him some drug

1875
01:40:38.551 --> 01:40:42.660
or touch his penis,
but I didn't know that that's what the charge was.

1876
01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:45.360
I thought it was like sexual assault or something like that.
They trumped up.

1877
01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:49.890
Really?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
No,
I'm not sure.

1878
01:40:49.891 --> 01:40:52.890
I don't even know if the guy real name,
I don't know what anything is.

1879
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.010
Get your magic if it's not even

1880
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.130
<v 6>real.
He's just like an actor that they using to get all this information out.</v>

1881
01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.020
The whole thing.
It's very strange,
man,

1882
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:01.420
to releasing all these secrets about China.
They're all,

1883
01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:03.670
all these Chinese studies that they're doing,
man,

1884
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:08.140
and one of them was quantum teleportation.
Whoa,
cool.
Quantum communication.

1885
01:41:08.141 --> 01:41:11.320
I guess it's not as like space 1999 is we're wrap our heads around.

1886
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:14.500
It's not like star Trek.
We were teleporting things from one place to another.

1887
01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.150
They're working on some,

1888
01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:19.570
some way of distributing information where it only exists in one place,

1889
01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:24.460
then you can transport it to another place.
It's like it totally,
uh,
undecided.

1890
01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:27.370
Uncrackable the idea is that you could have like,
you know,

1891
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.330
you could send information,

1892
01:41:28.331 --> 01:41:31.090
not have to worry about anybody picking it up along the way.
You know,

1893
01:41:31.091 --> 01:41:34.630
this whole thing happened because there was an employee that brought in a lady

1894
01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:39.631
Gaga CD and it looked like he was just fucking playing music on his computer and

1895
01:41:40.151 --> 01:41:43.150
this motherfucker was just downloading shit onto this,

1896
01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:47.080
this CDR with lady Gaga written on it.
Wow.
Yeah.

1897
01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:50.470
That's what happened man.
The whole thing is very fascinating.

1898
01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:55.010
91,000 classified U s military documents were dumped last week.

1899
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:58.180
Just saying fuck it.
Everybody know this guy just,
I don't know,

1900
01:41:58.181 --> 01:42:00.270
I don't know how it all got started.
I'm,
but I'm,

1901
01:42:00.271 --> 01:42:03.730
I'm fascinated to have heard a story on NPR about it and they said they have

1902
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:04.720
pled pleaded with him.

1903
01:42:04.721 --> 01:42:07.330
Sometimes we're like about certain things like don't release this.

1904
01:42:07.331 --> 01:42:09.370
And he's listened to them a couple times where it's like,
okay,

1905
01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.610
you've made a point,
this will hurt people.
I'm going to not release that.

1906
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:15.830
Has He done that?
Won't release a few things where it fits.

1907
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:19.840
It'll just lead to someone's harm and no one needs that information.
Man.

1908
01:42:19.841 --> 01:42:21.930
The whole thing is such a trip,
you know,
it's,

1909
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:25.830
we're finding out how they communicate and how they,
uh,
talk about,
uh,

1910
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:28.930
different parts of the world and all the different problems that people have.

1911
01:42:29.150 --> 01:42:32.230
Yeah.
Here's one of them.
A Texas company,

1912
01:42:32.231 --> 01:42:36.370
they're saying help pimp little boys to a Afghany cops.

1913
01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:37.820
This is really crazy.

1914
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:41.470
That's to be released to hurt besides the people who are doing stuff.
Yeah.

1915
01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:45.850
The company's called Din core private security contractor tasked with training

1916
01:42:45.851 --> 01:42:49.630
the Afghan police,
the companies officially based in DC area.

1917
01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:53.800
Most of his businesses managed on a satellite campus at alliance airport,

1918
01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:55.120
north of Fort Worth.

1919
01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:59.470
And one of the diplomatic cables from the wikileaks archives is to be believed.

1920
01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:03.040
These guys apparently are,
this is somebody,

1921
01:43:03.190 --> 01:43:06.880
this guy named Hans von posted this on the Rogan board.
This,
um,

1922
01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:10.150
the apparently were bringing in boys,

1923
01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:15.130
this is fucking crazy man.
And yet you gotta think,
man,
look,
there's,

1924
01:43:15.131 --> 01:43:18.730
if you know anything about Afghanistan that is the tradition there.

1925
01:43:18.731 --> 01:43:21.280
It's been going on for a long,
long time.
They have sex with boys.

1926
01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:25.150
It's like guys who have gone over there,
I've talked to military guys will do,

1927
01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.550
especially when we do these,
um,
fight for the troops.

1928
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:29.050
You can get a long time to talk to these dudes.

1929
01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.280
And this guy was telling me about catching guys fucking like you would just in

1930
01:43:33.281 --> 01:43:35.800
Afghanistan,
they would just catch guys fucking like,

1931
01:43:35.801 --> 01:43:39.380
that'd be a on on patrol or they'd be doing something and they'd be,
you know,

1932
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.290
soldiers will be fucking,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Two Afghanis.

1933
01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:43.750
They're just banging each other.

1934
01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:46.210
Like they're just pull over somewhere and then just,
you know,

1935
01:43:46.211 --> 01:43:48.100
they're behind a fucking fence,
fucking each other,

1936
01:43:48.110 --> 01:43:50.140
sucking each other's cocks or something.
He's like,

1937
01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:52.190
it's like they have sex with boys all the time

1938
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.230
<v 0>over there.
It's apparently just,
you know,</v>

1939
01:43:54.231 --> 01:43:56.840
you hear about it like from the Greek empire and the Roman Empire will

1940
01:43:56.841 --> 01:43:59.330
apparently,
it's still going on in certain parts of things like,
okay,

1941
01:43:59.331 --> 01:44:01.790
you might make a call where it's like that's acceptable in their society,

1942
01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:05.180
so we're going to allow it,
but you shouldn't hide it.
Yeah.
Little Boys,
man,

1943
01:44:05.181 --> 01:44:07.130
like young boys.
It's like super common.

1944
01:44:07.131 --> 01:44:10.170
Apparently they spoke a lot of pot to the Afghani soldiers,
so this company,

1945
01:44:10.171 --> 01:44:14.030
then we ship it to the kids at where they shipping them out of Texas to have

1946
01:44:14.031 --> 01:44:16.400
Gail feel American boys.
I know.
That's a good question.

1947
01:44:16.401 --> 01:44:20.360
I didn't read the whole story.
No Way.
Yeah,
that'd be,
that'd be nuts.
No,

1948
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.700
to be Afghani boys,
I would assume.
Right.

1949
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:27.950
Did they charge a service fee of you order online for those who can't get the

1950
01:44:27.951 --> 01:44:29.710
clothes for free by Baka.

1951
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.720
Bazi is a pre Islamic Afghan tradition that was banned by the Taliban and Baka

1952
01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.480
Boyz r eight to 15 years old.
They put on makeup,

1953
01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:42.710
they tied bells to their feet and they slip,
slip into scanty women's clothing.

1954
01:44:42.711 --> 01:44:46.370
And then to the wine of harmonium and wailing vocals,
they dance.

1955
01:44:46.371 --> 01:44:49.580
Abductive doctor [inaudible] to smokey roomfuls of leering older men.

1956
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:53.540
This is what this Guy Hans von wrote.
That's fucking crazy,
man.

1957
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:57.560
Wow.
There's no shame in having a little boy lover on the contrary.

1958
01:44:57.590 --> 01:45:01.430
It's a matter of pride.
Those who can afford the most attractive boy,
our players,

1959
01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:04.700
the ogs of places like Kandahar and coast.
How old's the boy?

1960
01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:09.230
It's a frontline vape eight to 15,
eight to 15.
And I could sort of see,

1961
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:12.080
you know what dude,
we,
we've talked about this before,

1962
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:14.880
but you people get used to everything.
You know,

1963
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:17.990
people get used to whatever the culture is around you.

1964
01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:22.220
You get used to the crazy traditions that people have as far as like,
you know,

1965
01:45:22.221 --> 01:45:25.190
when I was in,
um,
um,
uh,
Germany,

1966
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:30.310
they had a television channel that was,
uh,
it was the,
the Hodge on,
uh,
Mecca,

1967
01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.960
if that's how you say it,
the Hodge [inaudible].
Anyway,

1968
01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.130
it's on TV at 25 Mecca Cam.
Oh.
And there's a,
if you've ever seen Mecca,

1969
01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:38.360
there's like a building.

1970
01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:43.070
It's like this a flat box that's in the center and all these people are milling

1971
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:45.290
around this.
And I'm looking at this and I'm like,

1972
01:45:45.291 --> 01:45:48.080
you could if you started this up tomorrow.
And he said,
hey,
you know,

1973
01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:51.350
this is what we're doing.
We're going to all meet in this one super secret,

1974
01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:52.213
cool spot.

1975
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:54.680
And we're going to start walking around in a circle where people would start

1976
01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:57.530
going,
well,
what's in that box?
Why am I walking around this?
This is stupid.

1977
01:45:57.531 --> 01:46:00.020
Why do I have to wear this white robe?
What's in the box?
Exactly?
What is it?

1978
01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:00.920
I Dunno.
I have no idea.

1979
01:46:01.190 --> 01:46:05.090
But the point is that it's been done for so long that doing,
it's normal.

1980
01:46:05.170 --> 01:46:07.850
It's just normal.
It's just the thing we did.
So if it's,

1981
01:46:07.851 --> 01:46:11.300
if it's banging kids or if it's a everybody banks,
kids,
okay,

1982
01:46:11.301 --> 01:46:12.890
I'll get a kid to bang.
You know,
what does it,

1983
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:16.730
you know that those African women that like fucking stuff plates in their lips

1984
01:46:16.731 --> 01:46:19.940
or those Thai people that like stick fucking swords through their faces.

1985
01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:22.400
Why do they do that?
Because they're all doing it.
Everybody's done it.

1986
01:46:22.401 --> 01:46:23.780
So you do it too.
You know,

1987
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:25.910
there's a lot of follow the leader going on with people,
man.

1988
01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:30.380
And somehow or another,
if,
if they all decide that banging kids is okay,

1989
01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.500
then it's okay then it's okay.
Yeah.
Dog findings.
Okay.
And a lot of cultures,

1990
01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:36.230
a lot of cultures.
And how can you blame somebody?

1991
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:37.910
All the Indians would come over here like,
wait,

1992
01:46:37.911 --> 01:46:40.370
you're not allowed to have sex with a 17 year old?
I don't understand.
Yeah,

1993
01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:45.140
I don't know about that.
You know,
my um,
my gardener,
my ex gardener actually,
um,

1994
01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:47.420
used to fight chickens and he took them,

1995
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:55.230
um,
that's illegal too.
He used to fight chickens.

1996
01:46:55.380 --> 01:47:00.090
So,
uh,
he took me to why he does not the guy that works for me now.
So,
um,

1997
01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:02.550
he used to fight chickens and he took me to,
uh,
you know,

1998
01:47:02.551 --> 01:47:06.210
like chicken buddy's house.
Yeah.
They had,
this guy has a whole backyard set up.

1999
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:10.320
It's in the most Mexican neighborhood of La.
You've ever been to ever?

2000
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:11.431
I don't want to say where it is,

2001
01:47:11.431 --> 01:47:15.180
but you get there and all the signs are in Spanish,
Bro.
Everything's in Spanish.

2002
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:19.620
Everyone's Mexican for blocks and blocks and blocks and every one's got

2003
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:21.660
chickens.
The whole backyard.

2004
01:47:22.150 --> 01:47:25.070
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

2005
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.190
<v 0>everywhere you go is by pit bulls and chickens.</v>

2006
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:32.820
These motherfuckers had pit bulls and chickens and mind my gardener,

2007
01:47:32.821 --> 01:47:34.330
I gave him one of my pit bull puppies.

2008
01:47:34.331 --> 01:47:37.260
So he had one of Frank's puppies turned out to be a crazy dog.

2009
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:41.370
That's a long story.
And uh,
he's got like fucking 20 chickens in his backyard.

2010
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:44.310
Wow.
This guys would go and they would get hammered and they would,
uh,

2011
01:47:44.311 --> 01:47:48.210
they would roast a goat.
That's what they do that kill a goat.
And they would,
uh,

2012
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.320
put a fire on the ground,
put the goat on a spit role,
the goat around a barbecue,

2013
01:47:52.321 --> 01:47:55.830
and then they'd start chicken fights and they would get fucking hammered and

2014
01:47:55.831 --> 01:47:57.990
they'd all get together in this guy had a giant yard.

2015
01:47:57.991 --> 01:48:01.740
It was all set up with chicken like breeding.
That sounds fun to me.

2016
01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:05.190
It does sound fun.
Barbecued booze and just what people like,
what are you doing?

2017
01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:09.780
It's cruelty to animals and forcing these animals to fight each other,
I guess.

2018
01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:12.660
But you know how come it's okay to eat them,

2019
01:48:12.810 --> 01:48:15.840
but it's not okay to watch them beat the fuck out of each other?
Yeah.

2020
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:17.580
Isn't that what they want to do?
The kill him?

2021
01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:19.770
I guess the problem is also they give razor blades.

2022
01:48:19.771 --> 01:48:22.940
They put razor blades on their spurs.
Oh yeah,
they don't,
I mean,

2023
01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:26.640
they don't cut each other up because of their beaks.
That shit forever.
Wow.
Yeah.

2024
01:48:26.641 --> 01:48:30.120
They totally fix it.
The way they fight.
It's kind of harmless.
I mean,
they can,

2025
01:48:30.150 --> 01:48:32.970
they can occur,
hurt each other eventually,
but take it going to take some time.

2026
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.160
So they put razor blades on their sperm.
They put spurs on their paws clawing.

2027
01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.180
Another one,
you just chop it up.
Obviously.

2028
01:48:39.181 --> 01:48:40.500
I don't think you should have chicken fights,

2029
01:48:40.501 --> 01:48:43.770
but for them it's a huge part of their culture and it's a lot of fucking fun and

2030
01:48:43.771 --> 01:48:46.530
they love it.
And the gamble on it.
They'll get together and you know,

2031
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:50.100
he would tell me about the different strains of rooster about his friend has

2032
01:48:50.101 --> 01:48:51.060
this new strain.

2033
01:48:51.061 --> 01:48:54.180
It's like championship fighting strain and he brought it in and the,

2034
01:48:54.181 --> 01:48:54.830
he brought this,

2035
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:57.000
the rooster and they showed me the rooster like take into the cage.

2036
01:48:57.150 --> 01:49:00.110
He's a bad motherfucker.
You see this roof too?
So I'll send you Ian Shit.

2037
01:49:00.370 --> 01:49:02.400
We'll do you know what fucking evil.
Look in his eyes.

2038
01:49:02.401 --> 01:49:06.660
You could tell Lowe's is good genetics.
Wow.
Prime Brewster assassin genetics.

2039
01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.480
If chicken bites we of growing up.
No,

2040
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:13.640
I see them towards the stock sites got price.

2041
01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.750
That's what they call man.
Yeah.

2042
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:19.500
Roy Jones Jr apparently he likes to fight chickens.
Really?
Yeah.

2043
01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:21.900
If somebody's telling me a story about him when he was in the prime of his

2044
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:25.290
career,
when Roy Jones like Roy Jones,
you know,
it's like dominating everybody.

2045
01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:28.740
He was in a private jet and he had to stop over somewhere to pick up some

2046
01:49:28.741 --> 01:49:29.574
chickens.

2047
01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:33.510
So he stopped over and they're flying in a private jet with Roy Jones and his

2048
01:49:33.511 --> 01:49:38.340
boxes of chicken all over the place.
On a fucking private jet.

2049
01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:42.450
Roy Jones is chilling with his fucking,
with as Nike's on and Shit.
Wow.

2050
01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:45.630
Diamonds and shit with chickens.
He just likes chicken fights,

2051
01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:47.880
man who doesn't.

2052
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.360
It's a strange thing that you know the want the need to bet on animals chip

2053
01:49:52.361 --> 01:49:56.860
fighting to thrill.
Yeah,
it is.
Well,
it's like,
you know the fix is not in,

2054
01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:59.470
they're going to go for it.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's true too.

2055
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.960
But when you see the chickens fight and you see these people that are there,

2056
01:50:01.961 --> 01:50:06.050
these people are scary.
Oh yeah.
Oh,
it's not OTB bitch.
No,
this is it.

2057
01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:08.940
A little level of deeper than Otb Oh,
Turkey bettering.

2058
01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:12.100
You'll take off track betting on the closed TB in New York.

2059
01:50:12.150 --> 01:50:13.660
Why close their bridge though?
The one,

2060
01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.910
did you see what was a thousand them all over?

2061
01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:20.680
They try to get legislatures some shit on showing that people gamble.
God dammit.

2062
01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:23.710
[inaudible] how many people out there are what?

2063
01:50:23.711 --> 01:50:25.810
They should let people gamble online.

2064
01:50:25.930 --> 01:50:29.050
They should let people gamble in pool halls,
in bowling alleys.

2065
01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:32.530
Gambling is fun and she'd be completely,
totally legal.

2066
01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:36.520
And the idea behind it is that,
oh,
people get addicted to gambling.

2067
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:39.520
Dean use people get addicted to anything to get the ice.

2068
01:50:39.521 --> 01:50:43.600
I've been addicted to Q tips.
You know,
should q-tips be illegal?
C'Mon man,

2069
01:50:43.601 --> 01:50:45.450
this is stupid.
Let him gamble.
God dammit.

2070
01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:49.120
I see Otb cause one person to tell you what you can and can't do with your
money.

2071
01:50:49.121 --> 01:50:52.750
That's where your money just tax it.
Tax Id.

2072
01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:55.090
And if it's a personal thing between two people like plan,

2073
01:50:55.230 --> 01:50:58.000
like guys who play basketball,
there should be a little LR to gamble.

2074
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.500
It's kind of fun.
I can tell you in a whole DVD,
I don't to pay taxes on that.

2075
01:51:02.501 --> 01:51:06.910
It's like why are you probably are [inaudible] claim it?

2076
01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:10.990
Wow.
I think you should be able to gamble on whenever the fuck you want.

2077
01:51:10.991 --> 01:51:14.290
It's not even,
you shouldn't have,
it's not income man.
You know why?

2078
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:15.430
Because when you work you,

2079
01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:19.780
you earn something and that's income professional gamers,
they pay income taxes.

2080
01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:22.060
Yeah,
but that's different.
That's a job.
You know what I'm saying?

2081
01:51:22.061 --> 01:51:24.700
I mean these guys are entering into professionally run tournaments and shit,

2082
01:51:24.701 --> 01:51:28.960
but what I'm saying is if you're betting 20 bucks and against against another

2083
01:51:28.961 --> 01:51:31.450
guy who's also betting 20 bucks,
when you win that 20 bucks,

2084
01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:35.890
you shouldn't have to pay taxes on it because you risk $20 to make $20 you know

2085
01:51:35.891 --> 01:51:38.550
what I'm saying?
Kill.
Yeah.

2086
01:51:38.590 --> 01:51:41.150
It's not like charging points are in their entry fee.

2087
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:45.000
Pay 50 grand to get into the world series of poker with all winter.
Exactly.

2088
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.890
Lose it all or winner.

2089
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:50.770
It's not like pay 50 bucks to win 5,000,002 dudes putting them both up.
Yeah.

2090
01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:53.590
What?
Like what does it cost when you go into the world or series of poker?

2091
01:51:53.591 --> 01:51:57.970
It's not cheap,
right?
10 grand,
$10,000 God damn,
you gotta be a player.

2092
01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.900
You've got to be a player to step up and throw 10 grand at a game that you're

2093
01:52:00.901 --> 01:52:01.734
probably not going to win.

2094
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:04.630
I'm probably like 9,590 700 that goes to the prize pool.

2095
01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.820
My friend Justin from the action report.com.

2096
01:52:06.821 --> 01:52:10.790
He's a guy that you met the big giant barely do who uh,
who does the um,

2097
01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.540
all the live streams for a pool matches and shit.

2098
01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:16.000
And he was talking to me about about poker players.

2099
01:52:16.110 --> 01:52:19.420
Amount of poker players are starting to gamble on pool now over as poker
players.

2100
01:52:19.421 --> 01:52:23.600
Don't give a fuck about $10,000.
$10,000 isn't shit to them,
to a pool player.

2101
01:52:23.601 --> 01:52:26.620
It's a big score.
So these poker players,
when they're bored,

2102
01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.570
there's this one guy named tippy Dave,

2103
01:52:28.571 --> 01:52:31.600
he's like the rage of the fucking pool community cause he's going off,

2104
01:52:31.630 --> 01:52:36.550
he's like losing 20,000,
30,000 there and he just won 80,000.
He beat this guy,

2105
01:52:36.551 --> 01:52:39.040
Alex Pangolin is just top level Filipino player.

2106
01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:42.840
A lot of the best players are from the Philippines.
I top level Filipino player.

2107
01:52:42.841 --> 01:52:44.830
He beat him for 80,000.
And everybody's going crazy.

2108
01:52:45.130 --> 01:52:46.130
This guys like willing to place

2109
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:47.630
<v 6>it,
but they gave him a crazy spot.</v>

2110
01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:51.170
They play a game called one pocket and instead of like having an even number

2111
01:52:51.171 --> 01:52:52.910
balls,
they need to get in each other's pocket.

2112
01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.200
The Filipino guy has to get 18 and he has to get four to make it somewhat even

2113
01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:00.140
so ridiculous spot.
It's not real happy very well that game.
Then it's like,

2114
01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:02.090
exactly.
So he's winning.
He's winning some of the,

2115
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:05.780
some of the matches go into some of the money,
but you know these poker players,

2116
01:53:05.781 --> 01:53:06.410
man there,

2117
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:11.240
they used to gamble in like $1 million on this and a million dollars on that.

2118
01:53:11.241 --> 01:53:13.520
And that book that you told me to read,

2119
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:18.140
I bought it about that guy who was the really Felix Unger.
What's his name?

2120
01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:22.850
Stuart Stuart Hunger.
Fuck.
Steve Unger.
Unger poker.
All right,

2121
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:27.120
let's find out real quick.
Through hunger,
through the lava lamp,

2122
01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:30.620
making tons of money.
Lost it all.
Fucking live in large.
Yeah.

2123
01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:32.390
Want a ton of money again lost at all.

2124
01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:35.180
Well that's the deal with all these guys are crazy,

2125
01:53:35.181 --> 01:53:39.230
crazy like wild gamblers.
Like the,
the best guys.

2126
01:53:39.231 --> 01:53:40.470
Apparently one of the,
the,

2127
01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.220
the attributes they have is they're not afraid to lose.
So they,

2128
01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.950
that's how they win.
They just throw money at shit and they like,

2129
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:50.570
see what happens.
Alex Pal line,
this guy wins $30,000 playing poker.
Okay.

2130
01:53:50.630 --> 01:53:53.450
He's just like kicking everybody's ass playing poker.
He gets his money up.

2131
01:53:53.451 --> 01:53:55.550
So he's looking for another game,
another pool match.

2132
01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.850
Kaz a couple drinks goes to the roulette table,

2133
01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.140
roulette table beaus it all goes to the dice table,
blows it all.

2134
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:06.440
Just one of those guys,
he'll be at $10,000 in his pocket.
That's just,

2135
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:10.150
I gotta I gotta be an action man.
I gotta be an action.
Wow.

2136
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:14.900
They get crazy and he start going off.
And so this is a weird addiction.

2137
01:54:14.901 --> 01:54:19.130
The addiction to gamble.
I growing up around,
uh,
in pool play in a,
at,
uh,

2138
01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:22.760
this place,
white plains,
billions.
There was a bunch of people in New York when I,

2139
01:54:22.761 --> 01:54:25.730
when I lived there in white plains,
uh,
executive billiards in white plains.

2140
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:30.050
And there was a bunch of people that were like serious hardcore gambling addicts

2141
01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:32.150
and never seen anything like it in my life,
man,

2142
01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:36.590
they had to be an action in something playing gin,
playing pool,

2143
01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.680
going to the race track.
It's no fun for him.
There's nothing now.

2144
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:44.770
Life was all about action sport game for about four months and I fucking hate

2145
01:54:44.981 --> 01:54:49.370
it.
Really.
I do as a means to survive.
I was a plot man.

2146
01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.360
You're real good at breaking down fight and I would imagine you would be real

2147
01:54:53.361 --> 01:54:54.800
good at breaking down games as well.

2148
01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:58.400
You can't do it every day now why does that go to the world?
It's impossible.

2149
01:54:58.401 --> 01:55:01.070
The odds are always against your Vegas keeps getting bigger and bigger.

2150
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:06.370
A professional gambler knows when to go in bang and pull out four nights and you

2151
01:55:06.571 --> 01:55:09.740
get some mouse has very high percentage.
He looks at the time of the year.

2152
01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.640
He looks at show many variables who won on Saturday one on Friday,

2153
01:55:13.641 --> 01:55:16.880
but it seems to me that,
it seems to me that it'd be super risky no matter what.

2154
01:55:16.881 --> 01:55:19.430
Even if you're really good at it.
What are the,
what's the odds that you,

2155
01:55:19.431 --> 01:55:23.780
when is it,
55 60 like 78 they always get you,

2156
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:26.560
this is the time of the year right now where they shut the lights on a

2157
01:55:26.561 --> 01:55:29.750
motherfucker,
but who do you know you get up to 60% wins.
That's great.

2158
01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.860
That's great.
That's great.

2159
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:34.400
Yeah and that's why when guys go on bad streaks they go bad and it gets scary

2160
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:39.170
because they could want to totally dead,
dead empty.
These guys that take 19 pics,

2161
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.650
I love when I make a joy karate view and people like you've got to put the pixel

2162
01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.220
all them,
you dumb fuck everybody's

2163
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.190
<v 0>going to go for and for what three and five you dummy,</v>

2164
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:50.850
I'm trying to give you info here so you can go to or three specific so you have

2165
01:55:50.851 --> 01:55:53.760
it that winter.
So at least you cover on one of the points.

2166
01:55:53.761 --> 01:55:55.290
You just not sitting there fucking sweat.

2167
01:55:55.291 --> 01:55:58.320
And I'm not sure if the sports book covers all the fights either.

2168
01:55:58.410 --> 01:55:59.610
They only cover a couple of them,

2169
01:55:59.611 --> 01:56:03.000
but a lot of people like when you bring in guys like Charles Oliveira from

2170
01:56:03.001 --> 01:56:03.960
Brazil or something like that,

2171
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:06.510
like who the fuck knows who that guy is and I'll send you killer.

2172
01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:09.870
There was a lot of dudes,
man in the early days of the UFC that a,

2173
01:56:09.871 --> 01:56:11.260
they used to put the line on when the,

2174
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:12.960
especially when you have fights at the palm and shit,

2175
01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:15.210
they would put a lineup and I would look at the line,
I'll go,

2176
01:56:15.211 --> 01:56:17.640
I got a bet and these guys don't even know who the fuck this guy is.

2177
01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:20.370
Who's a bunch of times where I was stealing money.

2178
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:23.500
You would think some guy was a fan favorite because a lot of people knew about

2179
01:56:23.501 --> 01:56:25.710
them so they would put money on whatever the product guys came over on my bet

2180
01:56:25.711 --> 01:56:29.400
against them.
Yeah,
because everyone thinks her name is bigger than they are.
Well,

2181
01:56:29.401 --> 01:56:31.680
the pride guys,
the situation with pride is first of all,

2182
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:33.240
apparently according to Phil Baroni,

2183
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:38.040
it's much tougher to fly from Japan to America.
That is from America to Japan.

2184
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:42.960
Something to do with like rhythm and cycles of your body and he totally truly

2185
01:56:42.961 --> 01:56:44.160
believes this and he says,

2186
01:56:44.161 --> 01:56:46.890
this is the reason why these Japanese guys come over here and they don't do so

2187
01:56:46.891 --> 01:56:50.760
well.
But another problem with Japan as they were allowed to free ball and take

2188
01:56:50.761 --> 01:56:54.990
whatever the fuck they wanted,
these guys were just,
it was a wild west man.

2189
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:56.910
They were just taking all kinds of,
go ahead,
Bob.

2190
01:56:56.911 --> 01:57:01.440
Sapp and Bob's had was 375 pounds with ABS.

2191
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:05.250
Have you ever even seen anything like that?
You work with them.
Joey,

2192
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:08.280
you work with them on the longest yard.
What was that like?

2193
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:10.930
And he couldn't pick me up really?
He couldn't fit we,

2194
01:57:10.931 --> 01:57:13.890
it was one scene where he was supposed to carry me.
He couldn't pick me up.
Joey,

2195
01:57:13.891 --> 01:57:15.830
you,
but how big were you back to read the navy?

2196
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:20.320
He was three 75 and he couldn't pick me up.
Jesus,
he had a fight or wrestle.

2197
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:24.150
I bet fucking against them.
Yeah,
there's restless,

2198
01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:28.890
but dude,
very few people can hoist up a 390 pound man.

2199
01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:32.670
There's not a whole lot of people.
That's a different kind of weight.
It's a,

2200
01:57:32.671 --> 01:57:35.520
it's the way you stay.
I though a lot of people,

2201
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.510
if I add a carry you like up out of a burning building,
we're both going to die.

2202
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:43.470
That really I have to drag you if you use your technique,

2203
01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:48.450
my Jujitsu techniques.
Shit.
What about my back weighed 390 bro.
You know what?

2204
01:57:48.451 --> 01:57:52.780
I can do three 90 for one squat with a bar.
Shit,

2205
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:57.090
Wade perfectly on my shoulders with a spotter,
you know,

2206
01:57:57.091 --> 01:57:58.020
making sure there's a bar in place.

2207
01:57:58.021 --> 01:58:02.090
Three 90 of human bone and movable tissue and everything switched.

2208
01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.870
A moving ball sack,

2209
01:58:03.871 --> 01:58:07.280
throwing off equilibrium became my head of my boss.

2210
01:58:07.281 --> 01:58:09.990
Like that slows you right the fuck the right when I get you on my shoulder,

2211
01:58:09.991 --> 01:58:12.640
I step on your Dick and trip.
Oh that the scale off.

2212
01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:15.240
Completely wrapping around your legs,
man.

2213
01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:17.870
I remember one time you were sitting in a chair and I got behind you and I'll

2214
01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.140
put you in a gable grip and I just said,

2215
01:58:19.141 --> 01:58:22.050
let me see if I got to hoist this dude up.
It was a joke.

2216
01:58:22.051 --> 01:58:24.420
It was like trying to pick up a house.
It was like,

2217
01:58:24.421 --> 01:58:27.750
I might as well have been trying to pick up my house.
Just didn't budge.

2218
01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:31.590
I gripped the whole of them tightened down at just arch my back.

2219
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:34.230
It was like nothing.
It was like my body was like,
dude,

2220
01:58:34.231 --> 01:58:37.530
you're going to break everything.
If you try this,
stop what you're doing.
Stupid.

2221
01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:43.790
No fucking chance.
No chance to get that water would go get.

2222
01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:46.650
I'm over here dying of thirst.
I either hate it.

2223
01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:51.140
Banana bread before I came up here.
Fucked up here.
Just sit here and watch.

2224
01:58:51.141 --> 01:58:54.160
It happened over the last hour where you slowed down considerably.

2225
01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:57.160
Sunk into the hole,
but I back bitch.
You know what I'm saying?

2226
01:58:57.161 --> 01:59:00.840
I never go down like that.
I'm like Columbus.
I keep coming back to China.
Woman.

2227
01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:05.780
I'm in New York.
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
Dat,
dat,
Dat,
dat.

2228
01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:08.980
The we're back.
Bitches.
What about flashlight?

2229
01:59:08.981 --> 01:59:13.480
Get mythologist boulder in the house.
Fleshlight the only putting up my boy.

2230
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:16.380
Doug's doctors are fucking hollered down in Florida.

2231
01:59:16.381 --> 01:59:20.020
Hold that tight with a bicycle.
Him.
Bali,
Tony Wagner,
my buddy Doug,

2232
01:59:20.021 --> 01:59:22.270
he knuckles a fucking animal.
I read this thing.

2233
01:59:22.271 --> 01:59:26.140
He really run all around the Atlanta bicycle.
Tricycle is back on.

2234
01:59:26.170 --> 01:59:28.740
He's got a big fucking head to Doug in not tugging knuckles,

2235
01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:33.550
almost bigger than mine.
And that's it guys.
You know what I'm saying?
We're here,

2236
01:59:33.551 --> 01:59:34.780
we're queer,
everything's beautiful.

2237
01:59:34.781 --> 01:59:39.781
What go to the economist.com my late by latest a cosmology article that I'm

2238
01:59:42.251 --> 01:59:44.340
fascinated with,
I haven't quite wrapped my head around this.

2239
01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.030
I don't want to come comment on and totally,

2240
01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:51.130
but the idea is that in the headline is in contradiction to most cosmologists

2241
01:59:51.131 --> 01:59:54.730
opinions to scientists have found evidence that universe that the universe may

2242
01:59:54.731 --> 01:59:56.290
have existed forever.

2243
01:59:57.070 --> 02:00:00.850
There has been no big bang and then it's just constant and it goes on forever

2244
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:03.850
and it never ends,
which is what I've always thought was right.
I mean,

2245
02:00:03.851 --> 02:00:06.550
I know I'm an idiot and I shouldn't be commenting on what cosmologists day,

2246
02:00:06.551 --> 02:00:10.060
but I always felt like our need for anything to be beginning and ending.

2247
02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:11.610
And so we can wrap our heads around it cause we be,

2248
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:14.410
we begin and end based on her own biological limitations.

2249
02:00:14.411 --> 02:00:16.610
We think that someone thing has to have a birth and,
and,

2250
02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:18.340
and it's also like can come the game over.

2251
02:00:18.341 --> 02:00:20.650
It's like where do you go after the interspace?
Where do you go after that?

2252
02:00:20.651 --> 02:00:21.484
So where do you have to have your die?

2253
02:00:21.490 --> 02:00:23.470
Nothing weird are they weren't your time man.

2254
02:00:23.471 --> 02:00:26.620
We're learning some shit about the universe and learning some shit about just

2255
02:00:26.621 --> 02:00:29.920
reality that no human beings have ever been able to wrap their heads around.

2256
02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:32.410
You know,
I had a conversation with someone the other day about,
you know,

2257
02:00:32.411 --> 02:00:33.310
how people,
you know,

2258
02:00:33.311 --> 02:00:36.610
they were talking about Egyptians and how much of the Egyptian people new to be

2259
02:00:36.611 --> 02:00:38.950
able to create those structures.
And I'm like,
yeah,

2260
02:00:38.951 --> 02:00:42.070
it probably was pretty interesting.
But I guaran t you,

2261
02:00:42.071 --> 02:00:45.090
we know more now so much more than knew some crazy shit.

2262
02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:47.620
They knew how to build some amazing structures that we can't quite wrap our

2263
02:00:47.621 --> 02:00:49.840
heads around today.
But believe me,

2264
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:52.510
everything gets more complex from the beginning of the universe,

2265
02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:54.970
from the beginning of life on this planet,
from,
you know,

2266
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:56.590
the fucking birth of our star.

2267
02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:59.260
Everything has gotten more and more weird and always wellbeing.

2268
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:02.310
You go to those mountains in Colorado,
you hike up those mountains.

2269
02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:03.290
Don't make me homesick.
Profit.

2270
02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:07.380
You see some shit up in those mountains and you've got to think that totally.

2271
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:11.050
Years ago there was water here.
It was water here.

2272
02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:14.740
My thing is this is never began.
And start with a bull.

2273
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:19.590
Civilizations of coming eight times on this same fucking planet is at least

2274
02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.490
illegally.
We vented with an 80 year wards route,
whatever shooted,
you know,

2275
02:01:24.491 --> 02:01:27.440
can start it with a cannon ball.
And it just kept evolving.

2276
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:31.750
We have paperwork to document this back to Jesus.
Now,
you know,

2277
02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:34.270
there's always one gun.
It ends up like fucking your buddy there.

2278
02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:36.420
The Scientologists,
the Black Dude,

2279
02:01:36.421 --> 02:01:40.250
that movie go Henry where he lived at a fucking cave himself with a German

2280
02:01:40.251 --> 02:01:44.570
shepherd.
Will Smith,
uh,
goal,
whatever.
Be,
what's his name?
I am legend.

2281
02:01:44.571 --> 02:01:45.980
I am legend.
You know,

2282
02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:49.730
and all of a sudden he meets a Brody Fox and then four people and then we go on.

2283
02:01:49.731 --> 02:01:53.220
And your Grandpa,
you know,
I,
I don't think we just existed,
died.

2284
02:01:53.250 --> 02:01:56.660
I always think that there's been a bunch of different versions of humanity,

2285
02:01:56.710 --> 02:01:58.380
different versions of humanity.
Man.

2286
02:01:58.390 --> 02:02:01.100
We've talked about Graham Hancock on this podcast a bunch of times,

2287
02:02:01.101 --> 02:02:02.600
but if you ever want to get into that folks,

2288
02:02:02.601 --> 02:02:05.210
there's a guy named Graham Hancock who wrote a book called fingerprints of the

2289
02:02:05.211 --> 02:02:06.830
Gods.
He wrote a bunch of books.

2290
02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:09.800
Underworld is another one that deals with all these different cities that they

2291
02:02:09.801 --> 02:02:13.010
found underneath the ocean.
Please.
There's so many different structures.

2292
02:02:13.011 --> 02:02:16.510
Man's giant structures,
rows and shit.
They're,

2293
02:02:16.511 --> 02:02:19.820
the earth used to be used to have a much lower level of sea level.

2294
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:22.400
The sea level was much lower and uh,

2295
02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:26.510
we had much more ice everywhere and that ice melted at a certain point in time

2296
02:02:26.511 --> 02:02:28.940
with what we're worried about today.
Everyone's worried about global warming,

2297
02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:29.960
but off the ice caps melt.

2298
02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:33.470
That shit has happened so many times over the course of humanity and there's all

2299
02:02:33.471 --> 02:02:35.960
this evidence for these cities that are in the ocean has shifted.

2300
02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.690
You have brought a point up that they found fucking,
this is a loan right here.

2301
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:44.120
I had a thought.
I had just,
this makes my hypothesis stronger.

2302
02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:48.780
You said that they found the tooth in Montana of a dinosaur that lived only a

2303
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:53.450
megalodons sharp believe used ago.
I don't know the info,

2304
02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:56.350
but right there.
What the fuck with the shark doing in the mountains of Montana,

2305
02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:59.180
that's one of the best places to find a negligible.
That's what I'm saying.

2306
02:02:59.181 --> 02:03:02.600
That was covered at one time and one civilization a long,

2307
02:03:02.601 --> 02:03:06.380
long fucking time ago before the Chinese even existed and came over and built

2308
02:03:06.381 --> 02:03:10.160
the railroad tracks.
There was a complete different civilization here.
Totally.

2309
02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:12.870
Well,
you know Chinese were over here before anybody that,
yes,

2310
02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:15.380
they were yesterday,
weren't found Chinese bones.

2311
02:03:15.381 --> 02:03:19.020
The oldest bones have ever found in North America from a Chinese person that was

2312
02:03:19.050 --> 02:03:22.280
in 10,000 years ago.
Believe it dog.
I believe it.

2313
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:25.670
That's my native place shit show.
It's,
it's,
you know,
well the Indians,
you know,

2314
02:03:25.671 --> 02:03:29.030
we know that they came from Asia to,
that's what the Indians came from.
You know,

2315
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:31.630
or you know,
native Americans,
you should say.
Yeah.

2316
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:34.340
Hawaii always freaks me out the most,
man.

2317
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:36.740
When you think that this is fairly recent,
you know,

2318
02:03:36.741 --> 02:03:38.740
in terms of like millions of years,
you know this,

2319
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:42.620
this volcano erupted in the middle of the ocean,
not near anything.

2320
02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:44.470
And there's all these motherfuckers just,

2321
02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.980
you know how those countries are populated,

2322
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:49.580
they go from one island and they take canoes and to another island.

2323
02:03:49.581 --> 02:03:51.920
They can't even see.
They don't even know it's there.

2324
02:03:51.921 --> 02:03:55.610
They just started canoeing out.
Yeah.
And they did it back before gps,

2325
02:03:55.611 --> 02:03:58.000
before they did,
I don't even think fucking folders.
You didn't,

2326
02:03:58.010 --> 02:04:01.370
they went to her to a cylinder,
going to gps.
They didn't give a fuck.

2327
02:04:01.371 --> 02:04:05.450
They got a blanket and took a chance.
You know what I'm saying?
Go East cock suck.

2328
02:04:05.451 --> 02:04:08.810
They do that.
The Polynesians,
like there's people that originally found Hawaii.

2329
02:04:08.811 --> 02:04:11.330
No wonder whether select like adamant about it being,

2330
02:04:11.331 --> 02:04:16.130
there's you imagine how hard it was to get there and you bitches are cheating by

2331
02:04:16.131 --> 02:04:19.180
getting on a Delta flight and coming over to your stupid fucking flower shirt

2332
02:04:19.181 --> 02:04:22.160
with the Polynesian cove.
I don't know the whole area.

2333
02:04:22.161 --> 02:04:24.980
I don't know where that bone,
I was a kid.
There was a Polynesian restaurant,

2334
02:04:24.981 --> 02:04:29.830
my name,
but the Mike caught up.
Motherfucker used to kick that place.
We kicked,

2335
02:04:29.831 --> 02:04:33.410
they have a bartender have movie karate chop.
He let you karate chop them.

2336
02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:35.610
They were the only joint that would have spare ribs.

2337
02:04:35.611 --> 02:04:37.100
And the thing we got to go get some Cuban.

2338
02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.280
We've got to go to verse size and Encino.
Soon.
Dot is another places.

2339
02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.940
A couple of good places for sizes.
Good.

2340
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.640
That chicken soup they have and that garlic chicken with onions.

2341
02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.910
We'll talk cause another person to the side.

2342
02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:51.660
Then this other one I Venice we're signed.
There's,
I dunno.
Well they're all like,

2343
02:04:51.661 --> 02:04:54.180
cause I've only eaten at the one in Encino.
All different.

2344
02:04:54.181 --> 02:04:56.090
They've got a one in silver lake.
That's tremendous.

2345
02:04:56.091 --> 02:04:59.670
So coaching Ito never trust the people that make shitty food,
man.

2346
02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:03.930
Countries that foods with foods not tasting the fuck's wrong Weirdos.
Yeah,

2347
02:05:03.931 --> 02:05:08.380
you born cuts.
Oh that's the first way you got to like people is to their food.

2348
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:11.610
Like just fucking Spaghetti's goals.
The case with English anymore though.

2349
02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:14.040
English restaurants,
there's a lot of dope restaurants in England,

2350
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:17.490
in London I guess too.
They have a good food.
All kinds of food.
It's like,

2351
02:05:17.491 --> 02:05:17.821
you know,

2352
02:05:17.821 --> 02:05:20.510
you hear about it like that's the old cliche like from Bill Hicks and material,

2353
02:05:20.511 --> 02:05:21.690
but English food being bad.

2354
02:05:21.690 --> 02:05:25.140
But I've had some great English food is a lot of great restaurants in now go

2355
02:05:25.141 --> 02:05:27.560
over there and a bunch of different places,
you know,
like that's what we are.

2356
02:05:27.650 --> 02:05:30.720
Or is it just food,
food,
you know there's like,
you know,
fine restaurants.

2357
02:05:30.721 --> 02:05:35.470
They're working on that passport.
England,
Australia come Aveda,

2358
02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:38.460
you motherfuckers within a year.
Is that possible?
I Bro,

2359
02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.390
don't worry about nothing.

2360
02:05:39.391 --> 02:05:43.110
I made a call and let us show you if you want to go right now.
Black,

2361
02:05:43.111 --> 02:05:46.110
can you go working on it right now?
So don't keep twitting me on.

2362
02:05:46.150 --> 02:05:48.270
But what happens when you,
when they land,

2363
02:05:48.330 --> 02:05:50.700
I'm going to have to break away from you and hide.
That's fine.

2364
02:05:50.730 --> 02:05:53.460
You're don't have to shine your on on nothing.

2365
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:56.100
I got Cardi Bravo had a gun charge from when he was younger.

2366
02:05:56.101 --> 02:05:59.070
When he used to work for a check cashing company.
It's totally legit and legal.

2367
02:05:59.071 --> 02:06:02.520
He had the gun on him because he worked for a dangerous United dangerous job is

2368
02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:04.200
transporting,
are this all this cash around.

2369
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:06.930
And he got pulled over and he told the cops,
you know,
I have a gun on me.

2370
02:06:06.931 --> 02:06:09.600
And they arrested him and even though he'd nothing happened and they cleared him

2371
02:06:09.601 --> 02:06:12.460
of it,
every time he goes to Canada,
they fuck them with it.
Wow.

2372
02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:15.450
Every time takes hours.
And now I'm like,
yeah,
you go ahead,
go.
Go ahead dude.

2373
02:06:15.451 --> 02:06:17.670
I love Canada,
but I can't go to that.
You guys don't,

2374
02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:20.510
don't know what to fucking work with people.
You know what I'm saying?

2375
02:06:20.511 --> 02:06:24.240
And when I went up there,
you guys are vented delivery.
We,
20 years ago,

2376
02:06:24.241 --> 02:06:27.450
nobody was doing delivery.
We'd like give you motherfucking Canadians prompts.

2377
02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:29.940
You guys do a delivery right there to blow a street.

2378
02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:31.650
I stayed in a hotel and I was doing whatever.

2379
02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:34.200
Well I completely understand candidates stance.

2380
02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:38.820
If you are a country that's filled with predominently friendly,
nice people,

2381
02:06:38.821 --> 02:06:40.830
law abiding citizens for the most part,

2382
02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:44.250
like their percentage of criminals and scumbags is way lower than ours.

2383
02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:48.360
They exist but it's a way lower number and you live next to a country that's

2384
02:06:48.361 --> 02:06:50.580
just fucking savages,

2385
02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:54.750
savages and criminals that are looking at scape law enforcement by sneaking into

2386
02:06:54.751 --> 02:06:55.710
the next door neighbor country,

2387
02:06:55.711 --> 02:06:57.720
which is really nice and filled with suite people.

2388
02:06:58.050 --> 02:07:01.800
So you know they had to react that way but so many people must've been sneaking

2389
02:07:01.801 --> 02:07:04.950
over from fucking Detroit in New York and criminals,

2390
02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:07.200
scumbags and murderers and douchebags.

2391
02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:11.160
Meanwhile Canada is like one of the nicest places in the fucking world and it's

2392
02:07:11.161 --> 02:07:14.900
our neighbor but they,
the flavor they do once lady blow street,

2393
02:07:14.901 --> 02:07:18.390
Blood Street was the only place ever I went down and went to a strip club cause

2394
02:07:18.391 --> 02:07:20.460
I'll even go to strip clubs.
These things.

2395
02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:24.900
I went to a strip club and the girl put her monkey in my face and I believe at a

2396
02:07:24.901 --> 02:07:27.550
club on blustery.
What's the,
okay.

2397
02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:30.930
She put her monkey in my and I'd been in a fucking monkey issue.

2398
02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:35.790
[inaudible] going big,
big,
big.
I remember that.

2399
02:07:35.791 --> 02:07:38.750
The monkey drove me crazy.
I went back to the Strip club.
I got up,

2400
02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:40.880
I went back to the comedy club before they closed,

2401
02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:44.470
got another $150 draw and went back at $10 a lap dance.

2402
02:07:44.471 --> 02:07:48.330
I sniffed her asshole and this is why going on in an American place,

2403
02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:52.300
you go to Canada stuff,
the girls asked for $10 they are lacking data.

2404
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:54.630
Labor though as far as you got motherfucker label,

2405
02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:57.070
let me and signed the paperwork.
This is what it is.

2406
02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:59.320
It's like some flavor up there.
North Toronto,

2407
02:07:59.410 --> 02:08:03.880
North America is like the three bears like Mama Bear,

2408
02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:07.990
baby bear and papa bear.
That's what it's like.
And like Mexico,
too much flavor.

2409
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:13.210
[inaudible] states the right amount of flavor.
Canada,
not enough flavor.

2410
02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:16.450
It's like Mexico's got too much.
They're too fucking crazy.

2411
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:18.880
I tell you what I'm ready for though.
Well,
at this point in my life,

2412
02:08:18.881 --> 02:08:22.540
I'm ready for England.
Are you ready?
I'm going to go there and I want the people,

2413
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:25.450
I went the fuck motherfuckers from snatch to pick me up at the airport.

2414
02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:27.940
The two black dudes and the other fucking Jewish.

2415
02:08:27.941 --> 02:08:31.250
You could go to England because I would love to take you to someone was loud

2416
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:36.070
rock you mother.
You guys know it.
Dave bishop has retired from comedy.
He's out.

2417
02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:40.960
Did I tell you what happened?
Oh my goodness.
We were in England and Dave,

2418
02:08:40.961 --> 02:08:42.000
I love him to death.
Uh,

2419
02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:45.790
he apparently hadn't been doing that much comedy and he went on stage and you

2420
02:08:45.791 --> 02:08:49.330
know,
so rowdy,
crazy drunk crowd and uh,

2421
02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:51.790
they were fired up and he just was like,

2422
02:08:51.791 --> 02:08:54.100
I was in the dressing room like for like six minutes.

2423
02:08:54.190 --> 02:08:57.730
I was going over my notes and all of a sudden,
Dave's at the door.
You Ready?
Joe?

2424
02:08:58.030 --> 02:09:01.450
And I go,
ready?
I go,
what's going on?
How come,
you know,
on stage?
He goes,
ah,

2425
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:05.710
I couldn't get him.
You couldn't get him who's on stage?
No one time stage.

2426
02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:08.800
So he did six minutes and just bailed.
Gone off stage,

2427
02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:12.340
came back to the green room to get me and I was like,
oh no dude,

2428
02:09:12.341 --> 02:09:15.880
like what's going on?
So I went on stage.
I'm like,
Hey,
what's come on folks?

2429
02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.920
And I didn't know what to say.
That's crazy.
Yeah it was.
It was ridiculous.

2430
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:23.980
The show.
It's great.
They were awesome.
They were awesome.
You know what man,

2431
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:26.610
here's the deal.
When you reach a certain point in your life,
and he did,

2432
02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:30.520
he's got a job and he's had a job forever.
He works in a full time job at a bank.

2433
02:09:30.850 --> 02:09:33.370
You know,
and I've said this and this is just the fact,

2434
02:09:33.371 --> 02:09:37.980
if you want to be a fucking comic,
the saying,
there's no safe place.

2435
02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.630
The saying no part time job,
it ain't easy.

2436
02:09:40.690 --> 02:09:43.990
You're going to have to immerse yourself in the world of comedy.

2437
02:09:43.991 --> 02:09:48.100
You gotta become a fucking comedy soldier.
You can do it if you can do it at all.

2438
02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:50.440
If you can do it and can go up there and get laughs,
you can get better.

2439
02:09:50.441 --> 02:09:52.600
If you can get better,
you can get become a professional.

2440
02:09:52.690 --> 02:09:55.480
If you could probably become professional,
you could become a good professional.

2441
02:09:55.481 --> 02:09:57.430
You could become a headline.
You could become a TV act.

2442
02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.850
You can be a stand up comedian,
but it's not going to be fucking easy,
man.

2443
02:10:00.851 --> 02:10:02.650
And you're not going to do it while you have a regular job.

2444
02:10:02.651 --> 02:10:05.980
But I need my dental now.
You don't need your dental.
You gotta.

2445
02:10:05.981 --> 02:10:09.560
You gotta fucking move.
We got insurance.
Cock sucker looked at me.

2446
02:10:09.570 --> 02:10:10.660
It's my whole thing is missing.

2447
02:10:10.661 --> 02:10:12.850
I got nice teeth that look like fucking Humphrey Bogart.

2448
02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:16.630
That's easy to say though.
It's,
there's no movies being booked in fucking,

2449
02:10:16.631 --> 02:10:19.170
you know Manchester.
Yeah.

2450
02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:21.730
Nice to hang out at the store late night.

2451
02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:25.650
It's still all the fucking cell phones from the office of black boots downtown.

2452
02:10:27.490 --> 02:10:31.380
I used to fucking give out tickets.
I used to give out the stubs.

2453
02:10:31.381 --> 02:10:34.040
It's the peak they were doing and I would get dial up a ticket.
I pick

2454
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.550
<v 2>up an extra 300 a week upstairs.
Mitzi show me pulling out.
We got a bed.</v>

2455
02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:39.530
You gotta know how to work the fucking deal?
No.

2456
02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:43.850
Joey would have robbed the shit out of Brian and robbed me.
Suck my dick

2457
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:48.960
sucked his down.
I can set right dick.
I would've made your pass out.
Yeah.

2458
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:52.130
How would I gave you a weed?
Y'All hot with a blown up.
You would've passed that.

2459
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:53.900
You would've woke up nothing with a bit.

2460
02:10:53.901 --> 02:10:56.860
Then you would have had another fucking anxiety attacks to [inaudible] on one

2461
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:59.280
night and woke up with a department full of tropical helmet.
Yeah,

2462
02:10:59.290 --> 02:11:02.600
you would have minus the Tivo and 800 and fucking ambulance charges.

2463
02:11:03.710 --> 02:11:06.290
What's the most you had to pay for ambulances for picking up like that?

2464
02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:10.160
Probably don't want the last one.
The last one.
Well,

2465
02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:15.170
the whole thing costs $4,000
with insurance.

2466
02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:20.290
Fucking a,
Oh my God.
With insurance.
Sacrifice myself.

2467
02:11:20.291 --> 02:11:24.140
Eat everybody.
Yeah.
Much Day Yama.
Stay right.
Keep it together.

2468
02:11:24.670 --> 02:11:27.770
If you ever have something like that happened,
all she can fuck.
Call me.

2469
02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:30.470
Absolutely.
I'll come rescue you.
Absolutely.
I'll save you.

2470
02:11:30.471 --> 02:11:33.510
I'm gonna hold your hand.
We're going to get through this pitches.
I'll come over.

2471
02:11:33.530 --> 02:11:37.290
Scare the fuck out of you.
You understand me all for one United health,

2472
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.931
whatever it is.

2473
02:11:37.931 --> 02:11:41.250
The more time we did ask and went to see apocalypse now be junk crowds,

2474
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.640
Chris de Lorenzo,
when it first came out,

2475
02:11:43.641 --> 02:11:47.360
the first weekend I was about 16 it was amazing on the walk home,

2476
02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:51.230
which is walking my little business just raved and all of a sudden this,

2477
02:11:51.330 --> 02:11:54.280
there's that.
I keep talking to my friend,
I keep saying to him,

2478
02:11:54.281 --> 02:11:58.550
do you hear those sirens?
And my buddy's like,
I hear him play,

2479
02:11:58.551 --> 02:12:01.640
he's playing along with me.
And I'm like,
you hit a sign was like,
yeah.

2480
02:12:01.641 --> 02:12:05.900
And honestly the one guy's like,
I don't hear nothing.
Nothing,
man.
I swear to God,

2481
02:12:05.901 --> 02:12:07.550
I'll fucking hit him like,
you know,
here.

2482
02:12:07.551 --> 02:12:10.490
And we started covering our ears and shit.
And then we went up to somebody.

2483
02:12:10.491 --> 02:12:12.170
You hear those sirens?
And he's like,
yeah.

2484
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:15.410
And we even freaked out now because somebody else is here with him.

2485
02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:18.290
And this poor kid looked around and had just rained.

2486
02:12:18.291 --> 02:12:20.270
There was a puddle on the street.
I'll never forget.

2487
02:12:20.271 --> 02:12:22.430
He got his hands and knees and started throwing.
The puddle

2488
02:12:24.010 --> 02:12:27.470
is probably like shy gasoline on the surface.

2489
02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.450
He just got up and ran the fuck home.
We've seen him like a two days later.

2490
02:12:32.451 --> 02:12:35.770
He's like,
man,
I kept hearing those sirens on.

2491
02:12:37.930 --> 02:12:38.980
<v 6>I saw apocalypse now.</v>

2492
02:12:38.981 --> 02:12:42.550
I really watched the whole movie was in this house when I first bought this

2493
02:12:42.551 --> 02:12:46.030
house,
when I first bought this,
because it's got,
I got to like a movie theater,

2494
02:12:46.031 --> 02:12:47.290
like a hundred inch,
you know,

2495
02:12:47.590 --> 02:12:52.140
thing that drops down and I ate a pop cookie and I'm stoned as balls.

2496
02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:56.110
Everyone's asleep at me and I'm sitting there watching this apocalypse now in

2497
02:12:56.111 --> 02:12:59.110
this giant 100 inch screen and that's when it hit me.

2498
02:12:59.230 --> 02:13:03.520
What a brilliant piece of filmmaking that move release.
There's certain movies,

2499
02:13:03.521 --> 02:13:07.180
man,
where you watch the movie and go damn movies.
Just a work of art.
You know?

2500
02:13:07.181 --> 02:13:10.270
It's like they just took you on a journey.
There's so much about that movie,

2501
02:13:10.271 --> 02:13:11.860
like the end when they're killing the bowl,

2502
02:13:12.010 --> 02:13:13.390
like there's so much about that movie.

2503
02:13:13.391 --> 02:13:15.670
Like you couldn't even do that today because they really killed a bull and

2504
02:13:15.671 --> 02:13:18.040
filmed it.
I mean,
they hacked that fucking boiled to death.
Right.

2505
02:13:18.130 --> 02:13:18.941
That was real shit.

2506
02:13:18.941 --> 02:13:23.470
That wasn't special effect on these like disturbing and shocking and the whole

2507
02:13:23.471 --> 02:13:27.850
Marlon Brando is this fucking insane general gone off his rocker.

2508
02:13:28.210 --> 02:13:32.040
The whole thing was amazing,
man.
That is a God damn movie man.

2509
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.740
<v 2>The sound,
everything.
Robert Duvall,</v>

2510
02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:37.650
Charlie don't surf that.

2511
02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:41.850
We'll see when he goes in and the black dudes listen to Hendrix and I can't even

2512
02:13:41.851 --> 02:13:46.851
imagine on a big screen by by month to jump out of fucks ripping balls.

2513
02:13:47.370 --> 02:13:51.240
The CEO here,
whatever he says,
surround sound speakers all around my head,

2514
02:13:51.241 --> 02:13:51.960
everywhere.

2515
02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:54.970
He was one of those real motherfucking black dudes with the veins in the eyes in

2516
02:13:54.971 --> 02:13:59.760
Detroit.
We open the fucking black dude in Memphis,
Detroit thing.

2517
02:13:59.761 --> 02:14:03.750
I'm phasing it in what phase?
The eyelid member.
They asked them,
they said to him,

2518
02:14:03.751 --> 02:14:06.100
well,
who's the capitol?
The and he looked around this motherfucker,

2519
02:14:06.110 --> 02:14:10.890
looked them buckler no
motherfucker.
He don't even have to say that.

2520
02:14:10.891 --> 02:14:14.360
That was intense.
He just looked at it all gone off the deep end,
all God,

2521
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:15.233
how many people?

2522
02:14:16.130 --> 02:14:20.370
That movie really kind of captured what a lot of people felt about war that does

2523
02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.690
this.
A lot of crazy shit going down.
It wasn't as simple as everyone marching

2524
02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:30.570
going rogue man.
A lot of nutty shit.
Some fucking knowledge jobs give people,

2525
02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:35.190
this is a true story.
One day be roughly manager.
I would around skin stone,

2526
02:14:35.191 --> 02:14:39.930
we go round,
we've got to catch this weed store.
It's on Formosa and Santa Monica.

2527
02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:42.360
They got really good edibles.
So we pull over,

2528
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:43.950
Ralphie may can't find a parking spot.

2529
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:48.810
It's 20 to fucking eight seven 35 the place closes at eight so we're going to go

2530
02:14:48.811 --> 02:14:49.644
to a movie.

2531
02:14:49.770 --> 02:14:53.310
And so I was saying I go roughly just dropped me off here and parked the car and

2532
02:14:53.311 --> 02:14:56.400
I'll get on in there.
So I walk in and there's a line.

2533
02:14:56.730 --> 02:15:00.870
So the guy wouldn't let me in.
They check ids outside the street at this place.

2534
02:15:01.230 --> 02:15:03.390
This is right across the street from the Formosa Cafe.

2535
02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:05.070
So while I'm waiting in line,

2536
02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:09.570
there's a girl in front of me and I'm waiting there could hoof and I'm stones

2537
02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:12.630
and I'm going in there to get more.
And who fucking walks up to me?

2538
02:15:12.631 --> 02:15:14.520
Who's walking down the street smoking a cigarette.

2539
02:15:14.850 --> 02:15:19.710
But Lawrence Mother Fishburg got Dan,
he goes,
what are you doing?
And I,
he goes,

2540
02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:22.850
don't use a comedian on showtime.
I had a thing,
I'll get the fuck ass too.

2541
02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:26.100
I told him,
he goes and with San Juan fucked me up talking to,

2542
02:15:26.130 --> 02:15:27.270
and he's talking about,
it's awesome.

2543
02:15:27.271 --> 02:15:31.770
So who comes walking up from a distance is Ralphie may Wallen up and I can see

2544
02:15:31.771 --> 02:15:35.370
that as he's walking up,
bro.
He's looking at me,
but he's like,

2545
02:15:35.371 --> 02:15:40.230
what the fuck you talking [inaudible] mother fucking fit by the fuck did you,

2546
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:42.690
did Ralphie start talking black to him?
No,
Ralph.

2547
02:15:42.691 --> 02:15:46.980
We just started talking to them at Laurence Fishburne told us about that movie.

2548
02:15:46.981 --> 02:15:49.140
They have his voice will vary in blackness

2549
02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:53.720
for,
he was doing dog,

2550
02:15:53.721 --> 02:15:57.330
he was 14 when they took him to the Philippines to shoot that movie.
Yeah.

2551
02:15:57.331 --> 02:15:59.520
So next time you see when he was 17 when they finished,

2552
02:15:59.521 --> 02:16:02.500
right for this next time you see Laurence Fishburne,
you shake his hand,

2553
02:16:02.501 --> 02:16:06.090
you're going to listen.
I only met him once at Skybar but very brief.

2554
02:16:06.091 --> 02:16:08.400
I didn't even know.
Didn't even meet him.
I shouldn't say I met him.

2555
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:11.820
I was in his presence.
You would in the Philippines when you afford team,

2556
02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:14.910
most kids don't make it back.
You got to feel bad for that guy,
man.

2557
02:16:14.911 --> 02:16:16.980
He's got a 19 year old daughter that's doing ghetto.

2558
02:16:16.981 --> 02:16:19.950
Paul shows up at the store sometimes.
Really not that attractive.

2559
02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:23.820
Not that attractive in her ass is filled with doubt.
It's like weird.

2560
02:16:23.821 --> 02:16:26.910
She's got like little,
these little zits all over ass.
It's weird.

2561
02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:29.980
You know like like someone shot her with like rock salt.
I hate

2562
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.950
<v 0>that shit.
You would go to a strip club and the chick would have her on her own.</v>

2563
02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:37.060
A little tight white head.
You want to pop that one?
I pop that on.

2564
02:16:37.061 --> 02:16:41.110
How you want to give it like a 10 let me pop that pimple walking around wounded

2565
02:16:41.111 --> 02:16:43.190
here.
That little white kid on your ass is killing me.

2566
02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:45.330
She's got hail damage on her ass.
No,
no.

2567
02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:49.840
There's this sadness man and having a 19 year old daughter and being some

2568
02:16:49.841 --> 02:16:51.910
superstar movie star and you know,

2569
02:16:51.911 --> 02:16:54.550
I mean from the fucking matrix and so many goddamn movies.

2570
02:16:54.551 --> 02:16:56.410
King in New York member him at King in New York.

2571
02:16:56.590 --> 02:17:00.610
How good was he in that fucking movie?
That was a great movie.

2572
02:17:00.611 --> 02:17:04.450
Man Walks this does give the kids money at the shop and he stole them all.

2573
02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:09.210
Here you go by yourself.
This is shit.
Yet he was caught on at Belk.

2574
02:17:10.170 --> 02:17:14.900
I turned to that was,
oh yeah.
Hey Man.

2575
02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:17.650
Herb bullshit or fucking one eight.
What is you doing man?

2576
02:17:17.651 --> 02:17:19.420
Is he doing a TV show or something like that?

2577
02:17:19.421 --> 02:17:23.380
What is the budget of 50 g a week on CSI though?
Cause he doing that CSI,

2578
02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:26.290
it's almost seems like that those guys to get to a certain age.
This one,

2579
02:17:26.291 --> 02:17:28.690
let me just take a show.
Women just live at home.

2580
02:17:28.691 --> 02:17:32.170
I live in New York or wherever city.
We're doing this in the house enough.

2581
02:17:32.171 --> 02:17:35.590
All this flying somewhere for three months and going somewhere else for four

2582
02:17:35.591 --> 02:17:39.490
months.
Some of the guys do like Kevin,
Kevin,
James,
man,
he uproots every six,

2583
02:17:39.550 --> 02:17:43.270
six months or so goes live somewhere for a few months and stuff.
Yeah.
When I,

2584
02:17:43.271 --> 02:17:45.400
when I did that,
a zookeeper movie with him,

2585
02:17:45.401 --> 02:17:48.610
he's got this sweet and Boston in a hotel.
It's like his apartment.

2586
02:17:48.610 --> 02:17:50.530
He's been there for a month.
I could see doing it too,

2587
02:17:50.590 --> 02:17:52.010
like going from movies to a TV show,

2588
02:17:52.011 --> 02:17:55.270
go like let me do this for just for a few years.
We just relax for a few years.

2589
02:17:55.271 --> 02:17:58.510
He shows her the best gig in town.
Man when I did news radio,
if you're,

2590
02:17:58.511 --> 02:18:00.370
if you're into acting,
if you want to be an actor,

2591
02:18:00.371 --> 02:18:03.640
that's the best gig in town because he,
once he gets it down to a science,

2592
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:05.560
like once news radio got down to a science,

2593
02:18:05.561 --> 02:18:08.050
we really only worked four days a week,
you know,

2594
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:11.770
and we filmed one of them and we would take a day off and once the writers got

2595
02:18:11.771 --> 02:18:14.500
really in tune,
you know,
they would come out with killer scripts.

2596
02:18:14.501 --> 02:18:17.230
Like on the first go,
like when you get in like third and fourth season,

2597
02:18:17.410 --> 02:18:20.350
everything becomes like a smooth machine.
You know,
you know how to do it.

2598
02:18:20.350 --> 02:18:22.930
And those are,
those are the best gigs,
man.
You don't have to go nowhere.

2599
02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.120
Dave Foley used to always say that.
He used to always say,

2600
02:18:25.121 --> 02:18:27.580
this is the best Gig in show business.
Don't ever forget it.

2601
02:18:27.581 --> 02:18:30.400
This is the best Gig in show business that pour fuck.

2602
02:18:30.401 --> 02:18:34.480
He's been twittering lately.
He's been tweeting lately about his first wife.

2603
02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:37.720
He's uh,
he's not making money these days,
not making much money.

2604
02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:43.560
And his wife took him to court for alimony and the judge ordered that he pay

2605
02:18:44.201 --> 02:18:47.740
three times his monthly salary.
What he makes a month.

2606
02:18:47.741 --> 02:18:50.770
Right now he has to pay his wife three times that.

2607
02:18:51.550 --> 02:18:56.440
And the judge said that his obligation to pay is not related to his ability to

2608
02:18:56.441 --> 02:18:56.990
pay.

2609
02:18:56.990 --> 02:19:00.940
Like he has an obligation to pay and it has no bearing on his ability to pay and

2610
02:19:00.941 --> 02:19:02.860
they won't make an adjustment.
It's like an Ottawa.

2611
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:05.020
You know in Canada they got some wacky laws up there.

2612
02:19:05.170 --> 02:19:07.420
Cause I remember when he got divorced,
it was nuts man.

2613
02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:11.260
When he first got divorced when we were on news radio and he was making a ton of

2614
02:19:11.261 --> 02:19:15.760
money and his wife had access to his finances for a year.

2615
02:19:16.090 --> 02:19:17.190
Because what happens is in,

2616
02:19:17.191 --> 02:19:21.130
in Canada the laws are totally different where you know for if one year you

2617
02:19:21.131 --> 02:19:22.180
can't get divorced,

2618
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:25.030
you have to be separated for one year before they allow you to get divorced,

2619
02:19:25.150 --> 02:19:26.560
which is crazy.
Wow.

2620
02:19:26.770 --> 02:19:28.910
I don't know if they're trying to keep families together or what,

2621
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:31.130
but in Dave's case it was worst case scenario.

2622
02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:34.790
So here's the wife with money and she's traveling all over the world with his

2623
02:19:34.791 --> 02:19:37.520
money buying furniture going off and she was going,

2624
02:19:37.521 --> 02:19:41.270
I remember he had to go to Egypt so he had to take all this malaria medication

2625
02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:43.760
and he lost his marbles.
Once he got hammered,

2626
02:19:43.761 --> 02:19:47.480
we were at one of these press parties and shit and he's on malaria medication,

2627
02:19:47.481 --> 02:19:49.910
which apparently does not mix well with vodka,

2628
02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:52.970
which they're just drinking out of his head.
Man.

2629
02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:56.840
Took some reporters tape recorder and stuck it in his drink and he doesn't even

2630
02:19:56.841 --> 02:20:00.620
remember doing it and he was just like hallucinating and show like malaria

2631
02:20:00.621 --> 02:20:04.330
medicine is,
no,
no fucking joke man.
But the whole thing is,

2632
02:20:04.450 --> 02:20:07.250
it highlights another thing about how crazy marriages man,

2633
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:10.660
how he hasn't been with this woman in a long time.
I still owes her.
Yeah.

2634
02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:13.550
Not Just Ozer Ozer exorbitant amounts of money.

2635
02:20:13.551 --> 02:20:17.720
He's responsible for maintaining her lifestyle even though his lifestyle is not

2636
02:20:17.721 --> 02:20:20.930
the same anymore.
He's connected to her even though he's not in her life anymore.

2637
02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.030
Sorry.
Before where it's like,
I don't make as much in common,

2638
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:26.750
but I still owe them based on what I used to.
They don't give a fuck.

2639
02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:30.740
They don't give a fuck.
It's crazy,
man.
It is not set up for you,
dude.

2640
02:20:30.741 --> 02:20:31.760
It's not set up for you.

2641
02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:36.020
It's set up to make sure that the woman doesn't get fucked over.
But in so doing,

2642
02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:39.470
they've set it up so the man gets fucked over some times now for some time.

2643
02:20:39.471 --> 02:20:42.410
Sometimes it's good because some dudes are douche bags and they don't wanna pay

2644
02:20:42.411 --> 02:20:44.870
for their kids.
Fuck them.
They should.
They should be paying money.

2645
02:20:44.871 --> 02:20:49.130
They hide money in child support is totally different than alimony.
But you know,

2646
02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:52.340
look,
I have another friend who got married.
He was married for over 15 years,

2647
02:20:52.341 --> 02:20:54.680
I believe it was before we got divorced.
He had no prenup.

2648
02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:59.630
He has to pay his ex wife alimony for the rest of her life.

2649
02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:04.370
Wow.
Four F RLS and needs a lot of money because he was wealthy.

2650
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:07.520
He was very wealthy,
so he is paying her stupid amounts of money.

2651
02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:10.970
So it just drives him nuts and he can't live the way he wants to live,

2652
02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:12.410
even though he makes good money.
He made,

2653
02:21:12.411 --> 02:21:14.570
it doesn't make as much money as you used to,
but it makes a lot of money.

2654
02:21:14.571 --> 02:21:17.510
But he can't live the way he wants to because he has this giant nut he has to

2655
02:21:17.511 --> 02:21:21.500
pay,
has to pay every month.
Chiott crazy.
Dot.

2656
02:21:21.501 --> 02:21:24.530
Just thousands and thousands and thousands of thousands.

2657
02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:28.010
It's just what the numbers are just flying in this chick's bank account.

2658
02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:30.110
As you're writing that check,
you get busy.
Oh,

2659
02:21:30.111 --> 02:21:33.190
he gets busy talking about fucking busy.
You know what I'm saying?
Red Lips.

2660
02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:36.910
Quivered man,
when he talks about his lips quiver,
when they tell you about it,

2661
02:21:36.911 --> 02:21:39.530
naturally slips quiver and he's married now and he's gotten,

2662
02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:43.640
he's got kids and shit still still has to pay mad,
mad loot.

2663
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:47.150
You look at that fucking knife once a month,
they have a narrow dizzy.
It's crazy.

2664
02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:49.640
And the only way,
it's not like you can get like,
listen,

2665
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:53.720
how about I just give you $2 million?
And we don't talk ever again.
No,
no,
no,
no,

2666
02:21:53.721 --> 02:21:57.770
no,
no,
no.
It's a million a year.
3 million here.
Whatever the fuck it is.

2667
02:21:58.010 --> 02:22:02.030
You should go on forever.
It's like visa.
I miss a month to see what the fuck.

2668
02:22:02.031 --> 02:22:06.010
Half good.
Lots of money on our own.
We got the fellow an animal.
Oh,

2669
02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:07.370
fucking crisis.

2670
02:22:07.370 --> 02:22:10.040
Isn't it funny that you could crush that and throw it on the floor and I

2671
02:22:10.041 --> 02:22:11.210
wouldn't even think you're being rude,

2672
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:13.910
but if you kill the rat and threw it on the floor,
I'd be like,
hey dude,

2673
02:22:13.911 --> 02:22:18.230
clean that out or something.
The size.
Yeah,
the little tiny baby.
And I'm like,

2674
02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:22.190
I don't care about that little ant body on my grandpa.
Insignificant.

2675
02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:25.440
But if it was bigger,
it was like a big giant beat on you.
Stomped on it,

2676
02:22:25.441 --> 02:22:25.990
then I'd have to pick

2677
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:30.060
<v 2>her up.
It's all relative pitches.
It's all relative.</v>

2678
02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:33.360
And with the music provided by Joey beat box Diaz,

Stay Black,
Huh?

2699
02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:40.980
The most important thing you should ever get out of this podcast.

2700
02:23:40.981 --> 02:23:42.690
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you see the circle of friends,

2701
02:23:42.691 --> 02:23:45.000
we surround ourselves with a bunch of cool,
positive people.

2702
02:23:45.001 --> 02:23:48.930
You can have this too.
If you are one of those and you bring in people like that,

2703
02:23:48.931 --> 02:23:49.621
you'd get it together.

2704
02:23:49.621 --> 02:23:52.980
A tight knit group of bad motherfuckers in your life could be a masterpiece.

2705
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:56.460
Okay?
Or just have good people,
good people come.

2706
02:23:56.730 --> 02:24:00.510
People had all that positive energy.
You would track this shit.

2707
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:01.920
This is like the secret.

2708
02:24:01.921 --> 02:24:06.780
Look at what we've attracted to design this fucking show.
I am thankful.

2709
02:24:06.781 --> 02:24:09.720
If I'm thankful for anything.

2715
