CHRIS RAMSDALE: Hello, and thank
you for coming aboard

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.160
this tour of application
data at Google.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.410
I'm Chris Ramsdale, product
manager for Google App Engine.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.390
I'd like to begin with some
quick trivia to provide some

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.750
context for the capabilities and
products I'm going to talk

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.350
about today.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.930
Every minute, over 60 hours of
video is uploaded to YouTube.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.120
Google's "Caffeine" Search Index
was over 100 million

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.090
gigabytes in June of 2010 and
growing very quickly.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.880
There are over 350 million
active Gmail users.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.070
And it takes Google
approximately one fourth of a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.520
second to respond to
a search query.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.100
So what did Google learn
building these products?

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.540
At Google, the reliability and
performance of the systems we

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.570
build are critical
to our business.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.860
We realized the traditional data
solutions just wouldn't

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.580
do what we needed them to do.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.640
The kind of scale we're talking
about here requires

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.340
that we do things differently.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.680
So we spent more than a decade
building data systems that are

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.400
extremely reliable and
available, have multiple

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.110
layers of redundancy, and can
handle the loss of any given

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.790
data center, and are
wicked fast.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.360
We published the details of
our early infrastructure,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.150
MapReduce, Big Table, and the
Google File System, which

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.140
became the model that was
adopted by the open source

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.580
community that sprung
up around big data.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.330
But those were just
the table stakes.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.960
Whether deliver high-quality
search results, relevant

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.690
advertising, or just to learn
how to continually improve our

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.810
algorithms and systems, at
Google, we believe fast is

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.700
better than slow.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.200
And our focus on performance is
very pervasive through the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.670
systems and products we build.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.560
At the core of our data
offerings are services that

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.650
help businesses store and
access their data in the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.500
Google Cloud using the same
technology that we use to run

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.460
our business.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.690
Google Cloud Storage for
unstructured content like

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.260
files and media, the App Engine
Datastore that provides

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.710
a NoSQL environment for
structured data, and Google

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.360
Cloud SQL for relational data.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.860
Google's mission is to
organize the world's

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.870
information and make it
universally accessible and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.050
useful, which meant that we got
very good at finding out

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.460
the meaning of data and
doing so very quickly.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.610
As the business and data
landscapes have evolved, some

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.650
of the problems that we set
out to solve that seemed

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.190
fairly specialized to our
business are now pervasive in

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.240
the industry.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.950
Data is a core business asset,
becoming ever more important

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.500
as a competitive advantage.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.650
There are fewer and fewer
low-hanging fruit.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.560
At the same time, data is
growing faster than most

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.740
organizations' ability to
leverage or even capture it.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.280
Going from a few gigabytes to
several terabytes to petabytes

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.990
of data has fundamentally
changed the tools

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.390
needed to work it.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.760
And traditional BI is struggling
to keep up.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.250
Several commercial and open
source initiatives have sprung

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.730
up to solve these problems,
many of which are based on

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.500
technical papers that Google
wrote to share its innovations

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.710
with the world.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.500
Hadoop is based on Google's
MapReduce technical paper,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.330
HDFS on the Google
File System, and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.780
HBase on Big Table.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.280
In the years since we published
those technical

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.620
papers, our technology has
continued to evolve.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.340
And now, we're starting to make
our latest and greatest

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.250
data tools available as
cloud-based services.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.260
In the Google Cloud, you can
use App Engine to build

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.890
scalable web applications
with high productivity

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.430
and low time to market.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.200
Google BigQuery lets you unlock
the insights hidden in

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.230
large data sets.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.480
And the Google Prediction API
enables you to use Google's

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.310
machine learning technology
with your data.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.490
Beyond storing and accessing
your data, though, we're

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.560
really focused on making that
data useful through an

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.200
integrated platform of data
services, premium APIs, and

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.010
platform services that let you
store, analyze, and leverage

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.650
your data in your own
applications.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.770
I'll talk a bit more about
leveraging your data in the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.420
Google Cloud in a
little while.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.840
Let's first look at the
core data services.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.780
First, Google Cloud Storage.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.840
This product was built from
the ground up to store

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.970
unstructured data with high
reliability, availability, and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.970
performance, and to allow you to
seamlessly scale your data

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.210
as your needs grow.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.130
Data is stored with multiple
levels of redundancy for high

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.830
availability and performance.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.420
One of the many benefits of
using Google Cloud Storage is

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.010
that you put Google's network
to work for you.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.290
When you store your data in the
cloud, you quickly realize

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.910
that cloud services live
and die by the network.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.700
That's been an area of
significant investment by

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.285
Google, and we think it shows
in the quality of service.

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:50.400
At high scale, reliable
storage has many

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.180
uses in and of itself.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.850
In order of increasing value,
you can use it as a tape

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.500
replacement strategy for
your data backups.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.050
Use it for active archives,
storing your data archives in

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.370
the cloud for easy access and
no maintenance overheads.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.900
You can use it for all kinds of
content and media-serving

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.980
applications to quickly and
easily share data with the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.600
organization, with a small or
large group of external

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.900
partners or customers, or freely
over the internet.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.360
You can use it to store data
for your applications or in

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.399
conjunction with some of our
other services for analysis

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.810
and computation.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.510
When most people think about
their structured data

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.380
strategy, they think about
two kinds of products.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.070
NoSQL datastores that offer a
very high scale and support

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.650
for millions of queries per
second, usually in exchange

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.700
for less rich data
representation--

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.620
typically they're denormalized
data--

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.800
and/or tradeoffs in
data consistency.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.210
SQL-based data stores that are
well-suited for applications

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.520
that need relational data, but
cannot deliver the kind of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.380
global scale and performance
that NoSQL stores can.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.230
At Google, we believe that
each has its own place.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.100
The App Engine high-replication
Datastore is

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.760
based on Google's Megastore
technology and combines the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.360
scalability and performance
benefits of a NoSQL data store

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.460
with high availability,
transactional capabilities, a

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.920
flexible query engine, and
strong consistency guarantees.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.310
The Datastore is schemeless,
which means your data

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.330
structure can be flexible and
evolve with your needs.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.860
Unlike many NoSQL solutions,
it doesn't sacrifice

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.610
consistency.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.270
It offers the ability to perform
asset operations

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.640
within transactions and
consistent reads outside.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.400
It's a very reliable
service, too.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.530
Data is written to multiple
data centers, making it

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.430
capable of withstanding multiple
data center failures.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.110
That replication Datastore has
had 100% uptime since its

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.980
launch a year ago.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.590
But to get all these benefits,
you do need to think

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.510
differently.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.810
You can't use tools
that depend on

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.905
traditional SQL databases.

00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:37.070
You need to denormalize
your data.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.140
These tradeoffs make the
Datastore most suitable for

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.540
data sets that need to scale
seamlessly and deliver high

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.660
performance and availability.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.880
For those applications that do
not need the kind of scale

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.190
that the Datastore provides
and that benefit from the

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.070
ability to use a traditional
database, we recently launched

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.720
Google Cloud SQL as an
experimental service that is

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.590
open for public use.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.170
This new service gives you a
fully managed MySQL database

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.280
in the Google Cloud.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.100
So you can use more traditional
tools and

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.240
represent your relational
data effectively.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.760
The data is replicated
for availability.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.940
Once your data is in the cloud,
you can make use of

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.500
other Google technologies.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.980
BigQuery is a fully hosted cloud
data analysis service

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.860
that enables you to get
critical insights from

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.180
multiterabyte data sets at
near real-time speeds.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.070
It's built on Google's
infrastructure based on

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.735
production tools used by Google
to build its own big

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:25.720
data business.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.020
You can perform SQL-like queries
via UI or API to gain

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.040
insights from your data, share
and distribute them, build

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.390
your application dashboards,
et cetera.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.900
It offers some unique
benefits.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.620
You can find a needle
in a haystack.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.130
Tens of terabytes.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.590
You can get near-instant results
in unlimited scale.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.970
No maintenance and no long-term
commitments needed.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.330
We think that BigQuery
represents a discontinuity in

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.100
what you can do with data.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.920
You can reduce time to insight
from weeks to minutes,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.060
allowing your business
to move faster.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.190
You can get straight to business
insights without

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.450
building and maintaining a
data center, developing

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.030
specialized technical
capabilities, or licensing

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.990
expensive software.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.430
You don't need to build
indexes to do

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.160
traditional BI planning.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.940
So you can be more flexible.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.880
Because, let's face it, it's
practically impossible to know

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.570
all the questions you'll
need to ask beforehand.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.810
For when you need to build
data-centric applications, we

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.670
offer Google App Engine, which
lets you build internet-scale

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.760
applications quickly, easily,
and cost-effectively.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.500
You only pay for the resources
you use, which means you don't

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.740
need to do complex capacity
planning or keep large amounts

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.010
of rarely used buffer
capacity on hand.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.060
The data generated by your
applications can be quickly

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.570
analyzed using Google Cloud
Storage and BigQuery.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.190
App Engine is also a great way
to build applications that

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.960
provide reporting, dashboarding,
and other

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.060
capabilities to your business,
your partners,

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.760
or even your customers.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.740
I'd like to spend a couple of
minutes talking about a few

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.950
illustrative cases where people
have leveraged Google's

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.150
technology to power
their data.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.080
DNAnexus is a bay area-based
company focused on unlocking

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.200
the potential of DNA-based
medicine and biotechnology

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.300
with a collaborative and
scalable data technology

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.650
platform built on the cloud.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.440
They wanted to give researchers
around the world

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.780
tools to search for and
access sequence read

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.175
archive data sets.

00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:05.840
They had an ambitious goal--

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.630
to completely re-engineer how
researchers interacted with

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.750
the data, mine results,
and download

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.470
data sets of interest.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.280
By using Google Cloud Storage
to store and serve the data,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.750
they were able to quickly build
a web-based interface to

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.110
the SRA data sets that had
garnered praise from the

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.920
research community.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.260
Crystalloids is an
Amsterdam-based analytics firm

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.000
that helps businesses analyze
massive amounts of data to

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.620
improve profitability.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.312
They first used Google BigQuery
and Cloud Storage to

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:34.159
provide a customized product
for one of their customers.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.190
Based on their success with this
project, they launched

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.270
Crystalloids Innovations,
a subsidiary that offers

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.690
cloud-based tools to the retail

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.159
and hospitality industry.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.780
Daffodil Software provides
a suite of web-based

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.640
applications, including a
business customer relationship

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.190
management--

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.560
otherwise known as CRM--

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.820
program and an enterprise
resource planning--

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.400
ERP--

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.910
app for schools.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.180
Daffodil needed a cloud-based
hosting platform for its

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.920
applications that would
save money and time

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.260
over in-house hosting.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.580
They built their applications
using Google App Engine and

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.910
Google Cloud SQL.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.110
So in conclusion, you can now
put Google's technology to

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.270
work for you.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.130
You can store and access your
structured and unstructured

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.370
data, mine your data for
insights, and build new

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.620
applications and capabilities
quickly and effectively.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.480
In return, you can capture more
data, gain business and

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.720
competitive advantages by
unlocking insights in data

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.390
sets of any size.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.430
And you can do so
cost-effectively.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.480
Thanks for watching.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.100
I hope this helps you understand
how you can use

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.900
Google's infrastructure to store
your applications' data

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.620
and power your business.
