00:00:01.392 --> 00:00:03.600
CHRISTIAN ERICKSEN: The
Android development Immersive

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.110
is a full-time course.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.360
It's a class that takes people
with little or no experience

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.600
coding and aims to have them
be full-on Android Developers.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.000
SCOTT KIRKPATRICK: Android
is the wave of the future.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.360
Creating the next generation
of Android developers

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.400
is so critical to
our mission, it's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.010
so critical to our
global community.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.530
It's changing the world, and
we need to be a big part of it.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.690
JAKE SCHWARTZ: Android is one
of the fastest growing platforms

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.220
in the world, with an
incredible need for developers

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.230
to serve the demand
that there is out there

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.240
and to build applications
on the Android platform.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.070
And so we're really
excited to sort

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.794
of empower both the developer
community as well as students

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.210
CHRISTOPHER SHUM:
Class experience

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.199
has been really great.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.740
We're all from
different backgrounds,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.198
but we all have
the same motivation

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:52.222
for doing this program.

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:53.680
JAMES DAVIS: You
have an instructor

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.430
that will be there to help you
out with whatever you need.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.555
You'll have students that'll
be around you that you

00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:00.030
can feed off of.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.040
We're constantly teaching
each other, constantly

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.337
learning from each other.

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:05.170
DREW MAHRT: We're
building our lesson plans.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.680
We worked with Google
to get an idea of what

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.872
they thought was necessary
for an Android developer

00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:10.580
to be successful.

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.330
JAKE SCHWARTZ:
Partnering with Google

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.580
is always a very exciting thing.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.600
They clearly see the importance
of supporting the developer

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.184
community through
efforts like this.

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:27.600
CHRISTOPHER SHUM:
It's going to be

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.980
exciting to go to Google's
office in New York, so, yeah.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.040
Can't wait.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.540
SARAH CLARK: The
goal of the program

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.350
is to build people
who are really

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.210
ready to get professional work
as Android developers working

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.400
at some at the top
companies in the country.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.980
And we've had Google
guest speakers dial in

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.870
and you can tell
they're doing the work.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.840
They're thinking about it.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.212
MALE SPEAKER: We were there
just this last weekend.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.795
MALE SPEAKER: My day
is going amazing.

00:01:54.795 --> 00:01:56.584
MALE SPEAKER: Hit stop.

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:58.000
ANNA LINDOW: Our
full-time courses

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.730
are intense, exhilarating,
transformative, probably

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.910
at times a little bit
overwhelming, but ultimately,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.487
just life changing.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:11.570
DREW MAHRT: The student
progress has been amazing.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.140
They came from no
experience to being

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.890
able to make Android apps that
are ready for the Play Store.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.540
And seeing the projects
they've been doing lately,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.971
really, they are ready to
jump into the industry.

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:25.470
RASHAD CURETON: They
took you from 0 to 100

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.352
and created a well-rounded
developer in all of us.

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:33.310
ANNA LINDOW: We believe
that mobile development

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.095
is a skill set that is
deeply in demand today.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:38.220
There are not enough mobile
developers in the world

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.315
and we're pleased to be
able to help create more.

00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:43.690
SARAH CLARK: I was really
impressed with General Assembly

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.450
and how they've thought through
the instructional process

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.520
and how it works
for their students.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.770
This is not one of those
where somebody goes home

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.732
and they never use it again.

00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:54.440
These are people that
are really thinking

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.660
about it and passionate
and building apps

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.090
and as someone who teaches,
that's, like, our dream.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.200
ANNA LINDOW:
Completing ADI, we hope

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.680
and we know that
this will happen.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.820
That our students
will zealously enter

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.750
into jobs as Android
developers, making stuff,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.210
building apps they're proud
of, and, ultimately, doing work

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.510
they love.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.560
