00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.530
 Let us have the equation y = x + 3. 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.050
 And I want to display all the ordered pairs of coordinates (x; y) 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.750
 which satisfy this equation. 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.000
 We've done this many times before. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 So we draw our axes. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.250
 This is my axis y. 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.630
 This is my axis. 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.500
 This is my axis x. 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.070
 And the equation is already in the form y = mx + b or 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.540
 in the form of an angular coefficient and an intersection with Ou. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.840
 The intersection with Oy here is equal to 3, 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.690
 and the angular coefficient (gradient) here is 1. 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.840
 So this right will look like this. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.910
 We cross into (0; 3) - 1, 2, 3. 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.190
 B (0; 3). 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.890
 And we have a slope of 1, so with every 1 we move 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.070
 to the right, we will go up with 1. 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.870
 So the rights will look like this. 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.610
 It will look like this. 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.760
 This is a good approximation. 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.770
 So the rights will look like this. 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.380
 And do not forget that when I draw rights, every point of this 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.280
 right is the solution of this equation. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.210
 The dot represents a pair of x and y, which 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.100
 satisfy this equation. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.300
 When you take x = 5, you go on 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.010
 the rights and you will see - watch you when x = 5 on 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.160
 this right, y equal to 8 is the solution. 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.370
 And it will lie on the right. 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.550
 So this is the solution defined by this equation, 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.610
 all pairs of coordinates that satisfy y = x + 3. 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.000
 Let's have another equation. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.180
 Let's say we have an equation y = -x + 3. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.540
 And we want to depict all pairs x and y that are in charge 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 of this equation. 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.630
 We can do the same thing. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.340
 This crosses also in 3, right there. 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.250
 But its slope is -1. 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.880
 So it will look like this. 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.505
 Every time you move to the right with 1, you will 

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:05.870
 go down with 1. 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.980
 Or if you move to the right many times, you will move 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.020
 down as many times. 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.720
 This is the way this equation will look. 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.860
 Each point of this line represents a pair of x and y, which 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.070
 will satisfy this equation. 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.770
 Now if I ask you: is there a pair of x and y, 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.740
 which satisfies both equations? 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.280
 Is there a point or the coordinate that corresponds to the two equations? 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.420
 Let's think. 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.850
 Everything that satisfies this first equation is on this one 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.500
 green right here and everything that suits that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.460
 purple equation, is the purple right there. 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.520
 So what satisfies both? 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.210
 Is there a point that is both right? 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.190
 In essence, this is a point of intersection. 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.150
 So in this situation, this point is on both lines. 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.570
 And this is actually the point of crossing the axis y. 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.660
 So point (0; 3) is both right. 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.090
 This pair of coordinates or this pair (x; y) must respond 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.020
 of both equations. 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.880
 You can try it out. 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.890
 When x is 0 here, 0 plus 3 equals 3. 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.610
 When x is 0 here, 0 plus 3 equals 3. 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.880
 It satisfies both equations. 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.500
 So what we have just done in graphic form is a solution 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.786
 of the system of equations. 

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:26.080
 The system of equations. 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.330
 Let me write it. 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.330
 System of equations. 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.550
 And all this means we have several equations. 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.650
 Each of them limits our x and y. 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.790
 So in this case, the first one is y = x + 3 and 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.140
 then the second one is y = -x + 3. 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.950
 This limits it to a straight line in the plain, that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.810
 limits our solution to another 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.510
 right in the xy plane. 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.600
 And if we want to know the xs and ys that satisfy both simultaneously 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.620
 of them, this will be the intersection of these rules. 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.070
 So, one way to solve these systems of equations is yes 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.270
 draw both lines, the two equations, and then see 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.420
 their intersection point. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.690
 And that will be the solution of both equations. 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.460
 In the next few videos we'll see other ways to 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.850
 solving them, perhaps more 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.430
 mathematical and less graphic. 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.730
 But I really want you to understand the graphic 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.310
 the nature of solving systems of equations. 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.990
 Let's take another example. 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:36.270
 Let's say we have y = 3x - 6. 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.620
 This is one of our equations. 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.040
 Let the other equation be 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.860
 y = -x + 6. 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.220
 And just like the last video, let's draw them both. 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.360
 Let's draw the graphs of the two equations. 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.740
 I'll try to do it as much as I can. 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.950
 Let's draw them. 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.530
 Here. 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.260
 Let's draw a few ... 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.680
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.710
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.410
 And then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.790
 I just had to copy and put some millimeter paper here, 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.470
 but I think it will work. 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.580
 Let's draw this purple equation here. 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.380
 The intersection with the y-axis is -6, so we have ... 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.660
 let me make another division 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.380
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.670
 This is y = 6. 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.150
 And then the slope is 3. 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.510
 So every time you move 1, you go up by 3. 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.370
 You move right to 1, your move is 1, 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.830
 you are rising 1, 2, 3. 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.580
 That's 3, is not it? 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.120
 1, 2, 3. 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.640
 So the equation, the line will look like this. 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.960
 And it seems I'm crossing into 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.080
 (2; 0), which is correct. 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.270
 3 in 2 is 6, minus 6 is 0. 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.830
 Our rights will look something 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.700
 just like that there. 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.560
 That's right there. 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.770
 How about these rights? 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.700
 Our intersection with the y axis is plus 6. 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.850
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.620
 And our slope is -1. 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.630
 So every time we go 1 right, we go down with 1. 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:26.500
 Go 1 right, move 1 down. 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.240
 This will cross ... 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.100
 when y = 0, x is equal to 6. 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.280
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.880
 So, right there. 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.620
 So this right will look like this. 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.300
 I want the graph to get as accurate as possible. 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.730
 We will ask the same question. 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.440
 Which is the pair (x; y) that suits 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.500
 both equations? 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.470
 Okay, look here, this point will be. 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.785
 This point lies on both lines. 

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:04.560
 And let's see if we can find out who this point is. 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.060
 Just looking at the graph here, we seem to be in 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.370
 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3. 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.810
 It seems that this is the same point out there that that 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.820
 is a point (3; 3). 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.370
 I only do it to check my drawing manually 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.080
 graphics, so maybe it's not exactly - 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.250
 let's check this answer. 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.260
 Let's see if x is equal to 3, y is equal to 3, definitely 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.630
 will meet both equations. 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.790
 So, if you check it in the first equation, you get it 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.740
 3 is equal to 3 by 3, minus 6. 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.030
 This is 9 minus 6, which is really 3. 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.350
 So, (3; 3) satisfies the above equation. 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.120
 And let's see if it meets the lower equation. 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.880
 You get 3 = -3 + 6. 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.740
 -3 plus 6 is really 3. 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.487
 So even with our hand-built graphics we were able to explore it 

00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:57.420
 and see that we can find a point 

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.370
 (3; 3) which satisfies 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.450
 both of these equations. 

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.810
 So we were able to solve this system of equations. 

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.160
 When we say a system of equations we have in mind 

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.510
 equations that have many unknowns. 

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.060
 They do not have to be, but are likely to have more than 

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.610
 an unknown one. 

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.310
 And you use each of the equations as a constraint on the variables 

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.860
 and you are trying to find the intersection of the equations, 

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.300
 to find the solution of each of them. 

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.420
 In the next few videos we will see different algebraic ways for 

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.300
 solving these systems, building their graphs and trying to 

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.910
 you find their intersections.
