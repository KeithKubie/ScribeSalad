00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.970
In a previous video, we used
a proof by contradiction

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.844
to show that the square
root of 2 is irrational.

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:07.760
What I want to do in
this video is essentially

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.470
use the same argument but
do it in a more general way

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.860
to show that the square root of
any prime number is irrational.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.925
So let's assume that p is prime.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.990
And we're going to set this up
to be a proof by contradiction.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.080
So we're going to assume
that the square root of p

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.070
is rational and see if this
leads us to any contradiction.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.630
So if something
is rational, that

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.476
means that we can represent it
as the ratio of two integers.

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:40.850
And if we can
represent something

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.230
as the ratio of
two integers, that

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.688
means that we can
also represent it

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:45.800
as the ratio of two
co-prime integers,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.940
or two integers that have
no factors in common.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.820
Or that we can represent it as
a fraction that is irreducible.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.130
So I'm assuming
that this fraction

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.510
that I'm writing
right over here,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.475
a/b, that this right over here
is an irreducible fraction.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:02.850
You say, well,
how can I do that?

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.170
Well, this being rational says
I can represent the square root

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.092
of p as some fraction, as
some ratio of two integers.

00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:13.550
And if I can represent anything
as a ratio of two integers,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.040
I can keep dividing both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.470
by the common factors
until I eventually

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.150
get to an irreducible fraction.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.620
So I'm assuming that's
where we are right here.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.400
So this cannot be reduced.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.260
And this is important for our
proof-- cannot be reduced,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.270
which is another way of saying
that a and b are co-prime,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.800
which is another way of saying
that a and b share no common

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.950
factors other than 1.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.450
So let's see if we can
manipulate this a little bit.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.440
Let's take the
square of both sides.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.320
We get p is equal to-- well,
a/b, the whole thing squared,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.690
that's the same thing as
a squared over b squared.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.010
We can multiply both
sides by b squared,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:07.010
and we get b squared times
p is equal to a squared.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.270
Well, what does this
tell us about a squared?

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.100
Well, b is an integer, so b
squared must be an integer.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.940
So an integer times p
is equal to a squared.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.090
Well, that means that p must
be a factor of a squared.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.120
Let me write this down.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:34.780
So a squared is a multiple of p.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.280
Now, what does that
tell us about a?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.130
Does that tell us that a
must also be a multiple of p?

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.850
Well, to think about
that, let's think

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.400
about the prime
factorization of a.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.150
Let's say that a can
be-- and any number-- can

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.400
be rewritten as a
product of primes.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.240
Or any integer, I should say.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.410
So let's write this out
as a product of primes

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.230
right over here.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.450
So let's say that I have
my first prime factor times

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.520
my second prime factor, all
the way to my nth prime factor.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.370
I don't know how many prime
factors a actually has.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.190
I'm just saying that a is
some integer right over here.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.590
So that's the prime
factorization of a.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.870
What is the prime factorization
of a squared going to be?

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.470
Well, a squared
is just a times a.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.110
Its prime factorization is
going to be f1 times f2,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.820
all the way to fn.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.490
And then that times f1 times
f2 times, all the way to fn.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.050
Or I could rearrange
them if I want.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:40.970
f1 times f1 times f2 times f2,
all the way to fn times fn.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.330
Now, we know that a squared
is a multiple of p. p

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.360
is a prime number,
so p must be one

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.350
of these numbers in the
prime factorization.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.120
p could be f2, or p
could be f1, but p

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.730
needs to be one of these numbers
in the prime factorization.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.494
So p needs to be one
of these factors.

00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:03.160
Well, if it's, let's
say-- and I'll just

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.760
pick one of these arbitrarily.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.790
Let's say that p is f2.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.560
If p is f2, then that means
that p is also a factor of a.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:26.660
So this allows us to deduce
that a is a multiple of p.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.180
Or another way of saying
that is that we can represent

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.530
a as being some integer times p.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.570
Now, why is that interesting?

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.270
And actually, let
me box this off,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.760
because we're going to
reuse this part later.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.980
But how can we use this?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.870
Well, just like we did in the
proof of the square root of 2

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.390
being irrational, let's
now substitute this back

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.570
into this equation
right over here.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.870
So we get b squared times p.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.740
We have b squared times
p is equal to a squared.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.770
Well, a, we're now
saying we can represent

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.600
that as some integer k times p.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:19.890
So we can rewrite that as
some integer k times p.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.660
And so, let's see, if we
were to multiply this out.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.860
So we get b squared times
p-- and you probably

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.700
see where this is going--
is equal to k squared

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.810
times p squared.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.760
We can divide both
sides by p, and we

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.290
get b squared is equal
to p times k squared.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.742
Or k squared times p.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.510
Well, the same
argument that we used,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.320
if a squared is equal to b
squared times p, that let us

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.260
know that a squared
is a multiple of p.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.310
So now we have it
the other way around.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.072
b squared is equal to
some integer squared,

00:06:05.072 --> 00:06:07.030
which is still going to
be an integer, times p.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.760
So b squared must
be a multiple of p.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:17.323
So this lets us know that b
squared is a multiple of p.

00:06:20.041 --> 00:06:22.430
And by the logic
that we applied right

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.265
over here, that lets us know
that b is a multiple of p.

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:31.600
And that's our contradiction,
or this establishes

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.440
our contradiction that we
assumed at the beginning.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.670
We assumed that a
and b are co-prime,

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.220
that they share no factors
in common other than 1.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.000
We assumed that this
cannot be reduced.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.010
But we've just established,
just from this,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.200
we have deduced that
is a multiple of p

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.654
and b is a multiple of p.

00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:54.570
Which means that this
fraction can be reduced.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.970
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by p.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.270
So that is our contradiction.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.560
We started assuming
it cannot be reduced,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.325
but then we showed that, no,
it must be able to be reduced.

00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:05.700
The numerator and
the denominator

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.750
have a common factor of p.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.720
So our contradiction
is established.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.940
Square root of p
cannot be rational.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.347
Square root of p is irrational.

00:07:16.347 --> 00:07:17.430
Let me just write it down.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:25.370
The square root of p
is irrational because

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.460
of the contradiction.
