00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.683
Uh,

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.140
[inaudible].

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.340
<v 1>This video will continue to explore the sound system of Spanish as an example</v>

4
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:15.350
for understanding phonology more generally.

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.060
Last time we looked at consonant and vowel phonemes and elephants.

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.140
This time we're going to work through the stress and syllable structure in Latin

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.460
American Spanish. Let's look at further sets of words in Spanish this time.

8
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:32.090
Paying attention not to the phonemes or did the ELA phones of those phonemes,

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.470
but to the stress

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.150
Si, Si. Oh, Kyla, Kyla. Oh, [inaudible].

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.570
Quinto. Guinta. I leave you. I leave you.

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.333
I leave you.

13
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.690
The words on the right hand side are marked with an asterisk and they don't

14
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:55.830
exist in Spanish.

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.720
So how does stress work in Spanish to push you in the right direction?

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.110
We find that accent plays some role in Spanish,

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.040
but moving the accent to a different syllable doesn't always generate a new

18
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:11.490
word. Some syllables are stressed,

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
but others are unstressed. Let's ask a more basic question.

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.220
How do syllables work in Spanish? In the IPA for language learning,

21
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.500
we looked at possible syllable types.

22
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.330
Now we move on to some examples that give us a sense of the fun, the tactics.

23
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.390
The syllable structure of Spanish a sparrow [inaudible] you'll see low say by

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.790
law. [inaudible]

25
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.680
may fall test to [inaudible] float.

26
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.950
I've given you examples of Spanish accentuation and syllable structure,

27
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.660
but what's going on here is accent contrasted in Spanish?

28
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.890
Meaning do we find minimal pairs that differ in accent placement? Only

29
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.750
reducing syllables to consonant and vowel.

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.540
What types of syllables exist in Spanish?

31
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.530
Please join me next time to start learning about rules and environments.
