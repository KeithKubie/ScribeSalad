00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.850
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: Good afternoon
everyone, and welcome to LJ 119.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.450
We're so happy to see
so many friends,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.290
so many current Kluge fellows and
my predecessor, Carolyn Brown,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.530
who joins us as a friend of
mine and also of our speaker.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.510
And it was under her directorship

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.870
that Peng Guoxiang was
recruited to the Kluge Center.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.260
And we're so happy to present
his lecture tonight as the result

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.600
of a lot of happy years of research
here and in many other places.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.880
Tonight's introduction draws for
me on deep childhood anxieties,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.280
because I grew up as the
child of two sinologists.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.440
My mother is still teaching Chinese
literature at Wellesley College.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.810
My father was a Chinese historian.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.270
And my form of adolescent rebellion
was to refuse to speak Chinese.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.070
And unfortunately, I cannot refuse

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.810
to speak Chinese in
this introduction.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.260
Although, you may wish that I have.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.790
I want to remind you that this
program is being recorded,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.150
so when you ask your
questions afterwards,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.770
if you could speak clearly.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.020
We're so happy to welcome Peng
Guoxiang for many reasons.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.500
He's been a wonderful colleague
here at the Kluge Center.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.870
He's a very deep scholar
of Confucianism

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.250
and its many incarnations.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.700
He's currently professor of Chinese
philosophy and intellectual history

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.710 position:56%
and religion at Zhejiang University,
has taught also at Peking University

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.810
and has held many visiting
appointments at universities

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.270
around the world, including in
Singapore, in Germany, in Taiwan

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.810
and several visiting
fellowships at Harvard University

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.820
where he used the Yenching Library,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.290
which was basically the
unpaid babysitting facility

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.400
where my parents dropped
off my brother and me,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.810
just about every day of the 1970s.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.100
If you read his recent
interview with Dan Turello

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.940
in the Kluge Center blog, you'll
see what a special scholar he is,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.530
because he has gone so deep
into the Library's collection.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.420
He's made a special home in
the Asian reading room here.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.300
And we're all happy that
digitization has arrived,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.840
and it facilitates our
research in so many ways.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.510
But as he has proven, and as I
think we all know intuitively,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.970
there's a lot more to the Library
of Congress than what is available

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.160 position:56%
on the surface, the digital surface.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.360
And while here, he discovered
that we have 41,000 books

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.710
that have not been, that
are early Chinese books

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.010
that have not been digitized.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.960
And so, he has made rich use of
those collections and has added

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.640
to his already amazing
output as a scholar.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.680
The CD I have is a couple of
years old, but it lists no fewer

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.430
than 70 articles that he has
printed, published over the years.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.510
And he has written seven books, and
I'm sure there will be many more.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.590
They include, let me
just say a few of them.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.700
This Worldly Concern of the Wise,
a Political and Social Thought

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.620
of Mou Zongsan, The Unfolding of
Innate Knowledge of the Goodness,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.250
Wang Ji and the Young Ming
Learning of the Mid-Late Ming,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.450 position:56%
Confucian Tradition Between Religion
and Humanism, Confucian Tradition

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.400
and Chinese Philosophy Retrospect
and Prospect in a New Century

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.620 position:56%
and Interpretation and
Speculation of Confucian Philosophy.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.150
So he has taken a very old topic,
Confucianism, and made it ever new.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
And tonight, he will do that
once again with his lecture.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.150
And I'm especially proud to
say that we have a sinologist,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.390
a scholar of China who is holding
the Kluge chair in the countries

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.630
and cultures of the north.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.070
We have never had that before,
never had a China specialist

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.700
in that particular position.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.770
And even though the word
north implies a certain kind

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.420
of Eurocentrism, obviously,
China is north of the equator.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.890
And we're very happy to expand
our horizon in that sense.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.350
So please join me in welcoming
Peng Guoxiang, who will speak

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.590
on understanding Confucianism
as a religious tradition,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.220
salient features and significance.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.820
Thank you.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.120
&gt;&gt; Peng Guoxiang: Thank you Ted.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.930
Thank you for your introduction.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.940
It's my great pleasure and honor
to be appointed as the Kluge chair

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.410
in countries and cultures
of the north.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.340
And I would like to express my
gratitude to Professor [Inaudible].

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.360
Unfortunately, he cannot be here.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.490 position:56%
And Dr. Karen [inaudible], the
former director of the Kluge Center,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.810
and Dr., of course, Dr.
Billington [phonetic]

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.330
and Dr. [Inaudible]
head of Asian Division.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.320
Unfortunately, he's not here too.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.890
Anyway, just one word.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.130
My thanks to all of the people
who have been supporting me.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.050
As a professor of Chinese
philosophy, international history

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.810
and religion and of
Confucianism, in particular,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.360
I would like to introduce
Confucianism,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.500
one of the great traditions
in the world to everyone here.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.470
Confucianism is not
something exclusively Chinese.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:12.230
It has been introduced to developed
and [inaudible] in Japan, Korea,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:19.020
and Vietnam, and other
regions of East Asia.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.630
And now, it is even accepted by
Western people as an integral part

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.900
of their spirituality
and value system.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.840
Example is that two Christian
theologians of Boston University,

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.310
Rob Neville and John Bersome
[phonetic], who were the dean

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.400
and vice-dean of divinity
school, respectively.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.890
And publicly claim that
they are Boston Confucians.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.980
It's very [inaudible] But Chinese
tradition is no doubt the matrix

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.370
of Confucianism.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.870
So what I'm going to say

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.230
about Confucianism is based
upon Chinese tradition.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.970 position:56%
Before we enter into that subject,
I need to clarify that religiousness

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.860
or spirituality is only one
perspective from which to look

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.350
at Confucianism as a tradition.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.460
Confucianism cannot be
exclusively classified

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.720
into any single modern
discipline, philosophy,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.000
religion or ethics and so on.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.350
Let me give you a story.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:42.850
In the 1930s, when asked if
Buddhism can be called a religion

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.820
or philosophy, to [foreign name],
a modern Chinese Buddhist master,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:54.440 position:56%
and he replied, Buddhism is
neither a religion nor a philosophy.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:01.530
On the other hand, it is both
a religion and a philosophy.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.690
And [foreign name]'s
answer seems paradoxical,

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.280
but the meaning is actually simple.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.170
The classification system of modern
western scholarship is not adequate

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.690
for defining Buddhism.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:23.060
Either religion or philosophy is
just one dimension of Buddhism.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.470
The case of Confucianism
is the same.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:32.910
Accordingly, when we look
at it from one perspective,

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.650
it does not mean there
are no other dimensions.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.050
Simply put, although we,
although the talk here and now is

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.120
about Confucianism as a
religious or spiritual tradition,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.970
other dimensions, philosophical,
ethical, historical, institutional

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.160
and so on, are also meaningful.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.250
I actually have more or less
tackled these various aspects too

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.550
in my work.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.080
And my talk includes three parts.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.240
Firstly, I will explore
the question of whether

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:16.750
or not Confucianism can be
understood or can be defined

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.340
as a religious tradition.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.770
And if so, in what sense this
understanding is meaningful.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:29.300
Secondly, I will demonstrate
there has been a strong dialogical

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.880
dimension in the Confucian
tradition all along.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.830
And this dialogicalness [phonetic]
should be understood as one

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.330
of the distinctive
features of Confucianism.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.500
Finally, I would like to point
out there are three contributions

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.770
that Confucianism as a
dialogical tradition can make

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.510
to religious dialogue, a dialogue

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.560
of most civilization
in a global context.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:02.180
These three contributions are
number one, a principle of dialogue

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.190
that [inaudible] harmony
without uniformity.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.680
Number two, a religious
pluralism that refrains

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.350
from those absolutism
and relativism.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.140
And number three, a theoretical
and practical resource

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.930
that entails multiple
religious participation

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:28.070
and multiple religious identities.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.220
Confucianism has been taught in
departments of religious studies

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.810
at universities in
the US for many years.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.470
Yet, for some people, it
is still controversial

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.230
to see Confucianism as a religion.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.210
And the controversies even
the fears and are prolonged

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.620
in Chinese-speaking world.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:54.050
I published a book called
Confucianism Between Religion

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.930
and Humanism by Peking
University Press in 2007.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.000
And a revised version is going
to come out this year too.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.520
And for me, I think I have
already made this issue clear.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.000
Unfortunately, there are
still some, if not many,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.300
ambiguous understandings
and debates.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.200
So let me first offer
answers to the question

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.800
of whether Confucianism
is a religious tradition.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:32.180
Whether or not Confucianism can be
called a religion depends primarily

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.390
upon what understanding
of religion we have.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.330
No doubt, as religion as a modern
western term is written early

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.960
from the Abraham tradition,
as you know,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.440
including Christianity
and Judaism and Islam.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.610
Accordingly, a transcendental
personal god, institution of church

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.270
and a single scripture
become indispensable defining

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.900 position:56%
characteristics of being a religion.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.710
During the 20th century, however,
some Western scholars realized

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.390
that religion encompassed much more

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.600
than the traditional
Abrahamic model.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.390
An increasing contact with
the East suggested to them

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:26.520
that religion need not be
monotheistic or even theistic

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.570
to serve as a civilization
in the same fashion

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:35.790
as Abrahamic tradition
served in the West.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.240
Examples are Buddhism and
Hinduism in South Asia

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.290
and Confucianism and
Daoism in East Asia.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.300
So those Western scholars

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.080
with global consciousness
revised the traditional definition

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.120
of religion and made
it more comprehensive.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.490
Paul Tillich's ultimate concern,
John Hick's human responses

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.390
to the transcendent, and
Frederick Streng's means

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.890
of ultimate transformation
and so on, are all examples

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.980
of this kind of revision.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:20.590 position:56%
And the reason that Wilfred Cantwell
Smith tried to replace religion

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.140
by religiosity or religiousness
is exactly to stress

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.320
that religiosity is one
while various religions

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.640
in the world are just different
manifestations of this one.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.780
Therefore, if we realize that
the call of a religion lies

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.340
in its religiousness,
religiosity of spirituality,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.540
which intends to make
people have an ultimate

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.300
and creative transformation rather
than in its particular form,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.770
such as those features that simply
belong to Abrahamic tradition.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:04.090
Our understanding of religion
should be revised and enlarged.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:10.050
If we know that Buddhism is
originally an atheism that strives

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:15.920
for personal liberation, and Daoism
has never accepted the separation

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.470
between this world and the world of
all kinds of spirits between body

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:26.790
and heart mind, and if we
cannot deny that both Buddhism

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.210
and Daoism are two kinds
of religion in the world,

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.180
we must embrace the idea

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:39.880
that Confucianism should be
considered as a religion.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.730
Why? Because it has provided
a resource, both spiritual

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.350
and practical, for human beings to
become great persons, [inaudible]

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:56.710
and noble persons [inaudible]
and [inaudible] in Chinese

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.770
by [inaudible] and
strenuous self-cultivation.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:07.710
Distinctively, a Confucian way
of ultimate transformation,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:13.580
the achievement of becoming a
great person, a noble person,

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:20.330
and a sage through self-cultivation
does not mean a leap of faith

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.820
from humanity to divinity
in [inaudible].

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:32.330
Rather, it precisely links the
full and perfect realization

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:37.290
of our achievement
of humanity itself.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.880
So Confucianists, together with
some other spiritual traditions

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.320
in the world, should be understood
as a religious tradition,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.850
although it does not necessarily
have the features of monotheism,

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.620 position:56%
nor is it necessarily institutional.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.120
In addition to the
definition of religion,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.210
there are still two
criteria of judgment

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:09.750
that make us consider Confucianism
as a religious tradition.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.380
First, Confucianism has
already been accepted

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:21.180
by other religious traditions
as an indispensable counterpart

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.690
in the religious dialogue
around the world.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:31.580 position:56%
Internationally, for many scholars,
treating Confucianism is a spiritual

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.530
and religious tradition has been
an unquestioned starting point

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.440
for further relevant discussions.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.310
A few books in the English-speaking
world on Confucianism

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.460
from the perspective of religious
studies have been published

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.140
since the 1970s.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.450
Quite a few international
conferences on the dialogue

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.250
between Confucianism and
Christianity have been held

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.620
in Hong Kong, Boston, and Brooklyn.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.960
And all these are exactly
reflections of this point.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.630
Secondly, we usually
acknowledge that the insiders

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:17.200
of a tradition have priority in
defining their own traditions.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.590
A consensus shared
by representatives

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:25.330
of contemporary Confucian
scholars is acknowledgement

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:30.050
of the religious dimension
of the Confucian tradition.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.440
For example, [foreign name],
a noted Confucian philosopher

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.090
of 20th century China,
clearly articulated

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:43.340
that Confucianists should be
understood as religious tradition.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.100
And he has once even claimed

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.190
that Confucianists
should be reestablished

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.520
as an institutional religion.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.280
And the [inaudible] a
contemporary of [Foreign Name]

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.760
and another distinguished
Confucian philosopher,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:09.060 position:56%
delivered a lecture entitled
Confucianism as a religion, in 1959,

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.660
many years ago, which was
included as a chapter in his book,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.180
Characteristics of
Chinese Philosophy.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:23.020
A well-known manifesto of
contemporary Confucianism drafted

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.060 position:56%
by these scholars [Foreign Name]
and jointly signed by [Foreign Name]

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:34.950
and [Foreign Name]
was published in 1958.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:40.980
I think it particularly
stressed the religious nature

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.020
of Confucian tradition.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.880
So when we carefully scrutinize
the history of Confucianism,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.810
we should be aware
that the development

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:57.810
of the Confucian tradition is
actually a process of dialogue,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.810
including those dialogue
with other traditions

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.670
and a dialogue among different
schools of ramifications

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.910
within the Confucian
tradition itself.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.750
It is this dialogical
dimension of dialogicalness

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.630
that enables Confucianism to
be more and more enriched.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:24.560
Here, let me take Confucianism in
the Chines and East Asia context

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.550
as an example of this
dialogical dimension.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:36.370 position:56%
When it emerged in the preaching
period, roughly the 6th century BCE,

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.820 position:56%
Confucianism was only one of various
intellectual trends among the

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.140
so-called [inaudible] in Chinese.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.860
Literally, many masters
and hundreds of schools.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.550
But through dialogue with other
masters and schools, Confucianism,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.220
which started locally, you
know, in [inaudible] Province,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:03.500 position:56%
eventually became the dominant value
system of Chinese civilization.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:10.000
Furthermore, even the thought
of Confucius himself was shaped

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.610
and developed from his
dialogue with his students.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.740
If we look both at the [inaudible],

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.830
which is without doubt
the authoritative record

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:29.130
of Confucius' thought, and at some
newly unearthed Confucian text he

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:34.680
scribed on some bamboo sticks found
in the 1990s, we can recognize

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.550
that almost all Confucius said
was in a dialogue with others,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:46.470
including his students, friends,
acquaintances, passersby,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.130
strangers, and even his rivals.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.700
From the Han Dynasty to the
Ming and Qing Dynasties,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.490
namely from the 7th century to
the 18th century, the development

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.920
of Confucianism was
particularly characterized

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:08.460 position:56%
by a dialogue process inside China
after a long and productive dialogue

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.330
with Buddhism and Daoism.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.800
Classical Confucianism
was transformed

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.460
into a new paradigm known
as neo-Confucianism,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:21.870
N-E-O/Confucianism, which
have solved the many Buddhist

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:27.820
and Daoist ideas without
giving up its own identity.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.270
Also, through invalid dialogue
with local civilizations,

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.430
various new Confucian traditions

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.700
with their own cultural
characteristics,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.740 position:56%
was shaped in Japan, Korea,
Vietnam and other East Asian regions

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.030
after Chinese Confucianism was
introduced into these areas.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:51.980
In this period, it is
no exaggeration to say

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.080
that Confucianists, in
general, played an important

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.770
or evening leading role in the
whole of East Asian civilization.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.360
If East Asian civilization
can be differentiated

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.100
from Western civilization,
West Asia civilization

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:15.720
and its Abrahamic religions and
from South Asia civilization

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.170
and its Hinduism and Buddhism,
the defining religious tradition

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.010
in East Asia civilization
is nothing but Confucianism.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:31.140
Briefly, throughout the process in
which Confucianist was transformed

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.690
into assuming a leading role
of East Asia civilization

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.500
from simply Chinese,
a striking feature

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.840
of Confucianism [inaudible]
is dialogicalness.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.300
From the late Qing
Dynasty until now,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.540
Confucianist has emerged
into another period.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:56.310
In this period, one of the
most important features

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:01.580
of new Confucianism is also
its dialogical dimension,

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:08.770
compared with the previous dialogue
among different branches inside the

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.940
Confucian tradition and
its dialogue with Buddhism,

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.470
Daoism, Christianity and Islam.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.700
The dialogue of Confucianism
is with the whole

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:23.370
of the Western spiritual world is
omnidirectional and multilevel.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:28.870 position:56%
In contrast to traditional Confucian
scholars, modern Confucius,

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:35.250
I mean Confucius from the 20th
century until now, have to face

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.800
and understand the
complexity and diversity

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.740
of various traditions in the world.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:47.510
In this sense, the burden is much
heavier than ancient Confucius.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:53.330
For example, both [inaudible]
engaged in lifelong dialogue

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.670
with Western philosophical
tradition,

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.190
especially German idealism.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.590
Their understanding of Western
philosophy not only goes far beyond

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.990
the teacher [foreign name], the
initiator of modern Confucianist,

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.740
but also surpasses
some Chinese scholars

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.660
who are specialized
in Western philosophy.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.430
As for [foreign name], a
great Confucian historian

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:26.630
and Kluge prize winner in 2006, his
understanding of Western culture,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.690
in general, and Western
history, in particular,

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:33.390
surpasses that of his teacher
[foreign name], a great master

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:39.080
of Chinese traditional learning
in the 20th century China.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.090
Now, as we know, religious
dialogue can be further divided

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.990
into two types, interreligious
dialogue

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.210
and intrareligious dialogue.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.910
The former refers to the
dialogue among different

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.320
religious traditions.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.640
For example, the dialogue between
Confucianism and Christianity.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.100
The dialogue between
Christianity and Buddhism.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.150
The dialogue between
Hinduism and Islam, and so on.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:13.040
The latter refers to the dialogue
among different branches or schools

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.180
within one religious tradition.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.280
For instance, the dialogue
among Baptists, Methodists

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.140
and Evangelicals in Christianity.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:29.310
But whatever perspective we take,
it is pretty clear that the history

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.360
of Confucianism is a
dialogical process.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.060
First, let us look at the
development of Confucianism

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.450
from the perspective of
intrareligious dialogue.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.560
I already mentioned the dialogical
feature of Confucius thought.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.370
After Confucius, Confucianists even

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:54.890
in preaching period was
already complicated.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.250
Different branches
were always in a state

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.050
of dialogue and sometimes conflict.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:05.340
Typically, two different
orientations initiated respectively

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.570
by [inaudible] were developed

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.020
into an enduring dialogue
by latter Confucians.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.640
Although Confucianists in
the Han Dynasty, in general,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.130
focused on commentary on the
classics, a different approaches

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:24.950
and their debates, especially
[foreign name] and [foreign name],

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.960 position:56%
among others, were also reflections
of the dialogue within Confucianism.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.640
As for neo-Confucianists, a
well-known debate occurred in 11/75

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.070 position:56%
between [foreign name], probably
the most important Confucius scholar

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.950
after Confucius.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.100
And [foreign name] another
brilliant Confucian scholar

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:50.260
and [inaudible] contemporary,
reflected two different approaches

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.900
to the Confucian learning
in new Confucian tradition,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.320
and was not only polemic,
but also dialogical.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.070
Furthermore, the leading,

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:06.160
the learning of the [foreign name]
School was particularly shaped,

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.340
not only through dialogue with the
learning of [foreign name] but also

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:15.600
through dialogue among many
brilliant students and followers

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.130
of [foreign name] basically
in 16th and 17th century.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.170 position:56%
And most works recording the thought

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:29.120
of almost all new Confucian
masters recount the discussions

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.570
and correspondence
with their students,

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.510 position:56%
colleagues, friends, or even rivals.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.430
This is an outstanding feature

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.470
that indicates the strong
dialogical dimension

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.970
of new Confucian tradition.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:49.120
Secondly, from a perspective
of interreligious dialogue,

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.990
the dialogue between Confucianism,
Buddhism and Daoism reached a peak

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.340
in the late Ming Dynasty.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.560
And new Confucianists
per se was the result

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.870
of this interreligious dialogue,
which lasted hundreds of years.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:11.540
The so-called East Asian
consciousness was precisely shaped

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:17.620
by the dialogue of Chinese
Confucianism, with local cultures

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.890
in Japan, Korea, Vietnam and so on.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.840
This has already been
mentioned previously.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.570
Now I would like to add
a couple of examples

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.980
to highlight the fruitful products
resulting from the dialogue

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:39.990
between Confucianism and
Christianity and Islam in China.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.310
And those great Confucian
Christians such as [foreign names],

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.590
who all lived in the
late Ming Dynasty,

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.280
namely the 16th and 17th century.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.000
Or even the Confucianized
[inaudible] missionary [foreign

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.790
name], also of the late Ming
Dynasty, have already been studied.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:08.090
Recently, the thought of [foreign
names], which represents some

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:13.130 position:56%
of the most important achievements
of the dialogue between Confucianism

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:20.310 position:56%
and Islam, also in the 16th and 17th
century have also received global

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.680
scholarly attention.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.290
I do not need to particularly
stress this biological dimension

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:29.590
of Confucianism.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:34.450
Some great Western minds have
already realized its point.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:39.750
For instance, William de Bary, a 97
years old distinguished professor

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.110
of Columbia University, believes

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:47.200
that the dialogical imperative
has always been embodied

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.440
in the Confucian tradition,
as an integral part

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.170
of East Asian civilization.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:59.480
Actually, when we look at
Chinese history, we should realize

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.630
that the Chinese people have
embraced almost every world

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.590
religious tradition.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:11.650
Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism
and Islam, let along Confucianism

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.150
and Daoist and the various
indigenous popular religions.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:21.110
It is precisely because of
this intrinsic dialogicalness

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:26.970
of Confucianism and the
arrival of globalization

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:32.300
that religious dialogue, as
I've been trying to argue,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.960
must be a leading project

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.170
of the 21st century
Confucianism in a global context.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:42.500
As a matter of fact, one
of the [inaudible] features

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:49.390 position:56%
for the development of
contemporary Confucianists is moving

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.790
in this exact direction.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:57.830 position:56%
Now, with the wave of globalization,
religious dialogue has become one

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.560
of the most striking
issues in the world.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:07.590
Globalization means not only
a process of homogenization

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:12.050 position:56%
but also a process of heterogeneity.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:17.100
The reason for the latter is
the differences among various

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.120
religious traditions.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.860
Therefore, how to treat
those differences and try

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.430
to alleviate the clash
of civilization caused

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.280
by religious conflict
through dialogue instead

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.570
of confrontation has become an
urgent issue for the good life

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.290
of every people in the world.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:42.360
Actually, an essential aspect
of the clash of civilization,

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.590
even in [inaudible] is
still more religious

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.680
than political, economic and so on.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.740
In [inaudible] statement, there
can be no peace among the nations

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.060
without peace among the religions.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.600
And no peace among the religions

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:05.550 position:56%
without dialogue among the religious
has been validated by history

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.400
and become a consensus
among people of religion.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.220
So in my view, according to
what is has done in history,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:20.270
a dialogical Confucianist can
make at least three contributions,

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:25.990
both conceptually and practically
to a global religious dialogue.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:31.060
The first is a principle of
dialogue [foreign word] in Chinese.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:36.800
Which, from Confucius, means
harmony without uniformity.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.520
Until now, most participants
offer religious dialogue

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:46.560
in the world already have
realized that the purpose

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.000 position:56%
of dialogue should not and cannot be

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.840
to transform others'
beliefs into their own.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:00.710 position:56%
Otherwise, the result is monologue
rather than dialogue and [inaudible]

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:05.020 position:56%
and unavoidably leading to conflict.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:09.370
Dialogue should be a
process of mutual learning.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.950
The minimum purpose
of dialogue should be

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.750
to deepen mutual understanding.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.830
Although mutual understanding
does not necessarily mean a mutual

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:26.440
appreciation, it is a precondition
for minimizing the possibility

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.130
of the large-scale clash

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:33.800
of civilization caused
by religious conflict.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.890
In the Confucian tradition,
the principle harmony

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.870
without uniformity advocated

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.970
by almost every Confucian
throughout history,

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:48.870
has always been respected
as a way of coexistence.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.330
This principle means every
individual shares a stance

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.190
of togetherness and
integration, while his

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:00.830
or her individuality
is fully developed.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:04.170
Obviously, this should
be a base principle

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:09.190
for global religious dialogue
at present and in the future.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:14.580
Maybe the based state that
we can hope to achieve.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.420
There are two extremes
about religious dialogue.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:25.090
One is a particularism that
believes dialogue is fruitless,

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:29.080
and there cannot be
helpful communication

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.090
between different religions.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:36.310 position:56%
The other is a universalism that
believes dialogue is the [inaudible]

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:42.800
that can lead people with
different religious backgrounds

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.670
to a homogeneous state.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:52.750 position:56%
By contrast, the Confucian principle
of harmony without uniformity

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.180
which goes beyond excessive
pessimism

00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:00.160
and optimism can provide a
reasonable and visible [inaudible]

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.020
for global religious dialogue.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:10.050
The second contribution
is Confucian pluralism.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:15.970
Now we know that the attitude
a religion takes toward other

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.070
religious tradition can
be pathologically divided

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.650
into three categories.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:27.170
Exclusivism, inclusivism,
and pluralism.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:32.970
An exclusivist denies the value
of other religious traditions

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.510
and acclaims as a monopoly
of religion truth.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:42.310
An inclusivist concedes that
other religions can have truth,

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:47.760
but he or she will say the truth
other religions have is already

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:53.190 position:56%
included in his or her own religion,
and this truth is not ultimate.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:36:01.220
Only his or her religion can
reveal the ultimate truth.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.000
Anonymous Christians is an
example of this standpoint.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.070
The third one is the
religious pluralism.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:14.500
It is now a very influential
trend which not only accepts

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.910
that other religions
can reveal truth

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.570
but also realizes the
particularity or limitation

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.140
of every religious tradition.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.510
A [inaudible] to inclusivism,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:32.850
this standpoint does not presuppose
the priority of a certain religion.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:38.790
A religious pluralist believes that
every religion can provide a way

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.840
of ultimate transformation.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.430
As John Hicks' metaphor suggested,

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.080
all religions in the
world should be considered

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.010
as a rainbow of humans' face.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:54.720
They are different reflections
of the same light of divinity.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:02.850
Of course, every religion cannot
be simply and absolutely clarified

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.160
into any one of these three types,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.580
while every religion can
simultaneously include these three

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.610
attitudes toward other religions.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.630
Because of its openminded
standpoint,

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.390
religious pluralism has
been increasingly accepted

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.620
by more and more liberal minds.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.460
But, pluralism in general,
has to face the danger

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.860
of becoming a kind of a relativism.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.890
Pluralism with an implication

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:39.200
of relativism apparently
can't accept every religion.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.710
But actually denies there
can be a unified truth

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.110
of the argument in the cosmos.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:52.180
It is not willing to or
cannot seriously consider

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:59.740
that different religions can treat
the unified truth of the ultimate

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:05.340 position:56%
in different ways and stress
different aspects of the same truth.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:10.230
It consequently undermines
the necessity

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.760
of dialogue among religions.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.790
So the significance of
a Confucian pluralism is

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:22.330
that Confucianists throughout
its history has developed a

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:23.740
middle ground.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:29.730 position:56%
As a dialogical tradition, Confucian
religious pluralists advocates

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.420
that on the one hand,

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.330
every religious tradition
is a manifestation

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.850
of the way all a unified
truth of the ultimate,

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:46.740 position:56%
while the absolute truth that every
religion claims is only a convenient

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.540
way [inaudible] in Buddhism
or relative absolute.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:57.200
Not the absolute per se,
at the ultimate truth.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:03.130
On the other hand, the
ultimate and the unified truth

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:07.690
of the ultimate should be
acknowledged, no matter whether

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:11.010
or not this ultimate reality

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.500
and truth can be clearly
uttered with one accord.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:22.350
I've named this distinctive
feature of Confucian pluralism

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:23.650
as the [foreign language]
in Chinese,

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.740
a term from the new
Confucianism, which literally

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.670
and roughly means one
principle, many manifestations.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:36.470
The third contribution a
Confucianist can make is a

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:42.090
conceptual and practical resource
of multiple religious participation

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.120
and multiple religious identity.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.550
And multiple religious
participation means a believer

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:52.760
in a religion fully getting
involved in another religion

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.250
or other religions and eventually
becomes an inner participant rather

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.920
than an outer observer.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.650
Accordingly, once one becomes
not only an inner participant

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:12.220
but also a believer in another
religion or other religions,

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.960
while not giving up his or
her original religious faith,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.910
this person already has
multiple religious identities.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:26.530 position:56%
Both multiple religion participation

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.460
and multiple religious
identities were issues raised

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:36.760
by contemporary Western theologians
or scholars in religious studies

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:43.030 position:56%
against a background of global
dialogue, global religious dialogue.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:47.860
For a conventional believer
in Abrahamic tradition,

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.400
multiple religious
participation is a very difficult,

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.610
if not totally impossible.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.080
And multiple religious
identities are basically, I think,

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.260
beyond this author
ability to imagine.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:06.320 position:56%
But religious dialogue in academia
or real religious dialogue motivated

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:12.880
by globalization, especially as
part of the wave of integration,

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.200
compel this issue to
become a focal awareness

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.740
of Western religious people.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:24.730
Intriguingly, in China or East
Asia, there has been a long history

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:29.730
of multiple religious participation
and multiple religious identities.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:35.060
In the dialogical history of
Confucianism, a rich experience

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.490
about multiple religious
participating

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:43.230
and multiple religious identities
has already been accumulated.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.880
In other words, for the
Confucian tradition,

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.150
multiple religious participation

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.830
and the multiple religious
identities have already been

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:56.390
at preconditioned or starting
point for further consideration

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.930
of relevant questions instead

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:03.520
of a problem still needing
to be wrestled with.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.760
For example, there were many
brilliant Confucians who went back

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:14.620
and forth with ease among
Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.660
in the late Ming Dynasty.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.690
They, on the one hand, deeply
engaged in the spiritual growth

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:27.720
of both Buddhism and Daoism,
including frequently communicating

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.780
with Buddhists and
Daoists, establishing deep

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.550
and lasting friendships with them.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:40.650
Making commentaries on publishing
Buddhist and Daoist classics.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:47.180 position:56%
And even practicing Buddhist
meditation and Daoist inner alchemy.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.590
On the other, they still had
their strong Confucian commitment

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.140
and identity.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:57.230
Or they still defined
themselves as Confucian rather

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.100
than Buddhists or Daoists.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.970
And even now, many temples
established in different dynasties

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:10.920
in Chinese history still
offer sacrifices to Confucius.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.180
Laozi, as you might know, the
founder of Daoism, and Buddha,

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.940
in one house at the same time.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:23.770
And all this exactly reflections
of multiple religious participation

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.140
and multiple religious identities.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.710
As Paul [inaudible] observed,

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:34.200
the life of the Chinese people
has always been with diversity

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.850 position:56%
of religious experience and history,

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:42.870
and a positive attitude toward
this diversity has accordingly

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.700
been developed.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.570
In this sense, we can
say that the ease

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.720
of multiple religious participation

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:57.530
and religious identity has
already acquired its answered,

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.770
both conceptual and practical

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.610
in a dialogical Confucian
tradition with a plural vision.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:10.980
So I do believe that more
resources from Confucianism

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.270
if primarily transformed
can contribute

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:21.550
to the global religious dialogue
in an age of dialogue or death.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:26.180
The story of the so-called Boston
Confucianism, which I mentioned

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.160
at the very beginning,
is very inspiring.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.330
Both Robert Neville
and John Bersome,

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:37.290
who are sincere Christian
Methodist ministers and professors

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:43.970
of Christianity have claimed
that they are also Confucians

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:49.510
since they also espouse the
core values of Confucianism.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:55.660 position:56%
Robert Neville even published a book
exactly called Boston Confucianism,

00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:00.670
Portable Tradition in
the Late-Modern World.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:09.400
No doubt, the emergence of Boston
Confucianism is the newest example

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:14.410
of, I think it's the
newest example demonstrating

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:17.240
that multiple religious
participating

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.660
and multiple religious identities
have already been happening

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.250
between Confucianism and
Christianity in the US.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:30.600
This case also indicates
that the leading project

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.300
of contemporary Confucianists

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.610
in a global context is
primarily the development

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:42.250
for the religious and
spiritual dialogue.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:49.130
Last, but not least, I would
like to say, and I do believe

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:51.370
that the dialogicalness

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:58.410 position:56%
and the contributive resources
discussed just now are not exclusive

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.890
to the Confucian tradition.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.640
We can definitely find
similar virtues,

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.620
more or less the other religious

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.790
or spiritual traditions
in the world as well.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:14.350
If this part of every tradition in
the world can be jointly advocated

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:20.200
and promoted, a good life for all
human beings based upon solidarity,

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.270
harmony and common good,
would be eventually realized.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:29.520
And it's not an unreachable
idea anymore.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.100
So let me stop here.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.900
Thank you all.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.200
