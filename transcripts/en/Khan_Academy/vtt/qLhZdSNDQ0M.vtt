00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:02.885
- [Instructor] We are told
the differentiable function h

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:05.210
and its derivative h prime are graphed

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.214
and you can see it here, h is in blue

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:10.560
and then its derivative h
prime is in this orange color.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.278
Four students were asked to give

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:15.370
an appropriate
calculus-based justification

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.288
for the fact that h is increasing

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:19.491
when x is greater than zero.

00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.074
Can you match the teacher's
comments to the justifications?

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.846
So before I even look at
what the students wrote,

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:28.124
you might say, hey, look,
I can just look at this

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:31.701
and see that h is increasing
when x is greater than zero

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:33.613
but just by looking at the graph of h,

00:00:33.613 --> 00:00:36.139
that by itself is not a
calculus-based justification.

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:37.281
We're not using calculus.

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:38.342
We're just using our knowledge

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:40.461
of what it means for a
graph to be increasing.

00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.953
In order for it to be a
calculus-based justification,

00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:44.500
we should use calculus in some way.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.310
So maybe use the derivative in some way.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.981
Now, you might recognize

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.873
that you know that a
function is increasing

00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:54.361
if its derivative is positive.

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.403
So before I even look at
what the students said,

00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:59.341
what I would say, my
calculus-based justification,

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:01.544
and I wouldn't even have
to see the graph of h,

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:03.418
I would just have to
see the graph of h prime

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:07.166
is to say, look, h prime is greater than,

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.214
h prime is positive when
x is greater than zero.

00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:12.332
If the derivative is positive

00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:13.272
then that means that the slope

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.866
of the tangent line is positive

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.635
and that means that the graph
of the original function

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:18.980
is going to be increasing.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.366
Now, let's see whether one
of the students said that

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:23.019
or what some of the other students wrote.

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.707
So can you match the teacher's comments

00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:27.384
to the justifications?

00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:30.529
So one student wrote, the
derivative of h is increasing

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.733
when x is greater than zero.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.373
So it is indeed the case that
the derivative is increasing

00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:38.462
when x is greater than zero

00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:41.488
but that's not the justification
for why h is increasing.

00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:43.605
For example, the derivative
could be increasing

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:45.034
while still being negative

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:47.563
in which case h would be decreasing.

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:50.752
The appropriate justification
is that h prime is positive,

00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:52.218
not that it's necessarily increasing

00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:54.909
'cause you could be increasing
and still not be positive.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:55.971
So let's see.

00:01:55.971 --> 00:02:00.138
I would say that this doesn't
justify why h is increasing.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.044
When x is greater than zero,

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:09.211
as the x-values increase, the
function values also increase.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.559
Well, that is a justification
for why h is increasing

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:15.660
but that's not calculus-based.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.786
In no way are you using a derivative.

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:21.824
So this isn't a
calculus-based justification.

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:23.657
It's above the x-axis.

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:27.232
So this one, what is it?

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.137
Are they talking about h?

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:31.460
Are they talking about h prime?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.800
If they were saying that h
prime is above the x-axis

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.571
when x is greater than zero
then that would be a good answer

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:42.834
but this is just what is above the x-axis

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.345
and over what interval?

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:46.874
So I would actually, let's
scroll down a little bit,

00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:49.405
this looks like a good thing
for the teacher to write.

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:51.403
Please use more precise language.

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:54.424
This cannot be accepted as
a correct justification.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.425
And then finally, this last student wrote,

00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.899
the derivative of h is positive
when x is greater than zero

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:00.841
and it is indeed the case.

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:03.546
If your derivative is positive,

00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:05.297
that means that your original function

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:07.751
is going to be increasing
over that interval.

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.918
So kudos, you are correct.
