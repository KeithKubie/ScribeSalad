00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Hey, you remember "A Kid in King Arthur's
Court"?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.630
Yeah, you ever wonder what the director
of that movie did before he made that

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.980
little masterpiece?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.359
Well, not that much can really top "A Kid in King Arthur's Court" but he did

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.699
manage to direct a few films before it,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.910
one of them, surprisingly enough, starring
Hulk Hogan.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.370
This is Mr. Nanny.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.840
Why do wrestlers continue to punish themselves by being in movies?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.160
They just so rarely work and Hulk Hogan is the prime example of that.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
I mean, you thought Suburban Commando was bad. That at least had a few cute scenes.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.430
This is just the ass shavings of what was
popular at the time:

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.590
"Home Alone" slapstick, top secret plot
devices, family life lessons, and big

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.110
tough stars doing silly, goofy things.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.219
All that's missing is a pet chihuahua
with sunglasses. But hey, what good does it do

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.959
do to bitch about it?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.580
A lot. But I have a review to do so let's take a look at "Mr. Nanny".

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.130
So as the credits roll, we see that Hulk Hogan is having nightmares about back

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.530
when he was a wrestler, probably like how
nowadays he's having nightmares about Mr. Nanny.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.470
He wakes up to be greeted by a
character named Bert, who I'm guessing just

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.450
moved on up from the east side to
finally get a piece of the pie.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.260
"I just got a call from major, major new client. He's looking for a bodyguard."

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.640
"I'm not a body guard. I'm a wrestler, ok? I am a wrestler."
Actually, I think this is how the offer

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.950
for the movie went down, too. "I want you to do this movie--" "No, I'm a wrestler." "Exactly, you're

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.100
an actor." "I said I'm a wrestler." "Ah, they're both the same thing."

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.540
So of course he takes the job as he goes
to meet up with his rich client

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.600
Max, from the Muppet Movie. "You're asking him to do something terrible. I can't be a part of it."

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.780
"Where do you think you're going?" "I'm looking
for Mr. Mason."

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.820
"Get off the bike." "What for?" "Just do it butthead!" 
Whoa.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.140
"Forget it." "Are you deaf or just plain stupid?"
Neither, I'm blonde. "Just got a real low

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
tolerance for gorillas in rent-a-cop
suits."

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.530
Dude, just calm down, you're not
American Gladiators. And even if you were

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.970
it'd probably get cancelled.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.510
"It's just the body guard." "Terrible
mistake, sir. I'll get rid of him immediately."

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.260
"Wrong. He's incredible, obviously a real pro."

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.099
Yes, only a real pro would lose his temper,
throw a rampage, and be totally

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.540
impossible to control.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.670
I see this working well. "So where is Mason's
office?"  So we see the reason he hires

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.549
Hogan is because he's getting attacks
and phone calls from your average

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.220
psychotic criminal genius. "Who the hell
are you?"

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.940
"Just your average psychotic criminal
genius."

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.799
You think it says that on his business card?
"I desire your new computer chip."

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.220
Yeah, there's a top secret computer chip
in this movie.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.519
Apparently it has information on a gun
that can shoot any kind of missile

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.480
imaginable.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.230
Is it me or is this sounding like a
story a ten-year-old boy would come up with?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.519
"And there's an evil genius who wants
the top-secret microchip and he can shoot

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.159
down missiles by using Mr. Freeze's gun and
then

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.039
Hulk Hogan comes in! But he's wearing
a tutu and acting all girly!

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.519
And then Mr. Jefferson comes in because my
mom really likes The Jeffersons and

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.840
would like to see him in my movie film. Awesome!!!

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.580
"You're supposed to guard my kids."

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.060
"Oh, you're out of your mind. I hate kids." "Listen, the children have a nanny. All you have

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.379
to do is protect them."

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.949
So he meets the two little kids, one named Kate and the other named Alex

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.940
who I swear to God is a heavier version of
the kid from Kazaam, isn't he?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.030
"Apparently Ms. Kapalski had a short-circuit in her blow dryer."

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.079
"Oh, this is very bad. Now the agency won't send us any more nannies."

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.290
So now Hogan has two jobs: body guard and nanny.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.220
A "Mr. Nanny" if you will. Oh, the idea
of a male nanny nowadays. Preposterous.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.569
But it's okay, he has help from
the maid, played by an actress named

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.349
Mother Love 
who obviously shouldn't have that name

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.260
"What are you doing in my kitchen!?" "I'm
Sean Armstrong" "Here, make yourself useful."

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.590
"Dash off, Lurch."
Oh, just put a bow on her
and call her precious. No, not that

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.750
Precious. But that was a good movie. 
So he enters his room where he sees a wire was

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.419
mysteriously laid out across the floor.
Here you will see the Hulk Hogan trying

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.860
his best to turn his primitive wheels
and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.990
overcome the obstacles of everyday
appliances. The everyday appliances win.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.539
So yeah, as you may have guessed, the kids set up traps all along the house for him.

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.490
Like I said, Home Alone was very popular
at the time.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.490
"Now, you alright?" 
"Never better."

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.620
Dude, that was fucking glass!

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.170
That's not funny! You should go to the
hospital!

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.180
"I'll tell you what, after we eat, why don't we all go out and get some ice cream?"

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.020
"Yeah!" *beep beep*
"Dad, you're beeping."

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.580
Oh it's my douche-o-meter. It says I'm to
neglect you kids and let you down until

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.870
the climax of the movie.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.170
Well, can't fault an overused formula. Later. 
"Come on, Kate." "I'm not hungry anymore."

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.740
So even though the father is never
around and the mother died of the fatal

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.919
off-camera disease, we see the kids
manage to keep some hobbies.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.350
Tell DeeDee to stay out of my room!

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.030
So after the kids annoy him some more,
Hogan talks with Bert to see if he can

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.710
get out of the job.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.420
Again, listen to this and tell me they're not
talking about Hogan acting in this movie.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.510
"You want to spend the rest of your life
getting your brains kicked in, suit yourself,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.740
but let me clue you in on something.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.220
Ex-wrestlers aren't exactly in demand, you
know. I mean, who else is going to offer you a career?"

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.680
Kind of eerie, isn't it?

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.760
So it turns out the kids are divising
more traps that even Jonny Quest

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.940
couldn't figure out as they hook up a
giant magnet to the ground.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.180
Faster. Faster!

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.300
Haha, it's funny because he almost died.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.270
Uh, you know, there's a difference between pranks and attempted murder.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.550
I mean, Jesus, kids! This is a creepy shit!

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.229
"It's only low voltage. It can't kill him."

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.349
Oh ok, I guess it's not that bad.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.540
"Then crank it up!"

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.479
Ok ok, that didn't happen, but it might as
well.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.870
These kids are sick! It's not like in
other movies where the kids are just

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.909
defending themselves, this is disturbing!

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:02.780
Really really disturbing! I mean, it's
like these kids are sadomasochists or something.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.800
"We're just put the rack right through him and almost killed Sean." 
"Are you going to punish us?"

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.120
They...want to be punished?

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.680
All right, I'm not going to read any more into this than I need to, though something

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.310
tells me I'm going to need to. The two
kids go to school as Hogan realizes

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.250
that Alex is being picked on by a pair
of bullies all the time.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.880
Yeah, because he could take on a
seven-foot bodybuilding wrestler but put

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.969
him up against the human mullet and the
kid whose sweaters are knit by his mentally

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:31.400
insane grandma and he chickens the fuck
out.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.330
"I hate bullies." "You'll only make it worse!" Dumbass kids, you have a f**king
Hulk Hogan and you don't even know what

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.690
to do with him. That is, unless they
consider drowning him in a pool of red dye

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.240
as using him protectively.
"That's it! I've had it!"

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.990
Ha oh my God. This is a visual you see on
the back of horror movie dvds. In fact,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.990
this is a perfect time to introduce you
to a new part of the show:

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.830
This is where I take a certain part of a
movie that's already a little creepy and

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.840
slow down to make it even creepier.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.960
With that said, let's take a look at this
scene in slow-mo.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:20.300
"No more games, no more tricks. You will sit here til I tell you to get up. From now on you you do as I say, cuz I ain't leaving."

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.140
Yeah, your pants feel a lot heavier, don't
they?

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.460
So Hogan decides to punish the kids for the first time since their mother died,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.700
much to their disturbing delight.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.000
"Hi Alex, hi Kate."
"We're being punished."

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.420
We originally wanted
whips and chains but he thought that

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.900
couch was much more fitting.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.280
So of course he starts bonding with the
kids as he shows Alex how to be much

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:53.660
tougher and sings a lullaby to Kate. "Mommy used to sing me a song. Could you sing it to me?"

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.320
"I've got a terrible voice."

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.600
"SING!"

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.920
I think this needs another scary slow-mo.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.580
"SING!"

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.420
Ok ok, you have enough nightmares for the week. But unfortunately the father is

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.330
kidnapped by the average psychotic
criminal genius as Hogan invites Bert

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.740
over to "double security",
because nothing is more threatening than

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.420
a black Yosemite Sam.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.180
"You should have seen the blood pumping out! Kabloom, kabloom, kabloom!"

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.740
Hogan actually ends up telling the kids why Bert has a limp leg as we cut to a flash back.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.580
"Nice match, Champ! Now we can pay the hotel and get your clothes back."

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.940
Oh my god...

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.140
*sputtering*

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.760
He looks like he's coming out of
his mom's vagina!

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.280
Vagina!

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.040
"Look out!"

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.740
Ah, now we've gone from scary slow-mo to...a really dumb scene.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:06.170
So Hogan chases him down and...is it me or are they playing "I Will Survive"?

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:16.810
Oh-oh-oh I, I survived the movie! It's a stupid flick and suck my dick

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:22.870
keep your shit away from me! I should have tossed this stupid film, I should go and sue Netflix,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.770
I will survive, I will survi--Oop, wish I was that guy.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.290
So the two of them continue to watch the kid's backs as Alex is again approached

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.550
by the school bullies.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.330
"He's gotta do it on his own!"
"Did Mommy put this on a string so Alex wouldn't

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.470
lose any more money?"

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.610
'Don't you talk about my mother!" 
"What you gonna do--" Oh my God who am I?

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.610
I can hear colors. My penis is numb. HELP ME!!!

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.780
So in this movie's quest to emasculate
Hulk Hogan, we now see him having a tea

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.540
party and wearing a tutu.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:58.040
Why? Because they thought it looked great on the poster, obviously.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.440
"Don't move!"

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:06.180
Oh boy, I'd paid good money to see Hulk Hogan fight in a tutu.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.000
Nobody interrupts my Swan Lake recital!

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.700
Don't make me get majestic
on your ass.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.700
You vicious brutes!

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.320
Masher!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.320
Um...help.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.480
"Get the alarm!"

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.640
And twirl!!!

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:32.180
Sometimes it's hard to be a wom--Oh!

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800
"What about him?"

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.960
Let his box office records eat him alive!

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:45.430
"Business before pleasure." 
So we see that the name of our villain in Thanatos.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.160
No, not that one.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.850
This guy, the vagina face guy, who now has
a bowling ball for a head.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.899
"Thanatos! I should have known. Who i
would kidnap little children?"

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.680
A lot of people.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.740
So after the family's intimidated by Friar Schmuck, we see Hogan

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.190
accept a ransom call demanding him to
bring the computer chip.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.690
Oh yeah, because we wouldn't want to do anything
stupid like tell the police or anything.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.680
This is clearly a job for an ex wrestler
in a tutu. Anyone can see that.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.780
So he breaks into the place as we
partake in the movie's climax.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.060
Uh, yeah, I think your hands would be
about as healthy as the Skywalker's

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.070
family after that stunt.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.970
Don't you dare touch that dangerously
unbalanced woman!

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.700
"Hang out, wimpy baby."

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.310
Oh Lord, this is making me beg for the
comedic genius of Three Ninjas.

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:01.949
Oh yeah, remember those nightmares from
the beginning?

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:06.029
I guess fighting a metal-lobed Geico
caveman is the only way to overcome them.

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:12.129
"We can generate electricity!"
"A super conducting magnetic beam!"

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.900
What the hell am I looking at?

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.380
You know, for a film with a premise about a male nanny,

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.380
I really didn't expect some of
this imagery.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.380
"Aaaahhhhh!"

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.070
So the bad guy is destroyed, the family is of course one again, and Hogan goes to

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.070
spread his endearing love of children
somewhere else.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.460
"See ya soon."

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.460
"Bye Sean!"

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:46.220
Let's go fly a kite, up to the highest height! Let's go fly a kite and--

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:52.350
"Aaaahhh!"

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.740
So that's Mr. Nanny and what a surprise: it sucks.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.460
There are little to no jokes that
work, the characters are pretty much

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.550
just puppets and it's just another in
this long line of cheap kid's films about

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.820
the big tough guy who has to look after
little tough children.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.330
Hogan, I love ya, but if you want to make
people laugh, go back to reality TV.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.180
Or wrestling. They're both equally fake.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.540
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.520
"SING!!!"
