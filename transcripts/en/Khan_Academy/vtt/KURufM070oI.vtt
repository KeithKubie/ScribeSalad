[Reading] Most of the sediment and

00:00:02.422 --> 00:00:04.302
nutrients of the Mississippi River

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:07.549
no longer reach the coastal wetlands,

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.189
a phenomenon that has adversely

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.889
affected the region's

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.839
ecological balance.[stops reading]

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.659
This feels pretty good, I'm kind of

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:17.968
in the mood for No Error,

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:18.978
but let me just double-check it.

00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:21.348
So, 'most of the sediment and nutrients

00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:23.038
of the Mississippi River',

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:27.288
so that's the subject right over here,

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:31.548
'no longer reach', yeah, this isn't even

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:33.798
up for debate, no need to underline this,

00:00:33.798 --> 00:00:35.918
but we have Subject-Verb agreement

00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:37.958
where we're talking about a plural,

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.228
'sediment and nutrients' and they

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:42.548
'no longer reach' and that makes sense,

00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:46.308
'the coastal wetlands, a phenomenon

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:50.308
that has adversely affected the region's

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:54.308
ecological balance.' Yeah, this feels really good.

00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:58.308
I would throw in this as a No error.
