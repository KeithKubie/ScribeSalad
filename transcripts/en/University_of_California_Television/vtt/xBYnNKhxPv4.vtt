00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:08.580
(gentle piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.910
Bipedal, naked,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.923
large-brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.630
long the master of fire,
tools, and language

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.243
we grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.430
CARTA brings together experts

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.373
from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:55.398
on who we are and how we got here,

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:57.960
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:48.130
- Thank you everyone for coming,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.660
and I'll just take a moment to tell you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.220
a little bit about how we decided

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.530
to make like a CARTA meeting
entirely on human imagination.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.140
This is one of those things that,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.010
it seems to happen only in San Diego

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.296
where two people and I'm
talking about myself,

00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:06.360
who I'm a professor in pediatrics

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.810
and cellular molecular
medicine, turns out to be

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.950
in a meeting sitting
together with Sheldon Brown,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.740
who you're going to
hear as a first speaker,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.340
and Sheldon Brown comes from visual arts.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.280
So, a scientist and an
artist, we start talking

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.420
and we realized we have
something in common.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.380
We are both fascinated
by human imagination.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.280
So I make a challenge to Sheldon,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.420
and say well can we put this
in a scientific context,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.320
and we start planning
about a meeting like that

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.590
and we realized that most of the time,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.029
when we try to understand something,

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.200
if it's unique or enhanced in humans,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.200
we turn on to compare
our closest relative,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.480
living relative, such as the chimpanzee,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.410
and comparing to other
animals is difficult,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.390
especially if you're
talking about cognition

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.540
and imagination, so this time,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.440
I think you're going to
hear lots of speakers

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.962
talking about imagination in modern humans

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:06.024
and also in extinct humans
such as the Neanderthals,

00:03:06.024 --> 00:03:09.670
and we hope that the combination
of all those speakers,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.190
all this knowledge, will
help us to understand

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.040
a little bit about ourselves

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.510
and answer those questions
that Ajit posed to us.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.220
- Okay, so we're going to
move into a new space in time

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.720
right now, we're going
to move into the night.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.720
Some 3,500 years ago, humans
engineered control of fire.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.932
It's actually quite complicated.

00:03:31.932 --> 00:03:36.540
There was a huge caloric gain from food,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.930
because cooked food makes
many more calories available.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.450
Protection from predators,
but what's most interesting

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.561
about it is that humans extended the day

00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:49.920
by four or five hours to become

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.533
the shortest sleepers of all primates.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:04:00.480
And, the time that gained was
economically unproductive.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.380
No more calories were going
in, nothing was happening

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.560
economically, and yet the physical changes

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.560
in ciracdian rhythms were
enormous to extend the day,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.950
and there were some very major impacts

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.500
on health from reduction in melatonin

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.260
and other things, so there were costs.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.420
So the question is, why?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.220
You know why was this selected for,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.889
why didn't we just go to sleep?

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.770
So what I'm going to suggest
here is that firelight

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.091
opened up a new time and space

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:40.040
for the imagination and for the arts.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.867
There's the wonderful
quote from a German writer:

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:44.479
"Nobody sees anything in the night;

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.457
"everybody sees something in the night."

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.230
So, this is, the night is often
the time of the imagination

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.506
if I would define the
imagination for this talk

00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:57.889
as the ability to form mental images

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.030
of something not present to the senses

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.593
and never wholly perceived in reality.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.544
So, what transpires by day and night,

00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:10.910
why do firelight hours matter?

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.260
Well this is not so easy to find out,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.850
but I became very interested in this

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.800
among the Ju'hoansi bushmen
of Botswana and Namibia.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.950
These are a group of people

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.870
who live by hunting and gathering.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.150
They utilize about 100 plant species,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.330
30 animal species, and in the hard times,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.060
a few of them even have to gather water.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.223
The only water they get is
from melon or from roots.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.650
And they live in very small
camps of 25 to 40 people

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.840
with egalitarian structure, age hierarchy

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.223
and recognized camp leaders.

00:05:47.244 --> 00:05:49.970
So the interaction, scale of interaction

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.950
in every day life is very very small.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.143
And yet they have these
incredibly sophisticated

00:05:56.143 --> 00:06:00.180
social institutions, and the question is,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.030
when you live on a postage stamp,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.923
you know, how do you see the big picture?

00:06:03.923 --> 00:06:06.480
So that was my question,
to see what happens

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.440
in the day and the night.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.148
Here are some of the cultural institutions

00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:14.418
that they have: complex kinship systems,

00:06:14.418 --> 00:06:19.418
defining both biological and
imaginary or fictive kin.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.770
These systems are so complicated that I,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.200
after 30 years of working there,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.219
am still trying to figure them out.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.280
(audience laughs)

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.615
Rules for widespread food sharing,

00:06:28.615 --> 00:06:32.776
they have arranged marriage
and elaborate marriage rites,

00:06:32.776 --> 00:06:35.426
sophisticated systems of land tenure,

00:06:35.426 --> 00:06:39.140
trance healing in an
unbelievable communication

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.699
with the spirit world, and
then networks of xaro exchange,

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.300
widespread access to
the resources of others,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.530
people move around, we'll see this.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.050
So what happens at day and night,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.734
that was my question.

00:06:51.734 --> 00:06:56.734
And with data in 1974,
I collected information

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.300
on day and night conversations with groups

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.234
of five or more adults
longer than 15 to 20 minutes,

00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:10.234
and then 2011 and 2013, I
collected the full stories

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.568
and had the transcribed and translated

00:07:12.568 --> 00:07:16.330
by a team of Ju'hoansi who
are now working with laptops

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.492
and sending me the most amazing emails.

00:07:19.492 --> 00:07:20.670
(audience laughs)

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.327
All the gossip comes through by email now.

00:07:23.327 --> 00:07:25.010
(audience laughs)

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.850
So, the day talk which
was really interesting,

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.406
was the topics of conversation
are largely practical,

00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:35.870
economic issues and planning,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.603
an enormous amount of
complaint and criticism

00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:40.305
(audience laughs)

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:42.410
as people get on to each
other's case, gossip,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.480
and people say, "Well gossip
maintains social norms,"

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.740
but in fact I found 30
to 40% of the gossip

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.210
was just total bull--
(audience laughs)

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.700
It was constructed for social strategies.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.467
And so you can see that, that was the day,

00:07:57.467 --> 00:08:00.870
and then there's the switch to the night.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.630
All day long as an anthropologist,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.767
people are on my case to give me things,

00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:07.410
to give them things, to help with things.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.080
At the night, that's off limits.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.935
Everything mellows off and
I don't get a single demand.

00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:15.587
Isak Dinesen, or Karen Blixen, wrote,

00:08:15.587 --> 00:08:17.957
"At times I believe that
my feet have been set

00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:20.917
"upon a road which I
shall go on following,

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:24.057
"and that slowly the center
of gravity of my being

00:08:24.057 --> 00:08:26.372
"will shift over from
the world of the day,

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:29.287
"from the domain of
organizing and regulating

00:08:29.287 --> 00:08:32.573
"universal powers, into the
world of the imagination,

00:08:32.573 --> 00:08:34.597
"with the coming of the dusk,

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:39.060
"with the lighting of the first
star and the first candle."

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.490
And that's the transition you feel,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.221
so I looked at nights, at
36 nights, in four camps.

00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:48.110
Eight nights were singing, music,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.980
singing, gathering together.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.250
Six nights were trance healing dances,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.910
and most nights were
conversation and storytelling,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.200
and that's where I
recorded the conversations.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.180
And the results were quite astounding.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.804
All you really need to do
is look at the orange here.

00:09:06.804 --> 00:09:10.040
Oh actually the print is pretty big,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.740
but you can see, in the
day there are few stories.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.168
Economic complaint.

00:09:14.168 --> 00:09:16.829
At night, people get
off each other's cases

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:20.055
and they mostly sit
around and tell stories,

00:09:20.055 --> 00:09:25.055
and come together, and so the moods mellow

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.990
when the suns set, and I can tell you,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.924
it's very harsh in the day,
because it's a sharing economy

00:09:29.924 --> 00:09:32.326
and people are always mad

00:09:32.326 --> 00:09:34.410
that he gave that to her and not to me.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.480
And people gather around single fires

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.326
to talk and to story.

00:09:38.326 --> 00:09:40.185
They talk about their own experiences

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:43.984
or those of others in a very entrancic,

00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.734
entrancing, compelling rhythmic language.

00:09:46.734 --> 00:09:50.620
The listeners are stunned with suspense,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.061
rolling with laughter, close to tears,

00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:56.410
and emotions are synchronized,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.753
because everybody is
relating to the same story.

00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:03.210
The people they talk
about are often people

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.910
who are 200 kilometers away,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.760
and they bring that person
right to the hearth,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.654
so delicious are the details of the story.

00:10:10.654 --> 00:10:15.442
But the storytelling, what
I'm going to suggest here,

00:10:15.442 --> 00:10:18.537
is that it gives the
big picture of society.

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:22.385
Good storytellers transmit
visions of social institutions

00:10:22.385 --> 00:10:26.020
that are imaginary, like kinship system,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.380
exchange systems, and they're
not present to the senses.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.778
They're never wholly perceived in reality,

00:10:32.778 --> 00:10:36.250
but the people, the few
people, like this old lady,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.060
who can put stories together
to imagine the big picture

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.780
of society and tell about it,
they become very influential,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.160
these are the organizers

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.663
and the mediators who have this skill.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.860
This is an example of xaro exchange.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.810
This is an exchange of gifts
where people choose partners,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.280
up to 200 kilometers away,
that longest line there

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.316
is 200 kilometers, and this
is a social security system

00:11:03.316 --> 00:11:06.260
so they keep exchanging gifts

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.161
and the underlying relationship is,

00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:09.930
when you're in trouble, I'll help you,

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.740
you can come live with me,
and when I'm in trouble,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.840
you can come live with me,
so that is the exchange.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.351
The average person has about
15 or 16 of these partners,

00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:24.713
and they usually spend about
two to three months a year

00:11:24.713 --> 00:11:26.650
living with these partners.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.114
This old lady is wearing all her gifts

00:11:29.114 --> 00:11:33.080
to advertise herself because
she's trying to marry off

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.348
her grandson, and she's
showing how welcome she is.

00:11:36.348 --> 00:11:41.348
And then, we have the
stories give the big picture

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.620
of regional gatherings, xaro exchange

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.780
and kin relations, and
the one story I collected,

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.880
it was from the 1940s,
six bands coming together

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.234
at a particularly good time of
year to harvest moramo beans

00:11:57.234 --> 00:12:00.950
and this story goes on for pages,

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.190
and the relations between
the bands are described,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:08.190
and the complex kinship
relations are described,

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.060
everybody named would
tell how they are related

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.090
to so-and-so and so-and-so, and so-and-so.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.012
This gives you an idea of the area

00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:19.298
from which people came for this gathering.

00:12:19.298 --> 00:12:22.603
The whole thing would be about
oh, two or 300 kilometers,

00:12:22.603 --> 00:12:27.603
north south, and this is sort
of an excerpt from the story.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.020
Different people were
there, some were there

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.520
from the N/olau Eiseb Valley,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.020
and some were Nharo
from the further south.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.610
Some from the N/on/oni si

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.250
where there is a forest with
lots of combretum trees.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.704
The norther people were there also,

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:46.640
they were called /Uisi also came.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.110
The owners of N(clicking
twice)ola'a also came, so,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.550
and then they tell how everyone
is related, this story.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.060
And this is a story put together

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.730
from many that she had heard
because she was a little girl

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.190
when this had happened,
and then they described

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.430
what happened at the gathering.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.150
This goes on for pages.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.660
She got the other skin apron

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.330
and gave it to my late
grandmother N/hakxa n/a.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.777
She took out another skin apron

00:13:09.777 --> 00:13:12.400
and gave it to her aunt,
the late N=aisa n/a'an.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.170
And then she gave out more gifts,

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.340
and then it was the
beginning of gift giving.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.387
He, /Kagece, tried to
pull the beaded headband

00:13:19.387 --> 00:13:21.480
on his head but it didn't fit,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.343
so he took it off his head
and gave it to my granny

00:13:23.343 --> 00:13:26.550
N/hakxa n/a and gave other things to her,

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.908
and this goes on and on and on, so.

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:33.250
And you don't only have stories

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.680
but for the other form of arts,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.409
you have gifts, so that these partnerships

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:41.500
of mutual obligation are
marked by gift exchange,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.300
beautifully made, artistically made gifts,

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.325
and these gifts represent relationships

00:13:48.325 --> 00:13:52.010
but they also carry stories
of who gave them to whom.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.960
They go through long chains of giving,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.322
so you know, they create
these huge networks

00:13:57.322 --> 00:14:01.790
so each gift would have
a history in stories.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.750
And then another example
would be in marriage,

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.740
you don't see many marriage
when you live in a small band

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.499
of 25 people, you may see
a few in your lifetime,

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:14.480
and they're infrequent but the procedures

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.480
are elaborate, they're arranged.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.480
Usually the girl is married
around 13 and rejects the man,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.450
and makes a big fuss and
these stories are hilarious,

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.877
of old ladies telling about
how they rejected their husband

00:14:28.877 --> 00:14:31.670
and ran away and destroyed
the wedding gifts

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.900
and this prepares young
people for marriage,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.606
knowing that the first years
are going to be kind of rough,

00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:40.641
(audience laughs)

00:14:40.641 --> 00:14:42.407
and that they'll get used to them,

00:14:42.407 --> 00:14:46.164
and then parents also learn
of all the case studies

00:14:46.164 --> 00:14:49.170
of marriage told in stories

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.940
and they know how to manage them.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.470
Okay, the other thing which
is people, N/uasi people do,

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.870
trance healing in which the
women sit and clap all night

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.100
and sing, and the men, the trance healers,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.066
travel to the spirit
world where they negotiate

00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:10.066
with the spirits, asking
them not to take people away,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.860
to leave them on Earth,
that they love them,

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.950
giving everyone preventative medicine.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.042
In these stories, the
trance healers at night

00:15:20.042 --> 00:15:22.790
will tell about how far they traveled,

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.948
I mean, I was once
telling people how about,

00:15:24.948 --> 00:15:26.740
we're sending men to the moon

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.607
and there's an old guy
who looked at me and said,

00:15:28.607 --> 00:15:31.800
"Been there."
(audience laughs)

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.800
So, this is you know, you can imagine, so,

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.910
the trancers then, in telling the stories,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.484
connect people with a shared cosmology,

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:45.540
a shared sense of the spirit world,

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.653
a shared sense of what causes misfortune.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.160
So, sort of to wrap up then,
day, night and the imagination,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.160
so the day, you have
economics, technology,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.739
nitty-gritty of social relations.

00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:05.722
The night, the stories
are about imagined roles,

00:16:05.722 --> 00:16:10.065
rules, communities, that are not tangible

00:16:10.065 --> 00:16:13.670
or physically coherent in time and space.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.730
So they're imagining society
in their social institutions.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.486
They also imagine as change comes,

00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:22.890
they can also imagine, they can innovate,

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.777
and imagine changes as well.

00:16:24.777 --> 00:16:28.708
And then stories stimulate imaginations

00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:32.030
to construct the big picture
of social institutions

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:36.590
and relations, and very very importantly,

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.230
because we have theory of mind,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.528
because we can read what
other people are thinking,

00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:42.988
they really make people imagine

00:16:42.988 --> 00:16:45.420
the thoughts and the feelings of others,

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.640
so that you can really understand

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.040
that people feel differently about things,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.370
and it brings a lot of
understanding into it,

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.890
and people put themselves

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.090
in other people's shoes in the stories,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.230
because they're so emotionally
laded, it's incredible.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.870
So essentially what I found in this study

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.334
is that the evening hours provide a space

00:17:07.334 --> 00:17:10.590
for the arts and for the imagination.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.590
And the arts would include
also music, dance and stories,

00:17:15.622 --> 00:17:19.440
and does this happen beyond the Kalahari?

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.253
We've moved up to the Arctic now.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.180
Yes, these kinds of stories are told

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.604
in all hunter-gatherer societies at night.

00:17:28.604 --> 00:17:31.320
If you look through the
human relation area files,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.320
there are 38 mentions
of sanctioning gossip,

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:39.510
none of them is at night,
they're all in the day.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.545
For 60 hunter-gatherer societies,
information on stories,

00:17:43.545 --> 00:17:47.645
songs, healing and
ceremonies is in the files,

00:17:47.645 --> 00:17:52.046
and of course as we all know,
we too hunt and gather stories

00:17:52.046 --> 00:17:56.940
through theater, film,
recording, literature,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.700
to feed our imaginations,

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.330
I mean we really are
as addicted as anybody.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.018
So to end, and I just
want to as this question,

00:18:08.018 --> 00:18:09.723
I often think about that.

00:18:09.723 --> 00:18:14.340
What is, in our society, the
impact of checking the phone,

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.260
flipping off the light switch

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.382
with no time for the
imagination to explore,

00:18:20.382 --> 00:18:25.382
to ponder, and to position
events and relationships

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.003
of the day in the past,
present and future?

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.943
And so these are thanks to my co-workers.

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:39.580
(audience applauds)

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.700
- Good afternoon, my
name is Pascal Gagneux,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.780
CARTA Associate Director.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.380
When Allyson and Sheldon and
I discussed the possibility

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.760
of this symposium, I immediately mentioned

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.961
the Kennis brothers to them,
Adrie and Alfons Kennis

00:18:52.961 --> 00:18:56.498
are world famous paleo
artists from Holland,

00:18:56.498 --> 00:19:00.220
and I contacted them and
they kindly agreed to come,

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.460
and we learned two weeks ago

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.654
that due to a family
tragedy, they couldn't,

00:19:03.654 --> 00:19:06.373
but luckily we could convince them

00:19:06.373 --> 00:19:10.250
to answer about 15 questions for us

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.560
in a brief video, in a filmed interview,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.960
interspersed with some documentary footage

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.240
that has never been shown before.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.970
So I hope you will enjoy
the upcoming presentation.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.360
Adrie and Alfons Kennis
telling us how they go about

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.863
making such believable recreations.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.990
- We are Aldrie and Alfons Kennis

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.824
and we make reconstructions of humans.

00:19:38.824 --> 00:19:42.110
We started because we
were very bad at school.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.030
We were not good in the mathematics,

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.610
we were not good in
reading, so the only thing

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.810
we could do was, make drawings of faces

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.060
and about animals and everything,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.890
and the first, I show you one example,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.620
two examples of the first
reconstruction we made,

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.100
are those two, and the
left, for you on the right,

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.205
you see it clearly
Combean, this Combean man,

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:11.205
and the left side for you,
this is clearly a Piki man.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.410
And especially, when
we came in the library,

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.400
there were not so many books
about our human ancestors,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.275
but one stick out, one
illustrator stick out,

00:20:20.275 --> 00:20:25.275
and there was illustrator,
Zdenek Burian, from Czechia

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.580
and he made this beautiful, we thought

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.120
he made this beautiful
rough reconstructions

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.460
of mostly of example, Neanderthals,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.530
so we were fascinated by it,

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.670
because we liked the characters,
we liked the rough style.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.210
We went on vacation to one of my parents,

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.720
she went on vacation to Germany, to Italy,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.970
and we traveled through these landscapes

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.183
Burian often depicted, because Adrie and I

00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:53.100
weren't so fascinated by dinosaurs,

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.380
because dinosaurs was much
too alien much too far away,

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.515
we couldn't--
- Reptiles have no character!

00:20:59.515 --> 00:21:02.540
- And we could not make a
world with only reptiles.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.000
We could imagine a
world with humans in it,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.490
and then with strange beasts in it like,

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:14.490
with rhinos, cave bears, even cave lions,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.137
and we were fascinated by
this world where people lived

00:21:17.137 --> 00:21:19.210
but if people walked around,

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.210
and when they could encounter
big lions and big mammoths.

00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:28.626
(gentle chamber music)

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.530
How do you make reconstructions?

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.792
First, you need a skull.

00:22:27.792 --> 00:22:32.391
We often get casts of skulls,
or we've made casts ourselves,

00:22:32.391 --> 00:22:35.650
or, if you want to
reconstruct a total body,

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.890
we get bags of all elements of pieces,

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:44.890
mostly pieces of human skeletons,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.330
and these pieces we try to put together,

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.123
to reconstruct a complete skeleton,

00:22:51.123 --> 00:22:54.035
and for example here, we got a skull,

00:22:54.035 --> 00:22:57.340
and it's missing its face, and we got only

00:22:58.382 --> 00:23:00.570
a couple of bits of the face.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.920
So we look in our big spare
part collection behind me.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.590
We have an enormous
collection here of skulls.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.480
In the drawers are also post cranial stuff

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.450
and in it here, you can
get all kind of bones

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.803
and pelvis pieces.
- It's our garage.

00:23:19.803 --> 00:23:22.143
- Our garage, we're going
to look in our collection,

00:23:22.143 --> 00:23:25.690
what type of human is this?

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.330
How old is it, you have to know of course,

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.700
and what type is it, and then
we look in our collection.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.590
If we find other individuals
for the same timeframe,

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.047
and then we're going to
look at what our bits are,

00:23:38.047 --> 00:23:40.860
are they the same type of morphology,

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.583
and then we try to recreate more or less

00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:48.070
the face on the skull.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.460
- This is end result of the
reconstruction of this face,

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.020
so we use this one as
base, we have this part

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.890
and all those loose parts,
and then we create new face.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.089
If you see carefully, you see
the maxilla that was used,

00:24:02.089 --> 00:24:06.432
the left maxilla of this face
is put here in this part,

00:24:06.432 --> 00:24:09.440
and the nasal area, we
used also this piece

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.440
from Atapuerca, we use here,
so we can recreate a new face.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.740
- But nowadays, lot of
skull reconstructions

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.867
are more made with scintigraphy.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.170
They made, they scan the
bones so it's not necessary

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.491
to do this, to make
casts of the originals,

00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:33.853
so we scan, the bones
are scanned nowadays,

00:24:35.188 --> 00:24:38.503
and at home we've got a 3D printer

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.078
and you can print out the bones without,

00:24:43.078 --> 00:24:47.150
I have to use silicones of originals.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.450
It's even today possible
to make a reconstruction

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.390
from the skull while still in situ,

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.080
embedded in calcite in the cave.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.565
This one is from Altamura and we got,

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:03.290
they managed to scan the skull in the cave

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:07.350
embedded in calcite, and then
we printed out the skull,

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.490
and then we were able to
make a reconstruction.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.500
- This is the result of the skull,

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.820
and you see these small
pegs here in the face,

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.870
and those pegs resemble the skin thickness

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.470
in this part of the face.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.770
So if you see here on the cheeks,

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.210
you see bigger pegs, longer pegs,

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:25.170
those are lot of more fat
tissue and bigger muscles,

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.300
especially here off the areas,

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.160
and this side, you see the
big muscle for chewing,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.670
and big temple muscle here

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.630
and you see this peg is rather long

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.380
because the muscle is very thick.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.801
On the nose, the skin is very thin,

00:25:40.801 --> 00:25:43.060
and there are no muscles,
not so much muscles on it,

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.700
small ones, so you see the pegs,

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.530
the tissue thickness is very
small, is very not so big.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.007
- To guide us with the
reconstruction and especially

00:25:52.007 --> 00:25:55.160
to choose the right muscle size

00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.160
and how the muscles are,
we look at dead corpses.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.060
We dissect dead corpses of chimps,

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.660
and also we can look at the institutes

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.789
where they have dead bodies of people,

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:14.479
so we can...
- Recreate.

00:26:14.479 --> 00:26:19.479
- Recreate the muscles
from the modern humans.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.330
So these muscles guide us
with the reconstruction

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.720
of these in between human ancestors

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.414
who are a little bit
apelike in the face also,

00:26:29.414 --> 00:26:32.957
especially the oldest
ones, but become more

00:26:32.957 --> 00:26:36.394
and more and more humanlike,

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:40.157
so we have to look more
at the human muscles.

00:26:40.157 --> 00:26:43.407
(gentle chamber music)

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.510
You must imagine, 'cause we live indoors

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.083
all the time nowadays, people.

00:27:34.994 --> 00:27:38.150
These people, you must imagine
people 100, 200 years ago,

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:42.704
people work on the land, work
in the orchards and things,

00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:45.060
I know people who work on the farms,

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.700
who in summer, got tanned very quick.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.854
So people who live outdoors all the time,

00:27:50.854 --> 00:27:55.250
especially in summer,
look probably pretty dark,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.893
and that's why on Neanderthals,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.060
we make all kinds of skin tests.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.500
And this one looks like a
very, okay this skin test

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.900
is much too pale for a Neanderthal,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.952
it was a failure, we have
hundreds of failures,

00:28:11.952 --> 00:28:15.280
but this one was too pale.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.794
So we try this other individual
but we tried to do it

00:28:18.794 --> 00:28:22.380
in different colors to
make darker, darker,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.530
dark so it looks more like a guy

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.310
who was living outdoors all the time.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.053
We build our colors inside out,

00:28:29.053 --> 00:28:32.880
so we start with dark pigmentation,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.640
where real people maybe also have,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.807
the dark spot, the darkest
layers, and then we work--

00:28:37.807 --> 00:28:38.640
- Superficial layers, yeah.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.680
- Yeah, superficial
layers, and then we make

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.400
layer after layer, more layers,

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.850
and why more layers, because then you see

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.307
nice different colors in the face.

00:28:48.307 --> 00:28:51.680
You also see this guy here,
this guy from Jebel Irhoud,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.460
this is one of the first homo sapiens

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.912
from 300,000 years ago.

00:28:55.912 --> 00:28:58.920
If you see our skin color here,

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.519
there's a variation, he has more orange,

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:07.519
more purple, dark, he is more blackish,

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.323
so if you use more layers,
it looks more realistic.

00:29:10.323 --> 00:29:13.580
In films in Africa, you
see this guy and stuff.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.960
These are very neat, these
are the first Europeans,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.463
the first Africans coming into Europe,

00:29:20.463 --> 00:29:23.610
they look very neat, they
look very like a six pack,

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:28.210
and muscles--
- Couche muscles.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.660
- Couche, idealistic people,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.150
also the woman has the clothes

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.070
on the right spots, but why?

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.310
If we look at, if we see human evolution,

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.760
we look at anthropological pictures,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.090
we should like this kind of stuff,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:46.950
this kind of, why not like this?

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.440
- Instead of this?

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.290
- This ethnographic photographs inspire us

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:57.290
to see how this ancient
world of prehistoric men was.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.505
This was a world very long ago,

00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:04.343
beyond, mostly beyond our imagination,

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.690
because we, Adrie and I,
and a lot of the people

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.257
in this space are grown
up in the Western world

00:30:11.257 --> 00:30:13.230
with a Western civilization.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.200
This guy next to us looks
for us a bit nearly alien

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.890
for us, compared--
- Strange.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.141
- With this European guy,
strange, but for him,

00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:25.195
in his world, he's
normal, and this abnormal.

00:30:25.195 --> 00:30:27.296
- Yeah.
- So we try,

00:30:27.296 --> 00:30:28.804
if we make, we're trying
to make a reconstruction,

00:30:28.804 --> 00:30:31.630
we try to kinda dive in this world.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.510
If he were maybe in a Western museum,

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.760
we think Western, you see his testicles

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.010
are hanging under his shell,

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.960
but if we put him in a normal museum,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.780
we'll put the shell over
his testicles for sure.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.270
But this guy doesn't feel naked.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.005
This guy feels himself
normal, he doesn't feel naked,

00:30:47.005 --> 00:30:49.005
he stands in his world.

00:30:49.005 --> 00:30:51.690
In his world, there's this
nice piece of necklace

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:52.717
here on his belly, you see,

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.680
and the West can have
big problems with it,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.190
to confront people who kind of visit,

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.030
with children and families,

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.100
this naked guy could have some problems.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.836
And our culture was 100 years,

00:31:04.836 --> 00:31:07.680
or not 100 years ago,
it was also a bit weird,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.740
because I don't, if you walk
on the streets this way,

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.917
nowadays, I think people would say--

00:31:13.917 --> 00:31:16.080
- It's not the difference than this guy!

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:16.913
- Yeah.

00:31:16.913 --> 00:31:19.690
- We also do kind of contrast in it.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.650
- Contrast in it, if you
see this nice picture,

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:25.860
of a nice woman, nice child
is hanging on the breast,

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.330
nice female body, but
certainly if you see,

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.467
under her face, she is smoking a cigarette

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:34.995
and she's a bit, it
looks to me like a male,

00:31:34.995 --> 00:31:37.390
kind of cigarette so she's got two things

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.519
in one view, you got a female

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:43.140
like on under side of this picture,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.369
and got a male for her
(speaking foreign language)

00:31:45.369 --> 00:31:48.341
- Yeah but it makes nice contrast,
and that makes authentic.

00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:53.341
- And smoking.
(gentle chamber music)

00:32:39.534 --> 00:32:40.901
- Then we have to
reconstruct the robust guy

00:32:40.901 --> 00:32:44.600
and we se also robust guys
in ethnographic photographs,

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.390
then they don't stand robust,
they don't feel robust,

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.800
they don't stand as a
hulk, so this Neanderthal,

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.293
we made the reconstruction.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.957
You see he's very robust, he
had enormous broad pelvis,

00:32:55.957 --> 00:32:58.900
incredible broad pelvis, short legs,

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.250
but he stands very
relaxed, he stand not as,

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.064
"I'm strong man, strong man!"

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:04.497
He can be shy, he can be a shy guy,

00:33:04.497 --> 00:33:07.093
he can be a shy Neanderthal.
- Introvert, introvert.

00:33:07.093 --> 00:33:10.640
- And we also make sure
that he makes contacts,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.160
it's also a bit, nice to
do, that a reconstruction

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.950
make contact with the visitor,
so our reconstructions

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.600
always look at you, so
you get a real feeling

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.500
you engage with ancestors,
you engage with somebody.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.710
Yeah, you will see on Homo sapiens

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.533
earliest Homo sapiens, this Homo sapiens

00:33:27.533 --> 00:33:30.012
was 300,000 years old, but you look,

00:33:30.012 --> 00:33:35.012
it has a rough hair cut,
it has a rough face,

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.590
it has a strong body, it's
rather thin, but a strong body,

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.104
so what we thought, we
saw pictures of females

00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:44.530
who are making themselves pretty,

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:48.707
and we thought why couldn't
this guy make himself pretty?

00:33:48.707 --> 00:33:50.340
- Put some stripes on his body.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.860
- White stripes on his
body, so he's doing kind of,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.750
maybe a female thing, of what
we think be a female thing,

00:33:55.750 --> 00:34:00.130
but his hand is very robust so
you have again nice contrast.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.007
This is the way how people
stand if they even stand,

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:05.320
if they have no pockets.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.530
- You leave your hands
somewhere, even very primitive,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:13.070
all human ancestors walk
erect, have their hands free,

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.294
but if they just staring at something--

00:34:15.294 --> 00:34:17.810
- Relaxed in an erect pose.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.570
- They leave their hands somewhere,

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.337
and it's very interesting
on ethnographic photographs,

00:34:21.337 --> 00:34:24.090
to see where people leave their hands

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.150
if they have no pockets.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.370
- We do the active pose like hunting,

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.164
or like--
- Try to avoid it, yeah.

00:34:29.164 --> 00:34:32.170
- Try to avoid it, of making tools,

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.040
because then you don't,
they have no connection

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.040
with the public and you don't
see the anatomy very well.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.230
- We've made a lot of reconstructions,

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:47.230
so each time for us, the
face has to be interesting.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.910
So, what we do, normally like to do,

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:52.930
is building a contrast in the face

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:56.770
and for almost kind of
tension in the face,

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.430
and for example here, this
child is a Neanderthal child,

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:04.191
has a broad big mouth, she's
a little bit laughing at you,

00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:07.700
but it's not a complete easy laugh,

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.892
it's not completely easy
to see, it's still hiding

00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:15.370
in the face where the
laugh will burst out,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.230
but she's still in the face before,

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.270
she's not laughing right out.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.881
The same have we done with this face.

00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:26.650
This boy, this boy Neanderthal, bit older,

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:31.250
but he also, he's just,
he's not laughing right out,

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:35.950
it's just something starts
to happen in this face.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.427
- 'Cause here are two examples
from sketches, two sketches.

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:40.400
They look very similar.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.900
There's a very nice face, a bit woman

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.650
but there's also nice
contrast in the face.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:49.700
You see, for us, we think
rather aggressive nose

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.590
with the nose holes turned up, upwards.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:55.757
And then maybe put some
friendly eyes above it,

00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:59.314
and we give her a friendly
smile so we get nice contrast

00:35:59.314 --> 00:36:02.453
with a bit aggressive like
nose and a friendly smile.

00:36:02.453 --> 00:36:05.100
And sometimes we go too
far, we can go too far.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.410
This is another sketch,
and here she puts the mouth

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.561
a bit already open, but we think then,

00:36:10.561 --> 00:36:13.950
when we make this thing, that is too much,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.920
because the mouth is
open, you got to look now

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.896
also at the nose and at the mouth,

00:36:17.896 --> 00:36:20.940
but the mouth attracts too
much attention from the nose,

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.000
so that's why we prefer
to do the mouth closed,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
so it's, you see nice contrast
of the aggressive nose

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.453
and the friendly face.
(gentle chamber music)

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.827
- I will, I'll show the work that we do,

00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:28.700
and in a way it's quite
similar to the Kennis brothers.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.230
We try to reconstruct
parts of the Neanderthal,

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.989
but instead of body parts,

00:37:32.989 --> 00:37:36.324
what we try to do is
reconstruct their minds.

00:37:36.324 --> 00:37:39.070
One day I imagined that would be possible,

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.960
and I don't have a
brother to challenge me,

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.110
to keep it going, but I have a whole team,

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.787
and this whole team
helped me to achieve that,

00:37:45.787 --> 00:37:47.791
and that's what I'm going
to share with you guys.

00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:52.480
So we start with the idea
that perhaps we should study

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.950
human imaginations by
comparing to other humans,

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:58.259
perhaps, humans that have a
different kind of imagination,

00:37:58.259 --> 00:38:02.000
either worse or better, just different.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.890
And we thought about Neanderthals,
and part of the reason

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:07.400
is because we know more
about the Neanderthals

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.140
than the other extinct hominids,

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:15.792
and we also shared our world
with them for a long time.

00:38:15.792 --> 00:38:19.420
It becomes clear, and I think
you guys all learn about that,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.495
that during the time
period of the Neanderthals,

00:38:22.495 --> 00:38:27.495
on Earth, I mean, they
developed these stone tools

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.056
and definitely make it better,

00:38:31.056 --> 00:38:33.309
but the technology
didn't go as far as that,

00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:36.490
and in contrast, we modern humans,

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.200
in a very short period of time,

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.624
we could create not only stone tools,

00:38:40.624 --> 00:38:43.700
but a whole set of new technology, arts,

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.945
and sophisticated ways to
communicate with each other,

00:38:46.945 --> 00:38:50.000
so which points out
that perhaps our brains

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.711
are somehow different from them.

00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:54.928
So, how do we study the Neanderthals

00:38:54.928 --> 00:38:57.399
and how we can start
tracking these questions?

00:38:57.399 --> 00:39:00.143
So we have bones, we have endocasts

00:39:00.143 --> 00:39:03.290
that we can predict how their brains

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.700
would have different shape or volume.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.200
We have DNA.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.935
We can extract DNA from
bones of Neanderthals,

00:39:09.935 --> 00:39:13.830
and we have impressions and
someone might call that art,

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.570
others might not think that this is art,

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.760
but they definitely left some impressions

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.507
for us to try to understand.

00:39:19.507 --> 00:39:23.060
So from the endocasts, this
is the work from the group

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.880
from Leipzig, in Germany,
they have confirmed

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.770
that their brains, at
least in terms of volume,

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.700
is not so different than us.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.100
They actually have a
little bit larger brain

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.621
compared to what we have.

00:39:36.621 --> 00:39:39.664
But, I mean the endocast
doesn't offer too much

00:39:39.664 --> 00:39:42.619
in terms of how that
brain actually functioned.

00:39:42.619 --> 00:39:47.619
So, Svante Paabo, also
from Leipzig, is a pioneer

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.964
on isolating the DNA from the Neanderthals

00:39:51.964 --> 00:39:54.950
and sequenced them so
we can actually compare

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.563
the Neanderthal genome
to the modern human's.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.770
So this is all nice, but actually,

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.310
how do we understand the Neanderthal brain

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.580
or the Neanderthal mind in a dish?

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.580
So I come from a stem cell background

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.250
and in stem cells, we have something

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:14.190
that's called brain organoid,
also called a mini-brain,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.740
because we can recreate those

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.492
using human pluripotent stem cells.

00:40:18.492 --> 00:40:20.980
They don't look like that.
(audience laughs)

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.864
They're actually a simplified,
miniaturized version

00:40:23.864 --> 00:40:27.420
of the human brain, and we have a recipe

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.095
that we developed in the
lab, that is quite good

00:40:30.095 --> 00:40:34.500
to make a functional mini
brain, or brain organoids,

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.680
and it always starts from single cells.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.640
These are similar to embryonic stem cells,

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.340
or pluripotent stem cells

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.110
that we can reprogram from people.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:46.960
I can do it from my cells,
from your cells as well.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.659
So from these single cells, we
grow them in different media,

00:40:50.659 --> 00:40:52.232
changing the growth factors,

00:40:52.232 --> 00:40:55.080
specific growth factors
at different stages,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.790
until we can mature
them and these networks

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.490
will just form and become
more and more sophisticated.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:05.270
Another thing is that,
I mean they can grow

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.010
up to a half centimeter
and we can keep them alive

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.630
for up to two years, so these
are quite robust protocols,

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.690
because not only you create a single one,

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.500
but it can create thousands
of brain organoids

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.110
in the same batch, so that allows you

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.302
to do some experiments with them.

00:41:21.302 --> 00:41:25.500
If you cut one of those spheres,

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.620
what you can see is that they maintain,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.660
or they mimic, some of the
embryonic brain structures

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.110
in humans, by having a
ventricular zone in the center,

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:37.140
that's stem cells that migrate out

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.630
and form what we call the cortical plate.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.320
As these organoids age,
these cortical layers

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.708
will become more and more well-defined.

00:41:44.708 --> 00:41:48.960
So this is a snapshot
of all the cell types

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.530
that we have if we just aged

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.850
these brain organoids
for about four month.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.320
We have mostly glutamergic,
these excitatory neurons

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.230
and you start to see two
populations in there,

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.900
so these would be upper
and lower cortical layers,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.898
but we also have
inhibitory neurons as well.

00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:09.770
It's more a population
of GABAergic neurons.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.010
There are progenitor cells
that continue to produce,

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.620
and at that stage, we start to see

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.440
some glia cells, or astrocytes.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.080
These are the cell types
that helps on the formation

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.385
of these complex networks
that I'm gonna show you

00:42:22.385 --> 00:42:25.190
how they behave later on.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.740
So this is all good, but I
need live cells to recreate

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.217
those brain organoids in a
dish, and the problem is,

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:36.740
there is no live cells
from the Neanderthals.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.520
So that poses a big problem:

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.280
how can we recreate a Neanderthal mind

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.655
if we don't have the
raw material for that?

00:42:43.655 --> 00:42:47.241
So, we turn to genetics
since we have their genome.

00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:49.880
One thing that is possible to do,

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.178
is compare the genome of the Neanderthals

00:42:52.178 --> 00:42:55.744
to modern humans, and we
have thousands of them,

00:42:55.744 --> 00:42:59.510
and ask, what are the differences
between those genomes?

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.446
What is it specific to modern humans

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:07.446
that were positive selected
in us, compared to them?

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.785
So, if we look across all the genes,

00:43:10.785 --> 00:43:14.290
we end up with about 200 genes,

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:18.216
and this is, many people have
been mining this data set

00:43:18.216 --> 00:43:21.460
and these are the genes that are different

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.087
between modern humans and Neanderthals.

00:43:24.087 --> 00:43:26.900
Instead of looking for all these genes,

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.810
we decided to narrow down
this list to three genes,

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.050
because we asked, what are the ones

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.610
that are highly expressed
during the early stages

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.782
of neural development
and what are the ones

00:43:36.782 --> 00:43:40.830
that we know if they are
mutated in modern humans,

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.230
will lead to a neurological disorder?

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:45.810
And these are the three
genes, these two here

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.356
are synaptic genes, to
help how the synaptic

00:43:48.356 --> 00:43:50.880
or the connections between
neurons are formed,

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.707
and that one is a very interesting one

00:43:52.707 --> 00:43:54.490
'cause they start very early

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:59.490
and it's a master regulator
of several downstream genes,

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:05.150
it's a splicing regulator,
splicing protein.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:08.060
So, the way we do that
is using genome editing

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.210
and we use CRISPRs where we can go back

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.550
to one of our modern human cell lines

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.280
and we can change or swap
the genetic information

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.230
from the modern humans to the Neanderthal,

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:22.156
so we Neanderthalize the cell lines,

00:44:22.156 --> 00:44:25.850
targeting those specific genes,
and at the end of the day

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.370
we have Neanderthal brain organoids

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:32.370
or Neanderthoids how we call
them, and we can compare.

00:44:32.445 --> 00:44:36.700
So, I mean we done that, we recreate that,

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.233
and I'll show you some of the differences

00:44:39.233 --> 00:44:43.220
that we observe by comparing
them with the modern humans.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.080
So the first big difference is
at the gene expression level.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.560
What are the genes that
are up or downregulated,

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.420
compared to us, and we
have a couple of them.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.761
The interesting part is
that they are all connected

00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:55.947
to brain development and several pathways

00:44:55.947 --> 00:44:58.081
that leads to brain formation.

00:44:58.081 --> 00:44:59.970
Now I'll point to some of them here,

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.027
this is just a list of interesting genes

00:45:02.027 --> 00:45:04.880
that we are trying to understand.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.100
There are genes such as nestin
which is a progenitor cell,

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.730
early stages of neuro brain formations.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.693
There are genes such as TBR1.

00:45:13.693 --> 00:45:16.440
This is a gene that has
been implicated in autism,

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.331
for example, and they are
downregulated in Neanderthals.

00:45:20.331 --> 00:45:23.240
There are genes like OTX,
that when upregulated,

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.340
might prone you to have
seizures or epilepsy,

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.380
so this all happens without
genetic modification,

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.930
I mean, it's just by
changing those early genes

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.150
that you affect downstream
genetic signature

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.828
that might lead to problems
such as autism or epilepsy.

00:45:38.828 --> 00:45:41.840
So, I told you about one of the genes

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.247
that are actually a master regulator

00:45:43.247 --> 00:45:48.247
and controls how gene expression
or splicing is regulated,

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.200
and this is a gene called NOVA1,

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:56.200
and this is a reconstruction
of the protein

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.623
attached to the RNA, and
exactly the base pair

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:04.410
from the DNA that changes
out of that conformation

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.970
and as a consequence, the RNA splicing

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.810
would be affected as well.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.920
And we are looking into
these outer splicing factors

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.400
and we realized that there is
a lot of information in there.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.879
Some genes, like HOMER1, this
is another synaptic gene,

00:46:19.879 --> 00:46:22.820
have a different isoforms between humans

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.146
and Neanderthals during development.

00:46:25.146 --> 00:46:30.146
Other genes, and these
are actual target of NOVA1

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:35.120
such as GNAS or BIN1, so
these are genes involving

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.537
epigenetic regulation for example.

00:46:37.537 --> 00:46:39.630
They create a new isoform

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.660
that's only present in Neanderthals.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.408
Modern humans lost that isoform
from that specific protein.

00:46:45.408 --> 00:46:47.900
So these are quite
interesting observations

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.530
at the gene expression level.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.711
What happens to these brain
organoids if they have that?

00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:56.430
So the morphology's quite interesting.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.245
They start quite similar but
as they progress in time,

00:46:59.245 --> 00:47:01.877
you can tell that the
morphology changes a lot,

00:47:01.877 --> 00:47:05.700
so why are the modern
human's brain organoids

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.224
become sphere, increase in
size and start to mature,

00:47:09.224 --> 00:47:12.687
Neanderthal brain organoids
have this kind of popcorn shape

00:47:12.687 --> 00:47:16.678
and you can measure the diameter of them,

00:47:16.678 --> 00:47:19.300
how they grow, and already we can see

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.410
that the Neanderthal organoids

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.210
probably have some kind of cell death

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:27.978
or some problems to develop,
compared to modern humans.

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:31.630
Also, the size of these
spheres is different

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.040
but also I mean the way those spheres

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.320
are shaped, which might point
it out to some differences

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.430
as I said, in cell death or apoptosis,

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:46.760
but also in migration,
the way the cells migrate.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.520
So just by looking at these pictures,

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.162
we can tell that there
is migration defects

00:47:50.162 --> 00:47:51.717
and there is a way to test that.

00:47:51.717 --> 00:47:53.513
You can plate some of these cells,

00:47:53.513 --> 00:47:56.220
and let them migrate by themselves,

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.847
and what we observe is
that the Neanderthal cells,

00:47:58.847 --> 00:48:02.210
they have a defecting migration.

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:07.210
They migrate slower but they
go farther than human cells.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:10.940
So even a small migration might affect

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:15.490
your entire brain's
trajectory during development.

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.060
So if you look at the neurons,

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.522
I mean we also see a
difference in specific subtype

00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:22.403
of populations from the cortex of,

00:48:22.403 --> 00:48:24.780
this is one of the cortical layers,

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.680
and we observed that SATB2,
a neuron that participates

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.560
on intracortical communication

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.870
as well as intracommunications
between layers,

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.659
it is dramatically reduced

00:48:35.659 --> 00:48:40.430
in the Neanderthal cell
lines compared to controls.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:43.031
So, everything is all about morphology

00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:46.670
and how the cells behave or
the shape of these organoids.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:49.420
What about the function,
can we actually measure

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:53.400
how the communication of the
network has been affected?

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.130
So to do that, we use a tool

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:56.950
that is called a multielectrode array,

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:59.240
where we plate these brain
organoids into multielectrodes

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.936
into the bottom of those
dishes and we can record,

00:49:02.936 --> 00:49:07.438
we gain an activity map
as well as a raster plot

00:49:07.438 --> 00:49:10.713
and every trace here,
it's when a neuron spikes,

00:49:10.713 --> 00:49:15.220
and if you have several
spikes at the same time,

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.522
we call that a burst,
and when bursts spikes

00:49:17.522 --> 00:49:21.080
in the same channel we
call it a synchrony event.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.430
And since we can keep them alive,

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.031
we can see that they
evolve, and we did that,

00:49:26.031 --> 00:49:30.150
and when we start, we actually
didn't have one to compare,

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.670
so I'm showing here just some of the work

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.380
that we did in 2D, this is,

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.261
we dialed a three dimension restructure,

00:49:36.261 --> 00:49:41.261
and most of the data,
it is below five hertz,

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.390
so this is just a average
measure of the brain activity,

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.430
so what is the idea, what is our goal?

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:52.540
So a mouse brain is about
18 hertz, and a monkey brain

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:55.250
is about 20 hertz, so other people

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.319
have also created different
protocols for brain organoids

00:49:57.319 --> 00:50:02.319
and although they can also keep
them alive for a long period

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:07.100
of time, they were not able to
see an increase in activity,

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.836
suggesting that there is some
problems with maturation.

00:50:09.836 --> 00:50:13.910
But, we are glad that
the protocol we have,

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.814
we were able not only to keep them alive

00:50:15.814 --> 00:50:19.285
but to reach a level of
activity that's much higher

00:50:19.285 --> 00:50:23.342
than was ever recorded before in vitro,

00:50:23.342 --> 00:50:26.828
so if you have that much level of activity

00:50:26.828 --> 00:50:30.740
in synaptogenesis going on,
it means that you can record

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.540
something else, and this is what we call

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.420
brain oscillations or brainwaves,

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.810
the activity that can actually measure

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:42.347
through the skulls using
electroencephalogram or EEG.

00:50:42.347 --> 00:50:46.380
So we can actually measure those EEG waves

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.589
from these brain organoids,
and we can compare them

00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:54.589
to preterm babies, so we
created these machine learning

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:58.243
algorithm and we train that
in an unsupervised way,

00:50:58.243 --> 00:51:03.024
by exposing them to different
EEGs from preterm babies,

00:51:03.024 --> 00:51:07.241
and asking the machine to
tell the age of the person.

00:51:07.241 --> 00:51:09.962
So once the machine has
done that, we feed them

00:51:09.962 --> 00:51:13.420
with our brain organoids' EEG and we ask,

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.278
what are the predicted
age of the organoids?

00:51:16.278 --> 00:51:20.640
So, this is how the machine will do

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.440
in a perfect condition, in the red trace.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.640
The data is actually on
the black trace as well.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.210
You can see that we have
a very good prediction,

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:35.000
above 25 weeks, and the reason why

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.530
the machine is not good
to predict below that,

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.420
is because we simply don't have any data

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.890
from human preterm babies below that.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.078
The babies will die, and we
don't have a way to record

00:51:47.078 --> 00:51:49.518
in utero, that is non-invasive.

00:51:49.518 --> 00:51:51.730
So that's why we don't
have a good prediction.

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:54.350
But what is the prediction
that we can have?

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:57.542
And I'll show you just one
example of one of the parameters

00:51:57.542 --> 00:52:00.889
from the EEG which is the
space between the interval

00:52:00.889 --> 00:52:04.115
of activities, so if we just look

00:52:04.115 --> 00:52:08.373
at an adult EEG here,
so it's quite complex.

00:52:08.373 --> 00:52:10.650
This is a preterm baby, you see

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.791
these spontaneous activity transient

00:52:12.791 --> 00:52:15.680
followed by a quiescent period

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.196
where the brain is just silent,
when you're super young,

00:52:18.196 --> 00:52:21.886
and here is our brain
organoid, so the brain organoid

00:52:21.886 --> 00:52:25.770
is much similar to a preterm
baby than to adult brain,

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.360
so that's what we're modeling.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.868
We're modeling early
stages of neurodevelopment.

00:52:29.868 --> 00:52:34.868
So, as we grow older, the
interval between those activities

00:52:34.949 --> 00:52:37.833
become shorter and
shorter, that's why we have

00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:40.545
this complex EEG in adult.

00:52:40.545 --> 00:52:42.900
So the organoid, as we age the organoid,

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.919
the interval also reduces,
and reduces to a level

00:52:46.919 --> 00:52:50.852
that gets close to that
red bar, about 40 weeks

00:52:50.852 --> 00:52:55.534
or nine month, that's
equivalent to a newborn

00:52:55.534 --> 00:52:59.910
healthy human baby, so
that's what we can get

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.886
with these human organoids.

00:53:01.886 --> 00:53:04.965
So now that we have lots
of activity to compare,

00:53:04.965 --> 00:53:08.398
I mean, how does the
Neanderthal brain organoids

00:53:08.398 --> 00:53:10.071
compare to modern humans?

00:53:10.071 --> 00:53:13.640
So we have been studying
that from different angles,

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.110
and I'll first start by
showing what is the level

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.364
of synaptogenesis, how
many brain cell connections

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:23.847
the Neanderthals can make
compared to modern humans?

00:53:23.847 --> 00:53:26.920
And we see that it's almost 50% reduction

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.562
which is similar to someone
with autism, for example.

00:53:30.562 --> 00:53:32.690
So definitely a lower level

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:34.980
of synapsis compared to controls.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.530
We also measured them on
the multielectrode arrays,

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.114
and what we have here in this part

00:53:40.114 --> 00:53:44.350
is just the raster plot, the activity map,

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:46.861
and then some of the
contrafigurations that we have.

00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:48.760
The number of spikes,
the level of activity

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.619
per neuron per minute, is way reduced

00:53:52.619 --> 00:53:55.986
to what we expect for an isogenic control.

00:53:55.986 --> 00:53:59.970
The same is true for the
firing rate for these neurons

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.265
is also reduced compared
to isogenic controls,

00:54:02.265 --> 00:54:05.347
which again points to the
fact that these networks

00:54:05.347 --> 00:54:08.877
are just not good enough,
or not mature enough,

00:54:08.877 --> 00:54:11.653
to the level that we would
expect from modern humans.

00:54:11.653 --> 00:54:15.615
So, I hope I could tell you that,

00:54:15.615 --> 00:54:19.010
by recreating these
Neanderthal brain in a dish

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.668
we could say that they have
differences in morphology,

00:54:22.668 --> 00:54:25.569
synaptogenesis, even at the network level,

00:54:25.569 --> 00:54:28.500
but the question is, are those differences

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:32.147
better or worse than the modern human's?

00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:35.260
And I made like some analogies with autism

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.130
and other neurological
disorders, but the truth is

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:40.514
that we don't know, so we
have been looking at that

00:54:40.514 --> 00:54:42.539
using different experimental models,

00:54:42.539 --> 00:54:46.284
and I'll just show you one
thing that we are excited about,

00:54:46.284 --> 00:54:49.150
and this came from this
idea that if you have

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:51.068
brain oscillations from
people working together,

00:54:51.068 --> 00:54:53.864
they might actually synchronize
or they are more prone

00:54:53.864 --> 00:54:58.864
to work if your friend is
with you, than a stranger,

00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.580
which suggests that to achieve something,

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:07.340
to achieve a specific goal,
it's better to work with someone

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:11.260
that you like, so we have been tagging

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.290
these human brain organoids into robots,

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:17.573
so that's a way for the robot
to experiment in the world,

00:55:17.573 --> 00:55:20.480
and we are doing that in two ways.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.420
The first step is just teaching

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.370
the organoid how to move a robot,

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:26.785
and that's what you're going
to be seeing in this video.

00:55:26.785 --> 00:55:31.540
So this is a robot that is
being moving all the legs,

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.010
just by the frequency of oscillations

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:35.663
coming from the human brain organoid,

00:55:35.663 --> 00:55:39.510
so the idea is now to do the second step,

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:41.260
which is to create the feedback loop,

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:43.324
so the organoid can
actually learn something

00:55:43.324 --> 00:55:47.580
and the robot can tell by
experiencing the world.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.100
So soon we're going to be
doing the same experiments

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.115
using Neanderthal brain organoids.

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:54.970
We can see if the robot can actually

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:58.176
learn something better
or not, than humans.

00:55:58.176 --> 00:56:03.176
So, I'll finish here by
summarizing that we have a model,

00:56:03.296 --> 00:56:05.930
brain organoid model
coming from stem cells

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:07.908
that can recapitulate human development.

00:56:07.908 --> 00:56:12.411
We can reconstruct evolutionary
steps that recapitulate

00:56:12.411 --> 00:56:17.411
key features of the Neanderthal
development, we think so,

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.090
and this might be a paradigm for learning

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:25.998
if you put them back to
a robot or something.

00:56:25.998 --> 00:56:29.270
So these are Cleber and Priscilla,

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:31.099
these are the brain masters in the lab,

00:56:31.099 --> 00:56:33.579
they are the ones who
developed these nice protocols

00:56:33.579 --> 00:56:36.330
that everybody's excited about,

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:39.221
and these are my collaborators
for this project.

00:56:39.221 --> 00:56:42.033
Both Katerina Semendeferi,
Yeo Lab, the VOYTEKlab,

00:56:42.033 --> 00:56:45.430
and Eric Green who helped us

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.247
on the general genomic
analysis of Neanderthals.

00:56:48.247 --> 00:56:50.400
And these are my funding agencies,

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.387
and I'll stop here, thank you very much.

00:56:52.387 --> 00:56:55.470
