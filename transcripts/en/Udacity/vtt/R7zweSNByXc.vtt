One way of coping with scale, is to

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.614
introduce hierarchy. OSPF has a notion of areas, and

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:09.260
ISIS has an analogous notion of levels. In a

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.330
backbone network, the network's routers may be divided into

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.470
levels, or areas. And the backbone, itself, may

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.590
have its own area. In OSPF, the backbone area

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.420
is called area zero, and each area in the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.610
backbone that's not in area zero has an area

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.310
zero router. The area zero routers perform

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.180
shortest path computation. And the routers in

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.160
each of the other areas independently perform

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.010
shortest path computation. Now paths are computed by

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.310
computing the shortest path within an area. Or, if the path must leave an area,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.060
it's computed by stitching together the shortest

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.100
path to the area zero backbone router, and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.780
then the shortest path across area

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.978
zero, followed by another intra-area shortest path.
