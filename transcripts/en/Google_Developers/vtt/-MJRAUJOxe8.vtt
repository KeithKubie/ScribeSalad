KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:04.420
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.350
I am joined in the studio
right now by Bill Santana,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.769
CEO of Knightscope.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.060
Thank you for joining us, Bill.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.060
WILLIAM SANTANA LI:
Glad to be here.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.976
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:15.446
So you have probably the most
visible product here today.

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:17.320
And it's because it's
all around the building

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.236
and at the front door.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.340
Can you tell us a little
bit about what that is?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.800
WILLIAM SANTANA LI: Sure.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.340
Knightscope's developing
technology in the long term

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.960
to be able to predict
and prevent crime.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.390
We have five foot tall, three
foot wide, 300 pound machines

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.170
roaming around here that
generate 90 terabytes of data

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.830
per machine per annum.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.460
And we use that data
for two things--

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.000
for the obvious monitoring
and surveillance, and also

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.440
to influence our autonomous
navigation stack.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.270
One big step to get to
that long term vision

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.910
is to do anomaly
detection, and looking

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.760
at what is, quote, unquote,
"normal" in an environment.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.840
And giving a private security
guard or a law enforcement

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.820
officer-- let's think of
it as smart eyes and ears

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.674
for them to do their
jobs more effectively.

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:01.590
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.585
So if we think about that,
you have your bots that

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:06.160
go around kind of key areas.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.820
WILLIAM SANTANA
LI: Autonomously.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.486
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah,
autonomously, right.

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:11.470
And so this, then, feeds
into either a system that you

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.504
guys run, or into
an internal security

00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:16.170
system that a company
would already run?

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.253
WILLIAM SANTANA LI: Right.

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:20.490
So most large corporations,
which are our customers,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.910
would have their own
security operations center.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.560
We would actually
download a Chrome browser

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.610
and be able to log
into what we call

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.520
the KSOC, or the Knightscope
Security Operations Center.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.990
It's a browser-based
user interface

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.690
that allows our clients to
interface with the machines.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.070
Humans aren't all that
great at reviewing raw data,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.940
but they're really
good at event analysis.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.670
So we have the machines do
the monotonous, computational,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.770
heavy, and sometimes
dangerous work,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.679
and then let the humans to
do the "strategic" work.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:50.470
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.060
And so how precise has it been
in actually false positives

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060
or actually putting
things up that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.360
are of interest to the humans
for the event analysis?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.860
WILLIAM SANTANA LI:
So yeah, there's

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.490
a lot of different
opportunities there.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.590
Some of it is just plain,
simple sensor analysis.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.010
If you've got hyperlocal
temperature, humidity, CO2,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.680
and pressure, you can do some
interesting things with that.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.500
Or, once you start
gathering all this data,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.890
if we're doing optical character
recognition on license plates

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.220
and a client asks
for, you know what?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.940
We need a parking meter.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.780
Let me know if any car has been
parked here more than 24 hours,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.380
or 48 hours, or 72 hours.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.200
And you can just
keep sending alerts

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.140
based on that simple rationale.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.709
Or you can look at parking
utilization for a retailer.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.250
We know the number
of parking spaces.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.520
We operate mostly outdoors.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.950
Any number of parking spaces.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.620
We know the number of vehicles
we've seen over the last hour.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.750
We can give you
utilization rates.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.720
Or simply at a mall, between
10:00 PM and probably 6:00 AM,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.370
there should be no one there.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.922
If we see a person, raise your
hand and let the guard know.

00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:02.220
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.430
So you've been at this
for about two years now,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.540
I believe, just over.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.500
So where is it today?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.310
Like obviously, there's bots out
there right now doing the job.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.639
Are these out in
the marketplace?

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.930
Are you selling them right now?

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.140
WILLIAM SANTANA LI: Yeah.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.920
So we're actually
deploying technology now

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.157
with our customers.

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:18.740
We've signed our
first few agreements.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.237
We've got about 104 customers
on a very long wait list.

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:24.320
And one of the reasons
we're here at Founder World

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.410
is F50 was very kind to twice
invest in our financing.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.300
So we were oversubscribed
on our seed round.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.780
We're oversubscribed
on our series

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.740
A. And looks like we're going to
be oversubscribed on our Series

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.440
B.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.800
And wanted to share
with the founders

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.370
here that, as I
mentioned this morning,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.290
don't ever let an
investor tell you no.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.680
I mean, the first year was very
hard, because what we're doing

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.940
is a complete outlier.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.930
Who would wake up one
morning and say, hey,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.170
let's take robotics plus
autonomous technology, sensors,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.590
analytics and big data, and
combine the whole thing.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.120
And we're going to go after
a space that isn't really

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.870
an investment thesis
for most funds, right?

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.180
No one's off disrupting the
offline security industry,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.680
right?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.989
That's not a--

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:09.780
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.810
Yeah, I've never seen that.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.018
WILLIAM SANTANA LI: So it
was kind of very difficult.

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.395
But my team and I, we
stuck with our guns.

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:17.770
And everyone told us that this
would be, one, impossible,

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.260
it would take $50 million
to build the first one,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.660
it's never going to work.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.630
And we're pretty happy that
we've made a lot of progress

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.039
in a short period of time.

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.580
Listen, we've still
got a lot of work

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.290
to do to get to
our grand vision.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.720
But if you look at crime,
the problem is really severe.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.220
Part of the theme
for the conference

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.550
is let's start
thinking big again.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.360
We've been thinking big
for the last two years.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.900
And if you look at crime,
it's actually a $1 trillion

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.120
negative economic impact
annually on the US alone.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.740
You add up all the murders,
ambulances, lawyers,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.730
and everything else, it's a
hidden tax, and a very large

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.600
one that we all pay every year.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.320
But if you think about
innovation, over the last 100

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.790
years, there's been
what innovation

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.822
in the security space?

00:05:03.822 --> 00:05:06.280
I think there's been a taser,
a bulletproof vest, and maybe

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.160
a camera.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.940
That's the extent.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.580
And having been
born in New York,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.290
I'm pretty upset over what
happened after 9/11 or at 9/11.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.870
We just as a country
haven't really

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.960
been investing in the space,
other than cybersecurity.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.170
And I think there's
a huge opportunity.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.900
If you look at the Department
of Defense's budget,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.614
we have maybe now significantly
larger than $600 billion a year

00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:33.030
spent by the
Department of Defense

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.488
to give our troops every level
of capability you might ever

00:05:35.488 --> 00:05:36.150
imagine.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.000
And I'm good with that.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.360
What I question is 2 million
law enforcement professionals

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.030
and private security guards
get up every morning,

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.420
are willing to take a bullet
for you and your family,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.650
and the level of technology
that we provide to them

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.870
as a country is certainly
beneath the dignity

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.110
of our nation.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.700
And I think it's high time that
entrepreneurs demand that we

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.490
make some serious change.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.180
Because let's say we
hit our grand vision.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.780
We cut crime by 50%.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.890
What does that do to society?

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.210
Talk to me about housing prices.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.530
Talk to me about
insurance rates,

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.430
the viability of
someone's business,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.650
the safety of your family.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.800
Everything changes.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.055
And that is a worthy
goal to work on.

00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:21.180
KORY JEFFREY: So that's
awesome, and you're clearly

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.650
very passionate about it.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.070
What's the inspiration?

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.030
Is there like a
coalescing moment for you

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.934
that kind of sent
you down this path?

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.600
WILLIAM SANTANA LI:
Two or three things.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.450
One, as I already
mentioned, 9/11.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.730
The Sandy Hook shooting
a couple of years

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.430
ago was-- so 26
innocent people get

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.290
shot in an elementary school.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.820
I don't believe the founders
of our country expected

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.529
that, when you got up every
morning, that you went

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:49.070
to school, you went to a movie
theater, you went to the mall,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.560
you went to the
library, that you'd

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.580
have a risk of getting shot.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.240
That's not acceptable.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.710
And somehow as a society,
we get up every morning,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.180
turn on the news, and we
see something horrific.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.280
And we move on.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.830
It's not OK.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.740
And so that was part of it.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.980
The other part of it,
if you look globally,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.840
we have 7-plus billion
people on this planet.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.090
We're going to grow
to 9 billion people.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.710
Having traveled around the world
like most people, trust me,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.790
I don't think the law
enforcement or the security

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.820
apparatus is going to scale.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.374
We need a better
way to do things.

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:24.040
And we need to do
them more efficiently.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.260
And we should be able to
leverage the technologies that

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.010
exist and develop
some new ones on top

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.160
of all the great foundations
that Silicon Valley

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.076
has provided us.

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:36.165
KORY JEFFREY: That's a
really interesting point.

00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:37.790
So here at Founder
World today, there's

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.040
all sorts of different
technologies spending all sorts

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.190
of different verticals.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.470
Is there something that
you see for your space,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.500
besides obviously
drones, that would

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.820
be a next wave or another
really good addition in order

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.050
of innovating that space?

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.430
So something like virtual
reality or machine

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.625
learning or--

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.000
WILLIAM SANTANA
LI: Yeah, there's

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.780
something that we--
a couple of things.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.180
One is the machine you
see outside is probably

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.184
the smallest one
we'll be building.

00:08:03.184 --> 00:08:04.600
So there's different
form factors,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.930
depending on what our
clients might need.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.160
So certainly iterating on the
form factor is an opportunity.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.450
The user interface can
be very interesting.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.630
What you saw outside
in terms of the KSOC

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.000
is basically a two
dimensional view of life.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.465
There's no reason
that could not be

00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:25.460
an immersive opportunity
for a crime analyst

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.230
to understand what's happening.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.100
And I think there's also
an opportunity a little

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.380
bit further down the road
to crowdsource security.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.200
Think about what happened after
the Boston Marathon bombing.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.059
Everyone was actually
trying to help--

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.250
uploading stuff on
YouTube, tweeting,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.500
sending all sorts of stuff.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.166
But if you're the
crime analyst, exactly

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:45.160
like, where am I
supposed to look?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.820
And if you ask the
FBI, how long did

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.780
it take you to get the data
from Boston to DC to analyze,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.110
depending on who you believe,
it was about two weeks.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.800
That can't be happening.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.770
And so that user interface
should be an opportunity

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.410
to combine a lot of the
gaming technologies,

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.700
some of the augmented
and virtual reality

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.980
stuff that's happening
in the long term

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.420
to give a crime analyst a
real, fulfilling and real time,

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.750
immersive environment to figure
out what the heck is going on

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.525
and how to deploy resources.

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:19.900
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.370
Thank you very much
for joining me.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.610
WILLIAM SANTANA LI:
Appreciate you having me.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.443
KORY JEFFREY: Thank you
guys for joining us.

00:09:24.443 --> 00:09:28.570
I'm Kory and we are on site at
Founder World in San Francisco.
