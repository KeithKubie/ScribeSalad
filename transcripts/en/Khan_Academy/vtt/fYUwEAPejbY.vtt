00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.091
- [Voiceover] Metal-air cells
are a relatively new type

00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.754
of portable energy source
consisting of a metal anode,

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:10.133
an alkaline electrolyte
paste that contains water

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.435
and a porous cathode
membrane that lets in oxygen

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:14.845
from the air.

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:17.765
A schematic of the cell is
shown above, and so we see

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:19.205
the different parts right over here,

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.407
we see the metal anode, it's an anode.

00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:24.407
So this would be the negative
terminal of our power source.

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:26.687
It'll be the source of electrons.

00:00:26.687 --> 00:00:30.437
We have an alkaline electrolyte
paste that contains water.

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:31.827
Let me underline that,
there's a lot of interesting

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:32.877
words there.

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:36.447
Alkaline electrolyte
paste that contains water.

00:00:36.447 --> 00:00:38.427
That's this right over here in the middle.

00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:40.047
When they say it's alkaline,

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:42.807
that means that it's going
to be basic versus acidic.

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:45.205
It's going to have a pH higher than seven.

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:46.947
Electrolyte paste.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.867
An electrolyte is something
that if you dissolve it

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:51.807
in a polar substance, a
polar substance like water,

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:53.817
well then the solution is going to be good

00:00:53.817 --> 00:00:55.497
at conducting electricity.

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:57.447
So what they tell us,
this electrolyte paste

00:00:57.447 --> 00:01:00.327
is gonna be something that's
good at conducting electricity,

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:03.657
and they tell us it's alkaline,
so it's going to be basic.

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:06.147
It's going to have a pH higher than seven.

00:01:06.147 --> 00:01:09.417
And a porous cathode
membrane that let's in oxygen

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:10.557
from the air.

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:12.097
So this is the cathode,
this is going to be

00:01:12.097 --> 00:01:13.359
the positive terminal.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.209
This is where the electrons
are going to be attracted to,

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.509
and it's a porous cathode
membrane that lets in oxygen

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.133
from the air.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.293
And so you can see that
oxygen is available

00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:23.763
in this membrane.

00:01:23.763 --> 00:01:26.789
It somehow is allowed to seep in

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.111
because it is porous.

00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:32.411
Reduction potentials for the
cathode and three possible

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:35.949
metal anodes are given in the table below.

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:38.049
So remember, reduction potentials,

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:38.989
you can view these.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:42.501
Reduction is the gaining

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.761
of electrons.

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:47.151
So this is the potential
to gain electrons,

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:48.109
is one way to think about it,

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.349
or a reaction that
somehow involves electrons

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.871
being incorporated in some way.

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:55.841
And right over here you
have molecular oxygen

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:57.971
reacting with water.

00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:00.551
For every molecule of molecular oxygen,

00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:02.199
you get two molecules of water.

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:05.831
Four electrons, and
then they react to form

00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:08.109
four hydroxide anions.

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.241
So once again, this is
a reduction reaction

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:12.911
because those electrons
are being incorporated

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:15.491
into the molecule.

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:17.921
And so you're left with the
hydroxide right over here.

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:20.951
And if you look at our
metal air cell up here,

00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:22.961
where is that occurring?

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.181
Well, you need oxygen, you need water

00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:26.531
and you need electrons.

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:28.553
Well, if you look at the
cathode right over here,

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:29.963
you got your electrons coming in,

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:32.901
you got your oxygen coming
in, and water, we can assume,

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.493
is available in this area.

00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:36.463
The electrolyte paste has water in it.

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:38.639
The cathode is porous,

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.949
it's a porous membrane-type substance.

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.479
So they're all available over here.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.459
So you can assume that, that reaction

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.489
could happen right over
here in the cathode.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.903
So let me just write it, 02 in as a gas.

00:02:51.903 --> 00:02:54.993
So for every molecule of O2,
you're gonna have two molecules

00:02:54.993 --> 00:02:59.307
of H2O in a liquid form.

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:02.519
And then you got your electrons
coming in on the wire,

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.819
I guess you could say,
and that is going to yield

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.371
four hydroxide anions.

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.261
Four hydroxide anions.

00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:13.149
And they're in a solution.

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.271
They're part of that electrolyte
paste that's in water.

00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.579
They're an aqueous solution,
a water-based solution.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.499
And so that's going to
happen right over there

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.781
so the hydroxide anions,

00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:24.761
I can even say four hydroxide anions

00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.489
are going to be produced
every time this reaction

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.481
is happening.

00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:30.041
And they tell us the reduction potential.

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:33.401
This has a positive potential,
has a positive voltage.

00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:36.491
And notice they say the
reduction potential at pH 11.

00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:41.291
So that's consistent
with alkaline conditions

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.021
because this paste might seep
in through here a little bit

00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.541
and obviously you have all
this hydroxide being produced.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.021
So you're gonna have a
higher pH, a more basic pH.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.741
And so the fact that this
is a positive voltage,

00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:57.971
so plus 0.34 volts

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.841
means that the potential
is going in this direction.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.871
The electric potential favors
this reaction to happen

00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.031
going from left to right.

00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:09.911
Now they also said they give
us the reduction potentials

00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.521
for the cathode, which
we just talked about,

00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.011
this is the reduction
potential for the cathode,

00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.141
and three possible metal anodes are given

00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:18.070
in the table below.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.044
So here there are three
possible metal anodes.

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:23.725
So we could have zinc,
we could have sodium,

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:26.759
we could have calcium,

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.559
and so let's just go with
zinc since it's the first one

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:29.027
listed here.

00:04:29.027 --> 00:04:32.697
So if we assumed that
the metal here was zinc,

00:04:32.697 --> 00:04:34.453
what's going to be going on?

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:36.403
Well, you're going to
have the zinc reacting

00:04:36.403 --> 00:04:38.623
with these hydroxides
that are being produced

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:41.413
over in the cathode, and
then you're going to use that

00:04:41.413 --> 00:04:44.533
to produce zinc oxide water and electrons.

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:47.953
So you're actually gonna have
the reverse of this reaction.

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:50.203
You're going to have,
let me write the reverse.

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:53.713
You're going to have
zinc in the solid state.

00:04:53.713 --> 00:04:56.893
This whole anode is
made out of metal zinc.

00:04:56.893 --> 00:04:58.663
And then for every molecule of that,

00:04:58.663 --> 00:05:03.313
you're gonna have two hydroxide
anions that are dissolved

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:04.568
in water.

00:05:04.568 --> 00:05:08.168
That's what makes the
electrolyte paste alkaline.

00:05:08.168 --> 00:05:12.098
And you are going to then go to,

00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:16.448
they're going to react and
you're going to form zinc oxide.

00:05:16.448 --> 00:05:19.688
Zinc oxide in the solid state,

00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:22.686
plus water

00:05:22.686 --> 00:05:24.218
in the liquid state,

00:05:24.218 --> 00:05:28.138
plus two, plus two electrons.

00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:31.460
And so this reaction
that I just described,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.801
this is going to be
happening right over here.

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.600
So you could think of it
as the hydroxide anions

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.480
get formed at the cathode,
and then they move their way

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.960
over to the left to the anode
where they react with the zinc

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.890
and they turn, or the zinc
reacts and forms zinc oxide,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.408
so you have more and more
zinc oxide being formed,

00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:50.930
water, which can then
seep its way back into

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.358
the electrolyte paste and
then it can eventually

00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:55.040
react again at the cathode,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.330
and then you have these two electrons.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.938
So these electrons, this
turns into an electron source

00:05:58.938 --> 00:06:01.158
right over here, and then
the electrons would migrate

00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:03.770
and then they can go to the
positive side, the cathode,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.240
to react again.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.250
And so you can start
to see how this will be

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.980
an energy source that you
can tap into this current

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.060
that'll form to do some useful work.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.400
That's why you have an energy source.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.072
All right, so let's
read that questions now

00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:21.152
that we have a decent
understanding of what's going on.

00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:24.766
Early forms of metal air
cells use zinc as the anode.

00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:26.837
Well, that's the example
we just thought about.

00:06:26.837 --> 00:06:29.357
Zinc oxide is produced
as the cell operates

00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:33.717
according to the overall equation below.

00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:35.914
For every two molecules of zinc

00:06:35.914 --> 00:06:38.104
and one molecule of molecular oxygen,

00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:41.434
you produce two molecules of zinc oxide.

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.156
Use the data in the table above,

00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:46.876
calculate the cell potential
for the zinc air cell.

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:49.004
So let's think about, let's
break down this reaction.

00:06:49.004 --> 00:06:50.830
Actually, we can just break it down

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.100
into these two steps here.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.010
Because notice, this is,

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.184
we can't see them both at the same time

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:03.322
but this, the things that are reacting,

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:05.244
you have zinc.

00:07:05.244 --> 00:07:06.948
Let me underlie the
things that are reacting.

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:09.708
You have zinc, you have zinc.

00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:13.546
You have oxygen, you have oxygen.

00:07:13.546 --> 00:07:15.378
And so if you return this,

00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:17.028
if you return the second reaction around

00:07:17.028 --> 00:07:19.039
like we did before, and let me rewrite it,

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.072
let me rewrite both of them
actually a little bit lower

00:07:22.072 --> 00:07:23.512
right over here.

00:07:23.512 --> 00:07:26.031
So you have this top reaction.

00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:31.031
So you have O2 gaseous state plus two

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:35.993
H2O liquid, plus four electrons.

00:07:35.993 --> 00:07:38.573
Whoops, four electrons,

00:07:38.573 --> 00:07:42.263
yields four hydroxide anions

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.363
in aqueous solution.

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.695
And then this one, we said we're gonna go

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:47.255
in the other direction.

00:07:47.255 --> 00:07:49.535
So you're going to have zinc,

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.445
you're going to have zinc

00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:54.063
in the solid state,

00:07:54.063 --> 00:07:58.235
plus two hydroxide anions.

00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:02.345
And then that's going to yield zinc,

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:04.865
zinc oxide in the solid state,

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:07.895
plus liquid water

00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:09.995
plus two electrons.

00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:14.015
So when you see this, you
see that we are reacting,

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:16.415
we have the oxygen, we have the zinc,

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:18.215
which are the two things
(mumbles) interact here.

00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:19.865
And if you want to make them equivalent

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:20.987
in terms of the number of molecules,

00:08:20.987 --> 00:08:22.095
we could say all right,

00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:24.467
we have one molecule of molecular oxygen

00:08:24.467 --> 00:08:25.787
and we need two zincs.

00:08:25.787 --> 00:08:28.727
So let me multiply this
whole reaction by two.

00:08:28.727 --> 00:08:32.327
So two zincs react with four hydroxides,

00:08:32.327 --> 00:08:35.537
react to produce two zinc oxides,

00:08:35.537 --> 00:08:38.447
two molecules of water,

00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:40.457
two molecules of water,

00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:42.016
and then four electrons.

00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:43.937
I just said, well, if this
reaction happened twice,

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:46.347
you'd would have just twice
as many of the reactants

00:08:46.347 --> 00:08:48.039
and the products here.

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:51.761
And then notice, now you have

00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.412
a molecule of molecular oxygen,

00:08:53.412 --> 00:08:55.331
two molecules of zinc,

00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:57.881
molecule of molecular oxygen,
two molecules of zinc.

00:08:57.881 --> 00:08:59.801
If all of this were to happen,

00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:03.639
you are going to produce
two molecules of zinc oxide.

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:06.101
And well, what about
everything else that I put,

00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:07.721
that were in these reactions?

00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:09.611
Well, the water is here,

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:11.981
but then water also gets
two modules of water,

00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:13.151
two molecules of water.

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:15.281
So I guess if you look
at the total reaction,

00:09:15.281 --> 00:09:19.091
we're neutral there, we haven't
produced or lost any water.

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:22.631
You have four electrons,
you have four electrons.

00:09:22.631 --> 00:09:23.684
So that's why they didn't write it

00:09:23.684 --> 00:09:25.497
in this total reaction here.

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:28.770
And these four hydroxide
molecules, anions,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.839
well, they're going to be
used up in this second part

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:31.857
of the reactions.

00:09:31.857 --> 00:09:32.617
So we're neutral there.

00:09:32.617 --> 00:09:34.509
They get produced, but then they get used.

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:35.649
So if you look at the total reaction,

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:39.009
you're using the molecular
oxygen and the zinc

00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:41.499
to produce zinc oxide.

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:43.479
And so they say use the
data in the table above,

00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:46.957
calculate the cell potential
for the zinc-air cell.

00:09:46.957 --> 00:09:50.479
Well, the potential for
this top reaction is zero,

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:55.447
is positive .34 volts.

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:57.219
And now what's the reaction,
what's the potential

00:09:57.219 --> 00:09:59.137
for this bottom reaction?

00:09:59.137 --> 00:10:01.059
Well, it's the reverse of this reaction,

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.147
so this reaction has a negative potential,

00:10:04.147 --> 00:10:05.661
but since we reversed it, it's going to be

00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:07.131
a positive potential.

00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:11.331
So it's going to be positive 1.31 volts.

00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:12.514
Now some of you might be saying,

00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:15.244
well not only did we reverse
it, we multiplied it by two.

00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:17.374
We said two of those
reactions, wouldn't we multiply

00:10:17.374 --> 00:10:19.174
the voltage by two?

00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:20.924
Well, if we were just
talking about the energy

00:10:20.924 --> 00:10:23.147
released from a reaction,
well, yeah, absolutely.

00:10:23.147 --> 00:10:24.836
If you're gonna have the
reaction twice or twice as much

00:10:24.836 --> 00:10:26.068
of the reaction, you're
gonna have twice as much

00:10:26.068 --> 00:10:27.234
of the energy.

00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:28.824
But voltage, you have to remember,

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:32.394
you can view it as potential
energy per unit charge.

00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:34.772
So since we're not, this isn't (mumbles)

00:10:34.772 --> 00:10:38.437
absolute energy, this is
your energy per unit charge

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:39.907
is one way to think about it.

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:41.197
When you're doing more of it,

00:10:41.197 --> 00:10:43.627
it doesn't change the actual voltage.

00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:45.397
So that's an important
thing to think about.

00:10:45.397 --> 00:10:47.735
If this was talking about
total energy or entropy

00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:50.225
or something like that,
then if you were to multiply

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:53.257
both sides by two, you would
multiply the energy released

00:10:53.257 --> 00:10:54.757
or taken by two.

00:10:54.757 --> 00:10:56.047
But since we're talking about voltage,

00:10:56.047 --> 00:10:58.507
voltage isn't a quantity
that depends on the number

00:10:58.507 --> 00:11:00.937
of charges or the number of
molecules we're doing to,

00:11:00.937 --> 00:11:02.257
it's a per.

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:04.777
It's what is the potential per unit charge

00:11:04.777 --> 00:11:06.427
is one way to think about it.

00:11:06.427 --> 00:11:09.035
And so for this whole
reaction, we would just add

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:11.947
the combined voltage of both of these,

00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:13.565
and then you would get

00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:17.767
1.65,

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:20.675
1.65 volts.

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:22.057
Now let's do part two.

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:26.057
The electrolyte paste
contains hydroxide ions.

00:11:26.057 --> 00:11:29.329
On the diagram of the
cell above, draw an arrow

00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:32.419
to indicate the direction of
migration of hydroxide ions

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.997
through the electrolyte
as a cell operates.

00:11:34.997 --> 00:11:37.007
Well, we've already thought about that.

00:11:37.007 --> 00:11:39.889
The hydroxide gets produced at the cathode

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:43.849
with this reaction, and then
it gets used up in the anode,

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:48.319
so the hydroxide is going to be moving,

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:50.479
the hydroxide is going to be moving

00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:53.222
in that direction.
