00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.450
Once again let's look at our two graphs. This one shows y equals log base 10 of

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.620
x. And this one shows y equals log base 2 of x. Which we just saw is about

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.930
equal to 3.3 times log base 10 of x. The only difference between these

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.520
functions now is just the coefficient out in front of log base 10 of x here. So

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.620
what does multiplying a function by a positive constant do to its graph? Does

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.210
it stretch or shrink it in the y-direction? Does it move it in some direction,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.515
either horizontally or vertically? Does it reflect the graph in the x or y

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.464
axis? Or does it find the graph's inverse?
