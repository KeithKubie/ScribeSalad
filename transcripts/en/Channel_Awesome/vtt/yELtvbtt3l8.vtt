[Disneycember Theme plays]

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.760
DOUG: When I started telling people I was doing the Direct-to-DVD sequels, a lot of people were saying that The Lion King II actually was okay.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.600
and... yeah, I see what they're talking about

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.220
it's probably the best way to describe it. "okay"

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.140
Is it the first film? no. but is it Belle's Magical World? no.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.340
It's not good, it's not bad. It's not incredible, but it's not awful either.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.860
It's the perfect middle-of-the-road film you'd probably expect.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.660
Simba and Nala have given birth to a bouncing baby girl named Kiara

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.940
voiced by Neve Campbell.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.020
Simba shows her the ropes, just like his father did, but it turns out there's a dark shadowy place that they need to stay away from.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.880
No. not the Hyenas. Now it's the Outsiders

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.480
a group of lions that liked the leadership of Scar and vow to get the land back.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.160
Their leader, named Zira, is training a lion cub, named Kovu,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.100
to be a cold-blooded killer who grows up, kills Simba and ultimately takes control.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.680
Why him? well apparently, he's a - NOT - descendant from Scar.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.800
yeah, it's a little confusing.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.040
He's not his son, but Scar took him in as his own

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.660
even though there was NEVER anything in the last movie that showed that he did.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.340
It's pretty forced and stupid. but, oh it makes the message in the end so much stronger!

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.500
Kiara, of course, befriends Kovu. but they're told they're going to grow up to be natural enemies.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.080
A few years pass and seemingly it looks like Kovu wants to leave his pack,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.580
having saved Kiara's life and using that as leverage to join Simba.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.100
What they don't know is Kovu is actually planning to kill Simba when he has the chance.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.780
Wouldn't you know it, the two just happen to get along and, of course, fall in love, and that makes things *really* complicated.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.200
Will love prevail and the two warring sides see their faults?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.380
Is this as clear a metaphor for Romeo &amp; Juliet as the first one was for Hamlet?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.640
Personally, I think it's clever that they're taking from Shakespeare's second biggest play after his first biggest play.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.080
(Apart from a few other things, but that's another story.)

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.840
The old characters like Simba, Timon, Pumbaa and Zazu

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.500
all feel kinda recycled, even with the original voice actors coming back.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
but the new characters and their actors seem to breathe this very likeable life into them.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.300
I really like the people they got to play the new parts

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.020
where the original actors, while not all bad, just kinda feel like they're doing their usual schtick

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.140
Rafiki has a song that doesn't really add much,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.560
Simba has a cool dream sequence, but outside of that, he's just kinda the mean father.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.480
Nala's practically pointless, Timon &amp; Pumbaa I didn't even like that much in the first film, now in the sequel we get the table scraps of that comedy.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.340
but everyone else really seems to care about this story, even if it doesn't always make sense.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.300
It's almost cruel to compare the animation of this one to the original

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.780
as the original was one of the BIGGEST animated movies ever made.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.300
It's just HUGE! it's one of the few films where, when they re-release it, I go to see it on the big screen every time.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.580
Now we have that animation budget cut in half, and what do you expect? it's Direct-to-Video.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.620
and as Direct-to-Video goes, it's not bad.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.140
they still have some of that nice line work and  try to work in some good backgrounds, but yeah.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.340
You're always gonna be comparing it to how good the first one looked, and that's always gonna be a little distracting.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.020
But honestly, for what it is, it's pretty decent.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.320
The songs I surprisingly kinda like.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.220
I even found myself humming some of them after the movie was done.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.200
"We are One" is a nice melody,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.000
and "Upendi" while pointless is still a nice rhythm.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.720
And even the song "He Lives in You." I think that's in the broadway version, isn't it?

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.700
So you know that's gotta be pretty solid.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.820
In many respects, this film doesn't NEED to exist.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.480
The first "Lion King" truly was a spectacle to look at

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.060
And when you do a Direct-to-DVD movie that's trying to capture something similar, you know you're not gonna get it.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.560
so it almost seems pointless.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.880
But, if I was forced to make a Direct-to-Video sequel on "The Lion King," this is probably what I would turn in, too.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.280
There is a lot of effort, in what I'm sure is not a lot of time and not a lot of money.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.300
at least, by Disney feature film standards.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:06.140
Is it awkward at times? yeah, but it still had enough character to it that even if I felt like I knew what was gonna happen, I still wanted to see it happen.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.100
If it was a feature film, I'd probably be a little harder on it, but since it's a Direct-to-Video movie, I think it's okay.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.640
It gave me exactly what I expected and nothing really more, but I wasn't expecting more. If anything I was expecting less.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.840
If you wanna see something on-par with the first "Lion King," you're definitely not gonna get that here, but honestly I don't know anyone who thinks they're gonna get that.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.120
If you wanna see a sort-of TV sequel with better-than-TV animation, I think this one's fine.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.380
Kind of a middle-of-the-road review, but it's kind of a middle-of-the-road movie.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.420
Pop it in and judge for yourself.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.500
