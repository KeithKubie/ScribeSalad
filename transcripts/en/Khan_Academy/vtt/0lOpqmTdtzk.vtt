00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.770
A human body has
5 liters of blood,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.700
40% of which is red blood cells.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.150
Each red blood cell has a volume
of approximately 90 times 10

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.170
to the negative 15 liters.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.280
How many red blood cells
are there in a human body?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.530
Write your answer in
scientific notation,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.280
and round to two decimal places.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.030
So they tell us the total volume
of blood in the human body.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.585
We have 5 liters.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.020
And then they tell us that 40%
of that is red blood cells.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.620
So if we take the 5 liters
and we multiply by 40%,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.800
this expression right here
gives us the total volume

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.090
of the red blood cells, 40%
of our total volume of blood.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.270
Now this is the total
volume of red blood cells.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.170
And we divide by the volume
of each red blood cell.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.870
Then we're going to get the
number of red blood cells.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.810
So let's do that.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.430
Let's divide by the volume
of each red blood cell.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.830
So the volume of
each red blood cell

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:09.440
is 90 times 10 to the
negative 15 liters.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.380
So let's see if we can simplify.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.120
So one thing that we
can feel good about

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040
is that the units
actually do cancel out.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.722
We have liters in the numerator,
liters in the denominator,

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:19.680
so we're going to get
just a pure number, which

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.380
is what we want.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.520
We just want how many red blood
cells are actually in the body.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.720
So let's just focus
the numbers here.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.080
So 5 times 40%-- well 40%
is the same thing as 0.4.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.450
So let me write that down.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.446
This is the same thing as 0.4.

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:44.260
5 times 0.4 is 2.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.420
So our numerator
simplifies to 2.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.420
And in the denominator, we have
90 times 10 to the negative 15,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.120
which definitely is not
in scientific notation.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.900
It looks like it, but
remember, in order

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.230
to be in scientific
notation, this number

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.010
has to be greater than or
equal to 1 and less than 10.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.720
It's clearly not less than 10.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.699
But we can convert this
to scientific notation

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.919
very easily.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.120
90 is the same
thing as 9 times 10,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.820
or you could even say 9
times 10 to the first.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.500
And then you multiply that
times 10 to the negative 15.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.020
And then this
simplifies to 9 times--

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.092
let's add these two exponents--
10 to the negative 14.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.884
And now we can actually divide.

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:42.800
And let's simplify this
division a little bit.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:54.790
This is going to be the same
thing as 2/9 times 1 to t

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.640
over 10 to the negative 14.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.490
Well what's 1 over 10
to the negative 14?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.460
Well that's just 10 to the 14.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.739
So this right over here is just
the same thing as 10 to the 14.

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.280
Now you might say, OK, we just
have to figure out what 2/9 is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.905
and we're done.

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:13.951
We've written this in
scientific notation.

00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:15.450
But you might have
already realized,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.180
look, 2/9 is not greater
than or equal to 1.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.110
How can we make this
greater than or equal to 1?

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.820
Well we could multiply it by 10.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.390
If we multiply this
by 10, then we've

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.790
got to divide this
by 10 to not change

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.910
the value of this expression.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.320
But let's do that.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.610
So I'm going to
multiply this by 10,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.515
and I'm going to
divide this by 10.

00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:41.390
So I haven't changed.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.320
I've multiplied
and divided by 10.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.800
So this is equal to 20/9 times
10 to the 14th divided by 10

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.440
is 10 to the 13th power.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.467
So what's 20/9?

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.050
This is going to
give us a number that

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.510
is greater than or equal
to 1 and less than 10.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.500
So let's figure it out.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.720
And I think they said round our
answer to two decimal places.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.960
So let's do that.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.130
So 20 divided by 9--
9 doesn't go into 2.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.770
It does go into 20 two times.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.830
2 times 9 is 18.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.880
Subtract.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.811
Get a remainder of 2.

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:19.769
I think you see where
this show is going to go.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.230
9 goes into 20 two times.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.640
2 times 9 is 18.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.810
We're just going to
keep getting 2's.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.710
So we get another
2, bring down a 0.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.610
Nine goes into 20 two times.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.320
So this thing right over
here is really 2.2 repeating.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.640
But they said round
to two decimal places,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.680
so this is going to be
equal to 2.22 times 10

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100
to the 13th power.
