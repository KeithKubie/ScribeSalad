00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:14.460
for a lot of developers
and companies

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.230
wanting to build
businesses globally.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.040
I love the ambition, and we're

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.290
MALE SPEAKER: The
offerings, the APIs

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.520
that Google has available
to build into your app,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.640
and then generate revenue,
and then receive a payment

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.135
into a Chinese bank account.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.820
So we're really
excited that we've

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.195

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:57.300
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.690
This is Adam from Hong Kong.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.450
We are from GDG group.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.864
We are in Shanghai today in
Google Play Playtime event.

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.155
We have learned a lot of
stuff from the Google experts.

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:08.090
They taught us about
the newest development

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.880
for Google Play
Store and how can

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.980
we develop better
games and applications

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.650
for putting on the market.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.290
So they gave us a
lot of statistics

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.590
and then some training so
that we can know what to do

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.790
and what to create.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.001
I have met three teams that
we can work something out

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:22.500
together.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.910
The event is so good.
