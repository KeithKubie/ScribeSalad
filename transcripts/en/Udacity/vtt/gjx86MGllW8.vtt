00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.286
we use a similar approach when multiplying context numbers. We just need to

00:00:04.286 --> 00:00:08.977
remember that i squared equals negative 1. So if ever we multiply two i's

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:13.730
together, and we get i squared, we should replaced i squared with the value of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.440
negative 1. Essentially, it will just change the sign of a term that we're

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.358
working with. So try using this knowledge on your own. See if you can multiply

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:26.214
these two expressions together. Now I don't expect you to know this right off

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:29.508
the bat, but if you use your knowledge of i squared equaling negative 1 and

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:35.590
what you know about multiplication, I think you might get these. Either way

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.267
have some fun and play around with the math.
