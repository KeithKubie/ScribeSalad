commentator: So, so we obviously don't have
enough books, we don't have enough chairs,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.090
we don't have enough resources; perfect metaphor
for talking about globalization.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.130
[laughter]

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.199
From, from the, the Google.org and Google
Foundation site, I'm particularly happy to,

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.230
to welcome Joe Stiglitz here today because
he's been writing about globalization and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:44.220
trying to carve a Goldilocks, middle of the
road approach between sweat shops that are

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.570
enslaving and sweat shops that are liberating,
which is, I think, a lot of what he's gonna

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.750
be talking about today.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.180
For those of you who don't his background,
it, it's like a litany of the top accomplishments

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.290
in the field of economics. And I'm just gonna
read them to you so that, you, after hearing

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.740
them are terrified to ask him a question.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.369
[laughter]

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:17.330
We'll start off with a small one when he won
the Nobel Prize for economics in 2001 with

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.859
Michael Spence and George Akerlof for contributions
to understanding how asymmetries in information

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.420
change the behavior of individuals.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.450
He is currently a university professor at
Columbia University, but previously he was

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.049
Chair of President Clinton's Council on Economic
Advisors. And while many people in Google

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.049
sometimes think that this is actually President
Clinton's cabinet in exile here at Google,

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.509
he has found many of his friends here in the
last couple of days - a bit of an old, old

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.979
home day for him.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.069
He was also a Senior Vice President and the
Chief Economist of the World Bank. So he got

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:06.210
all the major food groups: he got the World
Bank, he got Clinton, and the Nobel Prize.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.440
More recently he has written, I think, sensitively,
extensively, and soberly about the problems

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.230
of economic globalization. His book, Globalization
and Its Discontents, even the title which

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.110
I understand Hal Varian gave him captures,
I think, the poignancy of the struggle to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.769
liberate hundreds of millions of people from
the shackles of poverty and bring them up

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.549
a notch without causing economic convulsion
around the world.

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.709
That book examined how major institutions
of globalization operate, and it took a look,

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.060
and I think a tough minded and a fair-minded
look, at the consequences of how they operate.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.000
He's on a book tour. His latest book is Making
Globalization Work, which for us in Google.org

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.480
and the Google Foundation, are really part
and parcel of what we're trying to understand

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.380
as we struggle with methodologies of helping
to mitigate the increasing gap between the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.020
rich and the poor and bring people out of
poverty, especially in Africa, in India and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.590
parts of Latin America.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.980
In this book he extends his investigation
and proposers, policies, and structures which

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.209
will allow countries to enjoy the benefits
of globalization while mitigating and ameliorating

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.780
their disadvantages.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.230
I can see from all the people who are here,
you join me in welcoming Professor Stiglitz

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.230
to Google.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.720
[applause]

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:56.011
Professor Stiglitz: Well it's a real pleasure
to be here and, and to see so many, so many

00:03:56.011 --> 00:04:03.230
of you. And as Larry mentioned it was, it's
also [bad audio] when you see so many old

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.120
friends that I hadn't really realized have
been here.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.730
Hal Varian was in the first class I taught
at MIT in 1966, and then there were, have

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.200
been a lot of other people that I worked with
in Washington.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.230
The, the subject of my talk is, is my book
Making Globalization Work. And, and the title

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.640
conveys a lot of what the book is about. First,
Making Globalization Work suggests that it's

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.080
not working. And much of the book is about
the ways in which it's not working and the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.940
reasons it's not working.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:48.100
But Making Globalization Work also conveys
my sense of optimism that we could make it

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.200
work, or at least work a lot better than it
has been.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.950
And much of the book is based on the basis
of the diagnosis of the problems that I mentioned

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.980
before: their causes; what can be done; what
are some of the reforms in the way we, we

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.170
run globalization to make it work at least
better than it's been for more people than

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.230
it's been working before.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.850
[pause]

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:21.370
Let me begin by trying to describe fairly
briefly some of the ways in which I think

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.273
globalization has not been working and, given
the limit of time, limited amount of time,

00:05:26.273 --> 00:05:29.440
I'll have to be fairly, very brief about this.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.680
At the beginning of, of discussions of globalization,
modern discussions, the hope was that everybody

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.970
would, would be made better off. The expression
was sometimes, "A rising tide lifts all boats."

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.490
But a more apt description of what often happens
is that a riptide destroys a lot of smaller

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.740
boats, and particularly if there aren't life
vests.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.020
[pause]

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.770
What has happened in recent decades is that
while economic theory predicted that, oh and

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.740
I'm supposed to turn on this.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.590
[sound of button being pushed]

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.350
Okay. Well economic, I don't know if it'll
make any difference.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.350
Well, economic theory had predicted that the
disparities between the richest and the poorest

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:25.690
would be narrowed. In fact, those disparities
have increased. And not only between the richest

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.160
and poorest countries, but also within most
countries around the world, the level of inequality

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.920
has been increasing. And globalization has
at least something to do with that.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:45.200
Closer to home, the disparity between Mexico
and the United States is larger today than

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.470
it was. I was in the Clinton White House when
we talked about NAFTA. One of the arguments

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:57.240
for NAFTA was that it would do something about
the six-fold dis, in, differences in income

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:05.630
across that border. Disparity in income which
gives rise to enormous immigration pressures

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.600
which have consistently been a problem.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.680
But, as I say, a decade after the beginning
of NAFTA, those disparities had actually increased,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:22.160
and in some ways, if I have time for questions
we can talk about NAFTA contributed to that.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:29.370
The, Tho, Thomas Friedman has written a very
influential book called The World is Flat.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:36.400
And a simple point I wanna make clear is,
the world is not flat. And in many ways the

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.970
world is getting less flat.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:48.560
The good news is that 2.4 billion people living
China and India have been growing very rapidly.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:58.141
For a quarter century incomes in India have
been growing at five, six percent. This year

00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:00.810
it will, it's expected to grow at seven to
eight percent.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.870
In the case of China, growth has been just
under 10 percent for 30 years, and they've

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:11.340
managed globalization reasonably well so that
several hundred million people have moved

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.750
out of poverty.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:19.991
But elsewhere in the world, globalization
has not been managed as well and there are

00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:23.430
these problems of increasing disparity.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:32.580
The, in, in some ways, the forces that Friedman
talks about as having made the world flat

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.269
have actually contributed to making it less
flat. And he emphasizes in his book the importance

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:45.459
of technology, of which Google is at the center.
And, and what is so clear is that if you don't

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:51.649
have access to that technology, and if you
don't have the education to make use of that

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:55.519
technology, you will fall farther and farther
behind.

00:08:55.519 --> 00:09:01.340
And one of the problems is that coun, countries
like Africa, continents like Africa, they

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.770
do not have access to those resources, to
that knowledge, that education, and that is

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.279
one of the reasons that the gap has been increasing.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:16.149
But there are other reasons. The international
community makes rules, rules of trade and

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:21.010
those rules are made mostly by the advanced
industrial countries, and particularly by

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.899
special interest in those countries, for their
own interest.

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:29.910
And the result of this is that the last trade
agreement, that Uruguay Round in 1994, actually

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.250
made the poorest countries worse off. It wasn't
just that the United States and the EU got

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.320
the lion's share of the gain, the poorest
countries were, were actually poorer than

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.829
they had been before that agreement.

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:49.050
There are other funny things, funny, other
ways in which globalization has not worked

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.050
out in the same way that many people had hoped.
The wor, the growth was supposed to be faster.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:10:02.360
In fact growth on average has been slower
in Latin America and Africa. It was supposed

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.480
to be more stable. There've been a hundred
crises in the last 30 years. Money is supposed

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.490
to flow from rich countries to poor countries.
In recent years money has been flowing from

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.399
poor countries to rich countries.

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:21.470
On the other hand, talk about financial markets
being able to slice and dice risk, move risk

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:27.740
from those less able to those more able to
bear risk, and yet a disproportionate risk

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.759
still is borne by those in the developing
countries. When they borrow money, they borrow

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:37.920
money in short term loans, in hard currencies,
which means that they have to bear the brunt

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:44.399
of interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations.
And this can have enormous consequences.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:50.259
I was in, a few years ago I was in Moldova,
one of the former Soviet Union Republics.

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:57.740
You have to remember that at the time we had
said that communism was an inefficient system.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.459
Market economy was efficient. Moving from
Communism to market was supposed to increase

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:08.389
their incomes. In the case of Moldova, it
had led to a 70 percent decrease in their

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:11.959
income and poverty was soaring.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:18.560
But when we went there, 75 percent of the
budget of the government was being spent on

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.050
servicing the foreign debt. And the reason
was very simple: they had borrowed in har,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.569
hard currency when they, their own currency
was linked to the ruble, when the Russian

00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:34.531
ruble, when Russia had the crisis, the ruble
fell six-fold and the value in terms of their

00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:40.610
own currency of, of their debt increased six-fold.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.380
For an economist it was interesting. We could
see the process of de-development. You could

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.750
see people going back to using horses and
buggies. It was just, you know, a totally

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:58.080
depressing scene. The whole country ran out
of oxygen in the hospitals and, and people

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:05.220
on oxygen died the night while we were there.
And what we take as a, as a necessity, as

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.779
a, that we take for granted, they take as
an unaffordable luxury.

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:16.720
If there were only one country having a crisis,
only one country not being able to pay back

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.000
its debt, you could claim the problem was
a profligate government. You could talk about

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.589
corruption. We all know how a country can
go from a situation where you have a two percent

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:35.640
of GDP surplus to three percent deficit in
a span of just a few years, with not so good

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.959
economic management.

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:39.290
[laughter]

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:45.029
But the problem is, in the developing world,
it’s country after country. And as a social

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:49.949
scientist when you see a pattern like that,
when you see country after country, you have

00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:57.589
to say, "It's a systemic problem. And therefore
you have to look for systemic cures."

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:07.360
It was very good news the, that at Gleneagles
in la, a year ago summer, the G8 leaders decided

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.149
to give, for the third time, debt forgiveness
to the poorest countries.

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:16.300
But they didn't even discuss the problem of
why are so many countries having debt beyond

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.269
their ability to repay. And if they don't
discuss that, if they don't solve that problem,

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:25.430
debt forgiveness is just a temporary pro,
i-i-issue, and there'll be a debt problem

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:30.059
another five years along the way.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:38.069
Well, these are some of the, very quick picture
of the ways in which, in which globalization

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:40.290
has not worked out in the way that it's hoped.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.240
What are the reasons?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:50.860
Well, in the book I, I look at globalization,
not only from the broad view, but look at

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:56.970
it in all its manifestations. In my earlier
book I focused mostly on the World Bank, the

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:04.009
IMF, the global financial institutions. But
globalization touches every aspect of society:

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:09.949
trade, intellectual property, environment,
natural resources, multi-national corporations,

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:15.369
finan, as well as financial markets. And I,
I try to look at each of these, the, the nature

00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:18.610
of the problems in each of the areas and what
can be done.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.930
But there are a couple of overarching aspects
that I just wanna mention very quickly.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:30.730
The first of these, the underlying problem
is that economic globalization has outpaced

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.809
political globalization. Economic globalization,
globalization means that we've become economically

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:40.619
more integrated, more interdependent. And
that means what happens in one part of our

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:45.930
global economic system has affects on other
parts of the system. That means there's more

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.809
need for collective action to doing things
together. But, unfortunately, we don't have

00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:57.240
either the political institutions or the mindsets
to do this effectively, democratically.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.440
[pause]

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.940
And you can see that in, in a whole variety
of, of, of, of ways. One of them is that when

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:12.869
we're talking about economic policies inside
the United States we, we, we always talk about

00:15:12.869 --> 00:15:19.369
what is efficient, but also what is fair.
What is the effect on various groups?

00:15:19.369 --> 00:15:25.140
But it comes to internationally, we don't
tell our trade representative, the USTR, when

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.500
he goes to Geneva to negotiate agreement.
We don't say, "Come back with a fair agreement."

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:36.010
If he did that, he would be fired. We say,
"Come back with the best agreement for the

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.490
United States," but we really mean, "come
back for the best agreement for our campaign

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:44.449
contributors." And that's what they do. And
you can see that in, in some specific context.

00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:49.790
For instance, at the beginning of the Clinton
administration a big issue was access to health.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:56.249
And one of the problems was the high drug
prices and there was a, a, a lot of acrimony

00:15:56.249 --> 00:16:00.759
about, you know, ta-ta, between the Clinton
administration and the drug companies about

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.399
drug prices.

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:11.939
But internationally we were, to a large extent,
in bed with the drug companies. The provision

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:17.879
of the Uruguay Round TRIPS, which is called
Trade Related Intellectual Property, had nothing

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:22.841
to do with trade. It was only said trade related
so they could put it inside an international

00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:28.390
agreement. There was already the World Intellectual
Property Organization, and they had to have

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.800
some justification of why this was being dealt
with in the, in the, in, in the context of

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.800
trade.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.769
The whole purpose, one of the main purposes
of TRIPS was to make access to life saving

00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:47.690
medicines, to generic drugs, less available.
And the reason this is important is that brand

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.949
name medicines often sell for 10, 20 times
the price of generic medicines.

00:16:52.949 --> 00:17:00.189
In the case of say AIDS medicines a years'
treatment generic medicines can be under $300,

00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:06.829
brand name cost in the United States is $10,000.
And if your income is $300 or even $3,000,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:13.970
you're not gonna be able to afford a $10,000
treatment. So that was, that was the intent,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.490
and that was the effect.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:21.410
It meant when the trade ministers were signing
the agreement in Marrakech, they were in effect

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:27.830
signing the death warrants on thousands of
people in Sub-Saharan Africa, India and other

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:31.090
developing countries.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.371
Interestingly, both the Council of Economic
Advisors, and at least many people in the

00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:41.550
Office of Science and Technology Policy, thought
that this was bad not only for the developing

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:46.700
countries, but was bad for American, the American
economy and for, for, global, for American

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.820
science and global science. It was not a good
structure to intellectual property, and I'll

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.570
come back and talk about that a little bit
later.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:02.900
The, the second reason exacerbating these
problems is the end of the Cold War. In most

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:09.850
ways the end of the Cold War was a great thing.
But during the Cold War we had to fight to

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.550
win the hearts and minds of those in the developing
world, in the Third World. And that meant

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:25.070
that we w-would give aid, assistance to people
like Mobutu in Congo knowing that that money

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:31.660
was going to up in a, go into a Swiss bank
account, not help the development, but it

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.530
did what it was intended to. Mobutu stayed
on our side at least didn't go over to Russia's

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.530
side.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:43.520
We had a view that the enemy of our enemy
was a friend, our friend so Pinochet we could

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.520
cuzzle up to.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:52.760
With the end of the Cold War, we had the opportunity
to try to reshape globalization or international

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.550
economic, international economic order to
reflect our principles and our values, or

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:05.150
we had the opportunity to try to reshape it
to reflect our own economic interests or the

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.320
interests of our multinationals.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.750
And to a very large extend we chose the second
course. And that was why just shortly after

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.550
the end of the Cold War, we had the Uruguay
Round Agreement that I mentioned before that

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.120
left the poorest countries worse off.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:25.220
And the final reason that globalization has
not done as well as it should have is that

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.890
we've had a little bit of a Pollyannish attitude.
The view was that everybody would be be-better

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.081
off - the view that I rep, mentioned before.

00:19:33.081 --> 00:19:44.610
But in fact, what the economic theory had
always said was that countries would be better

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:50.020
off, there would be winners, and the winners
could compensate the losers. But it never

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:55.320
said that they would compensate the losers.
In fact it predicted that there would be some

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.320
very big losers.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:04.060
And the way to see this is to envisage for
a moment what a world of complete globalization

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.690
with perfectly working markets would look
like. Now we don't have anything near that,

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:12.840
so you don't have to worry. But just imagine
what the world that those who advocate full

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.310
globalization would like to see.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.830
Well it would mean that unskilled wages everywhere
in the world would be the same. Unskilled

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:24.140
workers in the United States would get the
same wages as unskilled workers in India and

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.580
China. And that means there's an enormous
downward pressure on their wages.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:37.440
Now globalization is not the only force that
is exerting downward pressure at the bottom.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.660
But it is one of the forces. And it's one
of the forces that a lot of people think that

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.330
they can do something about.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.410
The magnitude of these effects are, are really
quite striking. And they're not just short

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:57.160
run. Real wages at the bottom in the United
States today are about 30 percent below what

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:03.090
they were 30 years ago. And in the last six
years, even the middle has seen the income,

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.810
real incomes decline.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.430
Basic point I wa-wanna stress and really the
point that Larry was making is that unless

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:16.020
we can make globalization more equitable,
unless the, the fruits of globalization are

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.940
more widely shared, unless there are more
winners and fewer losers, there can be a backlash

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.540
against globalization.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.950
Now some people think of globalization as
something like medicine: cod liver oil that

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:34.080
you just have to swallow and accept, and it's
inevitable. But that's not true.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.240
Globalization, as measured for instance by
the ratio of trade to GDP or capital flows

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.210
to GDP, was stronger before World War I than
it was at the end of war period. So there

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:50.480
can be a backlash and we have seen already
inklings of some of that kind of backlash.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:57.250
And that's why this issue is extraordinarily
important, important for those who are advocating

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:03.110
globalization. And that the interest in making
globalization work is really, I think, in

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.130
everybody's, in everybody's interest.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.960
Well, as I said, much of the book is trying
to, to describe in, in more particular ways

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.110
how we can make globalization work in each
of the areas that I, I mentioned.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:23.070
And given the limited amount time, and I wanna
save most of the time for, for questions,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.910
let me make, just talk about two areas that
I, I think probably are of interest to people

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.910
here.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:35.440
One is intellectual property. And obviously
in Silicon Valley people think intellectual

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.290
property is very important. And it is. And
as an academic I also feel it's very important.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:46.590
I'll tell you a little story that, that oh
shows a little bit of the ambivalence that

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.910
most academics have towards intellectual property.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:56.810
I was, about 20 years ago I got a letter from
a Chinese publisher wanting me to write a

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.560
preface for a pirated edition of one of my
textbooks.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.790
[laughter]

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:09.170
And I was actually quite enthusiastic 'cause
I figured if one hundredth of one percent

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:13.580
of the people in China read my book, it's
a bigger audience than I'll get anywhere else

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:19.100
in the world [laughs]. So you know, and you
write these books mainly you do your work,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:26.611
mainly not motivated by pecuniary returns.
The main motivation is ideas affecting the

00:23:26.611 --> 00:23:32.780
world, trying to solve some economic problems.
That is the motivating factor. It's not money.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:43.450
So disseminating ideas was, was to me unambiguous
and positive. But I thought before I wrote

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:45.490
this preface I oughta check with my publisher
 --

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.760
[laughter]

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.260
and, and he went ballistic. [laughs]

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.590
[laughter]

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:58.750
Well, intellectual property is different from
other kinds of property in that it creates

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:03.710
an inefficiency. Ordinary property we think
of as important be, property rights are important.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:09.710
Everybody talks about property rights as a
necessary part of, of the efficient market

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.240
economy.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:17.350
But intellectual property rights creates an
inefficiency. Why? Well because knowledge

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:22.910
is, as economists call it, is a public good.
The, to use a technical way of saying the

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:28.900
marginal cost of using knowledge, of somebody
else knowing the knowledge is zero.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:36.280
If it's unlike, it, it's unlike ordinary goods
like a chair. If one person's sitting in the

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.880
chair, another person can't sit in the chair
without high discomfort.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
[laughter]

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:46.900
But in the case of knowledge after I've told
you what I know, you now know it but I still

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:55.130
know it, right? I haven't lost it. Well, Thomas
Jefferson put it actually much more poetically.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:25:00.410
If you go to the Jefferson Memorial, you can
see this where it says, "Knowledge is like

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.240
a candle. When a candle lights another candle
it doesn't diminish from the light of the

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.420
first candle."

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:11.650
Well, intellectual property not only restricts
the use of knowledge, it actually gives a

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.010
monopoly power. And we know that monopoly
is very inefficient.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.800
So the question is, why do we do this thing
and create this intellectual property that

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:28.300
has such inefficiencies? Well the answer is
to motivate innovation. And that is, it-it

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:34.030
plays a very important role in motivating,
incentivizing innovation. It's not the only

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:41.551
incentive, as I say, a lot of the basic research
is done not with that as a part of, part of

00:25:41.551 --> 00:25:46.910
the incentive, it's, it's there are other
incentives that are just as important.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:53.900
But if you don't get intellectual property
rights correct, you can have all the disadvantages

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.290
without the advantages. And what do I mean
by correct?

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:04.530
Well, intellectual property has a lot of dimensions
to it. It's the length of the, the patent

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:10.980
or the copyright, the breadth, the conditions
under which you can get it, a whole set of

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:17.790
terms which affect, which, which, which relate
to, that describe the intellectual property

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:23.440
regime. And if you don't get the balance right,
you get the disadvantages without the advantages.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:30.580
And historically we've, we've known about
that for a long time. It's not been talked

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:37.790
a lot about, but it's, it's, it's, in the
20th century the two most important inventions

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.640
innovations arguably were the automobile and
the car, and both of those were almost stymied

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.190
by intellectual property.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:53.690
In one case, the Wright Brothers got a patent
on the airplane after Kitty Hawk. But so did

00:26:53.690 --> 00:27:01.470
somebody else called Curtiss. And there wha,
developed what is called a patent thicket.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.710
Anybody wanting to develop an airline, an
airplane had to pay both of them and no one

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:10.790
could pay both of them. And so nothing happened
until World War I came along and the US Government

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:15.910
said, "It's too important to have an airplane
to allow the patent lawyers to stymie the

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:22.440
development." And the result of this was they,
they seized the patents and decided who was

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.370
gonna get what and how, who was gonna pay
how much. And we got the airplane.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:33.200
More recently the story all of you probably
know, the story of BlackBerry, where it had

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:39.750
to pay 600 million dollars ransom to continue
to operate to a patent lawyer who had bought

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.450
a patent from somebody else for a patent that
had already been declared invalid in two other

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:50.320
countries. And probably will not be sustained
in the United States. And yet the way our

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.250
intellectual property regime works says, "That
if you have that patent nobody can trespass

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.250
it."

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:01.020
Well that's, these are examples of, of the
ways in which if it's not correctly designed,

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.540
it can have very adverse affects.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.630
In the area of health, you can see it even
more dramatically 'cause what's at issue is

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:13.160
not just a question of money, it's a question
of life.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:21.950
There was a, a race, there, a very major important
project, the Human Genome Project to decode

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:28.520
the human genome. It was an orderly process
in which a clear, clearly on target. But a

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.910
few private companies decided that if they
could go a little bit faster, pick out a few,

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:43.030
hopefully valuable genes, they could get a
patent on the gene. What is the social value?

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:48.101
Well, they decoded it maybe a day, or week,
a month earlier than the Human Genome Project.

00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:53.830
But the social value of that was almost nil.
The social cost is enormous.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.721
One of them, for instance, got the patent
on the gene that's related to breast cancer.

00:28:58.721 --> 00:29:01.270
[pause]

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:07.680
Another company wanted to provide a free test
for breast cancer. But this company that has

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:14.160
the gene said, "No. No way. We, you, we, you,
we have to get several thousand dollars to,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.820
you have to pay us if you wanna find out whether
you are susceptible to breast cancer." And

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.860
the result of that is lar-large numbers of
people will die unnecessarily.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:29.460
In the case of Canada, they've decided not
to recognize this patent. So there is an element

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.990
of discretion in here, but the way the American
system has been going has been to restrict

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.990
the usage.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.260
Well, in the context of developing countries
I mentioned before the whole intent was to

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.750
reduce access to generic medicines, the whole
intent of the TRIPS Agreement, and it's done

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.460
that.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:54.330
The, what have they gotten out of it? Well,
the pharmaceutical companies have not used

00:29:54.330 --> 00:30:01.080
that money to, to spend that money on research
for the diseases of the developing countries.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.180
They spend more money on marketing and advertising
than they do on research. More money on research

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:11.850
on lifestyle drugs like hair, than they do
on life saving drugs. And almost all of the

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:17.610
money on life saving drugs is spent for those
diseases for the advanced industrial countries.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:23.850
It is all understandable. It is market economics
where the returns are. But that does not mean

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.370
that it is socially efficient or socially
desirable.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:33.120
And there's an alternative system that I describe
in the book, which is the prize system. Where

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.100
you give a medical prize, where you give a
prize for those who discover a vaccine or

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:43.490
cure to an important disease like malaria,
and a small prize to somebody who discovers

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:48.390
another drug for which there already is a-a
cure.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.410
[pause]

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:58.740
That would provide the resources, the incentive
to develop, to do the research that we need.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.270
The American taxpayers are paying for this
anyway through Medicare, Medicaid, through,

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:06.360
through a whole -- the question is are they
paying for it in an efficient way? And the

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.650
answer clearly, in the current system, is
no.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:15.780
What you would do once you have these pat,
the, the-these innovations then is use the

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:26.620
competitive marketplace to distribute, to
distribute these, these drugs, vaccines widely.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.940
So you use competition to drive down the price
and increase the quantity. As opposed to the

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.190
current system, which is based on a monopoly
system, which is raising the price and restricting

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:37.580
the quantity.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.390
And obviously, if you have knowledge you want
that knowledge to be used and disseminated

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:47.610
as widely as possible. And as I said in this
particular case the cost of not doing that

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.610
is enormous.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:55.730
So that's an example and, and it, it's an
important example because it illustrates the

00:31:55.730 --> 00:32:02.860
general principle; you need resources to,
to do anything. You need resources to innovate.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:08.940
Incentives matter. But too often, without
thinking about things, we've wound up with

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:14.010
systems where the incentives are not working
in the right direction, and that there are

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:19.530
ways of redesigning the incentive structures
to try to use the resources that we have in

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:26.260
a better way, to direct them to have increase
both economic efficiency and overall equity.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:32.380
Let me spend a-a moment talking about the
environment. I spent a lot of time, a chapter

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:38.100
in the book called "Saving the Planet." The
reason I talk about the issue of global warming

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:45.450
is twofold. It, it exemplifies the failures
of globalization - the global governing system.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:52.250
But also even if we solve the problems of
economic globalization, if we don't solve

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:58.120
our environmental problems, it won't do us
any good. So these, these, these are really

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120
first order issues.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.190
I was on the, the IPCC, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, that reviewed the

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:10.450
evidence in 1995 and then, then, even then
it was overwhelming. But since then what has

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:16.030
happened has, has made it even stronger.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:20.260
One of the thing, for instance, we knew that
the Arctic ice cap was melting, but we didn't

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.260
anticipate to melt anywhere near as fast as,
as has been occurring.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.900
I should tell just a brief little story. I
was at Davos last year, and in one of the

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:35.950
sessions the, on global warming the oil-oi,
large number of oil companies were there and

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:40.920
one of the, one of the oil executives said,
"You know you guys are just much too pessimistic.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:47.380
You're only looking on the gloomy side of
things. You, you know there's a bright side

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.760
to everything. The melting of the Arctic ice
cap means that we are gonna be able to get

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.010
the oil underneath the Arctic Sea at a much
lower cost." [laughs]

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.010
[laughter]

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:03.341
He said, "There's only one little problem,
the United States has not signed the Law of

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:08.070
the Sea so there may be a little war about
who gets the, who gets this oil." It is unbelievable,

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.780
but, but these are actually things that do
happen.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:18.419
The, this is a particularly concern for developing
countries 'cause they are among those that

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:24.339
are going to be much, most affected; the most
vulnerable. Bangladesh, you know one of the

00:34:24.339 --> 00:34:29.659
poorest countries, a third of that country
will be under water. I had a meeting with,

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:35.710
with a number of the Pacific Island, leaders
of the Pacific Islands, they were in, in New

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:41.480
York for the UN meeting. Most of them see
their days as numbered. They will be under

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.929
water; they just won't exist anymore. So for
them this is a matter of life and death. No

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:52.159
war could do what we are doing to them as
a result of global warming.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.929
Now for an economist the problem of global
warming is a very simple one. It's a question

00:34:55.929 --> 00:35:01.180
of externalities. We are imposing costs on
others that the greenhouse gases, the emissions

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.140
of greenhouse gases lead to the warming of,
of the atmosphere - something that actually

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.569
was predicted in a sense. I mean one of the
things that is very interesting as you start

00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:15.749
getting into this is, is realize that that's
back, th-th-ere's some physicists that made

00:35:15.749 --> 00:35:21.910
a back of the envelope calculations a hundred
years ago. Didn't know that there was going

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.250
on, but they asked the question, "What would
happen if concentrations of greenhouse gases

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:31.470
increased?" And their predictions were remarkably
accurate even before the big computers.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:37.070
The, the, the, the, the

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:43.460
[pause]

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:53.210
as I said the global warming is going to affecting
the, the most vulnerable, the most. But we

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.880
aren't doing anything about it. The way economists
think about it is as an externality, and whenever

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:03.200
there's an externality, you make people pay
for the cost that they're imposing and that

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:09.680
means a tax, some kind of a charge, a carbon
tax. And that was one of the things that Clinton

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680
administration proposed in the beginning.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:20.029
Now Kyoto was a major success in some ways.
The world got together, very disparate groups,

00:36:20.029 --> 00:36:24.700
and reached an agreement. But in other ways
it was a big disappointment.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:31.690
It only covers about a quarter, a third of
all the sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:37.490
The United States was not, didn't, didn't
join. The developing countries that within

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:43.710
30 years will be accounting for about 50 percent
of the emissions aren't in. And deforestation,

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:51.599
which accounts for about 20 percent of the
emissions, also is not a part of Kyoto. And

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:54.589
so, as I say, much more was left out than
was brought in.

00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:58.079
[pause]

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:03.299
The Kyoto approach has reached an impasse.
The problem is a very simple one. That it's

00:37:03.299 --> 00:37:08.740
impossible to get an agreement about target
reductions between the United States on the

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.309
one hand and the developing countries on the
other. The developing countries say, "Why

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:22.390
should we have less of an emissions permit,
emissions target per capita than you do?"

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:29.309
But if every country got the same as the United
States, the, the amount of emissions would

00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:35.800
be enormous, the world, it, it, it would not
be tolerable. More, put it another way, it

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.470
would put no constraints on the developing
countries for another century.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.580
[pause]

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:48.680
So we are at this impasse where, where a target
approach simply is not going to work. And

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.519
this alternative approach of a global tax,
carbon tax, I believe is, is an alternative.

00:37:54.519 --> 00:37:59.910
The interesting thing is there is beginning
now of, of, of a movement in this direction.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:06.099
The head of the Conservative Party in the
UK has said, "It makes so much more sense

00:38:06.099 --> 00:38:12.640
to tax bad things like pollution than good
things like work and savings. And so why don't

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.999
we shift the burden of taxation away from
work and savings towards taxing pollution?

00:38:17.999 --> 00:38:23.549
And if you do that, incentives matter, and
people will then pollute less and that we,

00:38:23.549 --> 00:38:26.039
we can do something about the, the spaces."

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:31.020
Now the fact that even the conservatives now
in England is moving this way I think is providing

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:37.009
a basis of a-a-a, an alternative potential
approach to, to this.

00:38:37.009 --> 00:38:45.650
In the book I talk about how, what we can
do about deforestation. That was a, a really

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:51.450
mi-minor mistake with major consequences.
We said that countries could get credit for

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:58.142
planting forests, but not for, not cutting
down their forests. That means that a country

00:38:58.142 --> 00:39:02.240
like Papua New Guinea is better off cutting
down its forest, then replanting it, than

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240
keeping it.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:08.960
Now you think about this it just sounds pretty,
pretty stupid. And it's amazing how long it

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:16.089
takes to move this idea through the political
process. We, we, we, we've worked with, a

00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:20.800
group of us in Columbia have been working
with, with a-a formed a coalition called The

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:27.050
Rainforest Coa-Coalition, which has actually
succeeded now in guiding, getting this issue

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:34.180
on the next agenda of the post-Kyoto agenda
for where we go from here.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:46.390
Well, let me just conclude with, sharing with,
a-a sense of optimism - a mild sense of optimism.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:54.779
A lot of people ask me, you know, why, why
do I think you know I've described all the

00:39:54.779 --> 00:39:59.911
problems, the roles of special interests,
how they shape globalization. Do I really

00:39:59.911 --> 00:40:07.059
think giving a sermon or writing a book is
going to make any difference? Aren't these

00:40:07.059 --> 00:40:13.349
forces too strong, won't they just keep going
on the way that they've been?

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:19.339
I think the answer is that globalization is
in a very fluid state. Lots of things are

00:40:19.339 --> 00:40:26.180
changing. I talked about global warming. The
evidences of that are much more rapid than

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:32.539
anybody had anticipated. I talk about the
trade agreements when the protests broke out

00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:38.049
in Seattle in 1999, the idea, the problems
were not very much in the air. Today everybody

00:40:38.049 --> 00:40:44.119
understands them. The WTO created a Rule of
Law was an imperfect one, but still a Rule

00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:49.430
of Law. And they've ruled that the United
States cotton subsidies are illegal. So we

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:59.369
continue to subsidize them; 25,000 rich American
farmers share three to four billion dollars

00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:05.319
a year, causing incomes of some 10 million
people in Sub-Saharan Africa to go down. But

00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:09.289
eventually those will go, go.

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:13.880
These are just a lar, a number of examples
of things of ways in which globalization is

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.880
changing.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:23.019
The real issue, in my mind, is the following:
are we going to try to patch globalization

00:41:23.019 --> 00:41:28.989
as it were? Have a crisis, we'll deal with
the problem, find some temporary solution

00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:32.690
as we, the expression goes "kick the ball
down the road a little bit" 'till the next

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:41.279
crisis comes along. Or can we make globalization
work better by trying to think thoughtfully

00:41:41.279 --> 00:41:46.299
about the problems? Think thoughtfully of
realizing that there are winners and losers;

00:41:46.299 --> 00:41:53.430
that we can redesign globalization and make
sure that there are a lot more winners.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:42:00.289
And, and this book was written in the note,
w-w-w-with a hope that, and a belief, that

00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:05.960
there are lot of these reforms that we can
undertake that will succeed in making globalization

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:14.670
work. Work for a lot more people so that the
potential that the advocates of globalization

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:18.650
talked about 25 years ago will really be realized.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.650
Thank you.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:19.651
[applause]
