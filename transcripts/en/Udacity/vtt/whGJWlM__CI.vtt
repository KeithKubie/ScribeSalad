00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.130
So you've decided that you need
more than what can be provided by

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.190
all the variance of Roboto.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.370
How do you pick an additional font?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.080
Well, it's pretty hard.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.260
Choosing the right font isn't
only a technical challenge.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.059
It's not enough to just pick
a font that's easy to read and

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.690
contrasts well with
the content around it.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.200
Your choice of font can impact
how your users perceive your app.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000
And how they emotionally respond to it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.420
Hand written fonts or

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.369
fonts with rounded terminals can
make your app feel informal.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.040
On the other hand, very geometric fonts
might give an impression of order and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.210
structure.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.550
And some fonts might even feel robotic.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.800
Weight matters too here.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.860
Light fonts are those
with really thin serafs,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.800
can invoke impressions of elegance,
but also impermanence.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.970
Meanwhile ultra bolds
might evoke heaviness.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.880
But possibly stability, and fonts can
even be associated with a time period.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.470
While some may have an almost
historic significance,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.930
others may be considered
a little too trendy.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.930
There really aren't great absolute rules
for choosing the right custom font for

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.140
your app, but here are a couple
of tips that might prove handy.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.800
First, limit your font pallet.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.940
You can often get away with
using just one custom font for

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.790
branding areas like your app bar and
Roboto for everything else.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.330
If you do pick another sans
sarif font to replace Roboto for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.950
UI elements like the text here,
make sure to switch over completely.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.760
So you don't have two similar
looking fonts next to each other.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.660
Here Helvetica and
Roboto are placed next to each other.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.250
But since they look kind of similar,
it's kind of this weird uncanny valley.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.420
It's not clear if it's intentional or
not.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.720
Second, try out the font you're thinking
of on a couple of different devices with

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.720
varying screen densities.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.440
What looks awesome at xxhdpi
might look really muddy at mdpi.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.780
Notice the serifs on the H
are barely even visible.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.360
And finally, watch out for
unintended cognitive dissonance.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.840
And make sure the font fits
the mood you're setting in the app.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.860
If your product is all about being fast,
putting a font with a heavy weight on

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
might give the feeling of
a slow lumbering giant.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.220
On the other hand, if you have
an app that's highly technical

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.930
an overly decorative font might
not only be distracting but

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.760
might erode your user's trust
in what you're trying to do.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.090
So does your proposed extra custom
font meet all those requirements?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.970
Great.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.710
James is going to walk you through
how to use the font you just

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.450
picked in your app.
