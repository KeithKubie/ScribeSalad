[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.748
Hello.

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:10.940
I can't speak as fast as Dan,
but I will try and do my best.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.050
My name is Mark.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.730
I'm a developer
advocate at YouTube.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.990
I'm going to talk a
little bit about gaming

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.810
and then a little bit
about some new APIs

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.770
we've launched for interactivity
on our live platform.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.530
First up, gaming on YouTube.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.210
It turns out it's
actually pretty big.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.240
We have a lot of gaming
content on YouTube.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.500
We have a lot of
gamers watching content

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.650
on YouTube-- let's
play's and reviews

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.780
and live streams-- and
it's always growing.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.800
We saw this and we
built YouTube Gaming.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.390
We wanted to give
that content a home,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.070
so we built this place
where all of our live

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.500
and all of our VOD
content can come together

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.920
in context that makes
sense for gamers so people

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.350
can find it and understand it.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.285
And it just looks really slick.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:57.859
So if you have not checked
out YouTube Gaming,

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:58.900
I encourage you to do so.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.900
It's gaming.youtube.com.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.440
And I mentioned live content.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.570
And so we really
like live gaming,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.640
especially the community that
kind of springs up around it.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.010
The phrase we hear a lot is
it's like sitting on your couch

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.960
playing games with a friend.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.290
When you're doing that,
you want to play with them.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.940
You don't just want
to watch sometimes.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.060
You want to play
with your buddy.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.470
You want to get the controller.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.430
And we see this too.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.760
When it works, it works well.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.290
We see people in like
heavy console games

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.290
like GTA, Destiny, Call of Duty.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.670
It's a great thing to do.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.720
The streamers love it.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.440
The fans love it.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.140
It can be a little
clunky to manage.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.790
People get left out.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.365
You have to be on your couch
in front of your console

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.000
or computer or whatever.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.860
So there's an opportunity
here to build something

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.630
where everyone can participate.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.580
Something that's
unique to this style

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.860
of streaming and having
a big at-scale party.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.950
If I were to call people
up on stage versus

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.690
have people raise
their hands and so on.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.280
So it's about scaling that
community interaction.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.380
A great example of this is the
game Whiplash by Jackbox Games.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.050
They actually built this game
with this use case in mind.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.940
It supports 10,000 players.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.010
So if I'm streaming
this game, I can

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.070
have eight people that are
playing on their phones,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.620
but then I could have up to
this massive audience that

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.610
are participating
in this scaled way.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.160
And they built that with a
web app and a client server

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.760
approach, but we
can actually build

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.800
these kinds of experiences
directly on top of YouTube

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.020
with our live chat system.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.460
You can integrate with
a very lightweight API

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.000
and watch for keywords,
hashtags, prompts,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.330
sentiment monitoring,
anything you want to do.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.630
And then anyone who's
watching the streamer play

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.690
the game can engage
and interact and be

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.270
a part of that experience
right from either the YouTube

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.070
website or the mobile app,
because they pretty much

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.950
all support chat.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.150
Any client except for,
I think, the TV clients.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.380
You can jump in and chat.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.962
We've just put together a
very basic REST API for this.

00:02:56.962 --> 00:02:58.670
This is just a little
sample of the JSON.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.086
There's a lot more data, but
this is really what you want.

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:02.262
These are the messages.

00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:03.720
You can understand
a little deeper.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.803
You can see if people that
are watching the stream

00:03:05.803 --> 00:03:07.940
are donating in real time
and potentially unlock

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.040
benefits for those people.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.960
As a lot of Youtubers
like to monetize

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.240
their content through our
fan-funding and sponsorship

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.820
programs.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.840
You can understand a
little bit of information

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.650
about the people that are
engaging with this content

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.020
as well.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.728
You get their display
name, their channel

00:03:22.728 --> 00:03:25.440
ID, and understand their
relationship with the channel.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.080
Are they a sponsor?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.030
Are they a moderator?

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.100
Things like that.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.600
To get their picture to put
together little experiences.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.467
Excuse my terrible mockups
that I made in slides.

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:38.050
Maybe you're doing
a voting and you're

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.240
putting people's
names on the screen

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.510
and their pictures
in a face pile.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.560
You can do leaderboards
if you have people

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.100
that are participating
in the chat

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.402
and you can actually
store the state

00:03:50.402 --> 00:03:51.860
if you wanted to
go a little deeper

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.540
or you can just do this
all very lightweight

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.805
through the client in real time.

00:03:56.805 --> 00:03:59.940
We made these APIs, as I said,
very simple to get started.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.070
Youtube's API is actually
part of Google's API.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.475
It's a question that I
get from time to time.

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:09.240
Any library that has that's out
there for Google's API surface

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.790
has the YouTube support in it.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.370
YouTube accounts
or Google accounts

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.310
so if you have any
sort of integration,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.550
you're building for Android
or any of our platforms

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.290
that support m those are YouTube
accounts as well if the user

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.000
has a YouTube channel.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.670
And then, of course,
all this is you

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.260
can use this in any
engine and the engine

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.140
that supports it REST
calls, basically.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.200
And that is it.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.960
So we put this
together and we're

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.640
really excited about
being able to offer

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.660
this kind of scaled ability to
build lightweight interactions

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.510
through YouTube and to see what
kind of at -scale community

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.200
interactions we can have.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.000
I would love to hear from anyone
that's interested in this.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.199
Anyone who's building
for YouTube in general.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.240
Please feel free to email
me, and then of course,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.320
developers.google.com/youtube
as we can get started with all

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.020
that.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.762
And I'd like to
introduce Nathan Martz.

00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:00.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.860
You.
