00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:01.920
[inaudible].

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 1>Hey, what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:07.941
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.170
July 31st, 2017 what's going on? How are you? What's going on?

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.450
Ah, Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:20.010
How she is I, is it going to be a heat

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.330
wave? The heats comment back. Oh my God,

8
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.420
please try to stay in sigh inside the air conditioning.

9
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.190
If you don't have air conditioning,

10
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.760
please try to remember to keep your windows open and stick your head through the

11
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:37.620
opening in the window, not in the solid part of the wall.

12
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.220
You know when they do that shit on the news and they try to help old people not

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.680
die in the summer heat?

14
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:48.600
What a fucking way to go. You'll live almost a century and just, you know,

15
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.870
you've lived through the wars, you've lived through the depression,

16
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.320
you've lived through the fucking New York in the 70s and all that.

17
00:00:55.321 --> 00:01:00.321
What finally gets you a hot summer day and you're just sitting there,

18
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:00.321
right?

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.810
So swirling four and you just can't, you just can't get to the window.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.570
It's like when you'd watch wrestling, right?

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.220
And it's one of those tag team wrestling matches and the guy just can't get to

22
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.280
his teammate to fucking slap his hand at tagament.

23
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.350
That's what it is. That's it. They lie there.

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.630
They find them face down in wrestling trunks.

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.410
The greatest generation stormed the beaches of Normandy taken out by a fucking

26
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:34.890
heat wave. Does it every year. How many heroes?

27
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.310
How many years people are we going to put up with the sun?

28
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
Taken another one of our heroes away. I swear to God. You know,

29
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.970
maybe if there was a different administration,

30
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.630
they would handle the threat of the sun, right?

31
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.700
My talking politics now, is that what I'm doing? Let's talk politics.

32
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.470
Why? Why do we keep fucking with this Douche in Korea?

33
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.680
Why don't you just leave him alone? You know what I mean?

34
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
It's like when you're on the subway and the crazy guy comes in the car,

35
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:10.530
you don't look at him. You don't start talking to them.

36
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.270
Just fucking leave them alone. Leave them alone. Isn't nothing too.

37
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.210
Why don't they just let the fucking guy, you know,

38
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:20.820
run his country the way he wants to run his fucking country.

39
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.820
Send some food in there, feed the fucking people.

40
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.510
Why does he have to have the same fucking ideas about strip malls that we do in

41
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:32.580
order as for us to get along with them? Huh?

42
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.310
Haven't we proven that? It doesn't matter what kind of government you have.

43
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.203
In the end,

44
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.880
there's going to be human beings running it so they're going to selfishly fuck

45
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:47.430
the whole thing up anyways. Who gives a shit? If he's over there,

46
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:49.860
lighten off his fucking mat is, let them do it.

47
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.900
The guy is clearly unbelievably insecure.

48
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.680
He clearly is trying to follow in the footsteps of his dad's giant fucking

49
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:04.900
shoes. Although he's probably smaller.

50
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.520
I don't know how tall those guys are over there,

51
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.550
but whatever tall for over there. Big Shoes for North Korea,

52
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.430
especially with all the lack of nutrition that's got to stunt.

53
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.630
The growth of your feet is there. Right? Why don't they just fuck it. You know,

54
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.360
we should like when he shoots something off, we should just feed his ego. Wow.

55
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.530
There you go. We'll go there. Kim Jong eldest second.

56
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.360
Whenever you fucking name is. Hey, you very case.

57
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.840
I was a good one too. That sec. You like that? Look it. Look at ours.

58
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.070
It's awesome. Fist bump. Good man. Good man. Hey,

59
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.140
here's a copy of the last year. Super Bowl. Check it out man.

60
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.590
It's fucking amazing. What do you got? You got a Mug, Gangnam style DVD.

61
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.470
You want to trade with us? Why can't we just try to get along with this guy?

62
00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:55.070
What is the fucking problem? Oh,

63
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.810
like we give a shit. What the fuck he's doing to his people? These kinds.

64
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.711
Who Runs Shit over here?

65
00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:03.230
They don't give a fuck how many people are upside down in their own house.

66
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.090
They didn't give a fuck about the people in New Orleans.

67
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.190
They give a fuck about those people in North Korea. No, they do not. No,

68
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.090
they do not.

69
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.960
You know what it is that they're sitting on a bunch of material that you could

70
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:18.560
turn into those doctors, those beats by Dre. God Damn it.

71
00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:20.330
We want it so that's where we're going to do.

72
00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:24.440
We're going to act like this fucking Goddamn fat show with his fucking three

73
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:26.000
missiles is going to be a problem.

74
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.060
<v 2>Um,</v>

75
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.360
<v 1>yeah. I don't want to just leave the guy alone. They're talking now, right?</v>

76
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:35.420
According to Google news that I didn't even read it.

77
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.510
All I did was just click on it says US allies prepared to use overwhelming force

78
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.710
in North Korea. General says, uh,

79
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.770
we're prepared to shoot a bunch of missiles in his general area,

80
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.800
says the general hoping that one of them lands on him and we kill his few

81
00:04:54.741 --> 00:04:56.240
innocent people as possible.

82
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.670
They would never say that the US and its allies are prepared to use rapid and

83
00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:02.450
lethal,

84
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.250
rapid lethal and overwhelming force if necessary against North Korea.

85
00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:11.060
The commander of the U S Pacific Air Forces warn Saturday night.

86
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.200
And why are we doing this?

87
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.860
Cause this guy's shooting off his own fireworks cause he's testing missiles the

88
00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:20.861
way we do a North Korea remains the most urgent threat to regional stability.

89
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.590
O Shaughnessy said, Oh Shaughnessy you've done it again.

90
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.020
Yeah, Jesus Christ.

91
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.430
Do we really got to go in there and blow this guy up with a bunch of other

92
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:38.690
people just trying to fucking get to work. It's gotta be another way to do it.

93
00:05:38.691 --> 00:05:40.850
Don't, don't, don't we have any James Bonds,

94
00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:44.750
guys that can just kind of go in there and start banging the hottest chits

95
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.590
chicks in North Korea as they subtly try to kill them, you know?

96
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.830
But the power of his dick is so overwhelming. They forget to kill him.

97
00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:54.680
And then he realized then by the time they realized I was supposed to kill that

98
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:59.150
guy, but I was so busy having orgasms, right. He's already out the door.

99
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.910
He's got the past codes, and then he goes down there.

100
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.950
How would you kill that guy? How would you kill that fat bastard? You know?

101
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.240
You know what I would do? I'd give him a honey of a ham. You know,

102
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:14.510
the glazed ones that they have around Christmas except in the glaze would be

103
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.750
some sort of Sinai. That's where you hide the poison, you know?

104
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.740
And he would just be staring at it and a witch's mouth would be watering so much

105
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.500
that he couldn't wait for the official taste tester to give it a try, you know?

106
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.210
And he would literally die while making himself a sandwich. You know,

107
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:33.044
when you're so hungry,

108
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.050
you making the sandwich and you're already fucking thrown chunks and meat in

109
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.930
your mouth. That's when he would be doing, so it'd be two price.

110
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.360
What does he look like? He looks like a white bread guy, doesn't he?

111
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.230
He's definitely not a multigrain, you know?

112
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.620
Do you think he gets an everything Bagel on the way to work every day?

113
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.073
<v 3>Okay.</v>

114
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.730
<v 1>Had a hairless bastard. I bet he doesn't even have to wear deodorant. You know,</v>

115
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.760
there's a lot of things to like about him. He's fat, you know?

116
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:03.240
So he's nonthreatening. Yeah.

117
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.920
That means he likes teaks likes to fucking stay up late and Netflix and chill.

118
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.500
You can see that about him. You know, you think he knows how to dance.

119
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.110
I'd be noticed that about little people and, uh, in fat, in fat people,

120
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.710
they transcend race when it comes to dancing, you know?

121
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.870
It's like white guys can't dance pretty much general,

122
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.750
unless they're fat or they're a little person.

123
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.510
Then all of a sudden they're just fucking, it's just like, wow,

124
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.040
will you in the beat it video, what's going on here? It's because they had to,

125
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.021
that's what happens.

126
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:42.220
You have to visit a certain amount of ice cream that you eat where the laws of

127
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:47.221
nature just take over and at some point you have to learn how to dance or you're

128
00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:52.420
just going to be heading into an abyss of sadness that, you know,

129
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.260
there's not enough chips Ahoy in the world can fill that void.

130
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.130
Or is it that they get that sweat into the oldies Richard Simmons thing and that

131
00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:05.700
just kind of launches this talent. They didn't know this is just for fat people.

132
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:09.960
I don't know about little people. You know, I think little people,

133
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:13.530
cause they're down at the ground, they can see the steps easier. You know,

134
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.140
where like when Michael Jackson first moonwalked, you know,

135
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.000
everybody was as tall as Michael Jackson,

136
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:19.980
so we couldn't figure out what he was doing with his feet.

137
00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.640
But little people down at the ground, they, oh, I got that shit right.

138
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:28.170
And the next day you're in the subway. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Oh,

139
00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:32.700
bone, bone. And it was like fucking eight little people all coming at you.

140
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.960
Yeah. And you, Nia, did you ever see that

141
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.000
you ever go into the subways of Brooklyn and there was a bunch of little people

142
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:45.180
doing recreating the bad video? No.

143
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.950
That Jack [inaudible] bad. I'm bad.

144
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.560
No, no. What's going on? I'm going to stupid mode. I'm trying to say.

145
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.950
How would you North Korea?

146
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.170
<v 3>Well, I don't have no idea.</v>

147
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.850
<v 1>You know, it's funny. He's like a baby, like baby fat.</v>

148
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.130
That's what I like about that guy. Like if you wore shorts,

149
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.030
it probably looked like, oh cutie pies. There you get ready for it.

150
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.880
<v 3>She just woke up. Oh you did? You did.</v>

151
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.690
<v 1>You want to go to Brooklyn today and watch us eat real people food while you</v>

152
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.860
keep drinking milk?

153
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.423
<v 3>Um, all right.</v>

154
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.930
<v 1>No, I dunno. I Dunno what I was talking,</v>

155
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:31.250
I was talking about some fucking stupid shit. Yeah. So why,

156
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.580
why? Like honestly,

157
00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:36.860
what would happen if we just left that guy alone?

158
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.490
You know what would happen if you just seriously asking this?

159
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.950
If you lifted all the sanctions and he was able to trade with the world and they

160
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:53.220
were able to fucking get some food in there, whatever the fuck's going on.

161
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.890
If you just honestly just let him do his shit.

162
00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:01.330
I mean we shoot a fucking missiles all the time. We don't use la.

163
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.230
<v 3>Wow.</v>

164
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.830
<v 1>This is what kills me. How do we even know what the fuck he's doing over there?</v>

165
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.030
Who has fucking time to be watching this shit?

166
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.360
Can you imagine if that was your God damn job and then you'd go and home on the

167
00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:26.560
subway and then you sit next to me and you're watching me losing my shit cause I

168
00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:30.370
can't download the new operating system and you're sitting there dealing with

169
00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:31.204
the fact

170
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.420
that there's some chubby little fella on the other side of the world shooting us

171
00:10:37.421 --> 00:10:40.570
some shit that could possibly be on its way over here right now.

172
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.593
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

173
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.870
<v 1>Do you think if the animals had the abilities,</v>

174
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.210
they had the ability to shoot those missiles,

175
00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:53.450
do you think they would do it in an effort to try to wipe all of us out so they

176
00:10:53.451 --> 00:10:56.510
could just go back to fucking catch and trout in a stream?

177
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.070
You know, if there was going to be an animal out there that would betray us,

178
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:05.260
which, which species do you think it would be? You know,

179
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.800
it have to be something at least at the level of a bear reptiles or out reptiles

180
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.390
of like, you know, they're, they're like, you know,

181
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.410
there's those kids that go to the,

182
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.600
like reptiles have like learning disabilities, right?

183
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.680
They have like fucking dyslexia, uh,

184
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.390
add, you know,

185
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.420
they like the Ritalin kids of the animal kingdom or they even considered an

186
00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:37.360
animal is a reptile, an animal. I always forget this shit. And Amphibian,

187
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.400
an amphibian is something that can be a,

188
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.840
it's like aqua man, right? And he's onto the ocean.

189
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.540
He's talking to a dolphin and then later on that night, you know,

190
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.330
he's getting Sushi. Oh, that'd be fucked up. Right?

191
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.170
It's on a Daikin Sushi dates sitting there looking at like, you know,

192
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.580
you just seem like you're somewhere else.

193
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.040
You just got to like the weight of the world. And he's sitting there going like,

194
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.490
I wonder if I'm eating somebody that helped me out one time.

195
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.660
<v 4>Okay. Do, do, do, do [inaudible] that shit</v>

196
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.410
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

197
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.140
<v 1>for some reason they would all come and help them.</v>

198
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.500
They never really explained that. Did they? Why they all liked it.

199
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.940
Why they wouldn't interrupt whatever the fuck it is that they were doing to stop

200
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:29.590
some other fucking people in a boat.

201
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.250
Is it bringing a key of cocaine or some shit into the u s and it's just like,

202
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.980
like, oh, whale doesn't even know what cocaine is.

203
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.270
Why is it going to hurt its tail smashing this boat?

204
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.840
Because as much as it could smash the boat, this, this pointy stuff, right.

205
00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:47.970
There's the mast and all of that. He can hurt himself

206
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.050
and all he gets is a thank you. Yeah. [inaudible] mango. Hey,

207
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.930
thanks a lot. By the way. There's a bunch of plankton over there.

208
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.120
Little heads up. No one's seen it yet. Ah, thank you aqua man. He never did.

209
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.710
You just be like, oh, thank you. Oh, fucking insecure.

210
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.843
These God damn fish.

211
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.233
<v 2>Um,</v>

212
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.090
<v 1>here's another thing too. I'm sick of fucking hot. Newscasters,</v>

213
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.600
male and female. All right. What do you, what are you trying to do here?

214
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.333
You know,

215
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.540
I don't need to be aroused when I'm fucking listening to world news.

216
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:28.980
<v 4>Okay?</v>

217
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.660
<v 1>Holy Shit. What happened to that fucking ladies face? Well, it won't go down.</v>

218
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.420
C'Mon. Go down. Scroll down. Oh Man. I, I don't,

219
00:13:38.421 --> 00:13:42.020
I don't get how to use computers. There's something on the side. Where is it?

220
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.160
Where's The lady? All right. An Arizona woman played dead.

221
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.520
All right. Wait a second. Oh, this is all this clickbait stuff.

222
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.900
Kendall Jenner's nude photos, sparks. Who gives a shit?

223
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.800
She really is the best looking one of all of them, isn't she?

224
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.660
No offense to Kaitlyn. Um, all right, so I guess now we're going,

225
00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:09.690
so we're going to, we're having a war with Afghanistan.

226
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.080
We're having one with Iraq and now we're going to have one with North Korea.

227
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.330
You know, isn't this like when Ho home depot opened so many fucking locations?

228
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.370
They like started putting each other on a business.

229
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.863
<v 2>Um,</v>

230
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.240
<v 1>all right, Jesus Christ.</v>

231
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.540
We're going to do another one. We're going to start another one out, right?

232
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.730
What are you gonna do? Hey, you know what the fuck I guess. I mean,

233
00:14:35.731 --> 00:14:38.100
what do I know? I'm just another asshole.

234
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.700
But the podcast just trying to struggle through an hour.

235
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:44.710
<v 2>Um,</v>

236
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.360
<v 1>you don't ever really wish I just wished like, you know,</v>

237
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.620
why can't they just do it?

238
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.250
There's some guy shooting off his firecrackers. You don't like it?

239
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:54.650
Just go fucking do it. Stop dragging me into it.

240
00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.180
Showing me what this guy could do and how his missiles can fucking, you know,

241
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.960
was a little Roman candle. Can fucking somehow land on my house.

242
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:07.020
So what does that do for me? Mike will do it.

243
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.020
They'll start putting some plywood up on top of my house.

244
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:13.240
I got hurricanes coming. It's Christ.

245
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.120
You're in the fucking navy. You Go, that's your job.

246
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.050
Does it world news when I can't put together my new hours, stand up.

247
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.220
Oh, shut up. Go Fuck Yourself. What do you want from me? Um, so, oh,

248
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.280
anyways, so my, my daughter was, uh,

249
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.990
grabbing onto this pleather couch that we have here. All right.

250
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.780
Cause she's learning, she's learning to crawl. And uh,

251
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.860
it was funny, she was like plank and today, you know,

252
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.200
doing like not like what the kids did on the Internet.

253
00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:50.290
We just laid face down face planting is what I thought it should be called.

254
00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:54.340
She was like literally doing, she was in upper push up position. How about that?

255
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.850
The upper push up position. Um,

256
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.910
and she was learning something and I know and I should've just let her figure

257
00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:03.340
shit out instead and went, there you go, there you go.

258
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:05.770
And then she just dropped down to the floor and looked up at me and smiled.

259
00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:08.140
I was like, yeah, just distracted. So anyways,

260
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:12.850
they got this pleather couch here and her fingernails are really long and a,

261
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.270
and she was making that thinking nail down the chalkboard sound and it was

262
00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:17.980
driving me nuts. So against

263
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.260
my gut I decided to cut her fingernails, which I do.

264
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.710
Nia has told me to do. I said, I don't want to do it. Things are too small.

265
00:16:26.711 --> 00:16:30.130
She wiggles him around it. It's, I don't want to do it.

266
00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:35.131
So I got the first four done correctly and then I did her thumb and she made

267
00:16:35.741 --> 00:16:37.630
this face and started crying and I looked,

268
00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:40.170
cause she was wiggling her finger and I thought I was underneath it and I,

269
00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:43.600
I just off just gave her the little, little,

270
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.670
little cut on it. I've got another families here. I got to go get some pizza.

271
00:16:48.671 --> 00:16:51.160
I'll talk to you. I am, I really gonna pause in this right now.

272
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.380
So I made like a little cut on a finger and, uh, it was a,

273
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.480
I probably the worst feeling I've had as an adult.

274
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.553
<v 5>And um,</v>

275
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.840
<v 1>you know, when she was fine two seconds later, but for the rest of the night,</v>

276
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:06.770
every time she cried,

277
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:09.800
I was convinced it was because of that little fucking scratch I put on a finger.

278
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.053
<v 5>Um,</v>

279
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.010
<v 1>worst fucking feeling ever. And I don't know why I had to pass it on to you,</v>

280
00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:15.521
but you know what,

281
00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:19.390
if they could sit there and tell me that this little fucking fat shit over there

282
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.340
was shooting off his a, I guess that's what you do.

283
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.390
I'm going to let you know what's going,

284
00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:25.600
everything awful that's going on in the world and I'll let you know what's going

285
00:17:25.601 --> 00:17:30.370
on in my world. That was awful and a, all right. I gotta get off the, uh,

286
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.090
hang on a second. Hang on one second. Let me see what's going on.

287
00:17:34.091 --> 00:17:37.990
As far as people who are coming over. Jesus,

288
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.080
I got too much family. He had to keep going.

289
00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:44.380
I'll try to go for another few minutes here. So, uh, yeah, so that happened

290
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.290
<v 5>and um,</v>

291
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.160
<v 1>just immediately stopped.</v>

292
00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:51.870
So now she has like short fingernails or one hand and long ones on the other.

293
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.930
And I'm trying to get my wife to clip the other ones she hasn't had the time and

294
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.640
it's driving me nuts aesthetically. You know what I mean?

295
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.860
It's like the fact that like

296
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.870
the fact that five of our fingers,

297
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.990
I have short nails and the other five don't is driving me fucking crazy.

298
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.550
I don't know why. It's the same thing.

299
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.910
You know when black guys walk around with their pants hanging off their ass,

300
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:21.420
like just that you just want to pull them up, you know?

301
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.440
And then the white guy version of that is that those white guys that walk around

302
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:27.750
with their shoes untied it fucking,

303
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:32.280
I don't know why it has no effect on my life. I don't know what it is.

304
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.690
It drives me up the wall. Pull up your pants,

305
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.260
tie your fucking sneakers. Okay. Can you be an adult?

306
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.153
<v 2>Um,</v>

307
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.680
<v 1>you ever seen those guys that take it to the point?</v>

308
00:18:45.681 --> 00:18:50.120
Literally they have a long shirt on that goes past their ass and then they have

309
00:18:50.121 --> 00:18:52.280
a belt. It's like,

310
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.710
I don't know how they can still walk. I saw a guy one time,

311
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.200
his pants were literally below his junk.

312
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.070
<v 2>Um, I dunno.</v>

313
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.670
<v 1>He's crazy kids, you know, I guess they guys,</v>

314
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.610
they have to keep taking it further than the generation before.

315
00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:13.880
I figured at some point that someone's got to be a rebel and go the other way

316
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.140
and you start yanking them up, you know, till you do the old man thing,

317
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.610
which is right underneath your man boobs. Um, anyways, you don't want,

318
00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:27.611
I became fascinated with since I got here because New York has changed so much

319
00:19:27.741 --> 00:19:29.900
with all these glass towers. Um,

320
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.020
I get tallest building in Manhattan. This is new.

321
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.460
They used to be this place called the Drake hotel was Zeplin and all these guys

322
00:19:40.461 --> 00:19:42.370
stayed. And uh,

323
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.310
this place that replaced it is four 32 park avenue

324
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.660
and you can have to see the fucking views of this place.

325
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.080
It's so, it's so tall.

326
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:58.130
Like you can see the roundness of the world or the flatness,

327
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.900
you know, depending on what you believe. You can see the end of like, you know,

328
00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:06.680
those people that I think they think we kind of live in like a giant Coffee Cup.

329
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.910
Is that what it is? You know, I mean,

330
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.920
there has to be like, even people who fucking don't think it's round,

331
00:20:15.921 --> 00:20:18.770
it's gotta be half round, right? Like you cut a tennis ball and half,

332
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.000
then you just filled it all in with land and ocean. Right?

333
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.070
Do they think it's like that? I don't know.

334
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.460
To this building on the top floor, they have this, this website.

335
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.720
I think on a clear day you can almost see the Tappan zee bridge.

336
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.880
You actually look over the freedom tower past the statue of Liberty,

337
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.770
pass that and island out to the ocean and the top floor.

338
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:51.790
I can't remember. I already talked about since bobcats went for $95 million,

339
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.450
I think he'd get the top two floors or something like that and then the floor

340
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:59.260
below it, the apartment below it, second highest one,

341
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.380
there's still for sale at 85 million bucks.

342
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.460
And I think in the reason why that isn't selling is who the fuck is going to pay

343
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:11.290
$85 million to still have some asshole walking on is salience.

344
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.100
Can Get fucking keep it down up there. You know,

345
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.190
some rich goat walking around. I think, you know, they probably the,

346
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.490
I would think at that point

347
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.050
you could literally be wearing tap shoes and like it's so expensive.

348
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:30.400
The person below, you can't hear it.

349
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:34.090
They got to have some sort of soundproofing or spongy floors.

350
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:36.820
I don't know what it is cause I know people who are that God damn bridge would

351
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:39.610
not tolerate listening to somebody walk.

352
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.180
You probably have a herd of horses up to the person below it wouldn't have it.

353
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.920
So probably the reason it's not selling is they just can't handle it.

354
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.370
They can't handle. If you have that kind of money,

355
00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:51.490
you want to be the swinging Dick and you're building this somebody else above

356
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:54.820
you drop it as jumped on your forehead every time you walk out the window out

357
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:58.060
the door. Can't have that. Um,

358
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.160
what I did find interesting was that the,

359
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.600
the building was so tall that they actually had to call the FAA.

360
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.730
Um, cause I learned last time I was out here,

361
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.660
I flew um, up to a Gig in a helicopter, right?

362
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.950
I just want to see fly over the George Washington bridge just to do it. And uh,

363
00:22:17.951 --> 00:22:22.180
he said Bravo airspace, which would be LaGuardia.

364
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.240
JFK in Newark was 900 feet and above.

365
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.940
And this building is like 1300 and change,

366
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.120
so it actually literally goes up into commercial airspace.

367
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.620
So at nighttime there's like these floors that are always lit,

368
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.680
which is pretty cool. And I don't know if that's because of the,

369
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.900
the FAA or what.

370
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.960
They usually just have like blinking red lights on the top or something like

371
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:47.650
that. Like, Hey, don't hit this man. Um,

372
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.800
anyways. I don't know who, who has, who has that kind of money?

373
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.910
Who is that kind of money? How long is that elevator ride?

374
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.010
And also how long before somebody based jumps off the top of that thing

375
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.940
and if you did, could you make it out to Ellis island? Actually,

376
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:09.670
you know something as far as like jumping, that's not that high up.

377
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.640
If you're going to try to fly right. When those guys don't,

378
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.180
they usually jump off. I bow on Ron Burger, burgundy,

379
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:19.240
I want to go shout it from Bob. Don't they don't say that.

380
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:23.200
You jump off a mountain. They go all the way down a mountain. Right. Jesus.

381
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.540
Bill, you've really talked yourself into a corner here, haven't you? Yeah,

382
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:28.570
I have. I have, you know what I was going to do last week,

383
00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:30.910
I was going to sing the praises of a water taxi,

384
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:35.020
which I think I did a water taxi about how great it was,

385
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.920
underrated taking the water taxi in New York from,

386
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:43.921
from Manhattan to Brooklyn or vice versa there man and now to New Jersey,

387
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:47.480
whatever you want to do, it's awesome, right? And no sooner.

388
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.040
And I took the local to where we made like 10 stops and it took an extra half an

389
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.860
hour, but it was just relaxing and it was beautiful.

390
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.413
<v 3>Um,</v>

391
00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.620
<v 1>I made the mistake of saying how great it was in like three days after I said</v>

392
00:24:01.621 --> 00:24:02.910
that one of those yellow ones,

393
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.260
the guided slow down in time and he smashed into the dark and like 30 people got

394
00:24:07.261 --> 00:24:08.830
hurt. Uh,

395
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.420
which means really probably 12 got hurt the other 18 and looking for a payday.

396
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.003
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

397
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.460
<v 1>This guy just came cruising and he was probably texting.</v>

398
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.580
I just don't understand how you screw up that bad

399
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.860
<v 3>with the bowl.</v>

400
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.650
<v 1>There was the, the, the weather was fine. It was a clear day. Like,</v>

401
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:37.640
what did you do? You just can't cruise it in that, that,

402
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.690
those probably the guys last run of the day that Chickie's been texted,

403
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:44.900
he wanted a banger. She finally texted them back, hey, what are you doing?

404
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:48.230
I'm at a bar on peer, whatever. Yay. And he was like,

405
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.900
oh well I'll get to go with DAB. Oh Shit, Bam. Wait,

406
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.170
buddy goes flying,

407
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.270
you know the boat I was on the guy driving it,

408
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:03.830
he's like surrounded by glass. So it's not like, you know, airline pilots,

409
00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:05.090
you know, when they have a hard landing,

410
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:08.600
they just won't open the door and they just stay there. You know,

411
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.290
you can't see him cause then he'd go into the jetway. When you're on a boat,

412
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.670
there's nowhere to hide. You know, people just walked by. You just been last.

413
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.110
Sorry about the Jesus. Uh, sorry about that. Everybody laying on the ground.

414
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.980
Um, I know I'm not supposed to laugh at stuff like that,

415
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:28.490
but the end of the day I wasn't on the boat and no one I know got hurt.

416
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:30.770
So there is something kind of hilarious about it.

417
00:25:30.771 --> 00:25:33.260
Unless somebody gets seriously injured, you know,

418
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.170
is this going to spark an internet controversy now?

419
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.220
Is they going to brew be a group of six people that complain all at the exact

420
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:41.600
same time and it gets picked up.

421
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.653
<v 3>You know,</v>

422
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.420
<v 1>we're going to go to war with North Korea, but first podcasting,</v>

423
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:52.420
can it go too far? Um, all right, 25.

424
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.870
I'm trying to get up to 30 minutes here cause I don't have any of the

425
00:25:54.871 --> 00:25:58.660
advertising right now and I don't have any other questions either. Um,

426
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.250
the New York Yankees are crushing it. Ladies and gentlemen, they are a,

427
00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:07.251
they were down five games to the a $200 million Boston red sox.

428
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.960
Uh, my $200 million Boston Red Sox, your $200 million ride songs. Okay.

429
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.000
Cause teams start spending that kind of money.

430
00:26:15.001 --> 00:26:16.290
Like it's got to come from somewhere.

431
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.160
It can't just come from red sox fans and even comes from people who are not red

432
00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:23.490
sox fans. So anyways, um, they,

433
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.580
I dunno, we lost so many fucking games in a row. We finally won last night,

434
00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:33.300
Saturday night. I'm recording this Sunday and, uh,

435
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.480
one nine to eight actually scored a bunch of runs for once,

436
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.880
but the Yankees are just surgeon,

437
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:44.310
but they're only up by half a game and his leg, I don't know, 900 games left.

438
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:46.440
We'll see what happens. But, uh,

439
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:49.200
I'm watching the Yankees all week on the yes network here.

440
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.290
One of my favorite things to do, watch them and root against them.

441
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.540
It's what I always did. And when I get the baseball package,

442
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.430
I lived in New York for so long,

443
00:26:56.431 --> 00:27:00.290
it's hard for me to turn on the red sox because I,

444
00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:01.680
I for so long,

445
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.180
my baseball watching was watching the yes network rooting against the Yankees.

446
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.730
It's bizarre. Um, and somewhere in there,

447
00:27:11.731 --> 00:27:13.740
sweet Caroline came out and I don't know,

448
00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:16.470
this is just a bunch of weird shit that happens at Fenway now.

449
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.860
I went away for too long and I came back and I just don't recognize it. Uh,

450
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.730
but I am back into it and, um,

451
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.510
I really wish our team would just focus on trying to win and stop getting into

452
00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:31.980
arguments with Dennis Eckersley. Alright. He's a hall of Famer.

453
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.160
He's, I love what he does. He's great in this job.

454
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:38.160
And I don't mind that he criticizes the fricking players and uh,

455
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.520
Jesus Christ. It's like all these stories that they, you know, people at the,

456
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:46.340
I get the fuck Outta here yelling at him on the,

457
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.910
on like the team plane and everything.

458
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:51.470
Like why would you do that to a hall of Famer, you know what I mean? If he,

459
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.660
if a hall of fame standup comedian criticized my act,

460
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.700
I would listen to it be like, all right, well shit,

461
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.940
evidently I need to work on some stuff. You know what I mean?

462
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.650
I certainly wouldn't start screaming at him on the team,

463
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:09.240
a comedian play, which is basically a commercial airliner.

464
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:10.900
Um,

465
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.970
alright I'm going to take a break now cause I got to go out with the family and

466
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.021
uh, I'll come back,

467
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:19.200
I read some advertising and some questions and we will wrap it up.

468
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.280
I have not watched the f one race yet cause I don't have the channel.

469
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.290
And like I mentioned earlier, um, you know,

470
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.110
I don't know a lot of people that are into it. None of my friends are,

471
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:35.750
so no one's really gonna ruin it for me. But if I had to guess, I really,

472
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.410
I hope Lewis Hamilton didn't win again.

473
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:40.830
I hope he's just not going to run away from this thing and it just becomes

474
00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:45.810
Mercedes, Mercedes, Mercedes like it did last year. Uh, I help federal one,

475
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.370
you know, but just to keep it,

476
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.960
keep it exciting before they go on the break or whatever. Alright. That's it.

477
00:28:51.961 --> 00:28:55.950
I'm done babbling. I will love, well for you guys. It'll be like two seconds.

478
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:57.150
I'll be back in two seconds. All right.

479
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.540
<v 6>Hey and I'm back. I hope this isn't too loud.</v>

480
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.680
I'm like fucking the battery ran out of my other thing. Um,

481
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:09.330
this is me continuing on with the Monday morning podcast. Oh, lovely.

482
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:13.800
Mia, how were you this morning? I know you're not in a good mood.

483
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.560
She's not in a good mood. You know,

484
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.260
every couple when you travel, there's the one person that's freaking out,

485
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.730
but they're going to miss the plane.

486
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:26.130
And then there's the other person who could like give a shit.

487
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.410
Knee is the one that freaks out. Like, Oh my God, did we leave enough time?

488
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.920
Did we bring extra batteries in case there's no flashlights on the plate?

489
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.550
Like I don't even know. I don't even know what airline, we're still,

490
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:45.610
oh delta. Are we in Delta?

491
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:49.180
I don't know. I never fucking know. You know when I on the way to the airport,

492
00:29:49.181 --> 00:29:50.920
when the driver goes, you know,

493
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.720
I always know what airport I'm going to for the most part, the dude just goes,

494
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:59.620
what airline and it, that's when I check my itinerary, my itinerary.

495
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.680
I am going on virgin.

496
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:09.180
I am going on. You Knighted Umami baby. Um,

497
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.980
all right, so since I last talked to you, which was yesterday, uh,

498
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.780
the Yankees de Yankees lose but so did the red socks were still a half of gay

499
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:23.960
male by the way. New York sports press enough with the judge.

500
00:30:23.961 --> 00:30:28.850
Shit. Jesus Christ all rise.

501
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.200
Then they had this thing, you know, cause he's got the gap between his teeth.

502
00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.960
They like the tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but the till we get it.

503
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.740
His last name is judge Jesus. Fucking Christ. Why does,

504
00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:46.220
why do sports pages get away with puns?

505
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.370
You know,

506
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.600
every fucking other day they got some stupid pun on the back of the sports page

507
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.270
cause they can't write a fucking joke and they shouldn't be able to,

508
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.620
cause the sports writers should just tell me who won the game. Okay.

509
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.290
I don't need you to say, Oh gee,

510
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:09.160
oh Coleen Jeter. Like why is it always have to be a pun

511
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.090
sitting in there? You're all a bunch of writers.

512
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:15.310
You can't come up with anything better than that. The tooth,

513
00:31:15.311 --> 00:31:17.830
the whole tooth and nothing but the two,

514
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.060
well they just like fucking, it just ruined my goddamn day.

515
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.430
I hate when I record just off my fucking computer.

516
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:27.290
This fucking Goddamn air conditioning will not shut up.

517
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.510
<v 2>Awesome. To shut off already.</v>

518
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.600
So fucking loud off offs. Yeah.

519
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.340
Off. Why is it still on mode?

520
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.730
Low, high, fall low.

521
00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.640
There's no fucking option here off.

522
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.440
<v 6>That's it. Sorry.</v>

523
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.070
It's fucking this fucking God damn air conditioning.

524
00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.530
It either doesn't work or it's drowning out conversation. You know what I mean?

525
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.610
It's like somebody you just hope it's going to pass out.

526
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.310
But that last 10 minutes before they do that,

527
00:32:08.311 --> 00:32:12.930
just interrupt and everybody sort this fucking air conditioning. It's like, um.

528
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.220
Anyways, let's get to some of the advertising here for this week. Uh,

529
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.300
where the fuck is it? Ah, that's not it. God Dang it. Come on. Come on.

530
00:32:21.301 --> 00:32:25.860
We can do it. Ah, look. Oh look who's here. Oh, would you look at this?

531
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:27.180
It's so sip

532
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.750
Rick griller. Are you hiring well, are you,

534
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.870
we'll settle for this person. Not the person who you know. Well,

535
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:48.800
at least he put deodorant under one arm pit. We want the best one,

536
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.500
the smartest, best looking, most fuckable candidate. Right? Who's kidding?

537
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:57.830
Who, that's what you want. You want people who know their job,

538
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.790
how to do it correctly and who look good. That's what you want. You know,

you want a good looking fuckable, reliable employee.

542
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.770
And that's where zip recruiter comes in. How is ZipRecruiter different? Well,

543

uh, pays out again. What's he gonna do?

He's out again. He's gonna kill that one,

602
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:20.970
but toe he's out again. It's Oh Jay,

603
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.990
run for your lives. I love when he said, you know, I've,

604
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:30.050
I've lived in a pretty confrontation confrontation free life.

605
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.510
And that is true other than when he killed those two people. I mean,

606
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.100
he was a hell of a guy. Um,

607
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.390
all right, here we go. Let's, um,

608
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.270
let's read some of the questions here for this week. Uh, microchipping says,

609
00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:53.740
revelation 1317 is called mark of the beast.

610
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.400
That, sorry for this. Click here. This is going to be loud. Block your ears.

611
00:37:57.401 --> 00:38:02.350
Three, two, one. Click. Um, what the fuck is it?

612
00:38:02.351 --> 00:38:06.040
I know. I looked it up. There we go. Revelation.

613
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.550
This is the exact reason why I don't read the Bible. Uh,

614
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.550
library. Revelation three 17.

615
00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.640
Let's see if I can get this here.

616
00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.520
The temple of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple,

617
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.320
the arc of his testament,

618
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.950
the arc of God's testament is the holy of holies.

619
00:38:29.951 --> 00:38:32.770
The second apartment of the sanctuary.

620
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.100
<v 8>I, I, you already lost me. Okay.</v>

621
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:40.510
Evidently you can rent a room out in his church in the er or he has one of the

622
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:42.520
tenant, uh,

623
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.600
in the Minnis ministration of the early Tabernacle,

624
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:49.390
which served unto the example and shadow of heaven

625
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:51.790
of heavenly things.

626
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.950
This apartment was opened only by the Great Day of Atonement for the cleansing

627
00:38:56.951 --> 00:39:01.690
of the sanctuary. Therefore, the announcement that the temple of God was opened.

628
00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.100
Okay, well, there you go.

629
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:07.030
So I guess that explains microchipping thank you Bible.

630
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.490
That really is the good book. I mean, I, I would,

631
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.570
I think I,

632
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.720
I think I understand like computers more than I get the Bible. I just,

633
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.540
why can't they just write it in fucking today's English?

634
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:25.010
They do that with every other book of lies. No kidding. All right.

635
00:39:25.011 --> 00:39:28.250
I work for the microchip company in Wisconsin. Okay.

636
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.430
Some stick fuck offered my boss a TV show.

637
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.910
A what the fuck are they going to call it?

638
00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.460
How to shed your employees rights. Thanks asshole. Sorry. Just venting.

639
00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.730
Love your stuff. Thank God for your gifts.

640
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.750
You don't punch a clock for Satan. Only the deal.

641
00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.450
You just work for a company in Wisconsin quick the fucking job they want wanna

642
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.560
do. I Dunno. Collect unemployment and not be microchipped. Come on,

643
00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:01.400
people don't give Delta Airlines your fingerprints.

644
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.090
All right. Please don't do this. People, please don't give in to this.

645
00:40:05.091 --> 00:40:08.810
Don't go to Tiger Stadium and give them your fingerprints so you don't have to

646
00:40:08.811 --> 00:40:12.260
stand in line for a fucking pretzel. You fucking dope.

647
00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.380
And please don't be dumb enough to think we'll do my credit's fucked. Good luck.

648
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.820
If somebody steals my identity dummy,

649
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.010
they're going to create a false credit report.

650
00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:26.090
All they need is the Lee Harvey Oswald dependent on which will be you and your

651
00:40:26.091 --> 00:40:30.440
fingerprints. Your fucking dope. Yeah. You know,

652
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.780
in the future there's going to be a knock on the door and they're going to

653
00:40:32.781 --> 00:40:36.950
question why you kill the fucking red you the Ukraine. And you'd be like,

654
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.580
I've never been there in my life. Oh yeah, your fingerprints were,

655
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:45.740
but it was sort of, here's this story of a person who didn't kill a hooker.

656
00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.840
<v 10>Now he's getting banked in the ass in the Ukraine</v>

657
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
<v 8>cause he left his finger prints at the ballpark cause he wanted a chorus light.</v>

658
00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:57.083
All right. Ah,

659
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:06.140
I'm sorry. All vacuums gathering information.

660
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.860
<v 10>Uh Hey, big bald Billy thought you might enjoy this article in Rick Gads.</v>

661
00:41:12.861 --> 00:41:15.840
Do your reach the podcast on companies and fingerprints.

662
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:21.020
Now it seems like those robotic vacuums are selling maps of the inside of your

663
00:41:21.301 --> 00:41:25.960
house so you can get furniture ads. Yay.

664
00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:30.100
A massive Aussie Fan. Can't wait to hopefully see,

665
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.460
see you when I go over to the u s in the spring of 2018 yeah,

666
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.970
things are just changing. So frigging rapidly,

667
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.730
you know that was really going to be interesting is when they microchip

668
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:44.190
everybody. Okay,

669
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:48.390
they microchip everybody and then they put all the cash.

670
00:41:48.391 --> 00:41:49.950
There's no longer any cash.

671
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:55.230
What's going to be interesting then is all these fucking, you know,

672
00:41:55.231 --> 00:41:57.540
drug dealers, all these fucking,

673
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.320
I don't know anybody who just didn't trust banks and put a sack of money in the

674
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:05.240
fucking wall. What do you do with that now?

675
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:07.283
<v 11>You know,</v>

676
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.690
<v 10>now it's all on you. Now that's not even worth anything.</v>

677
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.870
You got to show up with all this shit. They be like, hey man,

678
00:42:13.871 --> 00:42:16.060
where did you get this money? And you're gonna be like, Hey man,

679
00:42:16.061 --> 00:42:19.780
I earned this money and I already paid taxes on it, man. They going to be like,

680
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.740
hey man, you got to prove that and like, hey man, I can't,

681
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.730
and then I'm going to be like, hey man, fuck your bag of cash.

682
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.970
What's going on? Nino? Do you like my song a bucket microchips do, do, do,

685
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.280
Jesus. Okay, well that was fun. Yeah. So anyways,

686
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.340
these fucking lazy ass fat fucks by these computers that just,

687
00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:59.740
these little robots, that fat that sweep up after him, you know,

688
00:42:59.741 --> 00:43:02.590
as they're eating like Ritz crackers with like ice cream in the middle of it.

689
00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:06.010
Whatever fat people do, right? They're always creating some new food,

690
00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:08.860
some unholy matrimony of Crock.

691
00:43:08.861 --> 00:43:11.230
Cabo hydrates in fucking sugars.

692
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.203
<v 11>Um,</v>

693
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.720
<v 10>they're too fucking lazy to get off their ass and use a vacuum cleaner.</v>

694
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.700
So they have this robot to it and then they map the inside of this person's

695
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:27.290
house, you know, so they can do what with it? I don't fucking know.

696
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.590
So they can sell them an l shaped couch. In fact,

697
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:34.220
people sit on l shaped couches. Can they swing their leg up to that? You know,

698
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:35.330
that other side of us,

699
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.410
I don't know why I'm making fun of the fatties today because I started with that

700
00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:45.380
fucking guy over there in, uh,

701
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.120
whatever his fucking name. I don't even know the guy's name because the lead,

702
00:43:49.121 --> 00:43:53.690
you know, cause he's crazy. I don't need to know about this guy. Um,

703
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.650
we should get him to come over to the fucking Detroit Tigers ballpark in his

704
00:43:57.651 --> 00:44:01.270
fingerprints and we'll put it on something and we'll go over there and we're a

705
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.260
restaurant. We'll stick them in. Ojs outsell.

706
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.170

707
00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.680
<v 10>how mad would he be? Can you imagine if that guy ever went to jail?</v>

708
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.580
Just standing there,

709
00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:11.813
<v 11>you know,</v>

710
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.250
<v 10>all that hair on top of his head, but nowhere else on his body. You know,</v>

711
00:44:17.251 --> 00:44:20.100
he's one of those weird hairless adults. Right? All right.

712
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.560
Girlfriend broke up with me because I like your podcast. Uh,

713
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.080

716
00:44:36.371 --> 00:44:38.880
I would like to heard more details on that one.

717
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.190
What was it that she didn't like about the podcast? My annoying voice.

718
00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:49.360
My tone deaf singing, my inability to read out loud.

719
00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.210
Um, all right. Addiction to online prostitution to ocean to ocean.

720
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.320
Dear Trojan Bill. Over the course of the last year,

721
00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:03.700
I've become addicted to online prostitution, juice exchanges. Christ too.

722
00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.970
The courage you have, you just go online.

723
00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.750
[inaudible] she was just have her come over to your fucking place like you're

724
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.220
ordering it. God Damn Pizza.

725
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.760
What does it like when you look through that fucking hole and you see her

726
00:45:17.761 --> 00:45:21.240
walking down the fucking hallway, the hole in your door,

727
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:23.040
whatever you call that thing, the little psych thing,

728
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.970
she comes stumbling out of the elevator. Um,

729
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.250
it started off as curiosity.

730
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.240
What would it be like to fuck a stranger for money and snowballed into me

731
00:45:34.241 --> 00:45:37.480
spending a percentage of almost every paycheck on hookers,

732
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:42.510
anywhere from 60 to hundred 300 try to stick with the $300 plucker.

733
00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:47.590
You really get what you paid for. Photo book is this story

734
00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:55.210
of a bunch of venereal diseases. He said,

735
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:58.540
I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago. She had no idea,

736
00:45:58.541 --> 00:46:02.290
but I didn't want to drag her into this. Well, Joe, you can't fucking do this.

737
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:04.270
When you were in a relationship with somebody,

738
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:08.121
you said,

739
00:46:08.121 --> 00:46:12.350
I recently got tested and I came up clean thank God was what I was going to say

740
00:46:12.351 --> 00:46:13.820
and he wrote it too. Thank God.

741
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:18.950
No one knows what that I do this and I prefer to keep it that way,

742
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.180
but I can't help myself from going onto those websites and meeting with these up

743
00:46:23.181 --> 00:46:26.390
with these women. I feel like it's getting worse every month.

744
00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.490
It's already cost me my relationship.

745
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:33.290
It's costing me a fortune and I'm too embarrassed to ask anyone I know for help.

746
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.760
What should I do?

747
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:40.130
And I'm sorry if Nia is in the room and completely disgusted by this.

748
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.330
I'm pretty disgusted with myself too. All right.

749
00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:47.630
This is what you have to do. The second you wake up, you gotta rub one out.

750
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.940
All right? And then you go to work and at lunch you go, that was delicious.

751
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.070
Excuse me. And you excuse yourself.

752
00:46:55.071 --> 00:46:59.210
You go in and you rub one out at them in the bathroom right now, unless you can,

753
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.830
unless you can't lock the door. And then when you come home, rub one out again.

754
00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.640
Okay. And then that's it.

755
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.990
And then you take your fucking phone and you throw it in the freezer.

756
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.910
If you have a landline, you rip it out of the wall. Um, I actually, I,

757
00:47:15.911 --> 00:47:20.840
if I was you, if like this is like, did you spend in this amount of money?

758
00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:24.080
I would just, uh, I would go to a therapist,

759
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.100
get up and just say, yeah, I'm addicted to online prostitution.

760
00:47:28.101 --> 00:47:32.020
I mean therapist to hear everything. Okay.

761
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.280
That's actually like,

762
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.460
that's like easy listening music to them compared to some of the shit they'd

763
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.961
have to, you know,

764
00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:40.240
people come in there and talk about how they got molested by one of their

765
00:47:40.241 --> 00:47:43.710
parents. I mean, it's crazy shit. You're just like, hey, you know what,

766
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.570
like banging and hookers. It's cost me a lot of money and I'd like to stop.

767
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:51.250
And they'd be like, oh my God, you're sort of functional. By all means.

768
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:54.010
Lay down on my couch and let's fucking talk about this.

769
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.480
Why do you feel you want to get prostitutes?

770
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.690
Why wouldn't you want to be with a real girl? A regular woman?

771
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.840
Um, all right. I snooped through my husband's phone. Isn't that a song,

772
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.400
isn't it? I snooped through my husband's phone and I liked it, isn't it?

773
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.390
That's fucking Serrano. Good morning Billy. Good morning, Billy. Uh,

774
00:48:19.391 --> 00:48:20.470
on Sunday morning,

775
00:48:20.471 --> 00:48:25.471
my husband had his work phone alarm set to 5:30 AM of course,

776
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:29.710
the only person it wakes up is me. After I turn the alarm off,

777
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.830
I decided to go through his phone. You fucking pores.

778
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.630
Do we go through your shit itself? The SEC fucking horse.

779
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.370
I have to admit that it wasn't my proudest moment. All right then I forgive you.

780
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.260
You're a nice person. I'm see. I just jump around,

781
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.290
but I am insecure while looking at his message,

782
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:51.580
I see that there are texts from a phone number without contact information and

783
00:48:51.581 --> 00:48:56.581
quickly figure out it is his ex-girlfriend's number and the text message.

784
00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:02.160
There's a lot of flirting as well as my husband complaining about my appearance.

785
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:04.660
Oh, Jesus Christ. Well,

786
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:09.490
this is what you get for snooping and eventually asking her to get drinks

787
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:14.410
together while we were visiting his family for father's day in their home town.

788
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.570
Oh Jesus.

789
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.890
They were together for six years on and off through college and high school.

790
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.410
She cheated on him more than once.

791
00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:28.580
Um, then when we got together,

792
00:49:28.581 --> 00:49:33.581
she harassed me on Facebook and took an eight hour bus ride to try and meet me.

793
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.580
Oh yeah. So this bitch is crazy and she's great and bet that's what's going on.

794
00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:42.610
I had to ignore all my initial reactions toward her and just ended up ignoring

795
00:49:42.621 --> 00:49:44.420
her. I didn't want her in my life.

796
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:48.770
I confronted him about it and his only response was why would I go into his

797
00:49:48.771 --> 00:49:53.540
phone and that if I go looking for something, I'm going to find it.

798
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:58.100
Jesus Christ. When I asked him why he did it, he just said he didn't know.

799
00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.740
He has ignored me ever since.

800
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:05.840
I'm not sure where to go from here. Thank you. Uh,

801
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.780
you are amazing at colossal cluster fest.

802
00:50:08.781 --> 00:50:12.870
Too bad you didn't get to finish your set. Hopefully you're in the bay area.

803
00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.570
It gets to all right. You know something.

804
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:19.880
I apologize for call neural Hor 15 fucking times in all of womanhood. Divorce.

805
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:26.150
Um, well he's not leaving any doors open here.

806
00:50:26.151 --> 00:50:28.760
I guess what I do is

807
00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:36.360
Nia. Oh, she's too busy packing.

808
00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.530
I Dunno. What do you do here? You're married. You, you have kids.

809
00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:45.970
Unless you would just visiting his father for father's Day.

810
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:49.423
<v 11>Um,</v>

811
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.660
<v 10>well he's being a total bitch about it. I can tell you that.</v>

812
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.233
<v 11>Um,</v>

813
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.110
<v 10>I think you kind of needed to have the what the fuck conversation like, uh,</v>

814
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.830
do you think if you just like, ignore me, this is going to go away.

815
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.840
Well, hey, you know, what'd you snoop to my phone for?

816
00:51:11.841 --> 00:51:15.860
If you're looking for something used to find, well yeah, well I did and I did.

817
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:19.880
Would you say that to the cops? Yeah,

818
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:22.710
we find a kilo of cocaine in the trunk of your car. Well,

819
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:27.110
what the fuck he going through the trunk of my car for be fucking looking for

820
00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:29.960
something. You got to find it. The cops gonna be like, Oh, okay.

821
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.440
<v 11>MMM. [inaudible]</v>

822
00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.740
<v 10>he fucking deserves to give you a fucking explanation.</v>

823
00:51:35.741 --> 00:51:39.070
A little better than that. And then you decide if you want to work through it.

824
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.080
And if he doesn't want to work through it, fucking dump his ass. This, this is,

825
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:48.100
this is the best you can do. I mean, come on,

826
00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.590
you're better than this. Anybody's better than this.

827
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.180
<v 11>Fuck this guy. All right,</v>

828
00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:01.420
<v 10>fuck. Is this good guy? Get off pulling a move like that. No.</v>

829
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.720
Our response like that.

830
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:04.203
<v 0>Wow.</v>

831
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.320
<v 10>You know, I, I don't, I don't get that and that's 100% not fair to you.</v>

832
00:52:08.321 --> 00:52:11.140
Fuck this guy. Okay. And I'm not saying the leave the guy,

833
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.030
but if he's not going to discuss it with you,

834
00:52:13.031 --> 00:52:17.110
then the fucking relationships over right. The trust is gone.

835
00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:21.430
Um, all right, good luck with that. And I'm sorry you're going through that.

836
00:52:21.431 --> 00:52:22.540
That's, that's really a,

837
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:26.170
the unbelievably painful and that's one of the worst fucking responses ever

838
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:28.810
slash a little legendary. I'm not gonna lie to you.

839
00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:34.290
I'm teaching guitar to a cute girl and on Jaycees please tell me she's of age.

840
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.810
I don't like the sound of this already. All right. Hi Bill.

841
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.000
I've been listening to your podcast for a while now.

842
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:46.000
Just picture this old guy applying Ben Gaze. He listens to this. Um,

843
00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:49.660
and now no, and I now know you lend,

844
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.870
you tend to give some solid romantic relationship advice.

845
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.530
So I was wondering if you, and maybe the lovely Nia too, if she's around,

846
00:52:56.531 --> 00:52:59.470
could help me out with this one. About two years back,

847
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:03.580
I met this girl in my let, in my last year of university.

848
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:06.730
We had a lot of the same classes together. So we started talking.

849
00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:09.790
We have a lot of the same interests. She's really smart.

850
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:14.200
She's funny and Nice and just all around my type,

851
00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.760
but it turns out she had a boyfriend so I backed off pretty quickly.

852
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:22.180
To this day we're friends and we try to meet up every couple of weeks.

853
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.980
Is this when Harry met Sally or is this actually your, um,

854
00:53:25.981 --> 00:53:30.981
so about two months ago she messaged me saying she always wanted to learn how to

855
00:53:31.431 --> 00:53:35.040
play guitar and that she finally bought one disc she wants, she's in the,

856
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:39.030
you do. I've been playing guitar for years,

857
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:43.110
so I told I'd be happy to meet up with her and show her some easy stuff to get

858
00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.013
her started.

859
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:48.450
It slowly morphed into this thing where every week we meet up after work for a

860
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.283
couple hours. I teach,

861
00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:53.760
I'll teacher cords and stuff and we'll talk about life in general. Anyway.

862
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:56.470
I noticed lately that a good chunk of the conversations

863
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.130
<v 8>and about how she's been fighting with her boyfriend,</v>

864
00:54:00.131 --> 00:54:02.560
the same guy as when we first met.

865
00:54:02.561 --> 00:54:07.210
Yet how many more fucking signals to your need, Jesus' crisis.

866
00:54:07.211 --> 00:54:10.460
You not put Christmas lights around her fucking vagina there.

867
00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.970
She's also keeps telling me how amazing on being for teaching her guitar.

868
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.770
And now I'm such a great guy.

869
00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:21.430
Plus the last few week if ever a boyfriend calls them were together,

870
00:54:21.431 --> 00:54:24.700
she's been sending it straight to voicemail. Okay. Alright. Alright.

871
00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.140
Well what does she have to do?

872
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.460
Grab you by the back of your neck and fucking push your face towards her?

873
00:54:30.461 --> 00:54:32.950
I mean, come on, I'm starting this, this guy goes,

874
00:54:32.951 --> 00:54:35.320
I'm starting to get the feeling she might be interesting,

875
00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:41.650
call me crazy, but this is where I need your advice.

876
00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.010
I tend to overthink things. Uh, yeah.

877
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.880
I would say because I tend to overthink things a lot in general and I've

878
00:54:48.881 --> 00:54:52.810
actually had issues with anxiety slash depression in the past.

879
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.920
I was wondering if you and Nia could help me out here and I'm reading,

880
00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:01.980
am I reading too much into things or does it seem like she's actually showing

881
00:55:02.321 --> 00:55:06.670
some interests? I'll take any help on what I should do here.

882
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:10.420
Congrats on your lovely daughter and getting the show picked up for season

883
00:55:10.421 --> 00:55:15.010
three. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um, yes sir. Jesus Christ.

884
00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:19.720
You're low self esteem jackass. Yeah, she's in to you.

885
00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:25.020
So what do you mean what you should do here? Just our team.

886
00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:29.620
Tell her how you feel. I would just say, listen,

887
00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:33.580
I hope I'm not out of line here. I know you have a boyfriend.

888
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:38.550
I would, I would just ask her. I said, so what's going on with your boyfriend?

889
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:39.600
You don't seem happy. You know,

890
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:42.750
you're always sending it to Tennessee and you're always fighting your sending it

891
00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:47.090
to the voicemail. You know, you don't seem happy, happy.

892
00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.690
And this is a 40% chance there's that. She might cry

893
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:55.100
when she finally says No.

894
00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:57.733
<v 3>Um,</v>

895
00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:02.810
<v 8>and just say, listen, I really like you and I don't,</v>

896
00:56:02.811 --> 00:56:07.310
I don't like seeing you unhappy. All right. And not for nothing.

897
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.930
Do you ever broke up with that guy?

898
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:12.620
I'd love to take you out some time now.

899
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:16.370
Would you like to learn how to do what at half court? That's it.

900
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:22.250
How about that? F as in fuck me. Um, yeah, that's what I would do.

901
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.560
I just asked her about her relationship and she's going to say it's not going

902
00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:29.590
well, and then just say, well, you know,

903
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:33.780
just say what the fuck I just said it. Put it in your own words. All right.

904
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.270
What am I seeing her no diversion rack over here?

905
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:40.590
Is that the right guy that the guy tell her you're the man.

906
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:47.200
Remember that? What was that? Uh, that was at Rodney Dangerfield movie.

907
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.810
All right. I gotta go to the fucking airport. It's nine o'clock.

908
00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:53.080
We'll get picked up in 45 minutes and I haven't even packed yet or had my

909
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:54.730
fucking breakfast sandwich there.

910
00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:57.053
<v 11>Um,</v>

911
00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.450
<v 8>oh, that's it. That's it. Yeah. That is it. Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

912
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.790
I will check in on you on Thursday and I'm going to go home today.

913
00:57:05.791 --> 00:57:08.640
I'm going to watch the Formula One race. That's what the fuck company. No,

914
00:57:08.641 --> 00:57:10.860
I'm not. I'm landing and I'm going directly

915
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.070
<v 11>and do the, uh,</v>

916
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.660
<v 8>F is for family shit. I got to go back and start writing again. Okay. That's it.</v>

917
00:57:17.661 --> 00:57:19.250
Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you.

918
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:20.203
<v 11>Oh, I know.</v>

919
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:22.890
<v 8>I already said this on Thursday. All right. Bye.</v>
