00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:02.132
- [Voiceover] We're asked
to express the area of the

00:00:02.132 --> 00:00:05.731
entire rectangle below as a trinomial.

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.169
We have our rectangle here
and it's broken up into

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.979
these three smaller rectangles.

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.983
And we see for all of these rectangles,

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:17.256
the height here is four
units and then the widths

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:19.531
are expressed in terms,
or at least the first two,

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:22.375
are expressed in terms of
x and then this last one

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:24.233
has a width of two.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.727
So what's the area of
the entire rectangle?

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.550
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about it.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.802
What's the area of this blue, this blue,

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.391
it looks like a square,
but let's just call it

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:35.912
a rectangle, which all
squares are rectangles

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:37.142
so that's safe.

00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:39.255
Well, it's going to be the
height times the width.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.531
So the area here is
going to be the height,

00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:43.899
which is four, times the width,

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.987
which is x squared.

00:00:46.987 --> 00:00:51.143
And then to that, we want
to add the area of this,

00:00:51.143 --> 00:00:54.394
I guess we could say this
salmon colored rectangle

00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:56.414
and well that's going
to be the height four

00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:58.283
times the width 3x.

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:01.139
So we could say four times 3x,

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:02.532
we could write it like that,

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:05.457
but what is 4 times 3x?

00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:07.570
Well, that's going to be 12x.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.589
You have 3x four times, I have 12 xs,

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:12.191
so that's going to be 12x.

00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:15.279
12x is the area of this
salmon colored rectangle.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.949
And then, finally, the area
of this green rectangle,

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:19.748
we actually can figure out
it exactly, we don't even

00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:21.455
have to express it in terms of a variable.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.265
Its height is four, its width is two,

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:28.020
so the area's going to be
four times two, or eight.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:31.293
And we are done.
