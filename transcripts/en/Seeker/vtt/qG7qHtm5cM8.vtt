00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.090
If there’s a giant meteor headed straight
for the earth, what should you do!?

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.799
Listen to it.

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.710
Hey there meteor maniacs, Jules here for DNews!

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
If you’ve ever watched a falling meteor,
you might hear some weird sounds.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.360
Sounds like hissing, crackling, and popping,
which might seem obvious because, well, a

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.800
rock hurtling through the atmosphere is probably
going to produce some noise.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.220
But, that meteor is likely to be many miles
away, and although sound travels pretty fast,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.250
it is still much slower than the speed of
light.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.690
For example, when you see fireworks, there
is usually a slight delay between seeing the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.239
explosion, and hearing it, depending on how
far away you are.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.050
When you see the meteor, you shouldn’t be
able to hear the sound for another few minutes.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.140
But you do.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.480
So, what’s going on?

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.420
Well, a paper published in the journal Scientific
Reports, set out to solve this conundrum,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.361
which researchers believed had less to do
with sound waves coming from the meteor, and

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.210
more to do with the light waves!

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.670
See, a meteor burning through the atmosphere
becomes a very bright fireball and can even

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.989
reach temperatures similar to the sun.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.900
It generates light in pulses, and this light
shoots in all directions.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.660
The researchers’ theory was that materials
that absorb heat well, like leaves, fine hair,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.570
and dark clothing, will be heated by this
meteors’ light.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.990
When those objects are heated, the air directly
around them is also heated, generating pressure

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.470
waves, and these pressure waves create sound.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.920
Materials that absorb heat and create acoustic
waves are called photoacoustic transducers.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.760
So… what you’re really hearing is the
result of the light and heat, not the sounds

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.200
of the meteor falling.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.600
The researchers tested their theory by shooting
super-powerful light pulses, equivalent in

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.510
brightness to those produced by meteors, at
various objects to see if a) this would produce

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.330
sounds, and b) if those sounds were consistent
with the sounds heard during a meteor fireball.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.220
It turns out that this theory, called the
photoacoustic hypothesis, was supported by

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.280
these experiments.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.280
Technically, this is not altogether dissimilar
from the way lightning produces the sounds

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.310
of thunder.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.690
When lightning strikes, it creates a huge
change in pressure and temperature, which

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.210
expands the air around it.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.869
This creates a shockwave similar to a sonic
boom, which we hear as thunder.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.590
In the case of lightning, this is the result
of electricity changing the pressure.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.050
But in the case of the meteor, it is the heat
and light emanating from the fireball.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.800
In fact, the paper states that fibrous materials,
like frizzy hair, are great transducers, meaning

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.870
that they convert pressure into sound.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.370
This is why people with frizzy hair reportedly
hear more sounds during a meteor fall; not

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.170
only is the hair located near the ears where
it is likely to be heard, it also has a large

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.140
surface-to-volume ratio which can maximize
how much sound is created in the first place.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.200
In a nutshell, the researchers concluded that
an observant person in a quiet environment,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.640
who is surrounded by good transducers like
hair, leaves, black paint, or dark clothing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.610
would be able to hear this photo-acoustic
sound during a meteor fireball.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.840
So the next time you see a meteor, listen
closely, you might just hear its light.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.590
So, what actually happens when that meteor
strikes the Earth?

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.570
And have you ever heard the sound of a meteor
