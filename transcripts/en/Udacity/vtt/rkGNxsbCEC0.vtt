So Lauren just mentioned phobia when she talked about agoraphobia. So, the

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.314
question then is well, what is a phobia? Well a phobia is a persistent and

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:13.166
unreasonable fear of a particular activity, object, or a situation. So, for

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:17.969
instance let's take social phobia. Social phobia then is an unreasonable and

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:22.325
persistent fear of social situations. Fear of being scrutinized and humiliated

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:27.794
by other people. Now, this fear can be limited to specific social situations,

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:34.200
like public speaking, or it can be generalized to most any social situation.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.362
The problem with social anxiety and social phobia though, is that it can be

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:42.194
self-perpetuating. Meaning that by being anxious in social situations you might

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:45.704
draw more attention to yourself from other people and that in turn just builds

00:00:45.704 --> 00:00:47.860
on the anxiety.
