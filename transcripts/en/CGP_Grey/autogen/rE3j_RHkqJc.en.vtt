00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.120
 welcome 

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.799
 Ideas compete for a place in your mind: pictures of cats, news, beliefs, forms, 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.260
 Funny photos, educational videos, educational videos and limited space of thought. 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.560
 An idea without a mind thinks it, you die. 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.310
 Now we are dealing with ideas as if they are alive. Such as microbes. 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.289
 It may seem strange, but be patient with me. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.089
 Take jokes, for example. Bacteria germs live in your mind - and when you say humor 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.980
 For another mind, help it spread. 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 Such as the flu that spreads if you completely thirst. The bacteria enter 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.930
 To the body through the mouth or in our example words across the ear. But it is an infection 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.940
 in both cases. 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.370
 Entering the social networking pages, then, is exposing yourself to the insults of all people's minds. Each 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.399
 A leaf containing an intellectual germ trying to get into your mind - even if you do not have to stay forever 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.179
 It is at least a period of time that will make you press the button to participate in the idea 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.730
 For all the minds you know. 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.100
 In this context, the image of a funny cat with the perfect suspension will be a superhero flu. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.670
 Just as germs exploit the weak points of your immune system, you use intellectual germs 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.070
 Weaknesses in your mind. More clearly: emotions. 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.740
 When they enter, intellectual germs play with emotion to spread more 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.659
 -- Much more. Except grief, the sad intellectual germs do not spread much. 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.700
 Very good and this is why I see antibacterial spores like biological weapons 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.820
 Arm them with titles such as: "7 things will stun you" or "dangerous secret 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.740
 Behind ... this thing " 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.430
 But anger is the lethal weapon of intellectual germs. Anger infiltrates behind your immune system, 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.329
 And force you to spread the germ. 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.680
 Your awareness of the weaknesses of your mind is very important to clean your mind - as your science 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.380
 How to wash your hands. Because even without deliberate, or germ 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.920
 An intellectual on the Internet can, alone, infect many minds while spreading. If we talked about 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.350
 Cause, let's forget the anger for a moment and go back to the image of the cat. 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.850
 Each image taken is a germ of thought, and most of them die dead as fast as billions 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.479
 Images for cats (or children) that are placed online but do not spread. But it is a small picture 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.630
 Funny screenshots can grow a lot, because it's our transatlantic journeys 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.280
 The best thing that can happen to germs, the Internet is the best thing that can happen 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 Of intellectual germs. 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.789
 The image of the cat is an intellectual germ, when riding it jumps to other minds. And 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.680
 Those minds may publish them, and here's the key point, sometimes changing them - in Photoshop here 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.629
 Edit the comment there. 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.330
 Most of the modifications are very bad, but some make the intellectual germ more funny, helping the minds 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.980
 To publish more. Leading to more changes and a greater likelihood of fame. And so slowly 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.319
 Cat's image is capable of achieving mastery over minds. For at least a few hours. 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.349
 The Internet, with its unique ability to propagate and indiscriminate change of intellectual germs 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.180
 It must make them stronger. 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.800
 With jokes, this is good - but it is not always good with spores of anger. No. 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.590
 The germs of anger, the more they spread the more they go through the same stages of change and distortion 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.700
 To become more provocative. They have a better chance of spreading than they are more accurate 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.459
 But be dull. 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.650
 But as the plague, the germs of intellect can burn quickly. See 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.120
 Any program that makes Internet publications, and will see a full-blown microbial life cycle. 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.379
 But some intellectual germs have found a way to avoid this extinction. I have to warn you that it is Ali 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.250
 Any germ that lives in your mind, the next part may 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.190
 Sounds scary. Please take this into account, we are talking about what makes some 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.379
 Intellectual germs, especially angry ones, are successful. We do not talk about whether they are good or bad. 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.560
 The same deep .. Calm. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.150
 Intellectual germs are able to flare up because once everyone agrees, it is difficult to keep talking, and thus 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.239
 Think about them. 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.569
 But if there is an opposing intellectual germ, a controversy, in which case thinking can not stop. Controversy 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.939
 You do not have to be full of anger, but again, anger helps! The more controversy becomes apparent 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.269
 The greater the number of participants in the debate, the more participants in the debate, the more controversial the debate, which helps any group 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.260
 One of the most quiet internet sites turns into a double rage storm 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.769
 In less than a second! 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.470
 Wait a moment! These intellectual germs do not wrestle! They suffer! In collaboration 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.689
 They have access to more minds and stick to their ideas more than the work of each of them individually. When germs are intellectual 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.819
 On opposite sides of a controversy, this makes them co-existent. 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.579
 One of the means used by "living spores of anger" is either you are with us or you are against us! 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.329
 If you feel any germ on your head, just push it back. This video 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.189
 This is not really why. We are only talking about this medium, which makes it difficult for neutral minds 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.180
 To resist, being hostile also helps to grow their partner. 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.100
 This explains why the number of enemies increases as the number of allies grows in a debate. Because he 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.340
 Although the participants in the debate think they are in a fierce war 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.940
 But from the perspective of germs, there is a side of roses, and the other side a flock of butterflies. 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.340
 Of course the more roses, the more butterflies, the more butterflies, 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.260
 The more roses thrive the more 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.650
 If I am there is a strong argument divides the people into two halves, and lasts forever until that 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.750
 Neutralists find it difficult to avoid this division, you are definitely looking at a husband now 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.530
 Of the spores of anger that have finally reached a stable environment 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.280
 And now the last bleak idea. 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.400
 Those that will reveal your secrets, - actually are not just a bleak idea. 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.700
 When the opposing groups grow up, they really do not argue with each other, they actually argue 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.310
 With themselves for their anger around the other group. In fact we can record quarrels 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.350
 That occur online to see this practically. Each group in its own part becomes isolated from the rest of the Internet, 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.780
 They share their thoughts about the other group! 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.530
 We can now see where this will happen to us, right ?! 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.310
 Each group becomes a breeding ground for "intellectual germs" from the other group - as we have said before 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.880
 The most "angry" - and not necessarily the right - will spread faster. Each group will 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.300
 To build an angry "picture" of the other group to talk about it all the time 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.990
 In the same way that you are now aware, this "picture" will always remain 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.240
 Exciting. 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.210
 All of the above was not to say that there is no purpose of argument. (We talked about this in a previous video). 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.740
 Or to say that "Internet" is not surprising, or that it is useless to try to change 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.120
 Human Views. Intellectual germs come and go. 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.120
 But it is useful to be aware of how thought can use our feelings of diffusion 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.280
 And how the faster the spread of the idea the greater the chance to become * better * 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.940
 In diffusion through different changes. Sometimes this is excellent, but in some others, 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.750
 It becomes terrible. 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.490
 But if you want to maintain a healthy mind, you should be careful of the ideas that are 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.310
 Pass through different minds to attack you in your weaknesses. 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.280
 It's your mind - keep it healthy! 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.610
 This video intellectual germ turn, deliberately prepared 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.580
 To spread the idea of ​​germs on the germs of intellectual - to reveal our secrets - in the words of some. 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.970
 But I tried as much as possible not to make this video attack your mind through emotions, 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.500
 So I need your help to spread. Please be a good germist and press the share button 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.500
 To snooze this video on your friends. And your colleagues at work. Your family. Put them all in the infection. 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.950
 You've shared the video, have not you? If you are still here, you have been severely infected. 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.160
 The only other thing is to click here to share the e-mail, which will show you 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.160
 For more intellectual germs like this video.
