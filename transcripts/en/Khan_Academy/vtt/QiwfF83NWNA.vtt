00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.810
Now that we've seen
that as we take i

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.740
to higher and higher powers,
it cycles between 1, i,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.260
negative 1, negative i, then
back to 1, i, negative 1,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.290
and negative i.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.155
I want to see if we can
tackle some, I guess

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:15.780
you could call them,
trickier problems.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.110
And you might see these surface.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.526
And they're also
kind of fun to do

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:22.180
to realize that you can use
the fact that the powers of i

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.320
cycle through these values.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.990
You can use this to really,
on a back of an envelope,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.100
take arbitrarily
high powers of i.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.650
So let's try, just
for fun, let's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.310
see what i to the
100th power is.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.280
And the realization here is
that 100 is a multiple of 4.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.800
So you could say that this
is the same thing as i

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.467
to the 4 times 25th power.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.050
And this is the same thing, just
from our exponent properties,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.167
as i to the fourth power
raised to the 25th power.

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.000
If you have something
raised to an exponent,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.090
and then that is
raised to an exponent,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.300
that's the same thing as
multiplying the two exponents.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.170
And we know that
i to the fourth,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.420
that's pretty straightforward.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.390
i to the fourth is just 1.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.590
i to the fourth is
1, so this is 1.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.300
So this is equal to
1 to the 25th power,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.910
which is just equal to 1.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.867
So once again, we use this
kind of cycling ability of i

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:20.450
when you take its
powers to figure out

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.672
a very high exponent of i.

00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:24.880
Now let's say we try something
a little bit stranger.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.200
Let's try i to the 501st power.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.620
Now in this situation, 501,
it's not a multiple of 4.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.310
So you can't just
do that that simply.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.226
But what you could do,
is you could write this

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:41.500
as a product of two
numbers, one that

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.140
is i to a multiple
of fourth power.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.580
And then one that isn't.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.050
And so you could rewrite this.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.390
500 is a multiple of 4.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.000
So you could write this as
i to the 500th power times i

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.960
to the first power.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.230
Right?

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.070
You have the same base.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.840
When you multiply,
you can add exponents.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.960
So this would be i
to the 501st power.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.170
And we know that this
is the same thing

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.920
as-- i to the 500th power
is the same thing as i

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.050
to the fourth power.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.700
4 times what?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.760
4 times 125 is 500.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.280
So that's this part right
over here. i to the 500th

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.510
is the same thing as i to the
fourth to the 125th power.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.150
And then that times
i to the first power.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.800
Well, i to the fourth is 1.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.690
1 to the 125th power
is just going to be 1.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.130
This whole thing is 1.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.140
And so we are just left
with i to the first.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.222
So this is going
to be equal to i.

00:02:39.222 --> 00:02:41.430
So it seems like a really
daunting problem, something

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.180
that you would have
to sit and do all day,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.090
but you can use this cycling
to realize look, i to the 500th

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.620
is just going to be 1.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.690
And so i to the 501th is just
going to be i times that.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.060
So i to any multiple of 4--
let me write this generally.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.450
So if you have i to any multiple
of 4, so this right over here

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.030
is-- well, we'll just restrict k
to be non-negative right now. k

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.380
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.250
So if we have i to any
multiple of 4, right over here,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.130
we are going to get 1, because
this is the same thing as i

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.280
to the fourth power
to the k-th power.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.180
And that is the same thing
as 1 to the k-th power,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.960
which is clearly equal to 1.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.510
And if we have
anything else-- if we

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.340
have i to the 4k plus 1 power,
i to the 4k plus 2 power,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.640
we can then just do this
technique right over here.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640
So let's try that with a
few more problems, just

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.920
to make it clear that
you can do really,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.200
really arbitrarily crazy things.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.020
So let's take i to
the 7,321st power.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.540
Now, we just have
to figure out this

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.940
is going to be some multiple
of 4 plus something else.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.870
So to do that, well, you could
just look at it by sight,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.870
that 7,320 is divisible by 4.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.270
You can verify that by hand.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.160
And then you have
that 1 left over.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.020
And so this is going to
be i to the 7,320 times

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.770
i to the first power.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.905
This is a multiple of 4-- this
right here is a multiple of 4--

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:17.240
and I know that because
any 1,000 is multiple of 4,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.209
any 100 is a multiple of 4,
and then 20 is a multiple of 4.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.497
And so this right over
here will simplify to 1.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.080
Sorry, that's not i
to the i-th power.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.960
This is i to the first power.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.240
7,321 is 7,320 plus 1.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.287
And so this part right over
here is going to simplify to 1,

00:04:37.287 --> 00:04:38.870
and we're just going
to be left with i

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.100
to the first power, or just i.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.600
Let's do another one.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.860
i to the 90-- let me try
something interesting.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.230
i to the 99th power.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.860
So once again, what's
the highest multiple

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.490
of 4 that is less than 99?

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.590
It is 96.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.930
So this is the same thing
as i to the 96th power times

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.400
i to the third power, right?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.320
If you multiply these, same
base, add the exponent,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.840
you would get i
to the 99th power.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.410
i to the 96th power, since
this is a multiple of 4,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.740
this is i to the fourth, and
then that to the 16th power.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.850
So that's just 1 to the
16th, so this is just 1.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.670
And then you're just left
with i to the third power.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.940
And you could either remember
that i to the third power

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.630
is equal to-- you
can just remember

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.880
that it's equal to negative i.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.270
Or if you forget that,
you could just say, look,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.480
this is the same thing
as i squared times i.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.360
This is equal to
i squared times i.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.800
i squared, by definition,
is equal to negative 1.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.340
So you have negative 1 times
i is equal to negative i.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.890
Let me do one more
just for the fun of it.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.840
Let's take i to the 38th power.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.450
Well, once again,
this is equal to i

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.230
to the 36th times i squared.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.040
I'm doing i to the 36th
power, since that's

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.920
the largest multiple
of 4 that goes into 38.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.730
What's left over is this 2.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.870
This simplifies
to 1, and I'm just

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.530
left with i squared, which
is equal to negative 1.
