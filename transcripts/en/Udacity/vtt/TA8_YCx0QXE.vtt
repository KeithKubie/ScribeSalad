00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.480
We learned how to use free tools to
understand what people will search when

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.190
searching for a solution.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.920
Now let's think about
the places either virtual or

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.310
physical that potential customers
will be exposed to your business.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.650
These places are the path to get
your product to your customer.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.690
We call them distribution channels.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.080
For Coca-Cola, a distribution channel
can be a grocery store or a restaurant.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.950
Usually for consumer packaged goods,
the distribution channel is wholesale,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.320
retail, distributors,
e-commerce websites, things like that.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
Now for your app, it'll probably be one
of the app stores, or a website, or

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.870
even a creative partnership
you can think of.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.010
So on that note,
let's talk about partnerships.
