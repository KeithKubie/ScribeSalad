00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:16.871
This is Zeno of Elea,

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:18.377
an ancient Greek philosopher

00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:21.042
famous for inventing a number of paradoxes,

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.560
arguments that seem logical,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.779
but whose conclusion is absurd or contradictory.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.183
For more than 2,000 years,

00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:29.694
Zeno's mind-bending riddles have inspired

00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:31.310
mathematicians and philosophers

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.746
to better understand the nature of infinity.

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:35.525
One of the best known of Zeno's problems

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.741
is called the dichotomy paradox,

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:41.527
which means, "the paradox of cutting in two" in ancient Greek.

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:43.315
It goes something like this:

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:46.154
After a long day of sitting around, thinking,

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:48.950
Zeno decides to walk from his house to the park.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.397
The fresh air clears his mind

00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:51.920
and help him think better.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.075
In order to get to the park,

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.428
he first has to get half way to the park.

00:00:55.428 --> 00:00:56.601
This portion of his journey

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.443
takes some finite amount of time.

00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:00.452
Once he gets to the halfway point,

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:02.841
he needs to walk half the remaining distance.

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.868
Again, this takes a finite amount of time.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:08.140
Once he gets there, he still needs to walk

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.882
half the distance that's left,

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:12.371
which takes another finite amount of time.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:15.522
This happens again and again and again.

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:18.195
You can see that we can keep going like this forever,

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:19.857
dividing whatever distance is left

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:21.772
into smaller and smaller pieces,

00:01:21.772 --> 00:01:25.278
each of which takes some finite time to traverse.

00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:27.958
So, how long does it take Zeno to get to the park?

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.317
Well, to find out, you need to add the times

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:32.284
of each of the pieces of the journey.

00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:36.616
The problem is, there are infinitely many of these finite-sized pieces.

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:39.750
So, shouldn't the total time be infinity?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.548
This argument, by the way, is completely general.

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:45.092
It says that traveling from any location to any other location

00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:47.254
should take an infinite amount of time.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:51.006
In other words, it says that all motion is impossible.

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:52.785
This conclusion is clearly absurd,

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:54.784
but where is the flaw in the logic?

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:55.966
To resolve the paradox,

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.731
it helps to turn the story into a math problem.

00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:01.618
Let's supposed that Zeno's house is one mile from the park

00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:04.341
and that Zeno walks at one mile per hour.

00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.692
Common sense tells us that the time for the journey

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:08.205
should be one hour.

00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:10.867
But, let's look at things from Zeno's point of view

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.196
and divide up the journey into pieces.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.656
The first half of the journey takes half an hour,

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:17.782
the next part takes quarter of an hour,

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:20.064
the third part takes an eighth of an hour,

00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:20.969
and so on.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.266
Summing up all these times,

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.372
we get a series that looks like this.

00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:25.624
"Now", Zeno might say,

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.964
"since there are infinitely many of terms

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:29.621
on the right side of the equation,

00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.883
and each individual term is finite,

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:34.518
the sum should equal infinity, right?"

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:36.670
This is the problem with Zeno's argument.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.855
As mathematicians have since realized,

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:42.618
it is possible to add up infinitely many finite-sized terms

00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:44.814
and still get a finite answer.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:45.989
"How?" you ask.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.486
Well, let's think of it this way.

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:50.390
Let's start with a square that has area of one meter.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.528
Now let's chop the square in half,

00:02:52.528 --> 00:02:54.909
and then chop the remaining half in half,

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.172
and so on.

00:02:56.172 --> 00:02:57.239
While we're doing this,

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.380
let's keep track of the areas of the pieces.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.169
The first slice makes two parts,

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.028
each with an area of one-half

00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:06.545
The next slice divides one of those halves in half,

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:07.796
and so on.

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:10.227
But, no matter how many times we slice up the boxes,

00:03:10.227 --> 00:03:14.814
the total area is still the sum of the areas of all the pieces.

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:17.442
Now you can see why we choose this particular way

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:18.971
of cutting up the square.

00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:20.888
We've obtained the same infinite series

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:23.356
as we had for the time of Zeno's journey.

00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:25.791
As we construct more and more blue pieces,

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:27.314
to use the math jargon,

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:30.742
as we take the limit as n tends to infinity,

00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:33.356
the entire square becomes covered with blue.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.427
But the area of the square is just one unit,

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:38.700
and so the infinite sum must equal one.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.754
Going back to Zeno's journey,

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:42.370
we can now see how how the paradox is resolved.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.713
Not only does the infinite series sum to a finite answer,

00:03:45.713 --> 00:03:47.745
but that finite answer is the same one

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:50.172
that common sense tells us is true.

00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:52.877
Zeno's journey takes one hour.
