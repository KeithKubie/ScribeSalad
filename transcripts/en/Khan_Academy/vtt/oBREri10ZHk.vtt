00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:02.112
- [Voiceover] So i have
a box and whiskers plot

00:00:02.112 --> 00:00:05.526
showing us the ages of
students at a party.

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:08.336
And what I'm hoping to do in this video is

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:10.936
get a little bit of
practice interpreting this.

00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:13.026
And what I have here are
five different statements

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:14.628
and I want you to look
at these statements.

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:16.184
Pause the video, look at these statements,

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:17.565
and think about which of these,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.540
based on the information in
the box and whiskers plot,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.211
which of these are for sure true,

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:22.651
which of these are for sure false,

00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:24.207
and which of these we don't
have enough information,

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:25.895
it could go either way.

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.358
Alright, so let's work through these.

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:29.959
So the first statement is
that all of the students

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:31.909
are less than 17 years old.

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.093
Well we see, right over
here, that the maximum age,

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:37.397
that's the right end of
this right whisker is 16.

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:39.441
So it is the case that
all of the students are

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:40.857
less than 17 years old.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:43.597
So this is definitely going to be true.

00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:44.874
The next statement.

00:00:44.874 --> 00:00:49.447
At least 75% of the students
are 10 years old or older.

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:52.374
So, when you look at
this, this feels right,

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:56.739
because 10 is, 10 is the value

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.444
that is at the beginning
of the second quartile.

00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:01.346
This is the second
quartile right over there.

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:02.645
And actually, let me do this,

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.527
let me do this in a different color.

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:07.615
So, this is the second quartile.

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:11.145
So 25% of the value of the
numbers are in the second,

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.513
or roughly, sometimes it's not exactly,

00:01:13.513 --> 00:01:16.270
so approximately, I'll say roughly 25%

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.547
are going to be in this second quartile,

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:21.727
approximately 25% are going
to be in the third quartile,

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:23.140
and approximately 25% are going to

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.781
be in the fourth quartile.

00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:29.357
So it seems reasonable for
saying 10 years old or older

00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:31.262
that this is going to be,

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:33.096
this is going to be true.

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:34.350
In fact, you could even have a couple

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.834
of values in the first
quartile that are 10.

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:38.158
But to make that a little more tangible,

00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.178
let's look at some, so I'm feeling,

00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:42.174
I'm feeling good that this is true,

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:44.334
but let's look a few more examples

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:46.423
to make this a little more concrete.

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:47.608
So they don't know, we don't know,

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.048
based on the information here exactly

00:01:49.048 --> 00:01:50.324
how many students are at the party.

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:52.554
We'll have to construct some scenarios.

00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:55.502
So we could do a scenario,

00:01:55.502 --> 00:01:56.896
let's see if we can do...

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:59.019
We could do a scenario where

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:01.505
well let's see, let's see if I can,

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:03.029
I can construct something
where, let's see,

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:04.445
the median is 13.

00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:06.117
We know that for sure.

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:09.218
The median is 13, so if
I have an odd number,

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:12.305
I would have 13 in the
middle, just like that,

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:14.209
and maybe I have three on either side.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.511
And I'm just making that number up.

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.460
I'm just trying to see what I can learn

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.156
about different types of data sets

00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:23.626
that could be described by
this box and whiskers plot.

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:28.583
So 10 is going to be the
middle of the bottom half.

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.151
So that's 10 right over there.

00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.797
And 15 is going to be the
middle of the top half.

00:02:32.797 --> 00:02:35.561
That's what this box and
whiskers plot is telling us.

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:37.395
And they of course tell
us what the minimum,

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:39.043
the minimum is seven.

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:41.342
And they tell us that the maximum is 16.

00:02:41.342 --> 00:02:43.912
So we know that's seven
and then that is 16.

00:02:44.704 --> 00:02:46.816
And then this, right over
here, could be anything.

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.023
It could be 10, it could be 11,

00:02:48.023 --> 00:02:49.486
it could be 12, it could be 13.

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:51.924
It wouldn't change what these medians are.

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:54.120
It wouldn't change this
box and whiskers plot.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.023
Similarly, this could
be 13, it could be 14,

00:02:57.023 --> 00:02:59.738
it could be 15, and so any of those

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:01.286
values wouldn't change it.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.723
And so 75% are 10 or older, well,

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:06.742
this value, in this case, six out of seven

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:08.553
are 10 years old or older.

00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:10.270
And we could try it out with other,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.477
other scenarios where...

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:17.477
let's try to minimize the number
of 10s given this data set.

00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:20.523
Well we could do something like,

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:23.589
let's say that we have eight.

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.393
So let's see, one, two, three, four,

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:29.201
five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.267
And so here we know that the minimum,

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:33.706
we know that the minimum is seven,

00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:36.028
we know that the maximum is 16.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.698
We know, we know that the,

00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:40.719
we know that the mean of
these middle two values,

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.389
we have an even number now so,

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.268
the median is going to be
the mean of these two values.

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:50.610
So, it's going to be the
mean of this and this,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.279
is going to be 13.

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.253
And we know that the mean of,

00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:58.505
we know that the mean of this and this

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:01.639
is going to be 10 and that
the mean of this and this

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.029
is going to be, is going to be 15.

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:07.212
So what could we construct?

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:08.327
Well actually, we don't
even have to construct

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:09.301
to answer this question.

00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:12.065
We know that, we know that this is going,

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:14.967
this is going to have to be 10 or larger.

00:04:14.967 --> 00:04:16.059
And then all of these other things

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:20.005
are going to be 10 or larger,
so this is exactly 75%.

00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:22.815
Exactly 75% if we assume
that this is less than 10,

00:04:22.815 --> 00:04:25.160
are going to be 10 years old or older.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.645
So feeling very good, very good,

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:29.665
about this one right over here.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.081
And actually, just to make this concrete,

00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.660
I'll put in some values here.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.471
You know this could be,

00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:38.000
this could be a nine and an 11.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.411
This could be a 12 and a 14.

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:46.010
This could be a 14 and a 16.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.980
Or, it could be, it
could be a 15 and a 15.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.088
You could think about
it and in any of those,

00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:54.505
in any of those ways.

00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:56.409
But feeling very good
that this is definitely

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.382
going to be true based on the information

00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:00.321
given in this plot.

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:04.712
Now they say there's only one
seven-year-old at the party.

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:06.452
One seven-year-old at the party.

00:05:06.452 --> 00:05:10.006
Well this first, this first
possibility that we looked at,

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:10.795
that was the case.

00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:12.931
There was only one
seven-year-old at the party

00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:15.068
and there was one
16-year-old at the party.

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:15.996
And actually, that was the next statement,

00:05:15.996 --> 00:05:17.899
there's only one 16-year-old at the party.

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:19.642
So both of these seem like we can

00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:22.334
definitely construct
data that's consistent

00:05:22.334 --> 00:05:25.005
with this box plot, box and whiskers plot,

00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:26.213
where this is true.

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:28.054
But could we construct
one where it's not true?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.923
Well sure.

00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:32.925
Let's imagine, let's see,
we have our median at 13.

00:05:33.647 --> 00:05:35.086
Median at 13.

00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:37.872
And then we have, let's see,

00:05:37.872 --> 00:05:40.352
one, two, three, four, five.

00:05:40.352 --> 00:05:42.877
One, two, three, four, five.

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:46.895
This is gonna be, this is gonna be the 10,

00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:49.078
the median of this bottom half.

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:51.168
This is going to be 15.

00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:53.884
This is going to be seven.

00:05:53.884 --> 00:05:55.625
This is going to be 16.

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:56.903
Well this could also be seven.

00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:57.715
It doesn't have to be.

00:05:57.715 --> 00:05:59.294
It could be seven, eight, nine, or ten.

00:05:59.294 --> 00:06:00.641
This could also be 16.

00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:01.500
Doesn't have to be.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.381
It could be 15 as well.

00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:05.609
But just like that, I've
constructed a data set,

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:07.954
and these could be, you know
this could be 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:06:07.954 --> 00:06:09.882
This could be 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:11.345
This could be 13, 14, 15.

00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:13.457
This one also could be 13, 14, 15.

00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:16.545
But the simple thing is,
or the basic idea here,

00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:18.845
I can have a data set where
I have multiple sevens

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.470
and multiple 16s, or I
could have a data set

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.232
where I only have one
seven or only one 16.

00:06:23.232 --> 00:06:28.010
So both of these statements,
we just plain don't know.

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:32.532
We just don't, we just don't know.

00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:33.996
Now the next statement,

00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:36.660
exactly half the students
are older than 13.

00:06:37.526 --> 00:06:40.029
Well if you look at this
possibility up here,

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.780
we saw that three out of the seven

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.941
are older than 13.

00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:48.030
So that's not exactly half.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.190
3/7 is not 1/2.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.094
But in this one over here, we did see that

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:56.806
exactly half are over, are older than 13.

00:06:56.806 --> 00:06:59.176
In fact, if you're saying exactly half...

00:06:59.176 --> 00:07:01.219
Well, in this one we're
saying that exactly half

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:03.053
are older than 13.

00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:05.049
We have an even number right over here.

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.837
And so it is exactly half.

00:07:06.837 --> 00:07:09.021
So it's possible that it's true,

00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:10.228
it's possible that it's not true

00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:11.481
based on the information given.

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.945
We once again,

00:07:12.945 --> 00:07:15.730
we once again don't,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.169
we once again do not know.

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:19.655
Anyway, hopefully you
found this interesting.

00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:22.254
This is, the whole point of me doing this

00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:23.973
is when you look at statistics,

00:07:23.973 --> 00:07:25.669
sometimes it's easy to kind of say,

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:27.573
okay I think it roughly means that,

00:07:27.573 --> 00:07:28.989
and that's sometimes okay.

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:31.056
But it's very important
to think about what types

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:33.122
of actual statements you can make

00:07:33.122 --> 00:07:35.119
and what you can't make
and it's very important

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:36.395
when you're looking at statistics to say,

00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:38.184
well you know what, I just don't know.

00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:40.134
That the data actually is not telling me

00:07:40.134 --> 00:07:41.989
that thing for sure.
