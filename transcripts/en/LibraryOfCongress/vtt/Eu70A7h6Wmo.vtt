00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.790
&gt;&gt; Mary Quattlebaum: You
know we all know him well,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.330
everybody in this room, we know
his face, his voice, his words,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.430
he's the news director and
lead anchor of EWTN News.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.690
The news division of Eternal
Word Television Network,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.490
Global Catholic Television Network.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.920
He has written bestselling books
about Mother Angelica and I grew

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.590
up with a mom who loved and quoted
Mother Angelica as did my husband.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.270
Let's see, but what we're
really here for today is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.420
to celebrate Raymond's new
childrens adventure series

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.020
about a 12 year old
guy named Will Wilder.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.100 position:56%
And trying saying Will Wilder really
quickly, it's almost impossible.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.230
I think he must have done that
to the people that are going

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.580
to be reading your
books out loud right?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.860
The first book is Will Wilder,
The Relic of Perilous Falls

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.020
and it's being compared to
Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.450
and the Olympians series,
which is high praised.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.260
It's full of danger and daring do.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.200
Will is the Indiana Jones of the
middle school crowd and Dave Berry

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.540
and we all listen to Dave
Berry called the book a wild

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.450
and thrilling tale.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.560
Raymond's second book comes
out next spring Will Wilder,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.140
The Lost Staff of Wonder.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.270
The reviewed journal book
list praised the relic

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.710
of Perilous Falls saying it had
a likeable cast of characters,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.130
plenty of suspense and
battles between good and evil.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.760 position:56%
So I really looking forward to
hearing Raymond talk about his ideas

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.710
for getting the book,
where the series might go,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.510
after the first two books, so join
me in welcoming Raymond Arroyo.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.390
[ Applause ]

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.690
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo:
And you got the tongue

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.290
and you even the tongue
twister right.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.760
I know it's a challenge.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.130
Hi everybody, thank
you all for coming out.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.240
I, this series started in a odd
way, though some of you know me

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.700
from television I'm a
journalist by trade.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.860
Which means I run around
telling everybody else's stories.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.950
But this has allowed me
to go to places that most

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.120
of us don't ever get to go.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.410
Into catacombs, into
secret chambers,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.880
into vaults that haven't been
opened in centuries or seen

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.160
by people in many many years.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.680
And all of that was kind of working
in the back of my mind and because

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.330
of my children, we have three
children, parents often end

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.840
up telling their kids stories

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.140
and I told my children
stories at bath time.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.440
So I often say Will Wilder was born
as a soap opera, which is true.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.460
I would tell the stories, oh I
love, you're so good at this.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.810
I could watch her, see
this is very distracting

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.990
because I'd be watching
you and not me.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.240
I'm going to stand over here.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.550
But she's much better
at this than I am.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.250
What I love about the
series is it really was born

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.890
for children and because
of children.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.830
My kids often had difficulty moving

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.020
from one phase of bathing
to the next.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.720
So to get them to dry off and
then to brush their teeth and then

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.070
to comb their hair, I would
create these little stories

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.280
and it was about a wacky family.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.640
A 12 year old kid who
was an adventurer,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.820
a little bit of a rule
breaker, just a little bit.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.750
And he would often find
himself getting into trouble

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.690
by exploring things that
he had questions about,

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.680
which I think we all do at
some point in our lives.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.840
So, I would, I started telling,
he wasn't Will Wilderthen,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.610
he a very different name, if you
think Will Wilder was hard Mary,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.110
you should have heard the
original name aah, Carmen Derman.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.780 position:56%
The minute Random House signed the
contract they said we love the story

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.180
except you got to change the
kids name, so I went away

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.530
and found something better.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.520
Will Wilder's actually a
great name for this character.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.060
Because he has a very strong will
and anybody know what a wilder is?

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.100
Do you know what a,
it's an occupation.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.180
Do you know what a wilder is?

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.670 position:56%
Nobody. A wilder is one who captures
or kills wild animals or beasts.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.890
As you read the story
you'll discover why

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.190
that is the perfect name, not only
for Will but for his whole family.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.620
So that's where the family was
born and kind of the characters

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.080
but I didn't quite have a spine.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.980
You know as authors we want to
have a spine to hang the story on.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.560
A direction, what is
this really about?

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.360
So I was traveling with my
boys, we were in Dublin Ireland.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.080
And I was working on a
PBS special and it was

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.880 position:56%
at a church called the Christ
Church Cathedral, it's in the middle

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.710
of Dublin, it's a beautiful
old church,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.740
it really looks like an old castle.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.270
I mean to some of you it would
look like a mini hog warts,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.140
it's kind of got spires
and it extends out

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.310
and it's got several buildings
attached, really neat place.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.160
Well, the night before we went to
shoot at this particular cathedral,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.280
we had a sight survey,
where you go and kind of set

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.390
out the cameras and
get things ready.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.120
And as I left the hotel, on the
cover of the Irish Newspaper,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:51.350 position:56%
it said, Relic of Laurence O'Toole
stolen from Christ Church Cathedral.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.250 position:56%
Well. The journalist in me, did that

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.850
and then I said well this
might make a great story

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.280
for the children series
I'm working on.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.700
So I went to investigate and when
I got there, there was a cage

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.120
and it was probably 30 feet off
the ground in the cathedral.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.930
And bolted on to the
wall was this cage

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.810
and inside was this 700 year old
heart of Saint Laurence O'Toole,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.960
now I had never heard
of Laurence O'Toole,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.780
I thought he maybe was
related to Peter O'Toole,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.830
but I had no idea who he was.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.250
So I asked this little caretaker,
a sacristan what had happened.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.620
And he said oh they broke in in
the night, they had a ladder.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.970
They climb the ladder and they
use wire cutters, cut the cable,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.150
cut the blasted thing off
the wall and ran off with it.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.570
I said well, do you
know where it is?

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.220
Have you found out, any ideas?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.720
No we don't know where it is.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.020
Well to this day the heart

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.020
of Laurence O'Toole
has not been returned.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.730
So somewhere, maybe in Dublin,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.410
is this 700 year old
heart of Laurence O'Toole.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.880
But it got me thinking.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.330
What if that 12 year old kid that
I'd been telling my children about,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.990
who became Will Wilder,
what if he had a good reason

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.860
to borrow or snatch a relic?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.350 position:56%
And what if it had the supernatural
powers that so many believed it had?

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.120
Well that was kind of the
beginning of the story.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.710
And from there I stretched it out,
I enlarged some of the characters.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.540
I have always been
fascinated, not only by

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.360
and I love childrens literature,
I mean I am one of those adults

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.330
that goes back to kids lit.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:38.500
I find it not only nostalgic but I
think it's life giving, the wisdom

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.700
and the humanity of who we
are I think of contained

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.350
in the stories we pass on.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.190
Particularly those
we give to children.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.250 position:56%
And so CS Lewis had that great line,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.240
if a 50 year old can't read a
childrens book it's not a very good

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.870
childrens book and I agree.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.380
So I tried to write a story here
that would appeal to all ages

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.810
and that children could
rediscover later in life,

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.510
as an adult which I think
the best childrens books do.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:13.000
So this is a multigenerational tale
as well as a multicultural one.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.480
You have Will Wilder, I'll
tell you the basic plot.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.910
Will is a 12 year old who has,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.040
since he was very small,
since he was about five.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.650
He's been seeing shadows out
of the corner of his eye.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.510
And on his 12th birthday these
shadows begin to take shape.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.390
And he can't quite figure
out what it is he's seeing.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.840
His brother breaks his arm

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.100
in a backyard accident
and Will is to blame.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.090
And so while he's punished for two
weeks digging, literally digging

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.250
and planting trees, he discovers

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.140
that his great grandfather
had created this museum

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.690
at the center of Perilous Falls.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.690
And in it the great grandfather
collected antiquities and relics,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.930
many of which really exists,
in fact all of those mentioned

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.880
in the book you can actually find.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.760
In institutions, in
library's, in churches,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.820
in museums all over the world.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.440
So I liked that idea, using
real things that existed.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.770
So Will decides he's going
to break into the museum

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.700
with some of his friends.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.300
Liberate the relic, borrow it,
touch it to the arm of his brother,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.210
heal his brothers arm,
return the relic

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.630 position:56%
and he'll get out of his punishment.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.050
Makes sense, yes?

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.270
Things don't quite work
out that way for Will.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.730
He unleashes an ancient
evil, the flood waters

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.230 position:56%
around Perilous Falls begin to rise,
monsters, unspeakable monsters start

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.360
to emerge all over town
and Will is really to blame

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.000
and the clock is ticking.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.550
And it really takes Will and
his great aunt Lucille and many

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.020
of her friends to try to chase
down this relic and who has it.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.630
Now Will unwittingly and I won't
ruin to much of the book for you,

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.120 position:56%
but Will unwittingly hands the relic

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.360
over to someone he should
never hand it over to.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.000
And what I love about the series
and in so many of the letters,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.050
the thing that's been
most gratifying.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:07.800
Is, mothers and kids, grandmothers
and grandfathers and kids,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.020
uncles and kids have been
experiencing the book together

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.560
and it speaks to them
on two different levels.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.930
But it really is a family
saga, it is not about an orphan

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.190
or a kid alone or you know he
goes off and leaves everybody

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.980
and you know decides he's
going to remake the world.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.440 position:56%
The whole wacky dysfunctional family
goes on the adventure with him,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.230
which I like because I come from
a wacky dysfunctional family.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.730
So it all makes sense.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.470
There's also a lot of
wisdom and fun in between.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:41.820
I often say he's sort of Indiana
Jones meets Dennis the Menace

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.600
in the Exorcist but, I'll
let you figure that out.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.700
I was talking to my
daughter earlier, we were,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.490
somebody had mentioned to
her about Indiana Jones.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.950
They read the book and
they thought wow this is

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.640
like a young Indiana Jones.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.430
And I told Mariella I ran
into the real Indiana Jones

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:06.100
at the Four Seasons Hotel
in Georgetown not long ago.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.190
It was not a great moment I have
to say, you know you'd expect,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.300
it was Harrison Ford,
it wasn't Indiana Jones,

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.350
but to me that's Indian Jones.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.870
And he came wondering in and I'm
standing there I'm in this suit,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.820
so I guess he thought
I worked there.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.810 position:56%
So he comes up to me and you know
I'm, I've got a big smile on my face

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.740
and he walks up and I say oh my
god my kids would do anything

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.940
to trade places with me right now.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.750
And he said thanks, do you
know where the bathroom is?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.120 position:56%
I said well I think it's back there,
is the restaurant back there to?

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.380
I said you're Indiana Jones you're
suppose to know these things,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.170
yeah it's that way, right there.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.470
Can you show me?

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.260
I said I don't work here, but
yeah I'll show you come on.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.590
So I got take Indiana Jones to the
bathroom, that's my claim to fame.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.730
Oh, he found the lost arc
of the covenant you know,

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.470
now he found the bathroom,
so some things come harder.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.470
What? Get him on the
show, yeah well I,

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.040
there's some things
we shouldn't show.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.910
You know Indy should
have some privacy.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.410
But I loved writing this, I
loved going on this journey,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:09.220
I've spoken to 10,000 kids plus
around the country about this book.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:15.110
And to watch them come alive in
this world, has been amazing.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.780
So many of them, it's like their
own little private da Vinci codes,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.930
I've been getting pictures that the
kids have sent me while on vacation

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.920 position:56%
because as I said, the reliquaries,
the relics, some of the antiquities,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.030
the sarcophagi mentioned
in the book,

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.980
you can find at the
Walter's museum at the MET,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.850
at the Miami Museum of Art.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.120
All over the country and the world
at the Louvre, at the Vatican I

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.610
like that idea that it's grounded
in something permanent and real

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.520
because at it's heart, what
this story is really about,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.290
is how and one of the characters
says this to Will at one point.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:53.620
Unless you know your past, you'll
never really discover your future.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.630
And I think that's true.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.390
The decisions of our forefathers

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.740
and foremothers really
do light our path,

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.690
we're part of a much
longer saga and story.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.210
And so I love that it's a bigger
story than even I intended.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.880
I just finished the second book,
I'm working on the third book.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.030
The second book is called Will
Wilder, The Lost Staff of Wonders

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.330
and there's a particular
artifact that is in the museum

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.790
that goes missing and
Will is blamed.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.070
He didn't do it this time.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.700
But the problem is he doesn't
know who took it either.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.060
And, well I won't ruin it for
you, but it's a lot of fun,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.510
it really has a great engine to it
and moves along at a great clip.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.220
If you all have any questions
I'd love to take your questions,

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.980
they have mics on the aisles there.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:47.470
Feel free to jump up and it,
you know I love being able,

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.450
not only to share Will's
story but it really ends

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.420
up being all of our stories.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.310
Because I personally
believe and I've seen it,

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.740
we are detached from
our own history.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.690
Not only our own family histories
but our history as a people.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.480
And it's neat to weave
in these touchstones,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.780
you know you have the African
American Museum opening

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.050
as we stand here today.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.010
Those touchstones of the
past instantly take us back

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.460
to that moment.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.670
And there's something
important about us as a people.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.020
Holding on to those
things and cherishing them

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.010
and realizing what they represent.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.170
Not only the struggle but
the promise contained there.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.770
And of course with these relics
I get to, I get the added bonus

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.270 position:56%
of having supernatural possibilities
that I can play with because some

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.760
of these relics are reported
to have certain properties.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.680
In the case of Saint Tom
the, bones of Saint Thomas,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.370
which I use in the first
book, there were two things

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.190
that it supposedly could do.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.570
The bones of Saint Thomas, heal

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.200
and the Indian Church believed
it held the flood waters back

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.970
from the cathedral where
his relics are interred.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.150
So I use both of those things in
my story and it kind of informs

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.140
around the edges what happens
to Will and leads you back

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.980
to the thing itself and the much
bigger story that I think is

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.230
as fascinating as anything
I've written.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.080
So questions?

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.550
I know I, I ask for questions and
then I started chattering away.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.910
Come on there's a microphone here.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.880
Don't be shy.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.680
I only bite after two
o'clock, oh look at the time.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.610
No, no the microphones
there, look right there.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.360
He's walking right up, he wants
to make a this a double act.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.660
&gt;&gt; Make a movie.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.360
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Make a movie.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.570
A movie of what?

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.170
&gt;&gt; Will Wilder.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.470
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Okay you want

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.880
to make a Will Wilder
movie, I will tell you.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.320
I'm talking to some people now.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.560
We've just got get the right deal.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.580
You don't want me to just sign
rights away that's never good.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.330
I want to be involved, but we'll,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.600
I promise you we're working
at making Will a movie.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.550
But I want you to read
all the books first.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.850
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.150
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Okay.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.450
Is that it?

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.050
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: That's all.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.350
Nothing else?

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.650
Okay. Thank you for coming.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:11.950
Yes sir?

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.400
&gt;&gt; Why don't you make a
Will Wilder comic book?

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.670
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: A Will Wilder
comic book, you know a friend

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.180
of mine who works at one

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.780
of the comic book companies
has approached me.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.930
Let me get a few more books into
the series and then we'll do that.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.360
Because then you'll cheat
and read the graphic novel.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.140
Which in my day it was
called a comic back

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.730
and you won't read the book,
I want you to read the book.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.400
&gt;&gt; I love comic books.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.700
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: You do?

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.000
Why do you like comic books?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.620
&gt;&gt; Because they're superheros.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.310
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Well there are
things you can do in comic books

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.510
that you can't do with
the written word.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.310
But then your imagination is,
I make you work a little harder

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.030
in the book, but it's a fun ride.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.630
Okay? Yes sir or whoa
this lady here, sorry.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.930
Yes ma'am?

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.230
&gt;&gt; Hi do you believe some

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.790
of the supernatural powers
that you write about?

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.680
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Do I
believe in some of them?

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.780
I've seen some of, I've
seen some pretty bizarre

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.740
and spectacular things around
some of this, there's phenomena

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.300
that is associated with
some of these things.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.370
So there's a part of
me that looks at it

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.510
and says there's something
happening there.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.810
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.320
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: You know
I've consulted with a lot

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.480
of not only librarians and
teachers writing this project.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.350
Because I wanted to find out what
kids were really interested in,

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.510
what they were looking for

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.730
and I think there's a big
opening here that I saw.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.210
That I think particularly
boys and girls they want to go

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.440
on an adventure, but they want
something that is grounded

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.350
in the world, something a little
scary but not gory and horrible.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.070 position:56%
And something that can give you some
broader life lessons that you can,

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.570
you know after going on
the journey you're left

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.210
with a resonance of something real.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:51.350
I also consulted with people
scientists who experimented

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.810
and examined a lot of the
supernatural phenomena

00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:00.010
around certain places or items and
their research helped me a lot.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.230
And I've woven some
of that in between.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.530
So yeah.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.130
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Thank you.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.430
Yes sir?

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.440
&gt;&gt; What power would you choose
to have if you could have any

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.950
of the brotherhood powers?

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.020
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Oh
what power would I have?

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:20.080 position:56%
I'd probably want to have, I think
I'd want to have Will Wilder's gift.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.460
Will sees things nobody else can.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.110
He sees through that invisible veil
that I think is all around us here.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:35.130
He can see good, he can see evil,
very clearly in concrete form.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.650
I'd like to have that.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.770
I think I've met a lot of people
that Will is probably already seen.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.020
He's just seen them in a
clearer form than I have.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.160
So yeah I'd like that
ability I think.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.410
To see deeper, I think we all
need to see a little deeper.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.710
Yes ma'am?

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.830
&gt;&gt; Can we see any of the principles
of your faith in your books?

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: You know I write
the books to entertain, I really do.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:06.350
My first obligation is to entertain
and to take kids on an adventure.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:11.930
So you know my beliefs they,
certainly these items I'm dealing

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.930
with they're rooted in belief

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.690
as Steven Spielberg rooted the
Indiana Jones series in belief.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.900
As Rick Riordan, you know that's
Greek mythology and belief.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.550
So this is a different sandbox.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.950
But I think we approach
it the same way.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.420
It's really to go on a great
adventure and to learn something

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.690
in the doing about us as people.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:41.010
But it's not, I wouldn't call
it a faithful book or book

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.100
in any way trying to advance faith.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.730
I told the lady the
other day, who came to me

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.220
and said you know I won't let
my kids read Harry Potter,

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.520
I said why not?

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.840
She said well I'm afraid
they're going to be witches,

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.660
I said please your
children are no more going

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.170
to be witches reading J K Rowling

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.280 position:56%
than they'll become you know
Catholic reading my book, it's just.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But probably what I wanted to ask
you is, is it any goal that you have

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.750
in terms of lessons for kids
or something you want to?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.050
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Yeah.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:15.900
I think all good literature from
Tolkien to J K Rowling to Kipling,

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.370
it all has a certain
intact morality about it.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.700
Because it's true to
the nature of the world

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.060
and that sometimes disappoints,
that sometimes agitates

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.300
but there's these eternal truths

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.160
that I think childrens
literature has always been a great

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.460
reservoir of.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.960
I certainly want to
continue that tradition,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.070
but it's not anything sectarian.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:42.680
I mean anybody can and I've been
delighted the letters I've gotten

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.780
from so many people.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.230
You know all over the globe but
particularly in the United States

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.510
from different backgrounds
and they all,

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.700
it hits them at different
places and in different ways.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.350
Which is what was intended,
it's a universal tale.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.690
Yes sir?

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.990
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.290
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Hi.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.590
&gt;&gt; Interesting presentation
thank you very much.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.890
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Thank you.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.460
&gt;&gt; I'm curious, how do you think
childrens literature and the act

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.760 position:56%
of writing and the act of publishing
distribution and the work product,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.570
how do you think it's changed
over the last 50 years or so?

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:18.870
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Oh well,

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.030
I mean look the market
has certainly become,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.540
the business is more
lively than ever before.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.520
The children sections is
probably the most traffic section

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.820
of any bookstore.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.490
I personally think it's because the
literature there is the richest.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.330
It's, you know it's both
wondrous and it takes us

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.550
out of our everyday life, it also
roots us in the reality of what

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.320
that life is about I think.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.830
That's what good childrens
literature should do.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.890
We're shaping in many
ways young people

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.790
for the experiences
they're about to encounter.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.770
And you're hopefully are doing
it in an imaginative, fun,

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.570
engaging way that makes them
want to go down those paths.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.710
But I find so many adults,
adult friends of mine,

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.380
I mean I've always been a kids lit
fanatic, but a lot of my friends,

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.440
people here in DC, it is their
retreat, it is the valve they use

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.300
to sort of get away from the
work a day and if they're going

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.310
to spend time in a fictional
universe, they'd rather do it

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.900
in kids lit because it's
broader, it's a little wider.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.630
You can do more there.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.500 position:56%
It's fantastical but it's very true.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.600
It's simple but it's deep and wise.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.030
So I think that's what
has driven many adults to,

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.090
I mean half of the readers of YA

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.970
and even some kids lit,
they're 18 and older.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.040
So that tells you something
about us as a people,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.520
it also tells you something
about the state

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.570
of literature broadly speaking.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.950
That people are going
to kids lit now.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.340
&gt;&gt; And then one quick followup?

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.900
How can I make this
little young lady read,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.770
but not think it's a chore to read?

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.620
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Read to her.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.260
Read to her often and I'm going
to tell you a little trick

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.210
that a teacher of mine pulled.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.040
I was not a great reader.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.240
And in 5th grade, I had a teacher

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.710
and he would read us
Ellery Queen mysteries.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.630
Nobody even knows who
Ellery Queen is anymore,

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.910
it's like something
in a distant past.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.210
You read Ellery Queen?

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:19.020
Wow. Ellery, the little girl
behind you reads them to.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.100
Ellery Queen was, it was
actually mystery writing team,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.360
but they wrote these very
addictive kind of mysteries.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.230
Well he would read us Ellery
Queen mysteries and he'd get right

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.170
up until the murder, okay.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:34.590
And I can always remember the
story, it was in front of a hotel

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.280
and these dignitaries I
shouldn't even say this,

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.920
these dignitaries were coming out
and they were just dropping dead

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.290
and nobody could figure out why.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.260
And as it turns out Ellery Queen
is there, he goes over this head

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.320
of state is just falling and
he finds a curare laced dart

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.960
in the neck of this head of state.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.600
And this teacher closed the book,
put it on the end of his desk

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.960
and said, if you all would
like to know the rest

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.690
of the story you may come
up and check the book out.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.530
Well we were like, ah
everybody killing each other

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:06.830
to get to the book.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.560
You want to know what happens.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.260 position:56%
So I went out of my with this series
and the second book even more so.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.210
To create a lot of cliffhangers
within the cliffhangers,

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.210
which takes a lot of trouble.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.550
But because I want the kids to keep
reading and there's no obligation

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.570
for anyone to read your book.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.650
You've got to make
them want to read.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:31.290
So, start reading a
really good story,

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.810
not only mine there are
other great stories.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.530
Up until the climax, up until
that cliffhanger and then stop

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.950
and she'll read the rest.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.610
Everybody wants to
know what happens.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.910
Everybody.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:46.520 position:56%
I was at a school district in New
Orleans, a very poor school district

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.180
and a friend of mine donated
150 books to all the kids there.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.280 position:56%
These were not kids that read
regularly, they didn't like to read,

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.240
the principle told me
I don't know what kind

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.790
of reception you're going to get.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.870
But they gave the books out to
the kids a week before I came.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:05.770
Well when I get there, the kids
books looked like they'd been

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.380
to a war, they were bent back
and there was scrawling on them,

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.310
they were dog eared,
they were loved books.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.850
These kids had really
read these books.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.960
And the principle came over and
said, this is the first book

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.290
that some of these children have
ever read from cover to cover.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.880
Well that made my week.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.750
Because you want them to get
into the habit of reading

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.490
and the first question
I got from all of them,

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.300
when is the next book coming?

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.800
You know many of them
had read it twice.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.400
So that is I really do believe

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.900
if you give a child a great story
they'll want to know how it ends.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.440
But you've got to give them
the opportunity and lot's

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.910
of opportunities because
the things you

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.000
like might not be where
their tastes are.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.960
Let them go select their own books.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.630
90% of kids who select their
own books, will read it.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:56.010
90%. Then Barnes and Noble
didn't even pay me to say that.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.310
Yes ma'am?

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.400
&gt;&gt; Do you know how many books
you're going to have in the series?

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.030
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: How
many books in the series?

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.810
I have outlined seven books.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:09.290
I've written 2 1/2.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.860
We'll try to get to seven, it's
a big story and there are a lot

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.510
of what I love about it it's
almost like peeling back an onion

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.380
and you find out something
about this character

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.920
and then it reveals something else.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.030
But why the museum is where it is?

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.680
Why Will's great grandfather
built it?

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.620
Why his aunt Lucille has
been so kind of shunned

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.110
from the rest of the family?

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.530
All those things come
out as the series goes on

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.280
and what happened to
his grandfather?

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.580
His grandmother?

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.920
We don't anything about them.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.530
You learn more about
that as series goes on.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.750
And I love that it's
also drawn all of us kids

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.640
to ask their parents what
about my grandfather?

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.460
I had a beautiful lady send
me a note the other day.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.850
She and her daughter were
reading the book and she ended

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.410
up telling her daughter the story

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.830
of her great grandfather
who was a rabbi.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.600
And how he got out of the
country and saved the family.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.130
She didn't know any of this.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.280
It's important for us
to tell those stories,

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.120
our own stories to one another.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.360 position:56%
And that was a big part of this too.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.020
So six more coming.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.940
Preorder now.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.240
Thank you.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.540
Yes ma'am?

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.820
&gt;&gt; When did you know that
you wanted to be a writer?

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.340
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: When did I
know I wanted to be a writer?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.570
You know I think it was
when I was in 5th grade

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.480
and fell in love with stories.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.480
I fell in love with mysteries first
and then I got into treasure island

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.120
and I read all of the Agatha
Christie novels, I read Rex Stout,

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.040
Conan Doyle, all the
Sherlock Holmes stories.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.630 position:56%
So I would get lost in those worlds,

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.560
that's when I knew
I wanted to write.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.410
And then I you know, then I
kind of bounced around, I wrote,

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.710
I was a writer I wrote as
a journalist and then I got

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.010
into television and now I kind
of see it coming full circle,

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.780
cause these are very visual tales.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.430
So, so start writing
and keep writing.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.960
Okay. Thank you all
so much, very quickly

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.510
and then I'll answer it over here.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.160
&gt;&gt; My daughter says no
spoilers but we're wondering

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.370
if you have any tidbits to give
to your fans to look forward to?

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.670
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: The next book?

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:08.970
&gt;&gt; Maybe or.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.270
&gt;&gt; Raymond Arroyo: Okay Will
Wilder in the Lost Step of Wonders

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.570
and I know [inaudible] is going

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.190
to throw something at
me if I don't finish.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.250 position:56%
The Lost Staff is the staff of Moses

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:21.880
which as you know controlled the
plagues in the Old Testament.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.480
That gets stolen.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.970
