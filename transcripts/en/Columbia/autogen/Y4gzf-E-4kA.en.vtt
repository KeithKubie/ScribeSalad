but really what's following that is a
 

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:40.830
but really what's following that is a
foyer effort to secure evolved a nuclear

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840
foyer effort to secure evolved a nuclear
 

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.539
foyer effort to secure evolved a nuclear
material which is really being led by

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:42.549
material which is really being led by
 

00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:44.460
material which is really being led by
Department of Energy and I talked about

and what the what the nucleus of
 

00:34:04.989 --> 00:34:07.619
and what the what the nucleus of
chemically summit really did was bring

00:34:07.619 --> 00:34:07.629
chemically summit really did was bring
 

00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:09.419

high-level attention and focus on this
 

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.730
high-level attention and focus on this
effort and to get buy-in from the number

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:11.740
effort and to get buy-in from the number
 

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.470
effort and to get buy-in from the number
of countries to actually dedicate

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480
of countries to actually dedicate

these are scientists who were working in

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:36.940
these are scientists who were working in
 

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.730
these are scientists who were working in
prior when Iraq was working on WMD so

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:41.740
prior when Iraq was working on WMD so
 

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.510
prior when Iraq was working on WMD so
they are scientists who have knowledge

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520
they are scientists who have knowledge
 

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.789
they are scientists who have knowledge
but it's also scientists who there's two

00:46:47.789 --> 00:46:47.799
but it's also scientists who there's two
 

00:46:47.799 --> 00:46:49.260
but it's also scientists who there's two
definitions there was a scientist

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:49.270
definitions there was a scientist
 

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.880
definitions there was a scientist

and scientists engagement are scientists

00:46:59.760 --> 00:46:59.770
and scientists engagement are scientists
 

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:01.230
and scientists engagement are scientists
who have not been working on it but have

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240
who have not been working on it but have
 

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.079
who have not been working on it but have
the skills that they can use those

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:04.089
the skills that they can use those
 

00:47:04.089 --> 00:47:08.700
the skills that they can use those
skills for WMD so it's it's you know

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:08.710
skills for WMD so it's it's you know
 

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.819
skills for WMD so it's it's you know
it's a it's both in and in Libya it's

00:47:11.819 --> 00:47:11.829
it's a it's both in and in Libya it's
 

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:13.410
it's a it's both in and in Libya it's
more of a redirection because there were

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:13.420
more of a redirection because there were
 

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.079
more of a redirection because there were
a scientist who worked on their program

00:47:15.079 --> 00:47:15.089
a scientist who worked on their program
 

00:47:15.089 --> 00:47:19.559
a scientist who worked on their program
and the second question and what did you

00:47:19.559 --> 00:47:19.569
and the second question and what did you
 

00:47:19.569 --> 00:47:21.060
and the second question and what did you
ask what we're doing in the US

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:21.070
ask what we're doing in the US
 

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.720

risky countries i suppose especially

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000
risky countries i suppose especially
 

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.630
risky countries i suppose especially
where border control is concerned but i

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640
where border control is concerned but i
 

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.350
where border control is concerned but i
suppose in in thinking of nuclear Risk

one reducing the number of nuclear
 

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.300
one reducing the number of nuclear
weapons and i would include the US who i

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:48.310
weapons and i would include the US who i
 

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.400

nuclear weapons so he's very committed

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640
nuclear weapons so he's very committed
 

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.280
nuclear weapons so he's very committed
to that a lot of the initiatives that he

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:32.290
to that a lot of the initiatives that he
 

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:35.190
to that a lot of the initiatives that he
has he has started since he's been here

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200
has he has started since he's been here

really to try to start the process or or

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:40.300
really to try to start the process or or
 

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.150
really to try to start the process or or
at least to start the process people can

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160
at least to start the process people can
 

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.130
at least to start the process people can
think it's possible you know I think

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:44.140
think it's possible you know I think
 

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.350
think it's possible you know I think
there's a there's a feeling that it can

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:46.360
there's a there's a feeling that it can
 

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.000
there's a there's a feeling that it can
never happen but you have to at least

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.010
never happen but you have to at least
 

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.920
never happen but you have to at least
start thinking it's possible you can

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:49.930
start thinking it's possible you can
 

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.810
start thinking it's possible you can
start down so you said that for instance

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:51.820
start down so you said that for instance
 

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.900
start down so you said that for instance

frankly I'm not sure what how we're

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:03.310
frankly I'm not sure what how we're
 

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.570
frankly I'm not sure what how we're
doing our nuclear submarines I'm pretty

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:06.580
doing our nuclear submarines I'm pretty
 

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.160
doing our nuclear submarines I'm pretty
sure we don't have nearly as many as we

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:08.170
sure we don't have nearly as many as we
 

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.580
sure we don't have nearly as many as we
used to have because they're not as

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:10.590
used to have because they're not as
 

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:14.100

practical um so without knowing the

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:14.110
practical um so without knowing the
 

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.320
practical um so without knowing the
details of how many we have I'm pretty

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:16.330
details of how many we have I'm pretty
 

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:17.880
details of how many we have I'm pretty
sure we don't have that many we probably

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:17.890
sure we don't have that many we probably
 

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:19.410
sure we don't have that many we probably
destroy some of our own a lot of time

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:19.420
destroy some of our own a lot of time
 

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.810

these interactions if anything it works
 

00:52:56.849 --> 00:52:58.550
these interactions if anything it works
against unilateralism and it promotes

00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:58.560
against unilateralism and it promotes

funding that still set aside for that so
as soon as that situation changes we can

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:48.220
as soon as that situation changes we can
 

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.850
as soon as that situation changes we can
send people right back we've also when

to think in terms of what would we do in
 

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:01.770
to think in terms of what would we do in
the next 10 years but we'll be spending

the next 10 years but we'll be spending

back and do some of these kind of

back and do some of these kind of
 

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:16.170
back and do some of these kind of
efforts in North Korea but unfortunately

00:58:41.849 --> 00:58:41.859
initiative and I actually had a question
 

00:58:41.859 --> 00:58:45.870
initiative and I actually had a question
about the impact of the of kind of these

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880
about the impact of the of kind of these
 

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.480
about the impact of the of kind of these
alternative nonproliferation regimes on

alternative nonproliferation regimes on
 

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:50.820
alternative nonproliferation regimes on
the NPT as the cornerstone of

the NPT as the cornerstone of

the NPT as the cornerstone of

international non-proliferation regime
 

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:56.550
international non-proliferation regime
in terms of these alternative measures

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:56.560
in terms of these alternative measures
 

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.270
in terms of these alternative measures
and mechanisms undermining obviously

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:00.280
and mechanisms undermining obviously
 

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.859
and mechanisms undermining obviously
that's that's going to be on to

00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:01.869
that's that's going to be on to
 

00:59:01.869 --> 00:59:03.990
that's that's going to be on to
unintended consequences of these

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000
unintended consequences of these
 

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.870
unintended consequences of these
alternative regimes and creating a

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880
alternative regimes and creating a
 

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.270
alternative regimes and creating a
situation where countries don't take the

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280
situation where countries don't take the
 

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.359
situation where countries don't take the
NPT seriously anymore and i think the

00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:12.369
NPT seriously anymore and i think the
 

00:59:12.369 --> 00:59:15.060
NPT seriously anymore and i think the
the nuclear deal with india gives even

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:15.070
the nuclear deal with india gives even
 

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:18.930
the nuclear deal with india gives even
more credence to to such concerns that

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:18.940
more credence to to such concerns that
 

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.900
more credence to to such concerns that
now we have a gray area of countries

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:21.910
now we have a gray area of countries
 

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:24.870
now we have a gray area of countries
that neither belong to the NPT nor do

00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880
that neither belong to the NPT nor do
 

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.420
that neither belong to the NPT nor do
not belong there and we've created kind

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:27.430
not belong there and we've created kind
 

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.640
not belong there and we've created kind
of a you know halfway house for those

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:29.650
of a you know halfway house for those
 

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:30.890
of a you know halfway house for those
types of countries

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:30.900
types of countries
 

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.079
types of countries
and I was wondering if you're thinking

00:59:33.079 --> 00:59:33.089
and I was wondering if you're thinking
 

00:59:33.089 --> 00:59:36.260
and I was wondering if you're thinking
you think these uh by not incorporating

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:36.270
you think these uh by not incorporating
 

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:38.779
you think these uh by not incorporating
these alternative measures in to the MPT

00:59:38.779 --> 00:59:38.789
these alternative measures in to the MPT
 

00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:41.329
these alternative measures in to the MPT
were action actually undermining that

00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339
were action actually undermining that
 

00:59:41.339 --> 00:59:47.809
were action actually undermining that
cornerstone regime I'm not sure how us

00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819
cornerstone regime I'm not sure how us
 

00:59:47.819 --> 00:59:51.980
cornerstone regime I'm not sure how us
how we would incorporate I mean the

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:51.990
how we would incorporate I mean the
 

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:55.190
how we would incorporate I mean the
impetus the MPT is is as you're saying

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200
impetus the MPT is is as you're saying
 

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.069
impetus the MPT is is as you're saying
it's it's a it's a it's been very

00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079
it's it's a it's a it's been very
 

00:59:58.079 --> 01:00:00.440
it's it's a it's a it's been very
successful in many ways but it is

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:00.450
successful in many ways but it is
 

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:07.430
successful in many ways but it is
fraught with a lot of problems and it's

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440
fraught with a lot of problems and it's
 

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.470
fraught with a lot of problems and it's
almost in a sense it's almost it's

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480
almost in a sense it's almost it's
 

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.700
almost in a sense it's almost it's
almost its own entity because of the

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:12.710
almost its own entity because of the
 

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.750
almost its own entity because of the
issues with disarmament and

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760
issues with disarmament and
 

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.359
issues with disarmament and
non-proliferation and I can say for

01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:17.369
non-proliferation and I can say for
 

01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:19.099
non-proliferation and I can say for
example when we were working on the

01:00:19.099 --> 01:00:19.109
example when we were working on the
 

01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:21.650
example when we were working on the
Nuclear Security Summit which was in

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660
Nuclear Security Summit which was in
 

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.140
Nuclear Security Summit which was in
April and the NPT review conference

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:24.150
April and the NPT review conference
 

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:27.319
April and the NPT review conference
which was in May I believe it was there

01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:27.329
which was in May I believe it was there
 

01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:29.180
which was in May I believe it was there
was always a need to keep the two

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:29.190
was always a need to keep the two
 

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:33.410
was always a need to keep the two
separate because we didn't want to we

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420
separate because we didn't want to we
 

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:38.349
separate because we didn't want to we
didn't want to have the unfortunate

01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359
 
 

01:00:38.359 --> 01:00:42.230
 
firestorms in the NPT Indian nuclear

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240
firestorms in the NPT Indian nuclear
 

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.289
firestorms in the NPT Indian nuclear
security summit because it was very

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299
security summit because it was very
 

01:00:45.299 --> 01:00:46.880
security summit because it was very
important if you were going to have the

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:46.890
important if you were going to have the
 

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:48.230
important if you were going to have the
countries that we had at the summit

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240
countries that we had at the summit
 

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.620
countries that we had at the summit
including India Pakistan Egypt mexico

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:51.630
including India Pakistan Egypt mexico
 

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:54.710
including India Pakistan Egypt mexico
brazil israel who were all part of the

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720
brazil israel who were all part of the
 

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.960
brazil israel who were all part of the
Nuclear Security Summit you had to keep

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:56.970
Nuclear Security Summit you had to keep
 

01:00:56.970 --> 01:01:00.190
Nuclear Security Summit you had to keep
it very very focused on nuclear security

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200
it very very focused on nuclear security
 

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.359
it very very focused on nuclear security
securing nuclear material something that

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:02.369
securing nuclear material something that
 

01:01:02.369 --> 01:01:04.700
securing nuclear material something that
no country could really argue against

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:04.710
no country could really argue against
 

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:07.400
no country could really argue against
but that highlights the fact that the

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:07.410
but that highlights the fact that the
 

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:11.359
but that highlights the fact that the
NPT is a is a I dont 16 closer that's

01:01:11.359 --> 01:01:11.369
NPT is a is a I dont 16 closer that's
 

01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:12.980
NPT is a is a I dont 16 closer that's
too big oh that's too big an emphasis

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:12.990
too big oh that's too big an emphasis
 

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:15.349
too big oh that's too big an emphasis
but it is its own entity and it has it

01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359
but it is its own entity and it has it
 

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:16.839
but it is its own entity and it has it
has its issues and it has its problems

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:16.849
has its issues and it has its problems
 

01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:21.680
has its issues and it has its problems
so I think that if anything some of

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:21.690
so I think that if anything some of
 

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:24.500
so I think that if anything some of
these cooperative programs in which for

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:24.510
these cooperative programs in which for
 

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:28.069
these cooperative programs in which for
example well maybe maybe it's maybe the

01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079
example well maybe maybe it's maybe the
 

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:30.170
example well maybe maybe it's maybe the
center of excellence and India may do

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:30.180
center of excellence and India may do
 

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.430
center of excellence and India may do
something i don't know but maybe if

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440
something i don't know but maybe if
 

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.370
something i don't know but maybe if
these these programs are an opportunity

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380
these these programs are an opportunity
 

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.589
these these programs are an opportunity
for countries to interact and anytime

01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599
for countries to interact and anytime
 

01:01:36.599 --> 01:01:38.420
for countries to interact and anytime
you have that kind of interaction and

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:38.430
you have that kind of interaction and
 

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:39.799
you have that kind of interaction and
working together there could be positive

01:01:39.799 --> 01:01:39.809
working together there could be positive
 

01:01:39.809 --> 01:01:42.410
working together there could be positive
effects in in many areas maybe in the

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420
effects in in many areas maybe in the
 

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.569
effects in in many areas maybe in the
NPT as well

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:43.579
NPT as well
 

01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:45.370
NPT as well
but you're right i mean the npt is a

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:45.380
but you're right i mean the npt is a
 

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.400
but you're right i mean the npt is a
situation of its own entity in a sense

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:48.410
situation of its own entity in a sense
 

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:52.059
situation of its own entity in a sense
and so it's you have to deal with them

01:01:52.059 --> 01:01:52.069
and so it's you have to deal with them
 

01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:54.430
and so it's you have to deal with them
in certain ways in order to make things

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440
in certain ways in order to make things
 

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.370
in certain ways in order to make things
work if I can follow up on them very

01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:57.380
work if I can follow up on them very
 

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.319
work if I can follow up on them very
quickly because I have this feeling that

01:01:59.319 --> 01:01:59.329
quickly because I have this feeling that
 

01:01:59.329 --> 01:02:02.380
quickly because I have this feeling that
the that the power of the npt comes from

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:02.390
the that the power of the npt comes from
 

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:04.299
the that the power of the npt comes from
the fact that not being a member to the

01:02:04.299 --> 01:02:04.309
the fact that not being a member to the
 

01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:06.999
the fact that not being a member to the
NPT is associated with some sort of

01:02:06.999 --> 01:02:07.009
NPT is associated with some sort of
 

01:02:07.009 --> 01:02:10.420
NPT is associated with some sort of
normative stigma and I think by creating

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:10.430
normative stigma and I think by creating
 

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:12.459
normative stigma and I think by creating
these alternative mechanisms we kind of

01:02:12.459 --> 01:02:12.469
these alternative mechanisms we kind of
 

01:02:12.469 --> 01:02:14.620
these alternative mechanisms we kind of
undermine that normative you know power

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:14.630
undermine that normative you know power
 

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.469
undermine that normative you know power
of the NPT so you might be not a member

01:02:17.469 --> 01:02:17.479
of the NPT so you might be not a member
 

01:02:17.479 --> 01:02:19.569
of the NPT so you might be not a member
to the MBT but make up for that not

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:19.579
to the MBT but make up for that not
 

01:02:19.579 --> 01:02:22.749
to the MBT but make up for that not
maker membership through you know being

01:02:22.749 --> 01:02:22.759
maker membership through you know being
 

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:24.900
maker membership through you know being
part of these other alternative

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:24.910
part of these other alternative
 

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:29.199
part of these other alternative
non-proliferation regimes um I'm not so

01:02:29.199 --> 01:02:29.209
non-proliferation regimes um I'm not so
 

01:02:29.209 --> 01:02:31.749
non-proliferation regimes um I'm not so
sure that that's the way it's seen i

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:31.759
sure that that's the way it's seen i
 

01:02:31.759 --> 01:02:33.339
sure that that's the way it's seen i
don't i'm not so sure that the embassy

01:02:33.339 --> 01:02:33.349
don't i'm not so sure that the embassy
 

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:36.400
don't i'm not so sure that the embassy
parties would say that well because you

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:36.410
parties would say that well because you
 

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:39.849
parties would say that well because you
know pakistan or india is a part of one

01:02:39.849 --> 01:02:39.859
know pakistan or india is a part of one
 

01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:43.690
know pakistan or india is a part of one
of these regimes that that somehow it's

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:43.700
of these regimes that that somehow it's
 

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:47.130
of these regimes that that somehow it's
okay or if a country that's part of the

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:47.140
okay or if a country that's part of the
 

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.539
okay or if a country that's part of the
NPT that's a problem country is part of

01:02:49.539 --> 01:02:49.549
NPT that's a problem country is part of
 

01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:51.660
NPT that's a problem country is part of
another regime that that's somehow

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:51.670
another regime that that's somehow
 

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:55.509
another regime that that's somehow
reduces their there the fact that

01:02:55.509 --> 01:02:55.519
reduces their there the fact that
 

01:02:55.519 --> 01:02:57.099
reduces their there the fact that
they're probably MPT I'm not sure that

01:02:57.099 --> 01:02:57.109
they're probably MPT I'm not sure that
 

01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:59.799
they're probably MPT I'm not sure that
people see that that way I mean it could

01:02:59.799 --> 01:02:59.809
people see that that way I mean it could
 

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.449
people see that that way I mean it could
be it could be the case but I don't

01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:01.459
be it could be the case but I don't
 

01:03:01.459 --> 01:03:03.729
be it could be the case but I don't
think that in the NPT review conference

01:03:03.729 --> 01:03:03.739
think that in the NPT review conference
 

01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:06.370
think that in the NPT review conference
that they had in May than anybody would

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:06.380
that they had in May than anybody would
 

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.289
that they had in May than anybody would
say to a problem country you're part of

01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:08.299
say to a problem country you're part of
 

01:03:08.299 --> 01:03:10.870
say to a problem country you're part of
these other regimes so it's okay we're

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880
these other regimes so it's okay we're
 

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.979
these other regimes so it's okay we're
not going to give you as much as a hard

01:03:11.979 --> 01:03:11.989
not going to give you as much as a hard
 

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:13.959
not going to give you as much as a hard
time I don't think that's the case i

01:03:13.959 --> 01:03:13.969
time I don't think that's the case i
 

01:03:13.969 --> 01:03:16.209
time I don't think that's the case i
think the NPT is its own entity and it's

01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:16.219
think the NPT is its own entity and it's
 

01:03:16.219 --> 01:03:18.370
think the NPT is its own entity and it's
so it's talking about getting rid of

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:18.380
so it's talking about getting rid of
 

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.839
so it's talking about getting rid of
nuclear weapons talking about the

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:19.849
nuclear weapons talking about the
 

01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:21.640
nuclear weapons talking about the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:21.650
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and
 

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.439
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and
that's an issue that we've been dealing

01:03:23.439 --> 01:03:23.449
that's an issue that we've been dealing
 

01:03:23.449 --> 01:03:26.789
that's an issue that we've been dealing
with for you know since the 40s so I

01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799
with for you know since the 40s so I
 

01:03:26.799 --> 01:03:29.499
with for you know since the 40s so I
don't think that these in any way takes

01:03:29.499 --> 01:03:29.509
don't think that these in any way takes
 

01:03:29.509 --> 01:03:31.150
don't think that these in any way takes
away from the obligations that countries

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160
away from the obligations that countries
 

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.680
away from the obligations that countries
have any amputate I mean I could be

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:32.690
have any amputate I mean I could be
 

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:37.510
have any amputate I mean I could be
wrong but I don't think so

bureaucratic challenge do you think is

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:56.930
bureaucratic challenge do you think is
 

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:58.660
bureaucratic challenge do you think is
the biggest that you deal with

01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:58.670
the biggest that you deal with
 

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:01.000
the biggest that you deal with
day-to-day inside the US government and

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.010
day-to-day inside the US government and
 

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:04.060

ah what keeps me up at night I chef see

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:09.620
ah what keeps me up at night I chef see
 

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.930
ah what keeps me up at night I chef see
pretty well I think if these would

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:13.940
pretty well I think if these would
 

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.430
pretty well I think if these would
bother me that much I probably be doing

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440
bother me that much I probably be doing
 

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.990
bother me that much I probably be doing
it but I guess I guess um maybe bio

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000
it but I guess I guess um maybe bio
 

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.890

biggest questions everyone always asks
 

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.530
biggest questions everyone always asks
is how come there hasn't been a

is how come there hasn't been a
biological attack and you anywhere I

years you know with nuclear weapons you

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160
years you know with nuclear weapons you
 

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.770
years you know with nuclear weapons you
have to have the material and have to

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:38.780
have to have the material and have to
 

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.630
have to have the material and have to
have the facilities you have to have a

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640
have the facilities you have to have a
 

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.340
have the facilities you have to have a
number of things to actually make a

number of things to actually make a
 

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.580

easier of course because radiological

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:47.870
easier of course because radiological
 

01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:50.860
easier of course because radiological

a large number of people but it does
 

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.020
a large number of people but it does
make me wonder why it hasn't happened

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:26.030
make me wonder why it hasn't happened
 

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.850
make me wonder why it hasn't happened
and you don't want to ask the question

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:27.860
and you don't want to ask the question
 

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.530
and you don't want to ask the question
we don't ask other people to question

we don't ask other people to question

we don't ask other people to question
people do ask the question but it makes

people do ask the question but it makes
 

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:33.220
people do ask the question but it makes
me wonder why that hasn't happened and

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:33.230
me wonder why that hasn't happened and
 

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.620
me wonder why that hasn't happened and
that scares me because it can it's a

that scares me because it can it's a
 

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:37.030
that scares me because it can it's a
type of thing that can spread before

climate change if there is a way if
 

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:18.020
climate change if there is a way if
there was a way to deal with the energy

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:18.030
there was a way to deal with the energy
 

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:20.220
there was a way to deal with the energy
problems we have today in the world

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:20.230
problems we have today in the world
 

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.980

without more nuclear without doing it

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:22.990
without more nuclear without doing it
 

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:24.060
without more nuclear without doing it
through nuclear energy that would be

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:24.070
through nuclear energy that would be
 

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:28.680
through nuclear energy that would be
great simply because nuclear energy by

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:28.690
great simply because nuclear energy by
 

01:13:28.690 --> 01:13:29.910
great simply because nuclear energy by
building nuclear energy and nuclear

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920
building nuclear energy and nuclear
 

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.590
building nuclear energy and nuclear
power using nuclear energy and polly

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600

nuclear power gives you the skills and a
 

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:37.560
nuclear power gives you the skills and a
facility to build nuclear weapons I mean

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:37.570
facility to build nuclear weapons I mean
 

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:39.120
facility to build nuclear weapons I mean
you need facilities you mean materials

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.130
you need facilities you mean materials
 

01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:40.620
you need facilities you mean materials
and stuff but still it gives you the

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:40.630
and stuff but still it gives you the
 

01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:43.020
and stuff but still it gives you the
basic knowledge to do it but it's a

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:43.030
basic knowledge to do it but it's a
 

01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:45.060

writer every country every country has a

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:45.070
writer every country every country has a
 

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:48.060
writer every country every country has a
right to do it so you can't tell

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.070
right to do it so you can't tell
 

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:50.160
right to do it so you can't tell
countries date they can't do that so the

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:50.170
countries date they can't do that so the
 

01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:52.080
countries date they can't do that so the
really the issue is how to country how

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:52.090
really the issue is how to country how
 

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:54.060
really the issue is how to country how
do you ensure that countries do that in

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:54.070
do you ensure that countries do that in
 

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:55.740
do you ensure that countries do that in
a way that's not in a non-proliferation

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:55.750
a way that's not in a non-proliferation
 

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.140

talking about the do ii does is just

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:00.310
talking about the do ii does is just
 

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:03.300
talking about the do ii does is just
that it works with countries that want

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:03.310
that it works with countries that want
 

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:07.020
that it works with countries that want
to develop nuclear power and help them

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:07.030
to develop nuclear power and help them
 

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.030
to develop nuclear power and help them

Korean ship so here's my question here

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:38.550
Korean ship so here's my question here
 

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:42.740
Korean ship so here's my question here
you have an example of a participant

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:42.750
you have an example of a participant
 

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:49.310
you have an example of a participant
which changes its position with a change

01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320
which changes its position with a change
 

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.500
which changes its position with a change
in regime with a change of

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:51.510

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280
administration and it can work the other
 

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.290
administration and it can work the other
way so you have players joining or

01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:56.300
way so you have players joining or
 

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.580
way so you have players joining or
abstaining depending on their national

01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:58.590
abstaining depending on their national
 

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:01.810
abstaining depending on their national
interests so how do you deal with that

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:01.820
interests so how do you deal with that
 

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:06.320

well first of all yes the ROK is a has

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:06.330
well first of all yes the ROK is a has

is joining the perforation Security

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:10.050
is joining the perforation Security
 

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:13.870
is joining the perforation Security
Initiative so that's true it you know

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880
Initiative so that's true it you know
 

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.860
Initiative so that's true it you know
that's something that you really can't

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:15.870
that's something that you really can't
 

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:19.520
that's something that you really can't
control and for the most part for the

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:19.530
control and for the most part for the
 

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:21.350
control and for the most part for the
most part overall that doesn't happen

01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360
most part overall that doesn't happen
 

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.940
most part overall that doesn't happen
for the most part when countries join

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:22.950
for the most part when countries join
 

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:25.760
for the most part when countries join
these regimes are pretty much stay in

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:25.770
these regimes are pretty much stay in
 

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:27.950
these regimes are pretty much stay in
them but because we talk about 90

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960
them but because we talk about 90
 

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.040
them but because we talk about 90
countries or so but you know if you ever

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:31.050
countries or so but you know if you ever
 

01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:33.080
countries or so but you know if you ever
change and they pull out all you can

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:33.090
change and they pull out all you can
 

01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:35.120
change and they pull out all you can
really do is engage with them to try to

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:35.130
really do is engage with them to try to
 

01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.670
really do is engage with them to try to
stay involved and if they pull out of

01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:37.680
stay involved and if they pull out of
 

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.050
stay involved and if they pull out of
this they may pull out of a lot of other

01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060
this they may pull out of a lot of other
 

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.600
this they may pull out of a lot of other
things and so youryour diplomacy with

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:41.610
things and so youryour diplomacy with
 

01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:43.130
things and so youryour diplomacy with
that country would really focus on

01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140
that country would really focus on
 

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.140
that country would really focus on
staying engaged in these on these

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:45.150
staying engaged in these on these
 

01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:47.120
staying engaged in these on these
efforts and that's how your diplomacy

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:47.130
efforts and that's how your diplomacy
 

01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:49.100
efforts and that's how your diplomacy
for that country would adjust to the

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:49.110
for that country would adjust to the
 

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:58.610
for that country would adjust to the
change in what they do

01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620
 
 

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.280
 
yeah you're right it does definitely

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:01.290
yeah you're right it does definitely
 

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:03.980
yeah you're right it does definitely
does I think this will be the last

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:03.990
does I think this will be the last
 

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:06.740
does I think this will be the last
question thank you very much for your a

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:06.750
question thank you very much for your a
 

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:12.860

very interesting lecture well yeah the
non-traditional security and become more

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:17.190
non-traditional security and become more
 

01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:20.330
non-traditional security and become more
and more important now is especially the

01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:20.340
and more important now is especially the
 

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:23.060
and more important now is especially the
energy a climate change thread thread

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:23.070
energy a climate change thread thread
 

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:25.280
energy a climate change thread thread
and not only via United States but also

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:25.290
and not only via United States but also
 

01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:29.030
and not only via United States but also
the whole world so I can't hear what

the whole world so I can't hear what
 

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.340
the whole world so I can't hear what
you're saying you say there are energy

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:31.350
you're saying you say there are energy
 

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:34.760
you're saying you say there are energy
screech and a climate change and threat

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:34.770
screech and a climate change and threat
 

01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:36.590
screech and a climate change and threat
not only the United States master all

01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600
not only the United States master all
 

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.860
not only the United States master all
the world's a lot as a crazy idea what

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:41.870
the world's a lot as a crazy idea what
 

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:46.610
the world's a lot as a crazy idea what
the united states adopt what policy at

01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620
the united states adopt what policy at
 

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.490
the united states adopt what policy at
occupy the united states in the air

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500
occupy the united states in the air
 

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.110
occupy the united states in the air
energy and climate change field and

01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120
energy and climate change field and
 

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.390
energy and climate change field and
what's the multilateral cooperation to

01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400
what's the multilateral cooperation to
 

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.780
what's the multilateral cooperation to
the energy security stretching nowadays

01:17:59.780 --> 01:17:59.790
the energy security stretching nowadays
 

01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:05.150
the energy security stretching nowadays
thank you thinking about what the

01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:05.160
thank you thinking about what the
 

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.870
thank you thinking about what the
multilateral cooperation to the air and

01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880
multilateral cooperation to the air and
 

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.920
multilateral cooperation to the air and
it's crazy of threatening threat I guess

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:15.930
it's crazy of threatening threat I guess
 

01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:18.860
it's crazy of threatening threat I guess
are you asking her to speak to a US

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:18.870
are you asking her to speak to a US
 

01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:22.100
are you asking her to speak to a US
policy on on climate change of energies

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:22.110
policy on on climate change of energies
 

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:25.010
policy on on climate change of energies
mount original trying to do this or NLC

01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020
mount original trying to do this or NLC
 

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.930
mount original trying to do this or NLC
latter away yeah yeah non-traditional

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:26.940
latter away yeah yeah non-traditional
 

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:31.940
latter away yeah yeah non-traditional
threats yeah and climate change um well

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:31.950
threats yeah and climate change um well
 

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:33.500
threats yeah and climate change um well
non-traditional threads are you talking

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:33.510
non-traditional threads are you talking
 

01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:35.600
non-traditional threads are you talking
about just natural threats in general or

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:35.610
about just natural threats in general or
 

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.120
about just natural threats in general or
just trying and just climate change I

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:37.130
just trying and just climate change I
 

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:40.370
just trying and just climate change I
mean in in terms of I mean I'm not I'm

01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:40.380
mean in in terms of I mean I'm not I'm
 

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.660
mean in in terms of I mean I'm not I'm
not going to speak to know the climate

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:41.670
not going to speak to know the climate
 

01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:43.540
not going to speak to know the climate
change issue because I so like out of my

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:43.550
change issue because I so like out of my
 

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:46.910
change issue because I so like out of my
head of my portfolio um but

01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920
head of my portfolio um but
 

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.370
head of my portfolio um but
non-traditional threats you know it

01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380
non-traditional threats you know it
 

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.680
non-traditional threats you know it
depends on how how you're defining them

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:51.690
depends on how how you're defining them
 

01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:53.240
depends on how how you're defining them
i mean if you're talking about the kind

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:53.250
i mean if you're talking about the kind
 

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:56.420
i mean if you're talking about the kind
that i work with then these are the ways

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:56.430
that i work with then these are the ways
 

01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.650
that i work with then these are the ways
of what you're trying to deal with them

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:57.660
of what you're trying to deal with them
 

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.870
of what you're trying to deal with them
we just have a number of mechanisms that

01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880
we just have a number of mechanisms that
 

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.540
we just have a number of mechanisms that
exists that try to i mean we haven't we

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:02.550
exists that try to i mean we haven't we
 

01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:03.920
exists that try to i mean we haven't we
almost have a mechanism for almost

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:03.930
almost have a mechanism for almost
 

01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:05.990
almost have a mechanism for almost
everything that's out there we have a

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000
everything that's out there we have a
 

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.400
everything that's out there we have a
mechanism to interdict we have a

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:07.410
mechanism to interdict we have a
 

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:11.180
mechanism to interdict we have a
mechanism to for nuclear forensics to a

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:11.190
mechanism to for nuclear forensics to a
 

01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:11.959
mechanism to for nuclear forensics to a
few

01:19:11.959 --> 01:19:11.969
few
 

01:19:11.969 --> 01:19:13.910
few
you detect if you blow something up

01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920
you detect if you blow something up
 

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.989
you detect if you blow something up
we're trying to figure out where it came

01:19:14.989 --> 01:19:14.999
we're trying to figure out where it came
 

01:19:14.999 --> 01:19:17.569
we're trying to figure out where it came
from you have mechanisms secure the

01:19:17.569 --> 01:19:17.579
from you have mechanisms secure the
 

01:19:17.579 --> 01:19:18.830
from you have mechanisms secure the
materials at the source you have a

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840
materials at the source you have a
 

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.890
materials at the source you have a
mechanism to secure about the borders

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:20.900
mechanism to secure about the borders
 

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:25.370
mechanism to secure about the borders
whether it whether there WWD in general

01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:25.380
whether it whether there WWD in general
 

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:28.640
whether it whether there WWD in general
so in terms of the issues I work on this

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:28.650
so in terms of the issues I work on this
 

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:30.350
so in terms of the issues I work on this
there's pretty much a mechanism for

01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360
there's pretty much a mechanism for
 

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.969
there's pretty much a mechanism for
almost every path that materials for

01:19:34.969 --> 01:19:34.979
almost every path that materials for
 

01:19:34.979 --> 01:19:37.250
almost every path that materials for
example nuclear materials can go from a

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260
example nuclear materials can go from a
 

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:39.469
example nuclear materials can go from a
facility into the hands of a terrorist

01:19:39.469 --> 01:19:39.479
facility into the hands of a terrorist
 

01:19:39.479 --> 01:19:41.569
facility into the hands of a terrorist
and then getting this getting the

01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:41.579
and then getting this getting the
 

01:19:41.579 --> 01:19:43.729
and then getting this getting the
materials out of the hands of terrorists

01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739
materials out of the hands of terrorists
 

01:19:43.739 --> 01:19:46.250
materials out of the hands of terrorists
so we kind of have everything covered in

01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:46.260
so we kind of have everything covered in
 

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.419
so we kind of have everything covered in
all the different areas just have to

01:19:47.419 --> 01:19:47.429
all the different areas just have to
 

01:19:47.429 --> 01:19:49.729
all the different areas just have to
belong to some of them but it's if

01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:49.739
belong to some of them but it's if
 

01:19:49.739 --> 01:19:51.169
belong to some of them but it's if
you're talking about in that respect we

01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179
you're talking about in that respect we
 

01:19:51.179 --> 01:19:52.850
you're talking about in that respect we
have programs that deal with

01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860
have programs that deal with
 

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.669
have programs that deal with
non-traditional threats in terms of

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679
non-traditional threats in terms of
 

01:19:54.679 --> 01:19:58.459
non-traditional threats in terms of
anything that's divinity related climate

01:19:58.459 --> 01:19:58.469
anything that's divinity related climate
 

01:19:58.469 --> 01:20:00.410
anything that's divinity related climate
change I'm not that's not my area so I

01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420
change I'm not that's not my area so I
 

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.870
change I'm not that's not my area so I
can't really answer that one all right

01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880
can't really answer that one all right
 

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.430
can't really answer that one all right
oh you've already out of foam I can read

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440
oh you've already out of foam I can read
 

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:07.879
oh you've already out of foam I can read
about it tell you all right thank you

01:20:07.879 --> 01:20:07.889
about it tell you all right thank you
 

01:20:07.889 --> 01:20:11.599
about it tell you all right thank you
again ambassador Jack thank thank you
