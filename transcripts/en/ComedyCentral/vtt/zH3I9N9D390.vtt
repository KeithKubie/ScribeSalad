00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:05.506
In New York City they have one
great rule about Central Park:

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:08.775
seven to nine in the morning,
off the leash for a dog,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.479
so my dog runs every morning.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.348
We're out there
around quarter seven,

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.884
we run for about half hour 45.
I don't run.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.653
It's fun to watch
you're dog run though.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:21.021
You look like
you're in great ...

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.222
You are.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.457
I'm all right.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.726
I walk on the golf course,
I don't use carts if I ...

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:26.960
That's good.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.328
Unless I'm in a mountain.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.131
But that it's fun watching
your dog run in the dewy grass

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.366
in the morning.
Just like let loose.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.734
And they all kind of roll over.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:34.935
Oh, my God.
It's so fun to watch.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:38.906
And I figured out how not to
have him attack other dogs.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.608
Since he's a golden retriever.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.811
I put a ball in his mouth
and he won't let go of the ball.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.213
So, he can't bite anybody.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.749
That's genius.
That's really smart.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.184
So, he runs throughout the park
with a ball in his mouth.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.786
But he's not going to let
go of that thing.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.154
Let go of the ball.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.355
Snap at another dog.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.458
He may bark, you know,
a muffled bark but that's it.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.598
So, why didn't
your shows last?

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.334
You know, so many different
reasons,

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.904
just like internal things.
And then also you get ...

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.172
Who did you work for?

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.373
Like you said about ...

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.743
Comedy Central who I now work
for on the radio and then MTV.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.714
So, they didn't play it enough.
I want to do a show,

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:24.017
if I ever do a talk show again,
it cannot be one time a week.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.452
Oh, it's only once a week.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.720
If they don't replay it,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.123
the audience doesn't
get to know you, and trust you.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.026
You can't gather an audience
once a week-

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.661
But you don't have the time to
and they don't time.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.463
... unless you're some
variety show.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.635
You see, it's very interesting,
for instance, in daytime,

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.006
they've tried
so many actors, comedians,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.111
people who were never, ever
broadcasters as talk show hosts:

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.647
it didn't work.

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.148
I'm very interested,
for instance,

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:59.386
next year Kelly Clarkson
is going to do a talk show,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.457
and so, it's going
to be interesting

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:04.925
as to whether that works.
Ellen works.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.259
Ellen worked.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.461
Ellen worked.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:08.729
Rosie O'Donnell worked.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.997
For a while.

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:11.465
For a while. I loved the-

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.735
But then she got dark,
you know what I mean?

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.804
Yes. Yeah.
I got a little weird at the end.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.541
But in the heyday,
that was a fun one.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.976
But these things come and go.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.278
I mean, you must see them come
and go all the time.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.481
Can you tell when
something's going to work?

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.484
For instance, I mean,
there are a lot of ...

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.587
I knew Jane Pauley
wouldn't work,

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.589
I knew Meredith Vieira
wouldn't work.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.325
Well first of all,
you have to understand

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.094
these were people
who made their mark

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:49.503
and made their reputations
in shows that were an ensemble:

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:54.207
the today show is an ensemble.
Hey, Matt Lauer, right?

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:57.110
Biggest name in the world,
not there, still Today Show

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.280
works, you know, bring on
the next person, plug them in.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.681
It's an ensemble.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.252
It can exist
without someone and it ...

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:06.553
Yes. Okay.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.990
You go alone, you've got to be
a different person

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.492
than you were
when you were that ensemble.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:16.563
And so, it just doesn't
work that way.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.565
Didn't work that way.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.535
They didn't develop that skill
as a solo host

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:24.771
or the audience isn't going to
want to see them in that role?

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:31.078
I guess. I mean, you never know
how far you can get that way

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.080
unless you do something solo.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.415
Yeah, you gotta try.

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.084
You gotta do something solo

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.854
before you know
you're going to work.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:42.489
I mean, and it took me
a long time ...

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.357
First of all, I mean, look,
I'm a news guy,

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.826
I never got along
with my co-anchors ever.

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:47.027
Really?

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.829
I mean, look, years
and years ago,

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.631
I was the second banana
to a woman named Connie Chung

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:54.534
at the biggest station in LA,
and guess what?

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.236
They fired me, it didn't work.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:58.605
You guys met at a station?
Oh yeah.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:03:59.873
Working together?

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.108
Oh Sure.

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:03.243
Oh my God. Was that so fun?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.345
In the early days
of like no one knew?

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:09.683
First of all,
I started before her,

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.853
I'm much older than she is,
not much significantly older,

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:16.723
and so, I was a pretty big name
in Washington, D.C.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.058
my hometown.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:21.161
She was hired as the assistant
to the news director,

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.462
the secretary, okay?

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.464
The first job that opens up
in a newsroom

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:27.167
is a weekend writing job.
She wants the job.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.703
The news director says,
"You can't have the job,

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.272
you're my assistant, you're my
secretary, you can't ... "

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.640
"Yes, I want the job."

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.976
"Well, you can't get the job
unless you replace yourself."

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.545
She walks out of the newsroom,
across the street, into a bank,

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.680
looks at the first woman teller
and says,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.516
"You want to be in TV?
Come with me."

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.452
Replaced herself
and became a big star.

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:48.355
And nobody really knew
who she was,

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:49.589
and then all of a sudden
we're going,

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.424
"Wow, that took a lot of guts.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.426
I mean, that's
really aggressive."

00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:56.229
And so, she becomes a star.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.000
She goes to LA,
she becomes a big anchor,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.271
and then I'm hired as her
second banana, her co-anchor.

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.641
That didn't work.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:12.045
And six months later the new
General Manager fired me,

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:15.849
and then she took such pity
on me, we started to date.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.717
Wait. You dated after?

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.756
-Yeah.
-Nothing happened before?

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:24.090
No, I mean, no I just knew her.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.292
Was there any flirtation?

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:26.526
Oh, maybe. I don't know.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:29.162
Yeah. I mean, there had to be
a little something, something.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:33.433
Well, Connie, she had become
a pretty big star at CBS

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.202
in the Washington bureau
during Watergate.

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:37.571
I mean, she was a big star
during Watergate.

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:41.808
And so, she went to LA
and became a huge hit,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.378
she was the only person I knew

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.047
in that whole
West Coast newsroom.

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:51.084
And so, when I got fired,
she took pity on me.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.786
Well, how did that feel?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.823
Getting fired was the worst
thing in my life,

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.825
and the best thing
in my life

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:03.730
because the greatest fear
of anyone in this business

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.267
is getting fired.
That's the worst fear because:

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.603
A, you don't know
what it's going to feel like,

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:11.605
and B, will you
ever work again?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:16.076
And so, when you end up
having the feeling

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:19.613
at least you know
what it's like, it's shit.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:21.514
It's shit. It's shit.

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:23.817
That's so true.
You got to go through it.

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:26.553
I believe that that's all part
of my personality

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:27.787
that I bring out.

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:30.957
Hey, I've had my lows.
You know, I've been fired,

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:33.727
I've laid down on a couch
and wondered to myself,

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.129
"Should I be in this business?
I mean, what the hell."

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.065
Yeah. Oh, that's great to hear
that you've had that thought.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:43.036
Oh, yeah. No, I mean,
and then what you do,

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.904
you end up watching TV.

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.406
You know, and I'm watching
all the newscast.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.643
I'm saying, "Shit.
I'm as good as that guy.

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:52.812
You know, I can do that story.
What the heck?"

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.848
And so, I got a job
in San Francisco

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.716
about three
or four months later,

00:06:56.716 --> 00:07:00.086
and then we started dating
and had a commuting relationship

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.788
between LA and San Francisco.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.225
We dated for eight years
before we got married.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:07.060
That's smart.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.364
But not exclusively.
She says, I dated people

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.500
I couldn't even remember
their first names.

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:17.237
And she dated nothing
but stars in Hollywood.

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:20.440
Oh, really? I love this.
That sounds fun.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.777
So, before you got married
and settle down,

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.712
you were together, and you would
see each other when you could,

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:27.013
but you were just like,

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:29.149
"Hey, we're in different cities,
things are gonna happen."

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.383
Exactly.
I love that.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.419
I love it.

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.989
In fact, she would say to me
sometimes,

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.490
"Well, maybe we
should get married."

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.626
And I'd say, no I want to."
And then I would say to her,

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:40.960
"Well, maybe we should
get married."

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.662
And she say,
"No, I don't want to."

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:45.565
And then finally,
she called me up and she said,

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.100
"We can get married now."
I said, "Why?"

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.968
She says,
"Because I found a dress."

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.504
So, she called it in the end.

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.006
Six weeks later we got married.

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:54.574
Oh, my Gosh.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.810
And that was 34 years ago.

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:00.914
And then where did you move
after that when you got married?

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:02.415
Well, then I was back
in Washington,

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:03.650
and she was in New York,

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.852
and we commuted
for the first two years.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.387
And then this wild Australia

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:09.389
named Rupert Murdoch
called up and said,

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.359
"We're doing start this show
called a Current Affair,

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.827
and we're going to move you
to New York.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.061
And you're going
to find out

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.629
whether you can live
with your wife."

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:20.834
Now, you have to understand,
I was a local anchorman.

00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:25.305
So, I would come
to New York every week

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:28.575
or two to see each other
on the weekends we were married,

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:30.076
and I would go
to the apartment building

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.245
and I would say,
"Connie Chung please."

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:35.348
Who is this?
I said, "I'm her husband."

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.885
And he would call up
and say, "Miss Chung.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.954
Mr. Chung is down stairs."

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:44.090
And that's when I knew,
that I had a long way to go.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:50.830
That's so fun. I love your wife.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:56.069
She's is indefatigable.
She's the best.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:57.771
I gotta look that word up later.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:01.241
Good I think.

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:04.310
It's got to be good.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.446
Nothing can penetrate her.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.114
Except you.

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:14.521
Yeah, that's true. That's true.
Once in a while. Thanks Chris.

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:17.257
No problem man. That's why
I'm here, just sniping.

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:19.959
Nikki does the ...
I just snip in somehow.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:22.762
Some hit, some don't hit.
It's what it is.

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.464
Nikki's approval.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.333
Oh boy.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:30.737
She just went after
what she wanted,

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.772
and told you
when it was, "No-"

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.507
She was back to going
across the street

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.810
and taking a girl
from the bank and saying,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.312
"Do you want to be in TV
because I want this job."

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.814
What happened to that girl
at the bank?

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:43.049
She said she ended up
being a talk show producer

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.384
for me at that station.

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:45.652
That's what happens.

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:49.956
No way. So she did.
She wanted to be on TV.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.427
See that? See that?

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.129
All you bank tellers out there.

00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:59.432
First of all, do they have
bank tellers anymore?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.733
I don't know.
I do everything on my app.

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.235
Yeah, that's true.

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:05.772
I mean, if it's not
ATM is there anybody

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.140
ever go
into the bank anymore?

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.374
I don't know. I don't either.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:10.076
I recently wrote a joke
where I was like,

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.277
"And I went to the bank."

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.947
And I'm like, "No one's
believing this right now.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.483
When is anyone in here
been to a bank?

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:17.784
And I go,
"I didn't go to the bank.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.853
Let me put it
somewhere else as CVS."

00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:21.387
Yes. CVS. Yeah.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.889
You do everything on the app,
right?

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:25.124
You meet with girls,
you put you're check in.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:27.193
Are you on Instagram,
are you on Twitter?

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:28.394
Yeah, all that stuff.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.396
How do you feel about it?
Do you like it?

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:32.298
Well, the show is on it,
first of all.

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:36.736
We've got like,
3 million Facebook people

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:39.305
and another million
YouTube people.

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:42.775
But I have a hard time.

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:47.881
I see a lot of people who I know
who are in the business,

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:51.484
they're on Twitter,
and I wake up in the morning,

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.153
I usually wake up
like six 6/6:30 to walk the dog,

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.855
and all of a sudden
all these people are on Twitter.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.090
I'm like,"

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.093
What the hell are you doing
this early in the morning?"

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:06.065
Just responding to stuff.
It's almost like being a shrink.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.734
I think
Twitter's become a shrink.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:09.068
What do you mean?

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.704
Oh, just people pouring out
their emotions that they should

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:14.674
maybe go on a walk
with their dog and work out?

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.209
"Well, let me tell you
what happened to me."

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:17.810
Really?
Do I really want to know?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.047
Yeah, I know.
It's sad sometimes.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.816
You see like
if one of your friends

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.085
is having like a manic moment
and you're like,

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.222
"You might want
to pull this back a little bit."

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:31.457
And then, of course,
you better not do anything wrong

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:34.294
because somebody's got a phone
and it's on video.

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:35.595
-Oh yeah.
-Oh yeah.

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:37.130
I mean, how is it like
for you out there?

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.431
Are people coming up to you-

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.999
Boring as shit.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:43.136
You're getting recognized
all the time and have been-

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:46.472
Well, first of all,
if it's a guy right?

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.711
"Can you say,
"Stan, you are not the father.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.713
Maury Povich
write it down here."

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.915
That kind of stuff.
And there are a lot of selfies.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:59.919
I don't mind it.
Over the years,

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:03.456
I've known personalities
who just don't do that:

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:05.992
don't sign autographs,
don't take pictures,

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:10.263
and I'm saying, "Hey man.
I mean, you spend a lot of time

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:14.200
trying to get people to look
at you, get into your life

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.603
and then you just
shove them away

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:18.304
and don't have anything
to do it."

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.076
Look I'm on television
five days a week,

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:27.046
an hour or two hours a day,
if they know you,

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.748
that's the best
of the alternative.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.617
What happens
if they don't know you?

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:32.051
That means that
you're screwing up

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:33.319
and you ain't making it work?

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:37.056
Yeah, yeah. The fact that
you're being recognized.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.358
Yeah.
You're doing a good job.

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:40.059
You just taking a few seconds
of your life

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:42.161
to sign a ...
they're a fan for life.

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.597
It doesn't matter what you do,
it's always gonna be like,

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.898
"I'm team Maury."

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.100
Oh, I love selfies.
They're quick

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.937
phone to someone else, so you
don't have to look at it again.

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.639
You're done.
Yeah,

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:59.312
You've been famous for decades,

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:01.014
isn't that kind of fun
selfies have changed,

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:04.183
maybe the getting recognized
expedited that?

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.185
There used to be the Polaroid.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.054
I think it's fun.

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:10.823
Yeah, I mean, it is.
I mean, it's the new Polaroid.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.458
Yes. It totally is.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.060
Stay right here Maury.
We'll see how it looks. Yeah.
