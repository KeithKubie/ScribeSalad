00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.570
Learning by storing cases in memory has a very strong connection to cognition.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.400
Cognitive agents like you and I are situated in a world.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.850
Our interactions with the world have certain patterns of regularity.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.120
The world offers us the same problems again and again. If we think about it,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.730
the kinds of problems that you and I deal within a routine everyday basis

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.960
are the same problems that occurred yesterday and the day before.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.795
Tying shoelaces is a good example of that. When we have to tie shoelaces,

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:36.270
none of us thinks a lot about how to do it. Memory supplies us with the answer.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.415
We don't think as much as we think we do. If you recall we have drawn

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:45.193
a cognitive architecture earlier that had three components in it, reasoning,

00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:50.350
memory, and learning. When we think of intelligence, we typically focus on

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.575
the reasoning component. We think intelligence has to do with reasoning,

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:57.470
with solving problems, with decision making. To some degree, that is true.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.370
By learning by recording cases, shifts the balance between the component.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.459
It says that, learning is very important and so is memory.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.450
We recall things in memory and then memory supplies us with the answers so

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.600
that we don't actually have to reason as much as we think we need to.
