this about actually helping produce the
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.460
this about actually helping produce the
next generation in a way that will make

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
next generation in a way that will make
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.310

that generation go on to also support

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
that generation go on to also support

the economy so in Norway Norway is
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.800
the economy so in Norway Norway is
consistently ranked as the happiest

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
consistently ranked as the happiest

country in the world wonderful that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
country in the world wonderful that
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.880
country in the world wonderful that
makes sense they have almost a year of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
makes sense they have almost a year of

share it sounds great but when you look
 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420
share it sounds great but when you look
at the economy they are also with the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
at the economy they are also with the
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.230
at the economy they are also with the
top producing their GDP is the highest

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
top producing their GDP is the highest
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.760

per capita of any top economic country
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.100
per capita of any top economic country
in the world it's it's kind of amazing

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
in the world it's it's kind of amazing
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.010
in the world it's it's kind of amazing
and on top of that they have more moms

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
and on top of that they have more moms
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.020
and on top of that they have more moms
who work than any country in the world

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
who work than any country in the world
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.640
who work than any country in the world
they also have more moms

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
they also have more moms
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.649
they also have more moms
work full-time which is a really

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659
work full-time which is a really
 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.449
work full-time which is a really
important distinction it's not just that

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459
important distinction it's not just that
 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.160
important distinction it's not just that
they have you know mothers really

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170
they have you know mothers really
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.509
they have you know mothers really
involved in the workplace they have

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519
involved in the workplace they have
 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.729
involved in the workplace they have
mothers who are really involved in the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
mothers who are really involved in the
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.640
mothers who are really involved in the

workplace are also incredibly happy have
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.199
workplace are also incredibly happy have
also taken this time away from their

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
also taken this time away from their
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.809
also taken this time away from their
jobs and somehow the economy is still

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819
jobs and somehow the economy is still
 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.199
jobs and somehow the economy is still
moving forward at a good clip this is so

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
moving forward at a good clip this is so
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.089
moving forward at a good clip this is so
far away from what we have in the United

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099
far away from what we have in the United
 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.119
far away from what we have in the United
States it's it's almost it's sad but

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129
States it's it's almost it's sad but
 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.530
States it's it's almost it's sad but
it's almost laughable the women I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540
it's almost laughable the women I
 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.410
it's almost laughable the women I
interviewed told me that they felt

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
interviewed told me that they felt
 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.210
interviewed told me that they felt
better kind of more back to normal

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
better kind of more back to normal
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.750
better kind of more back to normal
physically at about the 5.5 month mark

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
physically at about the 5.5 month mark
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.520
physically at about the 5.5 month mark
after having a baby and I was careful to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
after having a baby and I was careful to
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.710
after having a baby and I was careful to
define that as not necessarily back in

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
define that as not necessarily back in
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.599
define that as not necessarily back in
your pre-pregnancy jeans that's not what

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609
your pre-pregnancy jeans that's not what
 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:54.979
your pre-pregnancy jeans that's not what
I meant it's really more about feeling

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
I meant it's really more about feeling
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.050
I meant it's really more about feeling
comfortable in your skin so that's a the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
comfortable in your skin so that's a the
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.000
comfortable in your skin so that's a the
5.5 month mark on average for all these

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
5.5 month mark on average for all these
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.440
5.5 month mark on average for all these
women and these were women who had kind

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
women and these were women who had kind
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.819
women and these were women who had kind
of all approaches to career and

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829
of all approaches to career and
 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.379
of all approaches to career and
motherhood there were single moms

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389
motherhood there were single moms
 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.750
motherhood there were single moms
adoptive moms there were mothers who

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760
adoptive moms there were mothers who
 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.869
adoptive moms there were mothers who
worked an hourly wage working jobs and

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879
worked an hourly wage working jobs and
 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.720
worked an hourly wage working jobs and
more professional jobs really as broad a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
more professional jobs really as broad a
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.490
more professional jobs really as broad a
spectrum of approaches as I could find

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
spectrum of approaches as I could find
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.250
spectrum of approaches as I could find
and so these women reported feeling back

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260
and so these women reported feeling back
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.110
and so these women reported feeling back
to normal physically after five point

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
to normal physically after five point
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.789
to normal physically after five point
five months emotionally it was actually

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799
five months emotionally it was actually
 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.439
five months emotionally it was actually
a little longer it was five point eight

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449
a little longer it was five point eight
 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.629
a little longer it was five point eight
months which is really interesting

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639
months which is really interesting
 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.330
months which is really interesting
because when you look at the science of

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
because when you look at the science of
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.990
because when you look at the science of
what a good parental leave looks like it

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
what a good parental leave looks like it
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.930
what a good parental leave looks like it
is six months of paid leave because

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940
is six months of paid leave because
 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.039
is six months of paid leave because
according to the research that's been
