seems to me that there's one set of

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:35.340
seems to me that there's one set of
 

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.159
seems to me that there's one set of
questions that do you think the Warner

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:37.169
questions that do you think the Warner
 

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.409
questions that do you think the Warner
up is a good idea or bad idea there's

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419
up is a good idea or bad idea there's

up is a good idea or bad idea there's
another set of questions how's it going

another set of questions how's it going
 

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.640
another set of questions how's it going
that are sort of fact and analysis

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:43.650
that are sort of fact and analysis
 

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.800
that are sort of fact and analysis
questions and we really see a large

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:45.810
questions and we really see a large
 

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.740
questions and we really see a large
degree of disagreement about that basic

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:48.750
degree of disagreement about that basic
 

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.750
degree of disagreement about that basic
question is this a problem for the press

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760
question is this a problem for the press
 

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.180

what's interesting about that is always

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120
what's interesting about that is always
 

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.100
what's interesting about that is always
interesting when you make those

broadcasters could or would argue that

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:13.830
broadcasters could or would argue that
 

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.500
broadcasters could or would argue that
their coverage was objective in the

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:15.510
their coverage was objective in the
 

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.030
their coverage was objective in the
sense of being based on evidence or

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040
sense of being based on evidence or
 

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.130
sense of being based on evidence or
based on facts but you can clearly see

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140
based on facts but you can clearly see
 

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.990
based on facts but you can clearly see
they all have a very different framework

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000
they all have a very different framework
 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.330
they all have a very different framework
a very different basis of the judgments

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:23.340
a very different basis of the judgments
 

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.920
a very different basis of the judgments
they're making for selection of what

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:24.930
they're making for selection of what
 

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.500
they're making for selection of what
they highlight and what they emphasize

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:26.510
they highlight and what they emphasize
 

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.420
they highlight and what they emphasize
and the disconcerting part is that those

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:29.430
and the disconcerting part is that those
 

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.700
and the disconcerting part is that those
judgments reinforce the kind of cultural

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:31.710
judgments reinforce the kind of cultural
 

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.320
judgments reinforce the kind of cultural
position and indeed the political

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.330
position and indeed the political
 

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.360

positions a lot of the countries and

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.370
positions a lot of the countries and
 

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.150
positions a lot of the countries and
cultures that they come from absolutely

including the BBC and CNN as well to a
 

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.370
including the BBC and CNN as well to a
greater degree than I think anybody

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380
greater degree than I think anybody
 

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.650

work at it and I think it's probably a

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.210
work at it and I think it's probably a
 

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.850

what's been good through that as we go
 

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.630
what's been good through that as we go
through this huge disruption it would be

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640
through this huge disruption it would be
 

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.980
through this huge disruption it would be
very easy to cast it away

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:21.990

think for the most part it really

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:15.970

in other emerging markets they're more
 

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.090
in other emerging markets they're more
sensitive to these issues perhaps but I

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:39.100
sensitive to these issues perhaps but I
 

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.430

show all of the cartoons but we did
 

01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:50.630
show all of the cartoons but we did
communicate what they showed and why

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640

they were offensive in other words we

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:52.650
they were offensive in other words we
 

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:54.290
they were offensive in other words we
tried to draw a line that meant we were

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:54.300
tried to draw a line that meant we were
 

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.630
tried to draw a line that meant we were
as open with all of our audiences about

as open with all of our audiences about
 

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.250
as open with all of our audiences about
what these cartoons were and what they

what these cartoons were and what they
 

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.620
what these cartoons were and what they

responsibilities there and and you know

01:06:10.339 --> 01:06:10.349
responsibilities there and and you know
 

01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:11.960

complicated it may get more complicated
 

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.710
complicated it may get more complicated
as you go on but I would say that I

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720
as you go on but I would say that I
 

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.599

think people who try to say freedom of

as we were discussing earlier so that

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960
as we were discussing earlier so that
 

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.150
as we were discussing earlier so that
you have people who can help make a

world would not countenance running an
 

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:39.470
world would not countenance running an
anti-semitic cartoon so therefore you

01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480
anti-semitic cartoon so therefore you
 

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.670
anti-semitic cartoon so therefore you
have to have people who can make the

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680

be legitimate to publish and an
anti-muslim cartoon and that means you

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:50.730
anti-muslim cartoon and that means you
 

01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:52.099
anti-muslim cartoon and that means you

into issue although all the different
 

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.990
into issue although all the different
varieties of reactions as the fact that

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000
varieties of reactions as the fact that
 

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.140

it was a mistake

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:22.150
it was a mistake
 

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:23.370
it was a mistake

perhaps that they were there in the
first place but it could have been

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:24.970
first place but it could have been
 

01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:27.480
first place but it could have been
handled better in which case maybe the

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:27.490
handled better in which case maybe the
 

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:30.120
handled better in which case maybe the
crisis could have been more contained or

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:30.130
crisis could have been more contained or
 

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.079
crisis could have been more contained or
more palatable to Muslims I should also
