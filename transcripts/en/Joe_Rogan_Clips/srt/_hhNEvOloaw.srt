1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,760
The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, and
I go into the issue of Iowasca, uh,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,430
in, in this book because I, first of all,

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:13,260
I [inaudible] is itself another
example of Amazonian Science. Um,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,710
as you and I, and many of the
listeners and viewers know, uh,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,780
the active ingredient of Iowasca
is DMT dimethyltryptamine,

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,470
but dimethyltryptamine is not normally
accessible through the gut. Uh,

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,710
we have to smoke it or,

8
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:33,150
or vape it to get that rocket
ship to the other side of reality.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,060
And the journey lasts what,
10, 12 minutes, not much more
than that, and sometimes,

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,810
sometimes quite a lot less.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,520
What Iowasca does is it makes
DMT available through the gut.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,060
The reason it's not available through the
gut is because of an enzyme in the gut

13
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:52,830
called monoamine oxidase.
And that switch is off DMT on contact,

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,850
the Iowasca Vine, which is one of the
two ingredients of the IOWASCA brew.

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,580
The other ingredient is
leaves that contain DMT.

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,210
The IOWASCA vine contains Amano
Amy [inaudible] oxidase inhibitor,

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,540
which switches off the enzyme in the
gut and allows the DMT to be accessed

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,540
orally,

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,070
which produces a rather different journey
from the smoked or vaped DMT trip is a

20
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:17,550
much longer journey. It's four or five
hours. It allows you to integrate and to,

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,300
and to interrelate with the strange
landscapes in which you find yourself

22
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,940
amongst and the entities
that you encounter.

23
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,850
I'm not making any claims about the
reality status of those entities,

24
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,680
but what I am saying,
and it's a fact,

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,270
is that people who work with DMT and
Iowaska do encounter what they construe to

26
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:36,450
be entities, uh, who, who
communicate with them intelligently.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,430
So somebody in the Amazon,

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,460
out of 150,000 different species of
plants and trees selected two that are not

29
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:46,440
psychoactive on their own,
but when put together,

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,640
create an extraordinary visionary brew,
uh,

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,570
and Iowasca means the vine of the
dead and what it's connected to, uh,

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,210
in South American religious
and spiritual thinking, uh,

33
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:04,500
is what happens to us when
we die. Uh, and, and, uh,

34
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:09,120
the Takano who are an Amazonian people
who work regularly with Iowasca.

35
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:10,140
I mean the,
no,

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,160
actually we'll give a teaspoon full
of Iowasca to a newborn infant.

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,510
They feel I ask is so important that
there is a hidden realm around us which we

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,540
are not normally aware of and
we need to be aware of it. Um,

39
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,070
and I'll ask it as an important part
of that. In their IOWASCA journeys,

40
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:30,570
the Tucano Schamens experience visions
and they will then come back to an alert,

41
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,290
normal problem solving
state of consciousness and
they will paint and depict

42
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,020
their visions. And what's intriguing,
and I, I go into it in the book,

43
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:40,770
is the quite a number of the tacamo
paintings of the other world of the

44
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:45,570
afterlife realm of the entrance to the
other world are geometrical and they look

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,550
exactly like the vehicle glyphs.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,750
So I'm beginning to wonder whether these
geoglyphs we're part of a system of

47
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:56,751
spiritual ideas concerning what happens
to us after death and what we need to do

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,360
in this life to ensure a beneficial
outcome. And oddly enough,

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,890
that same system of ideas is found in
the Mississippi valley, in the Amazon.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
It involves,
uh,

51
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,230
particularly Iowasca and the belief that
the IOWASCA journey takes you to the

52
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:15,610
afterlife realm and a journey along the
milky way in the Mississippi Valley.

53
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,360
Um, the mound builder sites up
and down the Mississippi Valley,

54
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,880
particularly Mountville in Alabama,

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,140
exactly the same system of religious
ideas associated with geometrical

56
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:29,140
constructions that on death the soul,

57
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,430
they're very specific ascends to the
constellation of Orion transits from the

58
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,450
constellation of Orion to the Milky Way
makes a journey along the Milky Way,

59
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:42,451
which they call the path of souls and
encounters challenges and or deals where

60
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,610
the soul must account for
the life that it has lived.

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,770
Then we got to Egypt and what do
we find the same system of ideas.

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,160
The soul must rise up to
the constellation of Orion.

63
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,730
There's a narrow shaft cut through the
southern side of the Great Pyramid of

64
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,300
Giza, which targets directly the lowest
of the three stars of Orion's belt,

65
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,930
widely accepted as a star
shaft or a sole shaft.

66
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:08,830
The soul would rise up through that shaft,
get to the Constellation of Orion,

67
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,690
which stands by the
banks of the Milky Way.

68
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,520
It would then transit to the Milky Way,

69
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,920
which they engined to Egyptians
called the winding waterway.

70
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,240
And it would make a journey along the
milky way where it would be confronted by

71
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:22,120
challenges and or deals,
very similar idea to the Chicano,

72
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,270
very similar idea to the Mississippi
valley as far as we know.

73
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,000
None of these cultures were
in contact with one another.

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,060
Either we're dealing with a huge,
unbelievable,

75
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:35,890
extraordinarily detailed coincidence
involving architecture and ideas.

76
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,180
Or we're looking at the legacy that
was inherited in all of these different

77
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,780
places from a remote common ancestor.
And,

78
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,410
and I believe that that's
what we're looking at.

79
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,660
What do we think the people from the
ancient Mississippi Valley though,

80
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,251
that culture,

81
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,850
what do we think they were using if they
weren't using Iowasca or do we think

82
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,470
that's what they were using? Well, that's,
that's, that's an interesting question.

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,891
Whether,

84
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:01,270
whether visionary substances are the
only way to get into altered states of

85
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:05,990
consciousness. And, and, uh, I would say
they, they, they are definitely not a,

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,260
of course there are visionary
substances which are,

87
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:12,040
which are used in native American,
uh, vision, vision quests. I've, I've,

88
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,110
I've had the privilege of Payoti ceremony,
uh,

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,910
with the native American church.
Um, I've never done that.

90
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,940
What does that look like? I loved it
actually. I thought, I thought it was,

91
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:23,020
I thought it was amazing.
It,

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,620
it doesn't overpower you in the way that
DMT and Iowaska does. Uh, it's, it's,

93
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,080
it's much gentler.
It's much more,

94
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,350
you feel much more integrated and
connected with, with, with nature.

95
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,350
Your thought processes are
quite, quite clear. It felt,

96
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,690
it felt just like a very
beautiful and healing experience.

97
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:40,720
And I loved the ceremony that I'm in.
I'm inside a teepee with,

98
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,770
with 30 or 40 other people and that there,

99
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,300
there are specific roles that are assigned
to those different individuals. One,

100
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,820
we'll keep the door,
another will be responsible for the fire,

101
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,600
which is a work of art in itself. Just
gazing into that fire. And the glowing,

102
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,110
the glowing embers is enough to induce
an altered state of consciousness on its

103
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:59,240
own. Incredible drumming, which,

104
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,350
which drives your state of consciousness
into a kind of peak peak experience.

105
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:08,351
This is a technology for accessing other
levels of experience and other levels

106
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:09,680
of reality.

107
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,760
And it's clear that the native Americans
had a number of advanced technologies

108
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,050
in this area. The Sundance doesn't use
a substance, but it uses austerity.

109
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,930
It uses pain to drive an
altered state of consciousness.

110
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,920
The objective in every case seems to be,
let's just for a while,

111
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,150
get ourselves out of the narrow, rigid
frame of the alert, problem solving,

112
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,790
state of consciousness. We all
need that. It's incredibly useful.

113
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,270
Hunter gatherer is needed just as
much as people in cities need it,

114
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,930
but it's not the only state of
consciousness available to human beings.

115
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,160
And maybe that's one of the big mistakes
that we're making in our culture. Um,

116
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,090
and was not made in,
in shamanistic societies.
