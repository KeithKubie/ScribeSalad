00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.619
Space medicine.

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:02.619
Is a thing.

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:06.189
And no, we’re not talking about medicines
made of compounds discovered on Mars.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:07.400
At least not yet.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.230
We’re talking about the drugs you would
need to survive in space.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.850
It’s a little more than an Advil, I can
tell you that much.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.830
Turns out, getting to and living in space
does some pretty crazy stuff to your body.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.320
Astronauts on the International Space Station,
live and work for months at a timein a microgravity

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.019
environment, which is sometimes called zero
gravity .

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.390
But the term ‘zero gravity’ is actually
a misnomer, because earth’s gravity is still

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.890
acting on the ISS.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.840
But doesn’t that mean the space station
is being pulled back towards earth?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.060
YEP.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.060
Astronauts float because the spacecraft, and
everything on it, is technically in freefall.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.580
The ISS is orbiting the earth at a speed that
perfectly matches the earth’s curvature,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.070
so it’s constantly ‘falling’ towards
earth, but will never hit it.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.000
And I thought rollercoasters were terrifying.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.350
So, microgravity is GREAT for all kinds of
scientific purposes--but your body would need

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.420
some help handling it.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.330
If the blast off into space doesn’t give
you nausea or vomiting, it’s likely that

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.050
your first entry into microgravity will.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.250
Our bodies have a specialized way of keeping
our balance with our vestibular system, a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.430
series of canals in our inner ear.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.360
In microgravity, our way of navigating through
the physical world, of sensing up or down,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.970
is totally thrown off and may cause us to
feel nauseous.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.630
So astronauts may take anti-nausea drugs to
get used to the environment.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.370
While motion sickness is so common in space
that it has its own name--space motion sickness--

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.020
we see similar issues out on the open sea.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.510
Ben Lecomte and the crew aboard the Seeker
Vessel are on an expedition to gather data

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.810
to raise awareness about ocean health.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.120
As he swims across the Pacific, he and his
crew aboard have already experienced motion

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120
sickness.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.920
Another challenge Ben and astronauts share?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.300
Bone density loss.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.450
His body’s ‘weightlessness’ in the ocean
is surprisingly similar to the microgravity

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.409
environment aboard the ISS.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.860
See when we move our bodies back here on earth,
on dry land, gravity is constantly pulling

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.860
on us.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.190
This makes our muscles and bones stronger,
even when we’re not explicitly exercising.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.100
But in space, our muscles and bones quickly
become weak and start to deteriorate because

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.009
there’s little resistance for us to work
against.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.400
One way astronauts on extended space flights
combat this is on a special treadmill--they

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.030
have to exercise an average of two and a half
hours a day, six days a week to keep themselves

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.030
healthy.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.180
But a long-term stay in space could lead to
a loss of 1.5% bone mass per month--and it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.840
takes years back on earth for your body to
get back to normal.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.950
In addition to exercising, and taking calcium
and vitamin D supplements, astronauts also

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.209
take a medication called Bisphosphonate once
a week to prevent bone loss.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.550
But let’s get a little freakier than just
baseline health maintenance.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.890
In addition to your regular antibiotics and
decongestants and antidiarrheals, astronauts

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.120
may also use drugs that improve their cognition.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.020
On the ISS, astronauts have to complete extremely
long and difficult tasks, like fixing some

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.020
crucial component of the space station.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.190
To help them stay alert, astronauts aboard
the ISS may take a drug called Modafinil.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.060
It’s actually not a stimulant in the way
that coffee or even cocaine is, it’s a class

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.560
of non-addictive psychostimulants called a
eugeroic--a wakefulness enhancer.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.130
It’s used here on earth to treat narcolepsy
patients, and for patients like astronauts,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.740
works to enhance attention, executive function,
and learning while they stay awake for long-periods

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.740
of time.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.670
I really could have used some of that in college.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.560
Last but not least, space crews also carry
tranquilisers.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.360
Space can be pretty freaky, and if any member
of the crew were to lose it a little bit,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.770
their fellow ISS inhabitants would need to
make sure they weren't going to do any harm

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.250
to themselves, the other astronauts, or the
station itself.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.030
If someone were to go a little Space Odyssey:
2001 on the ISS, their companions are encouraged

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.360
to bind their wrists and ankles with duct
tape and administer a tranquiliser.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.450
So that’s fun.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.170

And to see how Ben’s swim through the Pacific
compares to the extreme environment in space

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:48.040
- watch this latest episode here.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.590
This expedition will help us learn more about
our largest ocean’s marine life AND the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.370
human body at the same time!

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.370
Pretty cool.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.819
Thanks for watching.
