00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.689
We talked a bit about different
monetization models in the last lesson,

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.590
but let's refresh your
memory with the highlights

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.230
of some of the most popular models.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.700
&gt;&gt; First, there are ads,
serving advertisements provide a way

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
to make money while you are giving
your content or app for free.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.580
Ads are very popular on the Web,
but they aren't the only model.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.873
Let's see another common
way to make money.

00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:27.367
&gt;&gt; There's also
the one-time charge model.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.477
Now in this model, it's similar
to what you would experience in

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:33.610
the real world if you went
to a brick and mortar store.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.320
You go to a shop, pay a certain
amount to the shopkeep, and

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.490
you walk away with a t-shirt, let's say.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.780
Now in apps you can do this
in two different ways.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.690
First you can charge a fixed price.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.870
So the user pays a price, and
they can download the app.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.950
Or you can charge a price
after a trial period.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.530
Now in both cases there are two things
that you want to pay attention to.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.950
One, make sure that payment is quick and
easy, and

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.690
it doesn't require the user to log in.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.120
Second, use an established
payment model, Stripe,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.810
PayPal, GooglePay,
ApplePay, what have you.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.580
This will make sure that your
users have a convenient and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.280
consistent checkout flow.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.480
&gt;&gt; The subscription model is another
option there are many cases where

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.240
we wish to sell our service
on a monthly or yearly basis.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.880
The big advantage that made this
model so popular is the fact that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.270
you get to earn more due to the increase
in the lifetime value of your users.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.230
And they feel more comfortable
because in that pay-as-you-go model

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.250
they got full control on their expenses.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660
&gt;&gt; Lastly, there are in-app payments,
and this is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.300
a very popular model these days, as it
combines two main user preferences.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.430
Free apps as the starting point, and
then a way to monetize on that user

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010
after they've decided that
your products worth it.
