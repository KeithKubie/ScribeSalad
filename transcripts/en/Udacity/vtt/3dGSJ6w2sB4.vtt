00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.271
Let's review what we learned.

00:00:02.271 --> 00:00:08.888
I showed you how to use a minimizer to
find x such that f of x is minimized.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:11.848
I showed you how to minimize
in multiple dimensions.

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:15.700
And how to use a minimizer to
build a parametrized model.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.480
Where can you go from here?

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.900
There are a number of ways
you can carry this forward.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.830
You can use functions besides
polynomials, you can model stock prices,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.250
or you can optimize a portfolio.
