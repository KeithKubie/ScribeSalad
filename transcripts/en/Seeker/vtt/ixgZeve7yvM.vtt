00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.269
Life goals: meet an alien or at least answer
the question; are we alone in the universe?

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:11.500
What I’m saying is WHERE ARE ALL THE ALIENS?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.309
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.910
Probability tells us that our galaxy should
be teeming with life. Our universe is about

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.950
14 billion years old. Our Solar System and
our Earth are only 4.5 billion years old.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.490
But the universe is a big place, and there
are plenty of other solar systems that are

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.500
wayyy older even in our own galaxy. So intelligent
life should have evolved millions of years

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.329
sooner than we did and they should have taken
over the galaxy by now. At that rate, we should

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.870
have some evidence that the truth, or life,
is out there. So what’s the deal with the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.020
radio silence? This is the very question physicist
Enrico Fermi asked in the 1950s, specifically

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.610
“Where is everybody?”. This idea that
alien life should be out there, but we haven’t

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.239
heard anything is called the Fermi Paradox.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.989
Most solutions to the paradox can be broken
down into two broad categories, aliens don’t

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.309
exist, or they do exist.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.469
If aliens don’t exist, it might be because
a planet that can sustain life is rare, and

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.229
that complex life-- such as plants and animals--
would evolve is even RARER. This is creatively

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.729
called the Rare Earth Hypothesis, which suggests
that we are actually alone. Another idea is

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.600
that an intelligent, colonizing, intergalactic
lifeform is incredibly rare. Robin Dale Hanson,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.869
an associate professor of economics at George
Mason University, described this idea as ‘The

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.189
Great Filter’.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.020
He suggests that each stage of evolution might
just be really hard to reach. For aliens evolve

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.200
and become visible to us, they would need
the right star system, reproductive molecules

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.109
like RNA, simple life, complex life, sexual
reproduction, multicellular life, tool using

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.149
life, where we are now, and last but not least,
colonization explosion, or the ability to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.259
take over the galaxy. He suggests each of
these steps is very improbable, let alone

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.200
all of them. And one or more of these steps
is “the Great Filter”, meaning that it’s

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.399
so incredibly difficult to pass, that nothing
in the universe has done it.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.279
Since we’ve already made it through most
of these steps, it stands to reason that the

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:12.069
biggest hurdle of “The Great Filter” might
be where we are now or where we nearly are.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.099
If that’s the case, that means we are approaching
the filter.. and odds are, we will destroy

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.799
ourselves before we become interstellar, just
like everyone else in the universe probably

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.530
did.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.069
But okay what if aliens DO exist? Where are
they? One hypothesis supported by Author Michael

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.959
Michaud is that aliens are just shutting the
hell up. And for good reason, self protection.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.650
The universe could be a giant hostile place
filled with warfaring colonizing civilizations.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
So by staying at home and staying quiet, they
aren’t drawing attention to themselves to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.840
keep themselves safe.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.000
But some people think extraterrestrial life
is here. And that maybe they just don’t

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.819
care. Maybe they don’t find us interesting
enough. Or maybe they’re nice aliens, who

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.420
care about us a whole lot. So much so that
they won’t even touch us. One theory published

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.780
in the journal Icarus in 1973 suggests that
we are part of some sort of protected zone,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.099
almost like a preserve or a zoo!
But maybe they ARE here and reaching out to

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.010
us. But we just can’t communicate with them,
maybe we’re just bad at reading the signs.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.859
Maybe they communicate with technologies that
are different from radio waves, like lasers,

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.849
or something we haven’t even conceived yet!

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:19.150
There’s so many more solutions to the Fermi
paradox, one physicist Stephen Webb lists

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.500
at least 50 solutions in his book “If the
Universe Is Teeming with Aliens ... WHERE

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.709
IS EVERYBODY?”. But he actually believes
we are alone.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.409
No matter what, I want to believe we’re
not alone. But perhaps the universe is too

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.219
vast for us to ever know.

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.290
While we haven’t heard anything from other
civilizations that doesn’t mean we’ll

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.760
stop scanning the skies anytime soon. In fact,
NASA’s got a new telescope in the works

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.840
that will see further than we’ve ever seen
before.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.209
If you want an incredible behind-the-scenes
look at the new James Webb Space Telescope,

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.700
make sure to check out Discovery’s brand
new documentary Telescope! The world premiere

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.239
is this Saturday, February 20 at 9pm on the
Discovery Channel. We’ll be watching too!

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.790
So what do you think? Do you think life is
out there? Or what’s your favorite solution

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.599
to the paradox? Let us know down in the comments
