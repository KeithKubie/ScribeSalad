LACI
True facts, I eat food I dropped on the ground!

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.960
TRACE
And new research shows you are disgusting!

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.610
LACI
That's.....that's actually true.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.780
TRACE
Thanks, science.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.230
[[MUSIC PLAYING]]

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.990
LACI
Hey everyone, Laci and Trace here.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.090
It's an age old question: WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH THE 5 SECOND RULE?

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.199
TRACE
Uh, doi.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.279
The 5 second rule is the idea that it's safe
to eat food off the floor as long as its been

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.019
down there for less than 5 seconds.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.610
BUT this week, a new, informal study coming
out of Aston University in the UK has found

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.200
that this is in fact.....TRUE!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.540
LACI
DING DING DING.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.540
EAT AWAY PEEPS.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.540
LICK IT OFF THE FLOOR.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.250
TRACE
You probably shouldn't lick the floor tho.....you'll

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.420
lick up more bacteria.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.460
LACI
Oh right.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.860
DON'T LICK IT OFF THE FLOOR.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.170
To conduct the study, the scientists (i think
it was done by a professor and his students,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.890
not scientists) dropped all kinds of food
items like toast, pasta, biscuits, and sticky

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.040
sweets on laminates, tiles, and carpets.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040
Indoor floors only.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.770
Then they measured bacterial growth, specifically
of e. coli and staph, for various lengths

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.720
of time from 3-30 seconds.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.590
TRACE
They found the longer the food was on the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.690
floor, the more bacteria accumulated on the
tasty bits of food, which suggests: the amount

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.300
of time the food has been on the floor DOES
MATTER.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.350
On average, after 5 seconds, bacteria did
begin to accumulate to questionable levels.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.720
But at less than that, there was bacteria,
but it wasn't as bad.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.280
LACI
The type of flooring matters too.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000
Carpets were less likely to transmit bacteria
than both the tiled and laminated floors.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(can we get a why in here?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
why is the carpet less likely?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that's not what I'd think) The scientists
believe carpet is your safest bet, followed

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.760
by laminated floors, followed by tiling -- which
is the grossest and dirtiest.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.740
TRACE
That's how it is at my house too.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.270
Though carpet gets the fuzzies on the food
more.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.580
Dry foods were also found to be safer than
wet foods since wet foods made more contact

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.120
with floor bacteria.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.150
Cookies, for instance, were safe for up to
30 seconds.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.650
It's Girl Scout cookie season, I can now drop
them with reckless abandon!

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.409
LACI
2 notes on this verdict though - ONE, it's

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.610
still true that any food dropped on the floor
still carries some infection risk.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.260
I mean, it depends what kind of bacteria is
present on that particular floor.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.560
TRACE
Yeah, I mean, maybe your floor is gross because

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.630
you never clean it.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.710
I wouldn't eat off that floor.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.170
LACI
I would be less likely to eat off that floor,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.580
but I might still consider it.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.920
The other note is that this study is NOT YET
PEER REVIEWED.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.819
TRACE
*GASP* PEER REVIEWING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.920
This study seems to have good methodology
though.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.400
It was a followup to a 2007 study at Clemson
University and found that eating food off

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.950
the floor ISN'T safe because the bacterial
transfer happens immediately.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.240
LACI
Which is what this study found too, they just

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.060
also found that the amount of time it's down
there plays a role.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.440
TRACE
Long story short: you're probably not going

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.230
to get sick or die from eating food off the
floor if you pick it up right away--

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.980
LACI
But there's always a chance.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.080
And do you really want to risk it?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.900
TRACE
If it's CHEESE AND BAGUETTES WITH A SASAFWE

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.900
ON TOP, yes.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.900
LACI
That's right.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.900
We live on the edge here at DNews.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.310
TRACE
The study actually found that almost 90% of

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.470
people live on the edge and are down to eat
stuff off the floor, with women eating more

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.239
floor food than men.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.489
So there you go.

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.880
Are you guys down with the 5 second rule or
is it crossing the hygiene line?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.500
Let us know down below and we'll see you next
time with more science updates!
