00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.742
&gt;From the function p over q, we can see from the denominator that the vertical

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:08.966
asymptote is x equals negative 5 half's. The horizontal asymptote from our

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:13.530
leading coefficients, is y equals negative 1 half. The graph that has these

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.710
asymptotes is graph C right here. Moving on to our second function, q over p of

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.238
x, the vertical asymptote is x equals negative 4. The horizontal asymptote is y

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:27.659
equals negative 2, and that means that this goes with graph B.
