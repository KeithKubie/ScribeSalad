00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.829
So here's a situation

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.039
You just ran out of gas your vehicles stranded on the side of a Mountain road

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.350
Who knows if we're going to get any help out here?

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.189
So it's a good idea to get a survival fire going as soon as possible and here's a cool trick

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.490
You can use to do just that using a common graphite pencil now

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.629
this trick is actually super simple to do all you need to do is first of all just wiggle the eraser off the end of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.369
your pencil so that you've just got the wood and the graphite then all you need to do is take a sharp [object] like a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.369
Rock or a knife and just bite off the top section of wood and

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.979
Split it down the middle so you can see the graphite exposed through the center of the pencil and [that's] pretty much all the preparation

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.169
Your pencil needs to become a makeshift firestarter

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.430
Go ahead and attach your jumper cables with the red end to the positive and the black to the negative

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:42.670
and watch this

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.300
Clip one of the cables onto one end of the pencil so that poking into the graphite on one end then take the other jumper

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.730
Cable and do the same thing on the other end the second it makes contact the pencil start smoking and within a few

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Seconds will burst into flames

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.449
Now important thing to realize about your jumper cables

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.260
Is that only one of the teeth is electrically?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.930
Connected so look at the wire where it runs in turn your jumper cables with the neutral side down

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.149
that's where we're going to place the wood part of our pencil and when we close the teeth the pointy part - the one with

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.429
The cable on it should be digging into the graphite like this

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.669
Now rather than burning up the entire length of your pencil at once

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.869
It makes a lot more sense to break them into one and a half to two inch pieces you end up with four to five

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.589
Different igniters by doing this you can really make one pencil go a long way the second you clip your jumper cable into place

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.610
It's going to ignite into fire

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.319
So you need to have a tinder bundle or some kind of kindling ready to go to catch that flame the instant it happens

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.580
Now the wood that you take off your pencil does not need to go to waste you can use that for

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.270
Kindling to help stoke your fire

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.000
Just chop it into small pieces pile it up in a little teepee shape and then when you get your initial flame

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.669
You'll already [have] a little more tinder. You can throw straight on the fire

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.659
Now check this out if you can stretch your jumper cables out right to your fire pit

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.310
[you] can actually get your mechanism

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.060
Set up in the fire build your tinder and your kindling over top of it

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.589
And then you can go back to your battery and connect your jumper cables to the terminals there and from a safe distance

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.499
Your fire will ignite itself how cool is that?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.560
boom there it is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.860
Well that is how you make a survival fire using the jumper cables from your car and a pencil?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.180
Thanks so much for [joining] me for this experiment. I'll be looking for in the next video. Let's talk to you that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.360
Think we just got recognized

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120
for sure

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.459
busted
