00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.100
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good afternoon.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.070
I'm Karen Lloyd, a retired Army
Division Colonel and Director

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.240
of the Veteran's
History Project.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.500
Thank you for choosing to come
to our panel discussion on PTSD

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.150
and Veterans Correctional
Housing Units.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.160
It's the second in our
ongoing PTSD panel series

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.950
in collaboration with
the National Institute

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.340
of Corrections.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.360
I'd especially like
to welcome the members

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.260
of the Justice Involved
Veterans Network in attendance

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.120
and those watching online, a
group of industry professionals

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.020
who research and produce
recommendations on how

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.940
to help veterans involved
in the justice system.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.750
It is the work they do
that makes these types

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.770
of discussions possible
and so valuable.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.490
As an Army veteran, I know how
untreated PTSD can affect a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.790
veteran's life.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.840
Our partners at the
National Institute

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.590
of Corrections know all too well
how PTSD can create problems

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.870
with reentry into [inaudible]
and how it can lead to run-ins

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.080
with the law and entry into
the justice and prison systems.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
But as you'll learn today, it
doesn't have to be this way.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.160
We've pulled together
several experts

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.880
who have seen firsthand
how treating PTSD

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.900
and adding structure to
veteran inmates' lives

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.850
in the Veterans Correctional
Housing Units can break the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.100
cycle of crime and recidivism.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.860
This panel represents
just another example

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310
of how the Veterans
History Project is working

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.800
to illuminate the work done by
a wide variety of organizations

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.180
that focus on assisting our
veterans to move forward

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.120
with their lives and further
enrich their life stories,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.520
which we certainly hope
they then choose to donate

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.990
to the library so others can
benefit from their experiences.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.900
While we had hoped to
have Director Inch today,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.080
he sent the next-best
thing, a marine.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.040
Our next speaker is Frank Lara
of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.260
Mr. Lara is a veteran of the
United States Marine Corp

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.540
and is currently the Assistant
Director of Congressional --

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.010
Correctional Programs Division.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.380
Frank Lara began his --

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.810
began his career as a
correctional officer

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.180
in Seagoville, Texas, where
he rose through the ranks,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.440
eventually being named Warden

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.880
at the Federal Correctional
Complex, Beaumont,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.370
where he received the New
Warden of the Year Award

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.400
from the Bureau of Prisons.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.060
In 2017, he became
the Assistant Director

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.470
of the Correctional
Programs Division.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.510
So please, let -- help me
welcome Assistant Director Lara.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:01.150
[ Applause ]

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.450
&gt;&gt; Frank Lara: Good afternoon.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.690
&gt;&gt; Audience: Good afternoon.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.150
&gt;&gt; Frank Lara: Thank you,
Karen, for that introduction.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.680
I'm honored to be here, and we
did have a little discussion

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.980
with the Director this morning.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.280
So he couldn't make it.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.720
He had some unplanned
activities that were not

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.060
on his calendar that showed up.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.000
So he feels he -- he
regrets not being here,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.590
but I did tell him this.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.250
I said, "Well, you're
sending a corporal.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.200
That's equivalent to
a general in the Army.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.500
So -- "

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.800
[ Laughter ]

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.100
He took that pretty good.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.400
[ Laughter ]

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.270
But as Karen mentioned, I've
served in the Bureau of Prisons

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.390
for over 26 years in
various capacities.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.530
I've moved a total of 12 times.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.770
This is my second
time back in DC,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.210
and actually I've worked
two times at Beaumont,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.330
one as a lieutenant,
and then second time

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.740
as the complex warden.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.890
So that's one of the best
assignments I've had.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.780
Prior to joining the
Federal Bureau of Prisons,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.380
I proudly served in the
United States Marine Corp

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.810
for four years and exited the
Marine Corp as a corporal.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.110
I'm here on behalf of the --

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.090
Mark Inch, Director of
the Bureau of Prisons,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.400
and the 37,000 staff who serve
this agency and our country

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.150
at our 122 bureau
facilities nationwide.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.720
Prior to assuming the
directorship, Mr. Inch served

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.840
as the Provost Marshal
General/Commanding General,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.930
Criminal Investigative Division
in Army Corrections Command,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.480
where he maintained the
Executive Management Oversight

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.820
of the Army Corrections System.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.710
Every veteran, regardless
of when or where they served

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.360
or for how long, gave
of themselves to ensure

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.250
that all Americans continue
to enjoy the freedoms

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.080
and opportunities that are the
foundation of this country.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.510
I know firsthand some of
the challenges veterans face

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.880
as a result of spending
time in places

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.390
and circumstances many
cannot even imagine.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.440
We are here today to
increase the awareness

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.810
about Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.400
Some of these men and women
who suffer from PTSD struggle

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.260
to adapt back into society after
having served their country.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.140
PTSD can also contribute
to their involvement

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.420
in the justice system.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.420
Approximately 7%, or 200,000,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.620
of the 2.3 million
people incarcerated

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.680
in our nation's jails and
prisons are men and women

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.380
who have served in
the armed forces.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.800
The majority of these
individuals completed service

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.250
with an honorable discharge.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.550
A significant portion

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.750
of the combat troops are
returning home affected

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.740
by visible and invisible battle
scars, including high rates

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.250
of PTSD and traumatic
brain injury,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.580
as well as serious physical
mental -- serious wounds.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.250
Some veterans return
home and struggle

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.360
and find themselves using
substances, and others struggle

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.070
with various forms of
mental illness related

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.970
to their deployments.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.860
All of these issues
may, in some cases,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.840
lead to justice system
involvement and incarceration.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.570
Veteran-specific housing units

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.280
in our correctional environments
promotes opportunities

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.300
to assist veterans in
preparation to return

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.770
to our communities with
the skills and confidence

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.490
to be productive and
contributing members of society.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.910
The Bureau of Prisons houses
nearly 11,000 veterans

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.880
nationwide across
our 122 facilities.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.320
The vast majority are male,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.840
although we do have
a small number

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.140
of female veterans as well.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.210
We have an office devoted to
meeting the needs of the groups

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.000
of special inmates
with specialized needs.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.920
In December of 2017, we formally
recognized the inmate veterans

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.310
as a special population.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.580
We have a wide variety of
services for veteran inmates,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.150
but we are in the process

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.920
of standardizing
services nationwide.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.500
We have developed a three-tiered
services delivery model.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.590
Tier I services have just begun
to be rolled out nationwide.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.530
These will be available
at all facilities

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.370
and are primarily
self-service in nature.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.090
They include training, best
practices, guidance from --

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.160
guidance for staff, and forms
and resources that are available

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.100
to the inmate population.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.530
Each facility will
collaborate with veterans

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.340
and administration staff
to ensure inmate veterans

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.330
and families of veterans
have access

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.230
to the benefits information
they need.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.240
Tier II programs will be
rolled out later this year,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.940
and these are outpatient
services.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.310
These will be delivered
in a group model

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.700
and include a veteran
support group

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.940
and a veteran fitness group.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.280
Finally, Tier III services will
be the most intense in nature

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.740
and will include piloting --

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.040
will include the piloting

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.990
of a unit-based residential
program using a therapeutic

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.000
community model.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.920
We look forward to collaborating
with many of you as we roll

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.220
out these services nationwide.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.210
Today, it is my honor
and pleasure

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.880
to announce the National
Institute

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.260
of Corrections Publication
entitled "Barracks Behind Bars".

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.930
In veteran-specific
housing units,

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.940
veterans help veterans
help themselves.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.790
This publication tells
the stories of both --

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.720
of both some forward-thinking
sheriffs

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.620
who have instituted
veteran-specific housing units

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.160
in their jails and from
some of the inmates

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.080
who have benefitted
from these programs.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.330
We are seeing a number of
these housing units, dorms,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.260
or pods for veterans being
implemented across the country.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.220
This publication is designed
to serve as a resource

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.600
for the field as
jurisdictions consider

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.390
veteran-specific programming.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.390
Another great resource of this
publication is the sequential

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.860
intercept model that was adapted

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.910
to the justice-involved
veteran population.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:43.140
As you can see, each decision
point provides resources

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.930
and represents an
opportunity to intervene

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.330
at the lowest level possible

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.070
to minimize the collateral
consequences

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.970
of a veteran getting more deeply
involved in the justice system.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.240
Today, you will hear from
some of the folks featured

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.490
in the publication,
including our next speaker,

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:09.080
Sheriff Peter Koutoujian, from
Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.170
He is the -- he is serving
his second elected term

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:17.620
in the county with a population
of almost 6.1 million citizens,

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.890
the largest county
in Massachusetts,

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.740
and if I'm not mistaken,
in all of New England.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.560
His focus has been developing
a series of initiatives aimed

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.590
at increasing public confidence,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.770
providing a safer working
environment for staff,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.900
and improving the lives of
those in the county's custody,

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.560
including in 2016, the
creation of the HUMV Program,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.850
a housing unit for
military veterans.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.510
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sheriff Peter Koutoujian.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:58.120
[ Applause ]

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.390
&gt;&gt; Peter Koutoujian:
Good afternoon.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.690
Good afternoon.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.390
&gt;&gt; Audience: Good afternoon.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.500
&gt;&gt; Peter Koutoujian: I want to
begin by thanking Director Lloyd

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.860
and the Library of Congress.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.820
A number of us had
a tour this morning.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.370
This is truly an
amazing building

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.080
that is probably not
nearly as appreciated --

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.810
I know is not nearly as
appreciated as it should be,

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.790
and I appreciate it to a
much larger degree now,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.280
and I thank you for
hosting today's event.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.250
To Steven Amos and Greg Crawford
from the National Institute

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.980
of Corrections, Steve
and his team and Greg

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.770
at the NIC are helping agencies
like mine and many that are here

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.300
in this room that are
watching right now

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.970
to innovate our constant
sources of support and knowledge

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.010
for sheriffs across the country.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.800
And to Assistant Director Lara,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.160
thank you for that kind
introduction, and you --

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.920
I know you were afraid
of my name,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.490
and I say you did really well.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.580
So thank you very
much for that, Sir.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.170
I am truly honored -- I
mean this quite sincerely --

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.560
to be here among such a
distinguished group of leaders

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.740
from across the country, from
Cain County in Washington State

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.880
to San Francisco to
Orange County in Florida

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.640
to Cuyahoga County in Ohio,
New York, Texas, and elsewhere.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.790
And on behalf of all of us here

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.260
and my Middlesex
Sheriff's Office,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.990
to all that have
served our country,

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.790
I say thank you for
your service.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.540
While I did not serve
in the military,

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.950
my family has a history
of service

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.100
that has always impacted me.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.670
My grandparents came
to this country

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.270
to flee the Armenian genocide.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.660
They sought refuge
and opportunity

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.070
in this country,
and they found it.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.030
Three of their sons
wore the uniform,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.620
including my Uncle Jack,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.980
who went on to become the
Veterans Service Agent

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.550
in my hometown of
Waltham, Massachusetts.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.220
My Uncle Arson, who died in
an accident while serving

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.810
in the Philippines
at the age of 19.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.410
My grandmother, who could
barely speak English,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.340
was perhaps not technically,
but for all intents

00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:00.090
and purposes a gold-star mother
in the loss of her young son.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.360
And yet, my grandparents
loved this country

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.280
and everything it afforded
us, the truest of patriots.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.090
And I can just take a
moment to just think

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.390
that how proud they
would be to know

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.950
that their grandson was
speaking at the Library

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.230
of Congress as well, right?

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.090
It was that appreciation for
their service that made me want

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.580
to do better for
incarcerated veterans.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.580
After becoming sheriff
in 2011, I discovered

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.040
that we were lacking in
verified demographic information

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.660
on veterans.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.530
At the time, the only way we
knew if someone was a veteran,

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.680
if they told us they
were a veteran.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.670
And so, when we spoke
about the problem

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.940
of incarcerated military
veterans across this country,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.070
we really didn't have an
idea truly about the scope

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.300
of this problem because we
didn't have verified numbers

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.590
anywhere across this country.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.100
This was incredibly ineffective,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.540
and we knew that
we would miss folks

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.880
because sometimes we wouldn't
know that they were in there

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.120
or as they were coming closer to
release, they would let us know,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.420
but by then it was too late

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.470
to give them the proper
programming while inside

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.720
or the proper handoff to the
supports that they needed.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.020
We later learned
that the reasons

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.250
that many were not
identifying themselves,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.610
they were afraid
of losing benefits.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.690
Some didn't realize they
were qualified as a veteran.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.620
For some, it was either
stigma or shame at having been

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.920
at a place of incarceration.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.290
I knew there was a lot
more we could be doing

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.900
to improve the lives
of these individuals

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.960
and their families
-- and their families

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.720
and became personally
committed to this endeavor.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.600
It was at that point we
started speaking to the VA

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.940
about how we could better
identify veterans, and it began

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.870
with a launch of the Veterans
Reentry Search Service,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.520
or VRSS, developed by the VA.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.250
The system allowed us to
match our lists of those

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.090
in our custody against
the federal databases.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.170
And on day one, we had
19 men in our facility

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.610
who had self-identified at
having served this country.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.690
But VRSS immediately told us
that that number was wrong.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.330
We had another 44 in
our care, custody,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.630
and control that we
didn't know about,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.090
bring out total number to 63.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.980
In fact, two-thirds
more that we knew

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.080
about were serving time with us.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.420
In this instant, we learned
that we had tripled the number

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.360
of our veterans in our
custody, and that's why VRSS is

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.620
such a critical tool and
one I should be utilized --

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.920
I believe should be utilized

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.300
by every correctional
facility across this country.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.810
That discovery eventually led to
the creation of the Housing Unit

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.800
for Military Veterans, or
HUMV, designed in collaboration

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.150
with administrators and staff

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.730
and the incarcerated
veterans themselves.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.790
The unit was opened
in January of '16.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.450
It's been open for just about
2 1/2 years, and it was named

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.650
by the veterans themselves.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.100
Ours is not the first, and it
certainly won't be the last,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.740
unit designed for
veterans suffering

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.510
from so many ailments,
including PTSD.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.700
Because sheriffs and other
correctional leaders from Albany

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.590
to Arizona to recognize
specially tailored programming

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.620
for targeted population
works, a unique population,

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.240
a unique solution,
unique results.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.020
In veterans' units
in particularly work

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.610
so much more effectively
for a number of reasons.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.810
One, because of the staffs of
the officers, the volunteers

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.910
and the programmatic staff who
are specially trained to work

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.140
with veterans, the fact that
there are community resources

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.790
that can transition
to post release

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.090
to continue the treatment,

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.600
including the VA
any many nonprofits,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.370
and most importantly, because
of the veterans themselves,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.170
their own drive,
their own change.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.940
In Middlesex, we found
that the simple act

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.800
of housing the veterans
together opened new doors

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.790
for treatment and
rehabilitation.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.620
The men who have gone through
our HUMV have told us that being

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.920
out of the general population

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.300
and among other veterans allow
them to let their guard down,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.800
show them that they're not
alone, because they felt

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.580
so isolated and alone
before, and allow them to open

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.430
up about their trauma
and other issues that led

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.840
to their incarceration,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.830
making it a truly
therapeutic community.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.420
In fact, it was said that it
was very much like being back

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.310
in the service, where
in other parts

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.950
of the correctional facility,
you had to watch your back,

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:02.590
and in this unit, you knew that
you had someone at your back,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.740
and you had someone at your
left, and you had someone

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.800
at your right, and all you
needed to do was look forward.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.900
In our unit, it didn't
matter whether you had served

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.990
in Vietnam or Enduring Freedom,
whether you had spent a year

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.530
on a submarine, you
were involved in combat,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.000
or you served stateside,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.740
or you were discharged
honorably or not.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.940
And in some instances,
the issues that led

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.350
to a less-than-honorable
discharge are the very same

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.230
reasons that led to our
incarceration as well.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.910
If you swore an oath and were
willing to protect our freedom,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.020
we will consider
you for our program.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.640
Our experience is not that much
different from our colleagues

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.000
around the nation, many of
whom are here today and spoke

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.780
with such passion and
knowledge and expertise.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.570
The work that keeps happening
in these units is changing lives

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.010
and changing families
and changing communities

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.760
and making our communities safer

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.490
and saving our communities
money, all at the same time.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.500
You can see in the data our own
snapshot pegged our recidivism

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.120
at just 5% for all those that
spent a minimum of 30 days

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.400
in our custody over two
and a half years, 5%.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.660
Not only that, we have a
parole rate of about 95%.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.060
We had a number of
revising roles,

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.690
meaning that the sentence
given was actually lessened

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.690
by the courts themselves.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.290
We had a number of
men that were sent --

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.770
that were able to remain in
our unit instead of going

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.650
to the state prison
system because of the work

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.490
that we had done with them
and the believe in the courts

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.380
in our program, and
countless referrals

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.600
to veterans' treatment courts.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.100
That's consistent with
other programs like Albany

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.680
and San Francisco, who had
publicly reported other

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.490
single-digit recidivism rates.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.970
So this is not something
that is unique to Middlesex.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.090
It is happening across
this country.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.480
And more importantly, you can
hear it in the voices and see it

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.040
in the stories of the veterans
themselves, veterans like Mike,

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.690
who because of his participation
in one of these programs

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.820
and our program was able
to get a revisor revoke

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.120
and get out much earlier.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.190
I was walking at a Labor Day
parade waving at the people

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.430
in the sides of the parade,
and suddenly out of the corner,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.600
as I walked by one
section up on a hill,

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.930
I just could hear someone
yell out, "Humvee."

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.710
And as I looked over, I saw a
man sitting there by a woman

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.060
on the hill with his thumb up.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.720
And I ran -- thumb --
giving me a thumbs up.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.380
I ran up and it was Mike and he
was doing fabulously well and

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.680
yet we had allowed
him this opportunity.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.910
Or John, who was two inches
short of killing himself

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.830
with a shotgun as
he said if he was --

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.760
if he had another two
inches of length in his arm,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.590
he would have been dead.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.730
Came to our facility and
progressed so significantly

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:46.070
that at one point, he was free
to leave on a parole to a bed

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.780
that parole was providing
for him,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.570
but a bed that we were
going to provide him

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.000
through Veterans
Affairs was not going

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.460
to be available for
another month.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.000
By God, he stayed with us
for another month in a place

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.430
of incarceration because he
knew he had a bed and a facility

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.480
that would be fitting
for his treatment

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.810
and we had a bed following that
for the treatment of his PTSD.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.570
He stayed in jail an extra
month in this program.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.870
These are the stories
that you hear.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.880
Last year, the Washington
Examiner asked Pinal County

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.480
Sheriff Mark Lamb about the
idea of veteran's units popping

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.810
up across the country.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.550
Mark Lamb is a border sheriff.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.490
He is as true cowboy.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.680
He's a pretty amazing man
and a pretty amazing sheriff.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.940
In that, he talked about a visit
he made to our facility just

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.030
to learn what we were doing
because he liked the idea.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.690
And this is a quote
from that newspaper.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.150
It's kind of funny because we're

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.580
like the odd couple,
said Sheriff Lamb.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.500
"He's a Democrat, liberal
from Massachusetts" --

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.230
I'm not sure that was
meant in the most fond way

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.780
down in Arizona -- "and I'm a
conservative, cowboy sheriff

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.740
out of Arizona, but
together, as sheriffs,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.850
it shows how we work
together across this country."

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.330
With these initiatives, we are
showing that veterans that,

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.420
while they are being held
accountable for their actions,

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.860
we also honor their service,
and as it is said in bridge

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.190
of the military, we will
leave no man behind.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.680
We show them that we will
not leave them behind.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.630
Now, it's my honor to
introduce James Wright.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.050
I will speak from a summary
of his summarized summary

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.690
because his accomplishments
are so significant,

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.590
it is really hard to get
them down on one page.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.150
Mr. Write joined the Marine
Corps at age 17 in 1957.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.100
He served three years and
then became the first member

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.000
of his family to
graduate from college.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.220
He went on to earn a
PhD in American History

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.900
and joined the faculty at
Dartmouth College in 1969.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.720
He served from 1998 to 2009
as the president of Dartmouth

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.600
and for the last 14 years,

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.590
he has been working
to support veterans.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.900
He has been recognized for this
engagement by the secretary

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.950
of the army, the commandant
of the Marine Corps

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.310
and the commander in chief of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.570
He also has returned to his work
as a historian, publishing books

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.000
that focus on those who serve.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.780
Those who Have Borne the Battle:
a History of Americas Wars

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.010
and those who Fought
them in 2012.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:17.190
And during Vietnam, an American
Generation and its War in 2017.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.510
It is my great honor to
introduce James Wright.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:35.850
[ Applause ]

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.160
&gt;&gt; James Wright: Thank you,
Sheriff, you're very kind.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.420
And I certainly want to add,
I know on behalf of everyone

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.730
in this room, a salute to
you for your own creative

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.730
and effective leadership
in support of veterans.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.790
It's really quite
impressive what you've done

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.530
in Middlesex County.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:58.730
I'm pleased to be here to have
a chance to join Karen Lloyd,

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:03.120
Frank Lara on this program.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.120
I thank them for their service
and for their continuing work

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.120
on behalf of veterans.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.200
I applaud the commitment
of the Bureau of Prisons

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.680
and the National Institute of
Corrections to veterans issues

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.310
and I commend the report
that Bernie Edelman

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.250
of Vietnam Veterans of America

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.840
and that organization's
Incarcerated Veteran's Committee

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.130
have done.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.690
I look forward to the panel,
chaired by Jonathan Elias

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:39.480
with his special commitment to
telling the stories of veterans.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.680
It is an impressive group of
panelists who daily engage

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.570
and work to resolve
these issues.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:53.210
My special thanks to Bernie
Edelman and to Greg Crawford

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.650
for their service and for
their lifetime commitment

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.740
to serving those who served.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.450
They have made a
difference and they're not

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.150
yet finished making
a difference.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.150
Greg, thank you for all
you've done to help organize

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.040
and pull together this program.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.610
I also want to acknowledge
our hosts here today,

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.900
the Library of Congress.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.920
My personal thanks
to Karen Lloyd

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.300
and the Veterans
History Project.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.930
This is a very important
program.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.470
In my book and during Vietnam,

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.430
I acknowledge how
valuable they were

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.720
in providing personal
experiences

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.890
that enrich my account of those
who have fought in Vietnam.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.830
Special thanks to Megan Harris

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.200
of this project for
all of her help.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.990
Let me do a brief
personal account

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.490
because I think some parts of
it are relevant to the subject

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.690
that we're engaged in today.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:03.920
In the summer of 2005,
I made my first visit

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.090
to Bethesda Naval Hospital.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:12.650
The previous November, I had
been very moved and troubled

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:18.970
by the Battle of
Fallujah and Iraq.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.720
I thought about it a lot then.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.930
These were kids who
were the same age I was

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:25.540
when I was in the Marines.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.260
These were the same age
of students that I saw

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.050
on the campus of Dartmouth,
indeed the son of friends

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:37.440
of ours and across the river
in Vermont had been killed

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.910
in Fallujah, a local Marine.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.440
And I thought I wanted to
reach out in some way to those

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.590
who were serving and a good
friend, a retired marine, said,

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.190
"Why don't you go down to
Bethesda Hospital and visit

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.490
with the Marines there?"

00:24:53.490 --> 00:25:00.250
I did in the summer of
2005 and since then,

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.740
I've been to Bethesda,
Walter Reed over 30 times

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.720
to visit with veterans.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.530
I haven't been there
for a few years.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.470
There are not as many.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:14.410
The wounded veterans pipeline
has slowed significantly.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.670
When I would go to the
hospital on my pattern,

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.970
it was always the same.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.510
I would go bed-to-bed

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.650
and I would ask the
patient what happened.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.320
And, you know, I never once
encountered anyone and you --

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.970
those of you who
know Walter Reed know

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.290
that these were the
most seriously injured

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.150
and wounded in most cases.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:41.610
I never had anyone balk at
telling me what had happened.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.700
And then, I would engage
them in a conversation

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.320
about their future - about
what they hoped to do

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.620
and I kept reminding them,

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.230
"You have a great
future ahead of you.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.320
Let's think about
what you might do."

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.250
And I would ask them about
their own educational background

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.550
and plans.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.850
And I would try to
encourage them

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.840
to continue their education.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.730
I assured them that that already
demonstrated their discipline,

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.320
their commitment to
serving and now they needed

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.610
to prepare themselves for
the rest of their lives.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.310
They still had so much to do --

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.260
so much more that
they could contribute.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.380
I was able to set up an
educational counseling program

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.120
with the American
Council on Education

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.550
at Walter Reed Bethesda.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.910
And I went out and
raised the money

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.810
to get funded --
to get it started.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:37.400
And nearly 12 years
later, it is still in place

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.410
at Walter Reed now under
the Semper Fi Funds [assumed

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.560
spelling] organizationally.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.570
A few years after that,
I was able to work

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.660
with Senators Jim Webb, and
John Warner, and Chuck Hagle

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.610
on the post-9/11 GI bill.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:58.510
We had a meeting over at
the Senate office building

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:02.860
in February of 2008.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.430
And I encouraged them
to be sure to include

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.590
in that legislation
something that ended

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.250
up being called the
Yellow Ribbon Program

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.600
because that provided an
opportunity for private schools

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.890
to contribute money of their
own to match that of the VA

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.000
to make certain that private
schools were an option

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.180
for these veterans.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.700
And last year, the Congress

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.120
with bipartisan anonymity
approved an extension

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.950
and expansion of
that legislation.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.410
It was very important and I
think everyone needs to know --

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:41.790
everyone needs to recognize --
that legislation such as this --

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.700
legislation such as the G.I.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:49.710
bill, this is not a "Thank you
for your service" gratuity.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:55.610
It may provide an
incentive to serve.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.070
That would be good.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:01.630
It may provide immediately a
fully deserved acknowledgement

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.130
of having done so
-- enabling veterans

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.430
in their transitions
back to civilian life.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.880
But it is also an investment
in the future of this Republic.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.870
What a resource these
veterans can provide

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.160
if we can enable them,
and encourage them,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.510
and provide them the
opportunity to pursue it.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.240
The ranks of the American
military today are filled

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.940
with volunteers.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.860
They do not represent the
nation demographically.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.870
They tend to be more
rural than urban,

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.160
more heartland than coastal.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.460
They're largely from blue
collar middle class backgrounds

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.930
and they tend disproportionately
to come from military families.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:54.630
They constitute less than
one percent of the population

00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:01.510
and these 21st Century wars
are the first extended wars

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:07.010
in American History with no
designated tax to help pay

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:11.440
for the wars and no
service requirement

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.320
for citizens of this country.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.120
So, much for George Washington's
reminder that it is necessary

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.300
to go to -- if it is
necessary to go to war,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:27.990
all citizens should report
this with their treasure

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.370
and with their service.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:35.460
Not anymore, not for these wars.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.730
These veterans can come home and
spend a good part of the rest

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.410
of their lives helping to
pay off the debt of the wars

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.640
in which they thought
and the vast majority

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.330
of us go on with our lives.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.850
Those who serve in these 21st
Century wars are the best

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.580
educated of Americans
to serve in any war.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.040
They are better educated than
their age group as a whole.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.320
The Armed Forces expect at
least a high school education

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.750
and that's a good,
positive step.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.200
But, you know, we all know
unfortunately a high school

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:19.520
education is insufficient
in this modern economy.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:24.780
The recent pattern of veterans
having higher unemployment rates

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.060
than non-veterans has
been largely the result

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.670
of their educational background
rather than a negative judgment

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.690
on their military service.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:38.220
The parents and the grandparents

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.970
of the current veterans came
home from World War II, Korea,

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:47.020
Vietnam and if they
did not use the G.I.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:53.110
bill to pursue an education,
they could pretty much count

00:30:53.110 --> 00:31:00.350
on getting some good jobs at a
local factory, a mill or a mine.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:04.370
And they could really
count on knowing

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.950
that if they worked hard,
they could probably have

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.430
that job until they retired.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:15.040
And then, when they did retire,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.210
they would have some
pension plan to help them.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.250
Let's face it.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.180
Those opportunities are
far more limited today

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:29.170
and there is far less likelihood
of that lifetime security.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.290
The Post 9/11 G.I.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.670
bill offers them an opportunity

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.620
to set a course for
their future.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:43.240
But, you know, I learned
early on in my conversations

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.890
that while it is essential to
provide the financial support

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:51.450
for veterans to continue their
education, there was a prior --

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:56.450
an often more difficult
counseling need and this was

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:00.500
to encourage them to
do this, to assure them

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.580
that they could do this.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:09.640
While nearly all of those who've
joined the voluntary military

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.500
may be high school graduates,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.020
most of them did not take
college preparatory courses.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.180
They probably have not taken
standardized ACT or SAT exams.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.240
They often feel unprepared
for higher education and some

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.910
of them may not be ready.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:35.530
But I have no doubt that
they all can be ready.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.010
Counseling and convincing
them of this is essential

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.850
as is follow-up support
to encourage them

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.070
to pursue and to succeed.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:49.280
You see, we have
a national need --

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.080
an obligation to try to
encourage all students

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.020
who have never been encouraged.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.520
They can do this.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.790
And this is where those
young men and women

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.430
with military experience
can draw

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.540
on some greater self-confidence

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.080
if we can remind them
why they should have this

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.380
greater self-confidence.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.110
You know, there's another part

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.850
of the American military
experience --

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.380
of any military experience
that we need to understand.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.960
All of the children in
this country really --

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.430
human beings across the
world learn as infants

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:36.330
to remember two pretty
constant things.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.970
One is to lookout
for themselves.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.370
Avoid any threatening risks.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.900
Don't go there.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.220
Don't touch that.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.940
Look carefully.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.240
Be cautious.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:56.290
And they're also told
not to harm others

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.490
and the latter is more
than parental guidance

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:04.640
as it is emphasized under threat
of law, as well as moral code,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.470
and religious teachers
teachings.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:11.890
Do not bring harm
to other people.

00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:15.020
Think of a very small
fraction of our citizens

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.020
in their late teens
and early twenties.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.320
When they're mobilized
for war --

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.080
[ Coughing ]

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.380
-- they're told they have

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.650
to suppress these fundamental
instincts and principles

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.470
when the situation demands.

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.620
They must be willing to put
themselves in harm's way

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.400
without question or
without hesitation.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.790
[ Coughing ]

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.090
"Go there and do it."

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.440
They go and do.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.960
They don't stop and
reflect on it.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.460
"This looks dangerous."

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.760
That's not their job.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.100
They're told to go.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.260
And they must be willing
to bring harm to others --

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:59.700
lethal harm without any
delay, any opportunity

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.870
for moral reflection,
"Should I be doing this?"

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.460
This is their assignment.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:11.370
Now when they return to civilian
life, they are told to return

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.490
to their first rules --

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.730
to forget that which they
have just learned and to wipe

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.590
from their memory
contrary experiences.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:24.100
Obviously, in each of these
instances, this is impossible.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.160
The vast majority of
combat veterans do return

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.630
to civilian lives successfully,
but they never forget

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.100
that experience that they had.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.270
It's a difficult transition.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:44.370
Some do not return as
successfully as others.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:48.050
And indeed, some of
this group are a matter

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.330
for our focus today.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.100
We need to know the
experience of war from those

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.720
who were there before we can
begin to understand it --

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.210
to know how profound
this experience is,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:06.950
how contrary it is to everything
they've been taught and learned.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:12.720
As a Vietnam veteran,
army combat photographer,

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:17.210
a friend Dick [inaudible]
recently described it.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.800
"They risk their lives.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.700
They face terror.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.870
They lose buddies in battles
and then they come home

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.160
where they have to square what
they had to do as warriors

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:32.220
with what they are now expected
to do that they are home.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.520
It isn't easy."

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.630
Veterans who are in prison for
committing a crime face many

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.830
of the same problems
that non-veterans face

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.290
in transitioning back

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.690
to civilian life
following their release --

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:52.530
problems of employment,
of acceptance,

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:56.910
of reentering American society
while encountering suspicion

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.040
at every turn.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.460
And finally, of avoiding
recidivism --

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:09.810
this path is harder to avoid if
individuals encounter a society

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.340
that has little confidence
and a good outcome.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.390
These problems may be
compounded for veterans

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.120
who have been released.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:24.190
They confront dual and
reinforcing stereotypes.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:27.830
The current Ban the
Box initiative

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.260
to encourage perspective
employers

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.770
and college admissions
applications

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.940
to discontinue asking questions

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.800
about criminal convictions
is an interesting effort.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:46.120
It's reminiscent to me of
Vietnam veterans in the 1970's

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.880
who came home and didn't
acknowledge their military

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.210
service on job applications

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.050
because they thought
this was something

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.700
that would be far
better for them

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.340
if their employer didn't have
to say, "Were you a veteran?

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.640
Were you at [inaudible]?"

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:06.150
and ask some of the most foolish
questions you could imagine.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.920
We've, we've come a
great distance medically

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.930
since posttraumatic stress
disorder was recognized

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:18.840
as a clinical disorder, but
that journey is not over,

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.470
and the distance
remains even greater

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:26.290
in accomplishing
social acceptance

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.820
of this mental health condition.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.490
The mental, the medical
and the legal recognition

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.650
of PTSD has been so important.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:37.380
We discuss is more openly now.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.620
But you know I also
worry that this talking

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:48.010
about it more openly ironically
has buttressed another cruel

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:54.310
stereotype, that of the
socially unhinged veteran.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.830
The Vietnam veterans

00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:01.740
in the 1970's came
straight into this headwind.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.470
And they encountered
movies such as Taxi Driver

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.860
and Apocalypse Now,

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:13.540
which deranged psychotic
veterans emerged.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.170
The 1970's were not kind
to veterans coming back

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.310
from an unpopular war.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:23.000
In the 1970's on one episode

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.830
of the popular television
show Kojak,

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.830
Telly Savalas confronted
a series

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.470
of brutal homicides
in Manhattan.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.560
He told one of his
detectives to find

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.630
out if there were
any Vietnam veterans

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.370
in the neighborhood
of the crimes.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.460
Think of this.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.010
Are there any Vietnam
veterans there?

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:53.860
PTSD is a companion of
all wars, redevises,

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.510
but this was not
even done diagnosed

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.570
as a clinical condition
until 1979.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:05.410
Before that, veterans with
problems were categorized

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.140
as suffering from
the Vietnam syndrome,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.790
as if it were an
isolated condition of what

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.280
so many other veterans thought

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.610
of as this whining hippy group
coming back from Vietnam.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:24.100
World War II veterans, their
parents' generation told them

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.510
to grow up and get over it.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.320
They said we did.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:34.720
But of course, not
all of them did.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:40.130
It was called combat
fatigue or shell shock then.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:46.110
The Vietnam veterans spoke of
nightmares becoming day-mares.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.290
One said to me, if
those other people had

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.490
to spend just one night inside
my nightmares they would fall

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:57.030
to the floor with
tears in their eyes.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.580
But you know these
veterans endured

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.220
and they have contributed so
much to our national life.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.480
One thing we've learned is
that veterans will speak

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.140
about their experiences
more candidly and more,

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.530
more personally with
other veterans.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.060
Some of the best counseling
sessions involve a group

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.090
of veterans sharing
their stories

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.190
and encouraging one another.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:26.300
If post-911 veterans
have not had to contend

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:32.260
with the same nasty degrading
stereotypes in popular culture,

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.460
they still have too often to
encounter wisps of the fear

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.290
and prejudice that remain.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.890
And here they're reinforcing
fear and prejudice and suspicion

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:47.120
that confronts the ones
where former convicts

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.270
and veterans can be
even harder to escape.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:54.760
If this is their
difficult assignment,

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.490
I have confidence in them.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:01.100
But our society has
a role as well.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.810
We still need to thank them for
their service and recognize this

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:09.780
as not a condescending
throw-away gratuity.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.250
They need a hand, not a
handout, they need a hand.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.940
We need to recognize what
they did on our behalf,

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.810
even if they have
stumbled since.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.050
They have much to offer.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.910
You know Americans today
do juggle their views

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.130
of the current generation
of veterans.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.210
They applaud them when
they're introduced at events.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.000
They call them all heroes.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.810
And yet they're also
a little bit uneasy

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.630
around them sometimes.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.260
We all need to know them better.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.800
We need to understand
who they are,

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.340
what they've endured,
what they want to do.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:55.330
These veterans have worked
effectively with others

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.950
of different backgrounds.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:01.660
They've assumed responsibility
and accountability.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.170
They function in
complex organizations

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.910
and in an advanced
technological environment,

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.090
and they've confronted dangerous
situations while respecting

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.480
people of different cultures.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.600
They have learned
discipline and restrained

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.780
in self-confidence
and tolerance.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.230
They have observed, and
they have themselves offered

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:28.800
sacrifice for a greater good.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.720
I'm impressed by the options
that sheriffs and wardens

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.820
such as those speaking
here today.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.990
Officers such as
Sheriff Peter Koutoujian

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.820
and his Middlesex County team.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:47.340
Captain Malik Muhammad of
Orange County, Florida.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.720
Ron Perez of the San
Francisco Sheriff's Department

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.330
that have created
to help veterans.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.610
Judge Michael Jackson
and his initiative

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.050
in providing veterans
courts, Semper Fi Judge

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.980
and thank you for
what you've done.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.070
Their counseling and the
specialized living unit's

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.940
that some have developed
allow veterans to connect

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.570
with each other, remember they
are more comfortable talking

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.910
to each other.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:22.290
It's an essential step towards
their reconnecting with society

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.650
but that's the society
that sent them to war.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.820
The report which
is released today,

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:32.770
and this gathering addressed the
value of programs such as these,

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:36.620
these veterans have
met their obligation,

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:41.070
now we have an obligation
to reach out to them.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:45.080
They will benefit from
our support of course.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.610
As we all have already
greatly benefited

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.420
from all that they have done.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.670
And we and our society will
be the better if we are able

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:57.670
to help them to succeed.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:01.220
It is truly a win-win.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:06.620
We are all ahead if we
can help them to succeed.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.910
Maybe it's too much
delayed, but now we need

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.870
to say delayed reciprocal
we've got your back,

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:17.040
now we want to help you.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:23.250
I'm going to hand off the stage

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:27.130
to our moderator,
Jonathan Elias.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:30.360
Mr. Elias is an award-winning
journalist and the host

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.050
of WJLA's Salute to Veterans.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:38.050
He's an instructor at the Army
War College, and he's passionate

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:40.950
about veterans' issues.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.820
Before that, I believe we
have a brief video message

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.070
from Evan Simone, an attorney

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:48.250
at the Harvard Law
School's Veteran's Law

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.020
and Disability Benefit's Office.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.510
Thank you for participating
in this program today.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:46:07.510
[ Applause ]

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:15.070
[ Music ]

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.370
&gt;&gt; Evan Simone: Hello.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.800
My name is Evan Simone.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.720
I'm an attorney here at
Harvard's Veteran's Legal Clinic

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.320
where my main duty is to
find underserved veterans

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.320
in the community and assist
them with legal issues.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.070
Today the National Institute
of Corrections has recognized

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:35.390
that veterans' treatment
courts are one method

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:39.540
of assisting veterans who
are in conflict with the law.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.620
However, it's important to
realize that only a fraction

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:46.280
of veterans are eligible for
veterans treatments courts.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.640
Many of them will not
be able to participate

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.350
in diversionary document
or alternatives

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:56.870
to sentencing and confinement.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:02.690
NIC has focused on this
phenomenon of veterans' dorms,

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.640
sometimes they're called pods,
sometimes they're unit's,

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.950
sometimes they're
veterans blocks.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.990
What these are our reserved
spaces for veterans to live

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.750
and interact with one another

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:17.940
when they're confined
in prisons or jails.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.070
And NIC has, has illuminated
that these programs lead

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:25.270
to many pathways to
positive intervention.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:29.780
These programs draw on the
veterans' sense of pride,

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.580
and they adhere to values

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.910
that they still have
embedded in their [inaudible].

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:38.580
These programs promote
responsibility for others

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:42.950
in much the same way that
these veterans work together

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.570
in military units.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.580
These are counterparts to
veterans' treatment courts.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.060
Corrections professionals who
are responsible for oversight

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.910
of inmates more often
than not attest

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.800
that these specialized unit's
for veterans promote safety

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.120
and good order in
institutional settings.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.050
And while careful
consideration should be given

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:11.750
to the specific format for a
program, it's vital to realize

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:14.720
that most correctional
institutions already have the

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.940
essential elements to put
these programs in place.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:23.740
We're talking about the
space to put veterans

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.660
in proximity to one another.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.130
We're talking about
corrections professionals

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.110
who themselves have
military experience.

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.720
We're talking about the
paint to put up slogans

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.100
and reminders of
military service.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.600
We're talking about time.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.980
The commodity of time to
reflect deeply on the manner

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:47.150
in which military service has
affected veterans' behavior.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:52.090
And we're also talking about the
time to seek important benefit's

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.470
that will help in the future.

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:57.450
I'd like to thank those who
serve this country in uniform,

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.960
and especially I'd like to thank
those who continue to serve

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.160
by helping justice involved
veterans reintegrate

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.980
into our communities
as productive

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.820
and restored citizens.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:17.090
[ Music ]

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.390
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias:
Well good afternoon.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:21.050
That's all you got really?

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:23.030
We need a seventh inning
stretch around here?

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.130
I became involved with
the military going

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.690
on two decades now.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.380
And early on I was
recognizing returning Purple

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.680
Heart recipients.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.740
I just thought for me I
wanted to say something

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.870
because I knew a lot of friends
of mine that were veterans,

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.890
and maybe they got beat
up or bruised or scarred.

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:43.050
And I noticed that
the spirit was intact.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.670
Their bodies may have been
bruised but their spirit,

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.060
and I wanted to celebrate
that spirit.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.740
And I'll never forgot
this one time,

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.190
we would just have gatherings
of just strangers come together

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.700
and say, thank you for your
service and welcome home,

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.490
because the transition
from military

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.160
to civilian is very difficult.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.690
And I had a 23-year-old core man
come up to me, good looking kid,

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:02.670
you know, and he looked
buttoned down on the outside.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.190
And he said, you know
why are you doing this?

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.510
And all of a sudden,
he started to tremble

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:08.080
and shake and started to cry.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.430
And then he just gave me this
hug and it was like holding

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:13.180
like one of my little kids
after they'd gotten scolded

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.480
where they're just shaking.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.870
And I just sat there
and held this kid

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.260
and we just talked for a while.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.140
And he asked me again,
why are you doing this?

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.560
And I said, well
because everybody should.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.140
And then it got me introduced
to the whole idea of what PTSD,

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.200
this window dressing
of this buttoned down,

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.180
good-looking kid
was really a veneer

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.290
to something much more painful
and something much more deep.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.360
And we -- when we spent time
talking, he explained to me

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.540
that war is its own language.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.150
And that the language of war
is one where there is pain.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:42.690
When you're having a bad day,
maybe you get scolded at work

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.460
and you get the boo-boo lip
because your boss didn't

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.760
like something you did.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.060
When they have a bad day,
they've gone through the birth

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.700
of a child, sitting in
some fob in Afghanistan.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.460
You have a bad day,
maybe you got a ticket

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.760
on your way to work.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.160
When they have a bad day, they
step on something that goes boom

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.520
and their lives are
forever changed

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.970
because they're losing
their legs or their arms,

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:00.110
their ability to do anything.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:04.150
Their language of war is so
impossible for us to speak,

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.530
if you've not walked or marched
in a battlefield with brothers

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.590
and sisters at your side, and
suffered the loss of somebody,

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:14.080
it's impossible for you to get
your head around that language.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.380
And then they come home.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.610
And that language is
still fresh in their mind.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.270
That's the language they speak.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.690
And yet here they are
on our streets trying

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.490
to function as normal citizens.

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.910
It's a very difficult
transition.

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:28.000
It used to frustrate me that the
military didn't do a better job

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.350
of transitioning.

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.030
But as was explained to
me by a marine colonel

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.800
who is a very good friend, and
he's incredibly smart, he said,

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.900
how do we transition
somebody from learning

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.720
in introducing the language
of war, and then going

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.520
to a civilian language
once again?

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.550
So, it's incumbent upon
all of us given the fact

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:46.350
that these are people who
have given our lives for us,

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.270
they have selflessly
decided to sign up

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.610
and go serve a greater
purpose than themselves,

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.910
they're doing it for country.

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.210
The least we can do
is pay them back.

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:56.860
So, when he said to me, you
know, why are doing this?

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.160
And I said, everybody should.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.460
Well let me just
introduce to something.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.880
There's 41,000 plus agencies,
nonprofit's out there,

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.740
that are doing things to help
better the lives of veterans.

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.370
In addition to that, we have
leaders within our community

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:11.920
that are sitting off to my left
here that are trying to help

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.400
when they come back, and
they suffer from PTSD they,

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.760
all of them have scars.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.060
Those heal.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.840
The wounds never heal.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.540
The wounds stay with
them forever.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.160
Some will be able to adapt
and get back into the light,

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.010
and just try and forget it
and put it in their past.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.050
And others make bad
decisions along the way

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:30.400
and they find themselves
in the courts

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.470
as we discussed last year,
and when it gets worse,

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.020
they find themselves
incarcerated.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.580
So, do we owe them something

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.430
when they find themselves
making a bad decision,

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.730
getting incarcerated?

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.030
You bet we do.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:42.330
I think everybody in
America, if you ask them,

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.070
listen these are people that
went off and fought for you.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.400
Do we owe them something?

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.420
Yes. And as Mr. Wright
said, it is not a hand

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.720
out that they're looking for.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.090
None of them would take it.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:51.710
A hand up is really all
they're looking for,

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.350
just to get back on their feet.

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.300
What I'd like to do with our
panel is I'm going to ask them

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.600
if they could, briefly,

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.620
last year went a little crazy
we got ten-minute dissertations.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.490
I just want 60 seconds,
please introduce yourself

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:05.480
and tell us what it is you are
doing right now, in 60 seconds,

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.820
and then we'll start
the conversation.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.590
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford:
Thank you Jonathan.

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:09.890
My name is Greg Crawford,

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:11.210
I'm with the National
Institute of Corrections.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.450
I'm going to say some
thank yous to the group.

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.430
I want to thank the Library
of Congress and Karen Lloyd

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:18.510
and Andrew Hubert for again
bringing us back this year.

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:21.040
I do want to thank those
that have served our country

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.630
in uniform, and also those
that continue to serve,

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:26.620
whether you're a law enforcement
officer or correctional officer

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.430
at a jail or a prison,
or a probation officer

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:30.770
or somebody working
at a veterans court,

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:32.070
thank you for continuing
to serve,

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.690
and also the veteran
peer mentors.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:40.120
I served in the Air Force,
but it did shape my life.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.490
It helped create
structure and discipline

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:44.310
which was much needed,
just ask my father

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.510
and my mother at the time.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:48.740
But it helped also
lead me into working

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.300
in the criminal justice system.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.860
I started working
in mental health.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.180
I worked three years
in mental health

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:57.250
and it shaped my philosophy
to working with people.

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.610
You can't treat a piece
of the person you have

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.310
to treat the entire person and
that's why I think these types

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:04.430
of programs, veterans'
courts and programs

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:06.810
and local housing units for
jails work so effectively,

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:09.060
is because you're, you're
treating all of the person.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.110
I want to thank James Wright
for being here today for giving

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:13.560
such a wonderful
key note speech.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.190
Peter Koutoujian, Sheriff
Koutoujian thank you

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:17.490
for being here today.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.950
And also, Frank Lara
whose stepped

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:21.350
in for Mark Inch, Director Inch.

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:23.480
Even though he is not here
today I want to thank him,

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.590
because quite frankly without
his support we would not be here

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.260
today, and we would
not be releasing this

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.560
publication today.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.980
So, if you're listening,
thank you.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.710
I also want to thank
the National State

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:35.970
of Corrections leadership for
supporting veterans' initiatives

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:38.260
and for being here today.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.900
We started with veterans'
treatments courts,

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.520
a second chance for
vets who lost their way,

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.820
that's why we were
kind of here last year

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.400
and this year we're
releasing another publication

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.840
and I'm honored to pass it
off to my colleague here,

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.170
Bernie Edelman who offered
both of these publications.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.470
Bernie.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.920
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: Let's
see if I can do this in 59.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:02.390
I'm [inaudible] Brooklyn,
graduated college, got drafted,

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:08.170
spent most of 1970 in
Vietnam, that changed my life.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:11.350
I was not a combatant, I
was a broadcast specialist,

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:12.750
combat correspondent.

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:15.920
Spent a lot of time in a
hospital, spent a lot of time

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.630
with a civil affairs unit.

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:20.340
Still changed my life.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:25.570
Came back, got a career,
certain things never left me.

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:27.500
Participated in a
Vietnam art show,

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:32.360
brought it to New York
City, which is my hometown,

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.790
and I was named by
Major Koch to serve

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:38.080
in the New York Vietnam
Veterans Memorial Commission.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.790
As a result of the
memorial we did,

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:45.180
we did the book Dear America:
Letters Signed from Vietnam.

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.780
Became an HBO documentary
of the same name.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.990
Since then, I became
the Mayor's Office

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:59.080
of Veterans Affairs Director
under Ed, first public health,

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.910
public official to put his
money where his mouth was

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:03.540
when it dealt with
Vietnam Veterans.

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:07.210
I've been down here
for 15 years now

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:09.110
with Vietnam Veterans
of America.

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:11.350
Which is one of the
most activists

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:14.620
of all the veterans
service organizations.

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:18.650
I'm Deputy Director for
Policy and Government Affairs.

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:21.440
Technically though,
I'm a lobbyist.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.880
Thank you.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Jackson: My
name is Michael Jackson,

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.710
I'm from the Cleveland
area, and I'm a judge

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.590
at [inaudible] County
[inaudible] court.

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:35.440
I ran as a veteran and
was the only veteran,

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.580
am presently the only
veteran on our bench.

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:44.940
In the Vietnam War after my
college graduation I joined the

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:48.600
Marine Corps and was a first
lieutenant commanding a company

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.200
and a second lieutenant
commanding a platoon.

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.220
Came back, went to law
school, married the love

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.400
of my life who is here today.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.800
And practiced law and decided I
wanted to be a judge at the end

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.100
of my career and I wanted

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.850
to start a veterans'
treatment court.

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.150
Three years ago, we had
one veteran and now we have

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:09.320
over 100 veterans in my court.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:13.720
And we started a jail pod
connecting our veterans court

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.440
with those in the county
jail and look forward

00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.250
to exchanging some of
those views this afternoon.

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.190
&gt;&gt; Malik Muhammad: Good
afternoon I'm Malik Muhammad

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.500
from Orlando, Florida.

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.800
I'm currently employed

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.790
by the Orange County Corrections
Department and I've been there

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:28.580
for the last 19 years.

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.200
I am retired military, I
retired in January of this year.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.010
The first six years of my
military career was spent

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.260
on active duty, and
the remainder was spent

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:40.220
as a reservist out
of Orlando, Florida.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.110
And on behalf of my
chief Corinda Riley

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.320
and our Mayor Theresa
Jacobs I bring you greetings

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.100
from Orange County
Corrections Department.

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:51.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: I guess it's me.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.620
I'm Ron Perez, I
too was drafted.

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.150
I'm a Vietnam veteran.

00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:00.490
I was drafted shortly after
high school, served in Vietnam

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:07.100
from August 1, 1967
till August 1968.

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.620
1975 I went into the San
Francisco county jail,

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:13.830
and I've been there ever since,

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.480
working for the sheriff
department

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.400
in their prisoner services
division, developing

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.290
and creating programs.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:24.800
I retired from the sheriff's
department approximately 2008.

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.750
Shortly thereafter, they
contacted me and said, "Ron,

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:31.610
remember that Veteran's Program
you said we should always start?

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:32.910
Well, we're going to do it."

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:36.400
So I came back on a consulting
basis and did development

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.280
and implementation
of the program.

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.090
We started out program in 2010,

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:48.130
2013 because we had showed we
had a significant population,

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:50.040
the veteran's court started.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.250
Our program is called COVER.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:56.880
COVER stands for Community of
Veterans Engaged in Restoration.

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.180
That name was --

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.600
-- was the idea at brain trial
of our veteran service officer,

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.740
our sheriff at that time.

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:10.580
Loved having programs
that had little --

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.190
nice little tippets that went to
him like, sheriff work furlough,

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.630
and sheriffs work
alternatives, so when he --

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:18.510
and he loved restoring justice.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:21.760
And when he heard
community of veterans engaged

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.580
in restoration, he loved it.

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:27.650
Part of the reason
it was called COVER,

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:32.280
the officer from veteran service
office was a retired air force

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.490
military, and you all know,
if you were in the military,

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.110
you can't leave billets
without your cover.

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:40.610
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Good
to have you out here.

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:43.090
If you're not familiar
with how --

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:44.390
is anybody in the
room not familiar

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:47.100
with how the correction
system works?

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.010
Good. We don't have to
waste a lot of time.

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:51.330
So you know when you're in the
corrections -- and I had --

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:53.560
my wife worked at one
of worst -- it was --

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.790
The New York Times dubbed it
the most violent institution

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:57.720
for youthful offenders
in the free world.

00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.020
So I was really happy
when she'd [Inaudible]

00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.200
after work every day, there was
[Inaudible] out in California.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.520
And it was a absolutely
horrible place.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.320
Very well run, and immaculate,
I mean you'd look at it

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.780
and think it was a
mall when you drove by.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:11.400
But when I went in and I
took a tour, I remembered

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.040
that there were movements done

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.820
from certain sections
of populations.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.850
They literally had to separate
the populations for fear

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:19.150
that they would be violence.

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:20.720
And they were all
pretty much high risk,

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.090
because they said
anybody between 18

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:25.710
and 25 was probably the
most violent, or most likely

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:28.040
to offend in a population.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.680
And that's what we're talking
about with most of the veterans.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.410
We're talking that age group.

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.320
So when they go into prison,

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.510
you would think it would be a
no-brainer, that you'd segregate

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:38.360
that population perhaps.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.660
And then you say
to yourself, "Well,

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.440
why would they separate --
segregate that population?

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.090
What is it about the
veterans population

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.560
that needs segregating?"

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.860
So let's put that to the panel.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.660
Why is it a good idea to
segregate the population

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.440
of veterans that find
themselves incarcerated?

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.390
What is it that's going to come
from that, is it productive?

01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:00.090
Is there a chance that perhaps
you'll put them on the path?

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.890
What is the reason for
segregating that population?

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:04.190
Anybody, please.

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:05.610
&gt;&gt; Judge Michael E. Jackson:
Well, I think the basic reason

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:09.620
for doing that is that there's
something about being a veteran

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.850
that is different and separate
from those who have not served.

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:16.510
And to place veterans together,

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:20.520
you're recreating a
shared military experience.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.480
And from my experience, it
doesn't matter if the person was

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.380
in combat or not, served
early or served late.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:31.100
But that shared military
experience.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.820
Other veterans understand.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.660
And the veterans in our county
jail say the same thing that all

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.670
of the veterans in
the publication

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:41.640
that you'll have the
opportunity to read,

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:47.160
say in other jails throughout
the country, is that it's safer,

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.160
it's quieter, it's more
peaceful, they don't fight.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.760
If they do, they
solve it themselves.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.280
And they respect
each other in a way

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.140
that because they've all served.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.760
They may not like each other,
but they do respect each other

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.490
because of that service.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:10.350
And they end up helping
each other in that regard.

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:12.690
And for those who
have drug addictions,

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:17.320
or mental health addictions
or issues, particularly PTSD,

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.100
being in a quite safe place,
even if you have to be there

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:26.060
in jail, is much better
than the general population.

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.860
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: So I had -- I
went on a few of the site visits

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.010
for this publication, and
I just want to kind of add

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:32.630
to what he said, judge.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:37.430
Another really good thing for
this is the efficiency of it.

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:40.060
One of the folks
mentioned, in king --

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.850
in Seattle, was the fact

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.990
that the VA could
come-in in one spot.

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:48.150
People could come into one
spot and talk to people,

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.830
rather than bounce
around the different parts

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.240
of the correctional facility.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.140
So I think efficiency, and
having those resources all

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.420
in one spot makes
a lot of sense.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: And it also
helps your outside agencies,

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.520
and also it makes it easier
for them because they know

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.130
that they just have
to visit one facility,

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:07.020
and they know they can call
and check and make sure

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.420
when they're coming out to
do the intake on the veteran,

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.530
that the veteran is
there, not in court

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:13.320
or being moved somewhere else.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.620
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Have
you spent a lot of time

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.320
with the inmates that
represents this population?

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.770
Do you get a sense
from some of them

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:21.980
that they should have been
some sort of intervention?

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.050
What I found from working with,
especially those who came back

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.920
with PTSD, is that
a lot of times,

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.500
they just needed a friend.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.460
A lot of times they come back
and they feel isolated, lost,

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.340
they feel that language
that they learned overseas,

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.640
they don't speak it anymore,

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.940
nobody in their family
understands it,

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.470
so they just shut down.

01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:40.260
Is that often times
what you find?

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: We still have
a significant population

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:45.220
of Vietnam air veterans
in our jails.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.830
And quite often, very often,

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.600
they'll say this
is what I needed

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.810
when I came home from veteran.

01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:55.250
Something like this I would
not have spent my entire life

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.520
in the criminal justice system.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.820
&gt;&gt; Captain Malik Muhammad:
And I've heard similar stories

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.040
in Orange County, we have
veterans that talk about,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.340
"If these programs
would have been

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.140
around when they
first got out, maybe,

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.440
just maybe they would
not have ended

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.740
up in the criminal
justice system."

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.920
So again, it's a benefit
of having them there,

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.800
and I also believe
it starts to process.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.460
When you have those
veterans together.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.570
One of the things the military
taught us was comradery

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:15.870
and the espirit de corps.

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.710
So by placing all these guys
in one dedicated housing unit,

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:21.460
you start that treatment
process for recovery.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.810
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Let's talk
about resource for a second,

01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:24.340
'cause everybody
is so keenly aware

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.680
that everything cost money.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.740
This doesn't strike
me as any program,

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.660
like I know the middle
six, sheriff was talking

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.170
about the kinds of
things that they've done.

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:34.380
This is just redirecting,
as opposed to trying

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.140
to acquire more money
or a budget

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.440
to put something together.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.820
This is just about
redirecting resources, right?

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.050
This isn't something that
could be cost prohibitive.

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:43.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: For us in San
Francisco, we're extremely lucky

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.000
because we've had sheriffs
for the last thirty years

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.730
that have concentrated on the
development of re-entry services

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.560
for all prisoners in the jail.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.510
So, we were able
to tap into a lot

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:57.940
of already developed programs,

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.210
tailor them specifically
for veterans.

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.820
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: And if you
can do it in San Francisco

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.120
with no extra money, then
it can be done anywhere.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: That's correct.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.720
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Let me
ask you the same question.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.380
Is this something you're
finding that you can do by just,

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.510
maybe talking to few folks,
redirecting some assets

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:14.890
and not necessarily putting
more on the budget line?

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:16.190
&gt;&gt; Captain Malik Muhammad:

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:17.490
We did exactly the same
thing down in Orlando.

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.740
We were able to start our unit
without using any addition

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.390
or physical resources, because
we had a physical plan --

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:23.690
space available.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.450
And we had a good
program in place,

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:27.120
it was relatively
easy transition.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.640
So I want to let you guys know
that it's not a hard process,

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.070
and you can do it without
spending a whole lot of money.

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:34.430
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: And I
want to make the point

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.460
that I think the first thing you
ought to do if you're thinking

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.600
about this is identify
your population.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.120
Find out how many people you
actually have in custody,

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.040
and you know, data will drive
a lot of your decisions, right?

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.340
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Judge,

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.640
do you find that to
be an effective tool?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.940
&gt;&gt; Judge Michael E. Jackson:
It's exactly the same.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.780
It was easy to convince -- in
our jurisdiction, I'm a veteran,

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:55.340
the sheriff is a veteran,
the deputy sheriff who was

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.650
in charge of us is a veteran.

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:59.090
We both came to this
idea the same time,

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:00.390
we just weren't working
together.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:03.160
We talked to each
other and we started it

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.310
within I think sixty days
after our first meeting.

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.650
It's just reorganizing the jail,

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.590
and finding a spot
that's suitable

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:14.480
in the confinement facility.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.570
Training your guards to deal
with veterans differently.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:21.260
Many of the sheriff deputies
and the corrections officers

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.400
who are veterans wanted to
participate in this project,

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.010
in the county jail,
because they were veterans.

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.860
Some were upset because
they were doing it.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:34.400
But by and large, most of the
veterans wanted to be involved

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.780
because they sensed that
these veterans with some help,

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.130
would be on taking the
first step towards recovery.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.030
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: And we'll
talk in a second about the kind

01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:46.170
of pitfalls that you might run
into, that might be helpful

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:48.160
to somebody, maybe somebody
watching live and they have

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.970
like a jurisdiction out there
that they've been thinking

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:51.270
about it, but haven't done it.

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:52.850
Let's get to that in a second,
but talk to me for a second

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:55.360
about the characteristics
of veteran inmate,

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.850
are they a different population?

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:00.440
Because you have some folks
that are just chronic criminals,

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.770
life-long criminals, and
these people are not going

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:04.130
to be fixed or cured
of anything.

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.430
Well, when veterans come in,

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:06.830
do you get the sense
they've just made a mistake,

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:09.020
they made bad decisions,
they can be put back

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.340
on a path quickly, is it an
easy adjust or what is it?

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: Veterans
seem to fit

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:20.490
into a jail setting rather
naturally, because of the fact

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:26.430
that your jails and prisons
operate some semi-militaristic,

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:29.530
with inspections, with
line-up's, etcetera,

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.160
with work detailed,
structure, exactly.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:39.210
So a veteran coming into the
jail system can fit very easily

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:41.490
into that system,
and a lot times,

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.190
what we found before we
started our veterans program,

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:47.310
is the best workers in the
jail that were identified,

01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:50.180
were often veterans, and
veterans who had come back

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:53.880
into jail, "Oh, there's Gunny,
he's going to run the kitchen."

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.430
We see that quite often.

01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:56.730
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: So
they feel plugged in.

01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:58.210
They feel like they
have a purpose?

01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:59.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: Yep.

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:00.970
They can follow the
orders, they, you know,

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.720
they've got the structure,
get up at a certain time,

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.270
go off to your work
detail, come back,

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:09.160
here's your phone call
time, here's your meal time,

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.730
here's your nap time,
and so it makes --

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:15.410
it's much more easier than
the world they were living

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.840
in on the outside where
they lost that structure

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.620
and lost that comradery.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:20.920
&gt;&gt; Greg Crawford: Just
something that Jim mentioned

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.080
in his introductory
remarks is reminding them

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.840
of the confidence
that they once had.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.850
And I think that's an important
point that I think this kind

01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:32.670
of programing does for veterans,
is it kind of gets their sense

01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:34.830
of self, you know, purpose back,

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:36.130
and I think that
that's what it does.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:37.580
It get's their confidence going.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.350
&gt;&gt; Captain Malik Muhammad:
It kind of reacclimates them,

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:41.200
back to that military
life, because jails

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.870
and prison are traditionally a
para-military type organization.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.960
So being in that
environment reacclimates them

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.130
to what they were
once accustomed to.

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:50.790
Also, by placing
them in position

01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:53.210
to where they're working for the
jails and doing various things,

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:55.610
it gives them a sense of pride
and a sense of leadership.

01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:57.690
And also, you have
that belongingness

01:08:57.690 --> 01:08:59.060
that they often times seek.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.830
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: But anytime
we send somebody way to prison,

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:02.990
the hope is, in the
back of the minds is

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.320
that justice would be served,
that they'll learn their lesson

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.750
and they'll come
back into society.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:10.370
Do you get a sense from veterans
when they do make bad decisions,

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:13.250
find themselves incarcerated
that they are a population

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.820
that is much higher at perhaps
going back and reacclimating

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.130
to public life by learning
something from prison?

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:22.430
Are they successful

01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:25.320
as candidates coming
out of incarceration?

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.750
I don't know, I'm asking you.

01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:31.070
&gt;&gt; Judge Michael E. Jackson:
Well, in many of the prison's,

01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:35.150
particularly in Ohio, I think
it's pretty much nationwide.

01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:38.360
The veterans in prison
have organized themselves

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.580
and they've been permitted
by prison authorities,

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.970
allowing them to do this, to
set up very similar operations

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.760
than -- as we're talking

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.580
about with the veterans
in the county jail.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.080
So if you go to a
number of prions in Ohio,

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.930
you'll see a veterans pod there.

01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:59.580
Some of them are even working
towards doing productive

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.550
business while in
prison, it's authorized.

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.560
And they have their
own discipline group

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.250
among themselves.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:10.360
And they are transitioning
to the community

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.920
by having people come in.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.920
In fact, one of the veteran
service organization the AMVETS,

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.870
they even have chapters
of AMVETS

01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:23.420
or like American
Legion, VFW, in prisons.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.600
And so they are a member
of a veterans organization.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.510
So it's not as if it
doesn't go on there.

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:31.120
So hopefully when they
transition out, they'll have

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.410
that foundation that they can
recreate, and live productive

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:38.710
and law-abiding lives.

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:43.170
The connection in the jails
also is worthy of note,

01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:45.610
when you connect with a
veteran's treatment court,

01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:49.420
so I would get those people from
the veteran's pod in the jail,

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.830
put them in a veteran's
treatment court program,

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:54.650
where they have four stages
that hey have to go through.

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:58.880
And when they graduate, they
have the ability, we hope,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.300
to be self-sustaining.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.600
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: What
kinds of mistakes are some

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.670
of these veterans making when
they come back, when they decide

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:08.050
to make bad decisions and
find themselves incarcerated.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:10.570
Because I know we have the
court system that was setup,

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.910
we talked about last year.

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.460
Which tries to kind of intervene
and get in between some

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.760
of those veterans
that are coming back,

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.630
that have just made minor
infractions in the world

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:19.130
of the criminal justice system.

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:22.090
Some of this though, I mean,
this are very serious charges

01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:24.040
that they probably will
never see the light of day.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: Sometimes it
can be something as simple

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:30.650
as not being in compliance
with their medication.

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:37.690
We had an individual that came
into our system, was a captain,

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:42.170
a rogue scholar, a
West Point graduate.

01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:44.920
When he got out of
the military, he went

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.480
and got himself a little plot
of land in Alaska that butted

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.180
up against the forest, and
everything was fine except

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:55.060
when he came back to visit
family in the bay area.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:58.090
And he got himself
into a situation

01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:02.690
where he should have been
dealt with psychiatrically,

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:05.620
but instead wound
up being jailed.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:09.270
He came to our attention,
we weren't able to get him

01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:11.870
into cover because of
his psychiatric issues,

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:14.600
but we were able to get
him into veteran's court,

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.330
get him stabilized,
and it was determined

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.510
through veteran's court that
the best thing to do would be

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:23.670
to get him back to his
community, back into Alaska

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:27.500
where he had veteran
services already in place.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.800
We were able to do that.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.180
We had one of our veteran's
court, mentors fly back

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:36.490
to Alaska with them, and his
veterans court status has been

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:38.040
transitioned to Alaska.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.010
He's still having difficulties,

01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:42.220
but it was the best
place for him.

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.230
And again, he should
never have been

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:46.450
in the criminal justice
system, he should have been

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:48.650
in the mental health
system, but got caught

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:51.190
up in criminal justice.

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:53.740
But because of the
efforts of having COVER,

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:58.350
having veterans court, he's
not perfect, but he's stable,

01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:01.570
and he's living day to day.

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.480
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: Sheriff
some of your examples?

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.780
&gt;&gt; Captain Malik Muhammad:
I was going to say that,

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.720
just like the technical
violation that he mentioned.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.520
Sometime I've seen them come
back for self-medicating,

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.820
if they don't take care

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.160
of the substance abuse issue
while they're in custody

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.790
and get the right treatment.

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:16.760
Sometimes, when times get
tough when they're realized,

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.770
they tend to self-medicate
and find themselves back

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.250
in custody due to
something as minor as,

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.970
let's say, failing a drug test.

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:25.310
&gt;&gt; Judge Michael E. Jackson:

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:27.330
I think all of the veteran
supreme court judges

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:31.980
and those involved with
helping veterans while in jail,

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.500
all recognize that there
are a number of veterans

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.380
who draw some pretty
serious charges.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.730
And one of the things that
we have to distinguish is,

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:44.200
holding those -- that
induvial, veteran or not,

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.690
to be accountable
for their conduct.

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:50.790
The part that comes into play
that's effective for veterans is

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:53.210
that to the extent, we can,

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:57.020
we couple that with a
treatment situation.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.990
So, I just had a case
a couple of weeks ago,

01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:03.110
where a veteran had a flash
back, he was combat veteran,

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:05.920
Iraq, had a flashback,
as I mentioned,

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.880
three police officers
were injured.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.640
None life threatening
to my knowledge.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.500
The three officers asked for --

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.530
were given the opportunity
at sentencing

01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:19.710
to say what they wanted to
happen to this individual.

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:21.180
One said, prison.

01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.470
One said, judge it's up to you.

01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:26.680
And the other said, most
definitely probation.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.870
The person who said probation
was a combat veteran.

01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:35.590
And he understood what was
going on with that veteran,

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.960
with regard to a flashback.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.740
And so as a treatment
court judge, I have to make

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.720
that decision with regard
to being accountable

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.980
to that conduct,
which was serious,

01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:51.420
but also make him
available to the services

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.100
that I think would help him.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.260
In his situation, he's
going to be confined for up

01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:58.770
to nine months, maybe a little
bit less if he does well.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:00.620
But he's going to be in the
veteran's treatment court,

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.510
and he's going to be in the
veteran's pod, and he's going

01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:08.040
to have access to some
treatment during those process.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.340
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Elias: One
of the biggest issues,

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.640
especially with those
veterans coming back with PTSD,

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.860
especially being in the new
business we're keenly aware,

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.250
this is domestic violence, the
numbers are just astronomical.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:18.080
It has to go back -- it
goes back to the language

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.310
that I was discussing earlier
about the language of war

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:22.250
when you come back, you don't
speak the same language.

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:24.300
And the language in a
relationship is much different.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.530
There's an intimate -- an
intimacy with a relationship

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.830
of understanding another person.

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:29.960
But that side of
veterans, especially those

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.200
who have seen combat, or
they've been affected by war

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.860
in such a meaningful way,
that shuts down in them.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:38.330
Breaking through those
communication lines,

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.820
this is one of those
opportunities,

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.120
and unfortunately
it comes to prison,

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.420
and that's what we're talking
about with this setting.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.960
But in that setting where
you have other veterans,

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.260
they become a support group.

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:48.760
But it almost -- I think it
breaks everybody's heart hearing

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.690
the fact that they have
to go to prison in other

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:52.940
to find the support group
that ultimately can help them

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:54.460
on the road to recovery.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.050
Is that right?

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:57.440
&gt;&gt; Judge Michael E.
Jackson: Absolutely.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.760
I interviewed all 22 people
in our jail, I talked to them,

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.340
I did an interview,
before I came out here,

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.140
and all of them said essentially
the same thing that's

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:07.860
in our publication.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.690
They use this as a support
group amongst themselves.

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:13.200
And so, they really
are helping themselves.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.220
And one of the veterans came up
to me and said, "You now, judge,

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.230
couple of vets were bad rapping
you, and I had to talk to them."

01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:22.010
I'm not quite sure what he
said to them, but one of them,

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:25.510
he said, he didn't think
the punishment was right,

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.920
and the other vet said, "Well,

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.400
you have four positive tests
for, you know, drug use.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.060
What did you expect?"

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:37.040
So, they can have
that conversation.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.220
And they can talk it out.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.520
And whether it's right or wrong,

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.660
or whether my punishment
was too hard or too lean,

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.070
they have an avenue of talking
it out among themselves.

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:50.460
And they can hear other sides
and that doesn't generally go

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:54.670
on in the population as I think
many other sheriffs could attest

01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:56.040
better than I.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Perez: And I
just wanted to add,

01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.790
you touched on domestic
violence.

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:03.620
Our program, we have
a component --

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.180
that sheriff's department had
this component quite some time

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.350
ago resolve to stop
the violence,

01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:12.020
and anti-domestic violence,
anti-partner program.

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.760
It's been adopted -- had been
adapted, actually, by the VA

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.800
and is being provided in
San Francisco to veterans,

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.970
and on the outside,
it's called, 'At-Ease'.

01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:27.660
We have a component in our COVER
program, we call it stand down,

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:31.480
but it talks -- it deals
with the male world --

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.310
belief system and violence,
and addressing that.

01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:39.310
But it's geared toward veterans.

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:42.230
And I believe it's probably
the first one in the country

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:45.680
to be started specifically
for veterans on dealing

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.060
with domestic violence,
'cause again, that's something

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:52.810
that they VA, up until this
point has not been looking at.

01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:57.620
&gt;&gt; Bernie Edelman: You now, it
strikes me that we feel so good

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:02.560
when folks come back from a tour
of duty whether it is in Iraq,

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.700
Afghanistan, or Vietnam, they
are greeted by their family,

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.640
and it is supposed to be
wonderful at least it is

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:13.490
in the opinion of the eyes
of people who see that.

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:16.180
There are an awful lot
of guys who come back,

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:18.210
they haven't got no family.

01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:19.800
The family is dysfunctional.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.020
They have been dysfunctional
for years.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:26.360
Their family were the
brothers and sisters they had

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.960
in a combat situation.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.920
All of a sudden,
they find themselves

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.110
without a support group.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.630
They start drinking or drugging.

01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:40.670
I know of one guy, he was
a crew chief on a medevac,

01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:43.320
a medical evacuation helicopter.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.140
He would slush through
blood every day

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.960
that he was in the air.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.670
He came back, couldn't talk,
got married, couldn't talk

01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:59.480
to his wife, upstairs of
a bar, and for10 years,

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.470
he drank himself into
oblivion every night.

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:06.440
He started having
flashbacks on his way to work

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.500
when he got a different job.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.230
His life was all but stuck.

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:14.170
Nobody told him he had
anything wrong with him.

01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:16.560
He knew there was
something the matter,

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.120
but he didn't know what it was.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.590
We took a long time before
there was an intervention

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:26.680
and he started getting health
[inaudible] and one of that is

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.400
through the vet centers,
which were one

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:34.040
of the most successful
operations of the VA.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.610
We [inaudible] of
the VA to keep that.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:40.600
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
So, talking about, you know,

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.990
I wish there was some way
to improve from active duty

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.550
to the VA Services,
there is a gap.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:50.080
I hate that sometimes with the
first opportunity to intervene

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.740
in someone's life is involvement
with the justice system.

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.390
So, one of the things
that I am really--

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:58.380
this publication folks is on
housing units for local jails,

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.450
and if you think about the
continuum of criminal justice

01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:02.240
between the community
and law enforcement,

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.680
jails and vet courts,
and prison and re-entry.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:05.980
I think what is really
important,

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:07.320
even though this
publication focuses

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.030
on housing units it also
promotes collaboration

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:12.810
between entities within the
criminal justice system.

01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.730
I think what is really
important for us to think

01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:18.030
about is people are considering
implementing these programs

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:21.390
as partnering with other parts
of the criminal justice system

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:24.120
because you can not
only share resources

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.780
but you can improve outcomes
if law enforcement is talking

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.770
to the vet court and that is
something that I have seen

01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:33.860
on the newest project
that we are working

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.990
on around law enforcement
officers responding to veterans

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:39.850
in crisis overseeing
a sheriff, detective,

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:42.860
or a detective assigned to a
vet court, and there is a link

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:46.300
between the housing unit, the
vet court, and the community,

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.300
and I think Judge Jackson has
done a good job of communicating

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:51.690
between the local jail
and his vet court.

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:52.990
He was instrumental
in setting that up,

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:54.380
but I think that that is
something that is important

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:57.520
to think about is not just
focusing on your own peace

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.820
but look branching out

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.630
and communicating
within your system.

01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:01.930
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I think most who are going

01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:03.710
to hear this has said this is
a great idea in kind of one

01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:05.010
of those no brainers in life.

01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.780
The question I have is why
wouldn't every correctional

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:11.960
house, whether it's a
small local jurisdiction

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.260
or even a big federal unit,

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.900
why wouldn't they
institute this kind

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.450
of program and do it right away.

01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:18.640
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I can't really think

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.630
of a reason why they wouldn't,
but I can share with you

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:22.330
from experience that
when starting up,

01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:24.120
the hardest thing
is just getting buy

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.930
in from the stakeholders
that currently work there,

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:28.810
the public, and your
administration.

01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:30.940
Those are kind of your hurdles
when you are initially trying

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:34.280
to start a program and once
you get those accomplished

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.960
or over those three hurdles, I
think it is a little bit easier,

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.150
but again I can't really
think of a reason why

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:41.610
that we wouldn't look
at helping veterans.

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:45.070
I say that because not
just because I am a veteran

01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:47.830
but at some point, those men and
women that may be in the units

01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:50.670
that are [inaudible]
uniform, they wore a uniform

01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:53.150
and they decided at some point
they were going to protect us

01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:55.050
and I think for that
we still owe them.

01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:56.350
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
That is such a great point.

01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:57.650
I just want to quickly
point out that

01:21:57.650 --> 01:21:59.850
if you are running a vet court

01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:02.120
or you are running a housing
unit, it's really important

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:06.740
that you track data-- that you
justify why this programming is

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.040
so important.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.050
We all know anecdotally
that these programs work

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.930
and they are effective in that
we are reducing [inaudible],

01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:14.900
but if you are listening out
there and you are in charge

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.130
of your dataset, make
sure you are tracking this

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:18.430
and reporting it back

01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:19.730
and letting us know
how effective these are

01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:21.030
so we can keep building it.

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:22.630
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Let me
ask you as a general population,

01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:25.250
how well do veterans do if,

01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:27.010
let's say this program
didn't exist,

01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:29.570
nobody was instituting
it, and you start veteran

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:30.870
with a minor infraction

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:34.040
in general population,
what happens to them?

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.080
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
From what I have read

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.720
and from what I have discussed
with folks and interviewed,

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:44.680
again in general
population, they don't do well

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.010
because there is no
support system there.

01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.610
They don't want to fight
without the guys [inaudible]

01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:51.680
because you want
to fight with them.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.870
You need to have something
where you can depend on someone

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:58.170
where you can watch his six
and he can watch your six.

01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:01.170
It doesn't happen in gen pop.

01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:02.610
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
And if they come

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:06.730
into general population and
don't receive any services,

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.250
they are going to leave
without any services

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.830
and without any direction
and they are probably going

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:16.020
to be back very, very shortly
or at least with a program

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:19.910
such as this you are at least
making them aware what services

01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:22.010
are available, you
are making them aware

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:24.960
of what benefits they are
eligible for because a lot

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.010
of times you will find that
the veteran doesn't realize

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:30.520
that he is eligible for any.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.420
Veterans, especially
if they have less

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.810
than an honorable discharge,

01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:36.570
they think that there is
nothing available to them

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:37.900
when that is not true.

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.200
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Let
us talk about the pitfalls

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.570
because there are some
jurisdictions probably,

01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.170
after watching right now,
saying, oh, I would love

01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:45.020
to do it, but this is
going to be a hurdle.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.270
Talk to me about some of the
issues that sort of stood

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:48.990
in the way that you
quickly overcame

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.710
and how you overcame
those pitfalls?

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:53.070
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
The biggest issue

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:55.650
for us was probably
classifications.

01:23:55.650 --> 01:23:58.040
Getting classifications on board

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:02.290
because obviously
classifications is a real key

01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:05.260
part of it because
they determine whether

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.400
or not the individual
has any gang history,

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.070
what his sophistication
is, and a lot of times

01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:15.830
that is how an individual
is housed, and for a veteran

01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:17.960
if he has got some
things in his background

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.640
that could exclude
him programming.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:24.520
So, if you have classifications
on board,

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.170
they know that it is a veteran,
you could look at that veteran

01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:33.100
on a case by case basis, why
did you have these gang ties,

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.060
can you put those gang ties off
to the side, are you willing

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:39.560
to participate in treatment.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.690
And for us in California,

01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:44.470
now they have what is
called milestones credits,

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:48.740
so whether you are in county
jail, whether you are in prison,

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:52.890
for your participation and
any treatment or any type

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:55.230
of programming that is
going to give you time off

01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:57.800
of your sentence,
so that is another.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.100
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.400
Lets quickly get
some thoughts shared.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.700
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: I was
just going to say just getting

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.460
by in from the staff there
unless you want to start

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.810
in the program depending on
the number of veterans you have

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.430
in your organization to
get some form of push back.

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:10.850
That pushback can be in the form

01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:12.460
of some veterans
actually thought

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.100
about establishing
a housing unit

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.380
that would somehow
diminish their service.

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.470
Once you do buy in and
do training with them,

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:20.240
they quickly realize that
there are some benefits

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.470
in there of having a program.

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:28.870
&gt;&gt; Judge Jackson: I think the
staff issue is the main thing,

01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:31.460
training the staff, making
sure they understand it,

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.580
and also convincing
people outside community

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.460
and inside the jail facility

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:38.570
that these veterans are
not getting a break.

01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:43.190
They are being put
together because, one,

01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:49.850
there is less problem, less
time they are going to be spent

01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:53.890
in confinement and reduced
privileges and you are going

01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:58.300
to have necessary fewer guards
involved in guarding these vets.

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:03.890
So, there is an advantage that
can be assessed that will be

01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:09.100
of benefit to the veterans
and to the jail facility.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.220
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I think for anybody

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:16.340
who reads this publication,

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:20.660
a lot of those answers will
be found here, what you have

01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:24.430
to overcome, what you have to
think about when you want to set

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:28.110
up a specialized housing,
call it whatever you want,

01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:31.290
for what do you have
to really consider,

01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:33.490
and if you have objections,

01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:37.550
how do you overcome those
objections, and realistically,

01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:40.240
most of the objections
can be overcame

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.780
with just speaking
rationally and dealing

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.550
with any problems,
if they come up.

01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:45.850
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Okay.

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:47.150
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Great.

01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:48.450
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I kind of want to talk

01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:49.750
about the publication as well.

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:51.050
We want to encourage books
that read this publication.

01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.720
There are four examples of
positive things happening

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.210
in jurisdictions
across the county.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:57.590
These are ideas for
you to consider.

01:26:57.590 --> 01:27:01.590
We structured this publication
around design, development,

01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:03.330
implement, and sustain.

01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:05.240
There are examples from
each of these books along

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.180
with King County,
Seattle, Washington,

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.840
and the HUMV Program
of Middlesex County.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:12.220
Each of these folks, I
know would, if you reached

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.580
out to them, they would gladly
talk to you about, you know,

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.850
the successes, the
challenges, the lessons learned,

01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:19.810
but a lot of that
stuff is in here.

01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:23.280
Contact me at gcrawford@bop.gov
and we can have a conversation.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.930
Any of these folks here will
gladly give you their time.

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:28.230
Thank you for joining us today.

01:27:28.230 --> 01:27:29.530
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Thank you, John.

01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:30.830
It has been my pleasure.

01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:32.130
Anybody have any questions
before we say good afternoon

01:27:32.130 --> 01:27:33.430
to you.

01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:34.730
Any questions at all.

01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:36.030
No questions?

01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:37.400
Did a great job of
explaining to you all?

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.700
Thank you very much
for being here.

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.510
Thank you, guys for
being here as well.

01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:44.500
