00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.280
SPEAKER: So we're just thrilled
to have Kristine McDivitt

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.230
Tompkins here with us today.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.494
Kris is a fourth
generation Californian,

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:17.800
which is very cool.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.870
I am only a first
generation Californian.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.460
Maybe one day.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.480
[LAUGHING]

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.880
She is from a ranching
family whose life has always

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.610
revolved around a
passion for the outdoors.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.510
And when she was a
teenager, she worked summers

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.310
at what would become
Patagonia, Inc.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.920
And of course, after
graduating college in Idaho,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.250
she joined the company full
time and eventually, of course,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.800
became their longtime CEO.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.220
And she worked alongside
their founder, Yvon Chouinard.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.070
And in 1994, Kris
retired and married

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.410
climber-entrepreneur
Douglas Tompkins.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.030
He was the founder of North Face
and the co-founder of Esprit.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.830
And working together,
Kris and Doug

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.060
achieved some really
incredible results

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.170
in the creation
of national parks.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.860
And as you may know, just
on January 29 of this year,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.970
Kristine and Chilean
President Michelle Bachelet

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.180
joined forces to create
five new national parks

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.980
and expanded three
others, adding

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.070
a total of 10 million
acres of new national park

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.074
land in Chile, which
is truly remarkable.

00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:20.574
Yes.

00:01:20.574 --> 00:01:21.558
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:25.010
Cheers to that.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.130
So of course, truly an
incredible achievement

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.091
amongst many throughout
your great career,

00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.090
so we're really thrilled
to have you here today.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.720
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Thank you.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.220
SPEAKER: Let's dive in.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.580
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
All right, well, I

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.210
thought I would take all of
you on a very fast tour of some

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.900
of our work.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.120
I think I have 10,
15 minutes that I

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.530
can talk to you straight up.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.330
I'm going to get out of this
chair and move it to the side.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.370
SPEAKER: I'm going
to leave you up here

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.300
and I'll come back for a chat.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.883
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: All right.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.820
I thought the best way to
do this today is give you

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.700
a little bit of background
of Doug and me and how--

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.770
why was it that we
started out in business

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.960
and ended up where
we did, working

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.500
in the Southern Cone in
conservation and other areas.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.180
So I'm going to start off with
a little video that places you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.620
where we are as of
the last 60 days.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.608
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:28.087
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.506
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:07.847 --> 00:03:11.540
- It's the biggest deal
of its kind in history.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.930
This is an unbelievable
opportunity

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.146
for conservation and for Chile.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.030
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.850
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: There we go.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.350
So--

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.810
--how did we get
going on this path?

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.120
And I thought I would put
this picture up of Doug

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.800
and me back in the day in
the '60s, '70s, and '80s.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.570
Both of us were
climbers, ski racers.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.510
And through that
life, we obviously

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.030
developed a great
love for the things

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.010
seen and unseen about
the natural world

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.570
and really just a
world and a commitment

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.560
of having a wild life.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.790
Also, you guys are
probably too young,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.850
but I'm sure you've seen
photographs of the '60s.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.310
And we were
definitely influenced

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.579
by the activism that
sprang out of that decade

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.410
and ran into the '70s.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.510
And it became one of the clarion
calls to our personal lives.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.470
And surely, some of you have
been moved by these things,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.700
as well.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.750
That kind of ethos,
that kind of direction,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.700
really was one of the reasons
that the three companies

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.750
that we're associated with
developed the kind of ethos

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.620
that they did.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.300
And of course, Doug
with The North Face

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.630
and Esprit and Yvon
Chouinard, whom

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.950
I worked for for a
total of 25 years or so,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.940
they had different
products, but absolutely

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.340
a long list of things in common.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.710
In 1993, Doug had already
sold his portion of Esprit,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.890
and I was getting very itchy
as the CEO of Patagonia.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.010
I felt like I wanted
to do something else,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.210
but I wasn't quite
sure what it is.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.570
And then, Doug Tompkins
drifted into my life.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.810
And he had put more
thought and longer thought

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.200
into how might we
commit ourselves

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.470
to the things we love in the
third stage of our lives.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.050
And that ended up forming
family foundations

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.480
and basing ourselves out
of Chile and Argentina

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.380
between the United
States, focused

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.180
on building these big projects.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.950
So our foundation is
based on five areas.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.880
Conservation is probably the one
that we're most well known for.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.150
That's the conservation of
landscape and marine systems.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.060
And we'll talk a little
bit about that at the end.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.210
Restoration-- the
restoration of forest,

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.900
the restoration of grasslands,
the restoration of our minds,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.670
but also, the restoration
of extirpated species

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.720
wherever we're working.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.870
What is missing?

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.430
And we're going to
talk a little bit

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.980
about that in a few minutes.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.480
But re-wilding, the
idea of bringing back

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.230
species to those areas
where they had gone missing

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.620
became easily half
of our work today.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.630
Regenerative
agriculture-- as Doug

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.660
always says, if you don't
get agriculture right,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.380
you can kiss off the
rest because agriculture

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.410
is the greatest use
of terrestrial earth.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.800
It is unconventional
ag, toxic to the soils.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.440
We could talk about erosion
and all sorts of things that

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.280
are happening today and for
the last 100 years in ag,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.230
but we are very active there.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.970
And finally, activism.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.270
As Ed Abbey said,
"Sentiment without action

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.430
is the ruin of the soul."

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.720
So unlike a lot of
conservation groups,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.420
we take activism
very, very seriously.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.630
We believe that if
you see something

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.840
that is going and trending
in the wrong direction

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.000
toward your values,
that you need

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.130
to stand up and shake the tree.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.130
So finally healthy,
dignified human communities.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.960
We have a saying, "economic
development as a consequence

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.760
of conservation."

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.380
So where we work, we're
not finished with our work

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.100
until local communities,
provincial communities,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.190
and in some cases, the
national political scene,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.570
can benefit from the very
things that we're working on.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.100
And that's very long-term work,
but very satisfying and a must.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.990
So off we went.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.380
We based ourselves
outside of PumalÃ­n Park.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.420
This is in 1993.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.160
Big change from running
Patagonia and swirling

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.150
around the world.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.620
And that's where we ended up.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.050
This is the farm where we were
based when we were working

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.430
on PumalÃ­n.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.240
And it's a roadless
area, one of two only

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.550
between Fairbanks, Alaska,
and the tip of South America.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.510
And we were planted in
the middle of one of them.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.710
Big change.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:33.620
Over the ensuing years, we began
to put teams together and build

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.610
a kind of mental
architecture for what

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.669
could happen in these
regions, in terms

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.660
of conservation and working on
the other goals that we have.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.480
In the ensuing years,
this is what we've done.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.920
We have 13 national parks and
just over 13 million acres

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.040
that we have put in to
permanent conservation

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.990
in the form of a national park.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.910
That's what those teams
have been working on.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.730
We have a team here
in San Francisco.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.460
We have one in Chile, of
course, and one in Argentina.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.100
So why national parks?

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.160
When we think
about conservation,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.780
we get asked that
question a lot.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.180
Why didn't we just buy
the land, put a big lock

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.990
on the gate out in front,
and leave it alone?

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.390
And for us, first
of all, we grew up

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.080
in the national park system
of the United States,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.570
which is a big part
of our culture.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.870
You don't think about it so
often, but there they are.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.660
And if you took them away
in the United States,

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.630
you'd find yourself lacking.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.120
You'd find yourself wanting
them back and defending

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.310
those national parks.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:48.380
They create a kind of
image for a country

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.780
that helps define who
we are as a nation.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.090
But more importantly, we look
at it as a democratic move.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.230
If we close off this,
the millions of acres

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.740
that we acquired,
and nobody comes in,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.320
it's like owning a
Picasso and you hang it

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.160
in your living room.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.280
And you and your family can look
at it and maybe some friends,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.000
but that's it.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.270
If you hang it at MoMA,
millions of people

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.030
can see that Picasso every year.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:25.970
And that, to us, is essential,
that access, trails,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.610
all the things that go in with
national parks are available.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.900
So I'm going to take you
on a very, very speedy tour

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:38.930
through three of our parks that
each have a different ecotype.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:44.250
So starting, PumalÃ­n, as you
can see the little white box.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.580
It's on the Pacific
coast in Southern Chile.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.340
It's the first park
we ever worked on.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.580
And it goes from
the Andes at the top

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:02.060
of the Argentine border,
through 800,000 acres of forest,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.460
and down to the Pacific Ocean.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.810
We were famously called the
couple who cut Chile in half

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.670
when we first got going.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.910
And we were called a
lot of other things,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.160
too, but I won't go into that.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.680
So this park is just
over a million acres

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.190
and just declared
a national park

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.610
in February 27 of this year.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.810
The alerce trees-- there
are 30% of the last stand

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.110
of alerce trees in this
park, a first cousin

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.230
to the giant sequoias
here in California.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.820
A lot of flora and fauna.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.240
It's an impenetrable
forest, which has probably

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.110
been a benefit for it because,
otherwise, a lot more of it

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.030
would have been cut.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.430
It's also just an exquisitely
beautiful, wild place.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.770
And we have our own volcano
that went off in 2008

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.370
and created tremendous
havoc for us in cleaning it

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.870
up and reforming.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:06.480
Architecture in all of our parks
are always connected to place,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.120
so you never go to a
park that we've worked on

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.430
and find the same
style of architecture.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.340
In this case, it's a
Chilotan wooden style

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.900
reflected in bridges,
reflected in everything we do.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.730
So forests, rain
forests, and now we

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.510
move south to Patagonia
National Park.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.370
And we actually have one of the
longtime founder-types sitting

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.160
in the back row back there.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.800
This was started in 2004.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.100
It goes from the edge
of the northern ice

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:47.330
cap in southern Aysen
and has the Baker River

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.050
as its Western edge.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.600
And it's roughly--
well, no, not roughly--

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.310
764,000 acres, much
of which is grassland.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.690
It's considered to be one of the
biggest grassland restoration

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.580
projects in the
world, but I never

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.420
trust those kinds of statements.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.170
So I just say it's
one of the biggest.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.400
It's beautiful.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.840
It's emblematic.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.240
And it crosses the border--

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.430
it goes to the border.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.290
And what you're looking out
from the border in this shot

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.620
is Patagonia National
Park in Argentina.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.980
They're not yet contiguous, but
that would be a wonderful dream

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.410
to have them touch one another.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.775
Lots of animals there, some
you recognize, some you won't.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.780
This little guy is coming
back from having been

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.540
almost extincted from the area.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.750
So you have all these
little kinds of victories--

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.390
predators like mountain
lions coming back

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.710
once you stop persecuting
them, bird life.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.300
Everything begins to come
back as you take, in our case,

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.100
50,000 head of livestock
off this former ranch

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.050
and take all the
fences out, which

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.080
was nearly 500
miles of fence line,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.900
and you see the region begins
to heal itself with lots

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.430
of visitors every year.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.520
And this, too, was just
made a national park

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.270
at the end of
January of this year.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:27.070
A lot of wildlife
work in this park.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.540
Pumas are coming back.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.180
You have a deer nearly extinct.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.510
And this is a long
story, but I will just

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.190
tell you that I have often
found that the easiest

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.680
thing we've done is
actually acquire the land.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.220
And the minute the ink
is dry on the check,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.700
projects like this arise,
as they rightfully should,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.050
and they become the
challenges and headaches

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.960
and you hope a few
successes as you go along

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.550
in creating these
big protected areas.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.860
These are not guns.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.280
They're dart rifles,
and just to show you

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.040
a little bit about how
much work there is to do,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.470
besides creating just
the infrastructure

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.220
and acquiring the land.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.750
Another species reintroduction
here up on the border.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.460
And you can see the architecture
for this park reflects

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.280
Patagonia.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.040
It's actually an
English-style that

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.770
was settled by the English
who came to Argentina

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.490
and built the
railroads in the 1800s.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:36.190
And of course, any good
park has campgrounds,

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.200
has trails, and so on.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.840
And this is no exception.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.690
This I put in here because
this is an example of activism.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.160
There was a--

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.530
I won't go into the
whole story, but there

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.840
was a move to dam two of Chile's
most pristine and beautiful

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.830
rivers.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.380
It was an eight-year
fight, millions

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.420
of dollars spent, many, many
NGOs working against it,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.860
and truly, David and
Goliath, and finally, we won.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.510
And those rivers run free.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.230
So activism attached
to conservation, never

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.770
leave it far behind,
in my opinion.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.780
The third one,
IberÃ¡ National Park,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.640
1.7 million acres in the
Northeast eastern section

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.240
of Argentina, so cross
the border and go north.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.590
This is wetlands and
savanna grasslands.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.140
It's hot, subtropical.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.080
When we first visited there,
got out of the plane and said,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.230
let's get back in the plane.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.010
It's too hot here.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.890
There are bugs, and it's flat.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.850
And Doug insisted
and came back quietly

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.390
and bought it a month later,
the first piece of property

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.640
we started with.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.770
Because this is what he saw--

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.900
I missed it somehow--

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:05.089
the tremendous biodiversity,
an area that nobody really

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.660
knew that the province had.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.060
It was sort of
like no man's land.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.060
And we've come a
long way since 1997.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.660
And it is now a national park.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.690
So just some pictures
of what is there,

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.579
but then what is missing?

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.630
Within five years of
having arrived there,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:31.930
we began to realize that
species who were missing

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.880
had to be dealt with.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.340
You had to actively
figure out how

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.810
to bring them back,
which in Latin America

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.610
was really unheard of,
and most of the Americas.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.230
The jaguars were missing.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.990
Giant anteaters were missing.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.490
Tapirs were missing.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.350
Green-shouldered macaws missing.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:54.640
And so we committed ourselves
over the last 14 years

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.560
to start bringing them back.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.270
And all of the species
that you just saw

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:05.230
have been brought back with
the exception of the jaguar.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.350
We have adult jaguars, but
you can't release them, which

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.450
is another talk altogether.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.750
But suffice to say, where
there is someone missing,

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.820
we have committed that where
we work, by the time we leave,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.350
they will be back.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.380
So just a few shots
of what this entails,

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.770
working with the jaguars at
the jaguar breeding center,

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.520
and so on.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.560
So as we roll out of those
projects, we're still--

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.440
we are an ongoing team working
on new projects, one of which

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.270
is in marine conservation.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.870
These are the first two
marine national parks

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.960
of Argentina, something we
started just over a year ago.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.270
So lots to talk about.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.020
But I'm going to leave
it there, because I

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.710
think it's more engaging if
we get a very fast overview

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.980
and then start to visit.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.080
A lot of people ask
us why do we do this.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.490
We could just buy yachts
and go lay on the beach.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.040
Well, this is one
of the reasons.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:18.730
And this little guy, certainly
top choice, and generations

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.900
of humans in the future.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:26.530
We can't imagine that
it's ethical to leave

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:31.810
for future generations a mess,
which is the course we're on.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.350
And as Jane Goodall
says, "We are stealing

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.980
from our children's futures."

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.790
And so how do we work
against that trend?

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.240
That's really the
question mark upon us.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.993
So thank you.

00:19:47.993 --> 00:19:51.444
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.669
I'll grab my chair back.

00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:56.460
SPEAKER: All right.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:03.980
Thank you so much, Kris.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.969
That was such a
fabulous presentation

00:20:05.969 --> 00:20:07.260
and such beautiful photography.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.340
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: It was fast.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.910
SPEAKER: Yeah, yes.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:09.400
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Quick trip.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.720
SPEAKER: And now, we'll get
to dig in a little bit more,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.721
so this will be perfect.

00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.095
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Good.

00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:15.630
SPEAKER: So before we go
back to South America,

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.091
I wanted to bring you
back to California.

00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:20.340
You know, we mentioned that
you're a fourth generation

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.320
Californian, so I'd love
to have you just start

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.930
from the beginning, telling us
a little bit about how you grew

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.138
up and kind of where your
passion for the environment

00:20:27.138 --> 00:20:29.504
and conservation
really springs from.

00:20:29.504 --> 00:20:31.420
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
Well, as you said,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:37.860
I grew up on a ranch where my
great grandfather-- he founded

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.360
it.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.810
And my grandfather
was born there.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.000
Our father was born there.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.710
We were born there.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:49.450
So we were sort of hooligans,
as ranching kids often are,

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.590
and outside a lot.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.820
But I don't think that my
sensibilities toward nature

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.870
really started there.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.840
Maybe it made me more
comfortable in it.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.280
We moved to Venezuela when I was
eight years old for three years

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.990
and then came out of there.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.110
And that was probably
the first time

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:14.260
that I was exposed to so many
species that, as a Californian,

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.820
you'd never see.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.080
And they were right there.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.210
It was not in Caracas.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.250
We were way out in
the Orinoco Basin.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.330
I don't know.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.290
I think Yvon had a
huge impact on my life.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.190
I met him when I was 15.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:38.680
And once you get into
the climbing tribe,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.930
I don't think-- it's
like Hotel California.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.710
You never leave.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.156
[CHUCKLING]

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.680
And I would credit
Yvon with a lot

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.150
of what's happened in my life.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.120
My family was more traditional.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:58.600
And the ladies wore pearls
and not climbing ropes.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.444
So I think that he had
a lot to do with that.

00:22:01.444 --> 00:22:03.610
SPEAKER: Yeah, and I'd love
to hear more about that.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.110
That's what I was
going to ask you next.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.651
It sounds like you
guys met climbing,

00:22:06.651 --> 00:22:09.376
but I'd love to hear more
about how you guys connected

00:22:09.376 --> 00:22:11.500
and then, ultimately, what
brought you to Patagonia

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.572
and how you ended
up as the CEO there.

00:22:14.572 --> 00:22:16.030
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Well, I

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.430
was supposed to go to a
girls boarding school.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.290
And I swore to my
mother I wouldn't go.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.690
So I went to the local high
school and then realized I

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.240
didn't--

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.130
I don't know.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.990
Anyway, Yvon was
renting the house next

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.950
to our family's beach house.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.290
And there were a lot of
climbers around quite a bit.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.920
I had an older brother who was
sort of in with that crowd.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.410
And I was 15--

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.670
artists-- and in the
absence of a pull

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.910
toward my own age at
the local high school,

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.250
I started hanging out with them.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.690
And then, after my
first year in college,

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.990
my mother informed me during
the front end of summer

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.790
that, contrary to
my personal belief,

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.580
she was not my personal banker--

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.170
[CHUCKLING]

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.280
--and that I needed
to get a job.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.390
So I was worried.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.290
I didn't know how
to do anything.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.210
And so Yvon all said, why
don't you come work for me?

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.990
So I did.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.170
There were six people there,
just technical rock and ice

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.180
climbing equipment.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.840
And so we all wore
bathing suits to work.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.460
And I would peel the
labels off carabiners

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.180
from Germany or package things.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:37.790
And then for every summer
after that, it was a default.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.350
And then, when I
graduated from college,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.710
I had no idea what
I was going to do.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.300
And our family is very strict.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.480
The minute that your degree
touches the end of this finger,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.580
you're on your own.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.020
There's like a French guillotine
coming down, which was fine.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.310
We understood that.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.200
But I had no idea what
I was going to do.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.850
And so I just started
working for Yvon

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:07.250
full time, something I've
never regretted, obviously.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.560
You know, it was
all pretty organic.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.340
I think it's very different now
when you graduate from college.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.820
In your studies, you
have a direction.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.940
You have a-- you're
going somewhere.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.670
And in our family, you just
needed to go to college.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.660
Nobody really talked
too much about what

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.720
you needed to do after
that or preparing for that.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.050
And then, a year--
let's see, I was 22.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.680
So when I was 23,
Yvon decided, I'd

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.170
like to make some clothing
for climbers, for all of us.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:48.060
And that's how it got going
and that's how it is now.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.695
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:50.820
And then, what did your
trajectory there look like?

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.462
How did you go from labels off
carabiners to being the CEO?

00:24:53.462 --> 00:24:55.170
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Oh, you know,

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.640
it was so small,
starting at zero.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.750
And you did everything--
shipper, hand

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.550
labeling our little tiny
early catalogs out to whomever

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.470
had requested one.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:18.990
And I like running things.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.130
I mean, I see that now.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.690
I don't think I knew it then.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:28.160
But I think I just naturally
expanded what I was doing.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.140
And Yvon loves
working with women.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.240
He really-- he's very--

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.490
I won't say biased
in that direction--

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:44.530
but he's cognizant of that
and a lot of trust in me

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.520
and also Malinda
Chouinard, his wife.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.240
So if I was given
something to do,

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.000
I would grab onto it and I
wouldn't-- it's like a bone

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.380
for a dog.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.940
I grabbed it and I
didn't give it back.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.660
Maybe that's how.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.690
But I loved it.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:08.170
And I have a kind of
endless pit for taking

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.800
on stuff that's
especially difficult

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.642
or things that I didn't
know about heretofore.

00:26:14.642 --> 00:26:16.192
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:26:16.192 --> 00:26:18.650
And one thing I was particularly
curious to ask you about--

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.730
for me, I am such an admirer
and I'm sure many other people

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.400
in the room of Patagonia's
commitment to sustainability

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.842
and how that seems
like it's such a--

00:26:26.842 --> 00:26:27.467
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:26:27.467 --> 00:26:31.270
--excuse me-- core value of the
company through the products,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.360
through a lot of the campaigns
the company has funded.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.677
I'd love to hear you talk more
about how that ethos began

00:26:37.677 --> 00:26:40.010
and how you guys really saw
that as tied to the business

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.011
because it seems like it
really always has been.

00:26:42.011 --> 00:26:43.968
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
Oh, it's absolutely

00:26:43.968 --> 00:26:45.790
Yvon and Melinda Chouinard.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.770
Absolutely.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.460
If you pull a string
in anything that you

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.800
would find inside
the company today,

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.780
that string will lead
back to one of them,

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.560
whether it's child care
and Malinda's insistence

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:06.260
that we build that
population into our planning.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.450
The understanding of
the ecological crisis

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.190
in the mid '70s, absolutely,
they both were there at a time

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.450
when I had no idea.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.430
Rose Marcario, the
CEO of Patagonia,

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:28.660
is absolutely imbued and
very, very aggressive

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.810
about the company taking
a lead, whether it's

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:37.210
sustainability, or fighting
for Bears Ears, public lands,

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.820
you name it.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.010
The company is really
on the front lines.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.610
And I think that's
the value system

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:48.500
that we've had
since the beginning,

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.210
but it's absolutely clear.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.210
I just came from a two-day
Patagonia board meeting.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.780
And it's full of these
discussions about,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.800
how do you keep pushing the line
out, asking more of yourself,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:09.250
asking more of customers,
in terms of educating them,

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:13.930
and will they join us as
the lawsuit was placed

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.150
against the government having to
do with public lands and Bears

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.370
Ears?

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.090
And the response to those
things has been extraordinary.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:31.400
So they still run the
company as a means

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.130
to build the greatest
products, which has always

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:40.220
been Yvon's desire, but also
to use the company absolutely

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.760
as a mechanism to
change the world.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.970
And that has-- if I close
my eyes at a board meeting

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.300
and I listen to
Yvon speak, it could

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.170
have been 45 years ago
when we got going together.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.850
He is very consistent.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:01.730
And I think that's just an
extraordinary and unusual set

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.110
of circumstances.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.480
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.550
So you talked a little
bit in your introduction

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.180
about how meeting Doug Tompkins
had this big influence on you

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.780
and the next phase
in your career.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.738
I would love to hear you
talk a little bit more

00:29:14.738 --> 00:29:16.610
about that-- about
how you guys connected

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.830
and sort of what led you
to make this transition

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:19.730
into conservation.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.230
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
I'll tell you part of the story.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.021
SPEAKER: All right.

00:29:23.021 --> 00:29:23.832
[LAUGHING]

00:29:23.832 --> 00:29:26.040
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
I met Doug when I was 19.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.940
He was a climbing partner and
a very good friend of Yvon's.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:34.490
And he was a climbing partner
of my former husband's, as well.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:40.250
So the climbing community
is kind of small.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.220
Certainly back then,
it was a lot smaller.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.630
And I knew him since
I was 19 and knew him

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.040
during the Esprit days.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.900
And then, we sort of
lost track of each other.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.830
And then, I was down
in southern Argentina

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.950
with Yvon and a few other
people eating dinner

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:06.470
in this three dog town and
in walks Doug Tompkins.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:11.560
And that's where it started,
so it would have been 1990,

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.730
I think.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:16.170
And then, it was
like an algae bloom.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.010
[CHUCKLING]

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.040
SPEAKER: And was he--

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.310
were either of you already
working in conservation

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.022
or was it just really
an extension of--

00:30:22.022 --> 00:30:23.730
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: So yeah, Doug

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.810
was looking at the first
piece of property--

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.019
SPEAKER: OK.

00:30:28.019 --> 00:30:29.560
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: --second.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.470
Yeah, so he was on his way--

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.640
SPEAKER: Yeah, and what--

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.630
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: --in Argentina.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.880
SPEAKER: Yeah, and what made
you decide at that moment

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.589
that you wanted to make this
shift from having impact

00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:40.380
in the business world
through having impact

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.700
through your new work?

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.480
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Oh, well, love

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.530
had a lot to do with it--

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.326
SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:30:44.326 --> 00:30:45.950
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: --you know.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.820
If everything is built
on that kind of love,

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.260
then we'd be in great shape.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.330
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.800
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Timing.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:31:00.010
I think timing in life is really
40% of what happens to you,

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.730
good and bad.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.320
We sort of got
together at a time

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.860
when I really wanted
to do something else.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.950
I had started working with
Yvon when I was so young.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.450
And I was 40 years old.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.340
And I began to panic
that I would be there

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.950
when I'm 50 and
60, maybe even 70,

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.240
which is where I'm headed now.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.280
And I didn't know
what it would be,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.070
but I also thought
that the company would

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.540
benefit from new leadership.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.510
And so the timing
was perfect, really.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.647
That's how it happened.

00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:40.230
SPEAKER: And obviously,
you've already

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.660
shared with us a little
bit about the huge impact

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.369
that you guys have made through
conservation and your work.

00:31:45.369 --> 00:31:47.910
I was curious to hear you just
talk a little bit about what's

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.840
your feeling about
the status of land

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.780
conservation in general today?

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.770
How are we doing?

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.791
Are we doing enough
quickly enough?

00:31:59.642 --> 00:32:01.850
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
Well, the obvious answer,

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:04.656
are we doing enough,
using the royal we--

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.530
SPEAKER: Yeah, right,
exactly-- collectively.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.170
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Collectively no.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:16.370
I think, if you look at
just the raw numbers of area

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:25.670
protected or even in transition
versus the conversion

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.430
of the natural
world to production,

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.850
we're definitely
on the losing team.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:37.770
So I think that to use a
terrible militaristic metaphor,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.190
there is an army
out there of people

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:46.780
who don't want to see the
effects of climate change play

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.280
all the way out.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.680
There are millions of people out
there who really still believe

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.140
that development has to be
in balance with conservation,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.980
however that takes place.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:08.630
And no, we're not
moving fast enough.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.600
We can look at these numbers
that Tompkins Conservation may

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.580
be involved in,
but when you look

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:20.420
at the tsunami that's coming
in, then it feels quite small.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.130
Yeah.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.930
SPEAKER: And can you
talk a little bit more

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.429
about how you guys
ended up choosing

00:33:25.429 --> 00:33:30.306
Latin America as your
focus area for your work?

00:33:30.306 --> 00:33:32.680
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
Really, it started with Doug.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.590
He was a ski racer, as I was.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:40.060
And he used to train in
the off-seasons in Chile

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.230
and Argentina, as all the
teams did in those days.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.320
And he had no money, so he
would hitchhike around Chile

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.270
and Argentina every season.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.910
And that's how he began
to know the countries.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.000
And he really fell
in love with them.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.160
And then, in 1968, he talked
Yvon in, in two weeks,

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.520
to drive from San Francisco
to the tip of South

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.530
America surfing, climbing,
skiing off of volcanoes,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.460
and with the goal of climbing
this emblematic peak called

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.670
Fitz Roy in southern Argentina.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.360
And they did.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.790
And they were gone six months.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.550
And they did everything
they had planned to do.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.100
And when it was all
over, they sold the van

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.469
they'd driven down in and
came back to California.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:33.489
And it really set
something in their minds

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:37.600
about this place, which
in 1968 was really

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:46.480
kind of like a phantom, this
romantic, wild place on earth

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.060
that nobody really
knew anything about.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.219
And then, Yvon,
five years later,

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:53.830
decides he wants to
start making clothes

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:58.120
and he settled on
Patagonia as the name.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:05.530
So when Doug started looking
around to see where he would

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.330
work, at least
one of the areas--

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.274
because at the same time
we're doing all this,

00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:10.690
we're doing other
things, as well,

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.420
that aren't necessarily
directed at the Southern Cone.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.130
But the conservation side, he
just always had this affinity

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.470
toward it since he got started.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.940
So that's really the nut of it.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.790
SPEAKER: Well, that makes sense.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.950
And of course, we talked about
the incredible announcement

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.659
in January of the
10 million acres.

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:32.200
And you started to say a little
bit about marine conservation

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.329
is sort of a next frontier.

00:35:33.329 --> 00:35:34.870
I'd love to hear
you talk about where

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:35.860
do you want to go from here.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.485
I know you've already
achieved so much.

00:35:37.485 --> 00:35:38.902
But what's sort
of on the horizon?

00:35:38.902 --> 00:35:40.443
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Well, I'm

00:35:40.443 --> 00:35:43.120
definitely interested in
marine protected areas.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:49.420
And I don't really see us
moving out of the Southern Cone.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.500
That's for one thing.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.530
Because we're a small team.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.100
And I feel like it's really
important that we build off

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.920
of what we've done so far and
not just go to some new place

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.440
and start from zero again,
because there's still

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.200
so many things that we
could do in conjunction

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.340
with the various governments,
and the two countries,

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.490
and building off of those
relationships, and so on.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:18.130
So the marine area,
our big vision

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.180
is going around Cape Horn.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.790
It is one of--

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.000
it's a convergence,
a marine convergence,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.640
between the Pacific Ocean
and the Atlantic Ocean.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:33.910
So that's where we're
especially interested.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:36.340
You know, these are just ideas.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.310
There are a lot of people
working in the marine area

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:44.300
down in Chile, not
so much in Argentina.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.140
I think that it's
important to talk

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:52.180
with the leaders of the
sovereign states and ask them,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.930
are there areas
where we might be

00:36:55.930 --> 00:37:00.550
of service to the goals of
the government and so on?

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:02.590
And then, of course,
there are always

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.190
projects that are on
the terrestrial side

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:09.940
and the agricultural side.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.680
Although, that's a little--

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.530
that takes place out
of our family life

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.880
and not inside the foundations.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.320
So I don't have any
intention of doing

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.260
anything else until I fly away.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:29.080
So I feel blessed to be
doing what we're doing,

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.670
especially blessed that
we have the teams we have.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.370
I know many times, it's sort
of the Doug and Kris show,

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.680
but that isn't it at all.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.980
We have so many people who've
been with us for so many years.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.460
And in Chile, these parks
have been built and created

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.340
by Chileans.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.580
And the same can be said
for those in Argentina.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.240
So I always need
to remind people

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.880
that we wouldn't have
gotten off first base

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.540
without a tremendous amount
of work and dedication

00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.740
on that side.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.560
And I think that, as
far as we've seen,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.410
we're all in to keep going.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.630
SPEAKER: That's so wonderful.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.670
So I know you--

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.330
I really like the title that
you gave your talk today

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.610
of paying rent to the earth.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.680
So I was so curious to hear you
talk a little bit about what

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.070
does that mean to you and
how does that relate the work

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.570
that you do.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.028
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: I don't

00:38:19.028 --> 00:38:22.180
know who coined that pay your
rent for living on the planet.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.030
I don't know if it was
Yvon or Doug or both or--

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.170
I'm not sure.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.580
But it's absolutely true.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.420
I think, regardless of
where you are in your life,

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.830
you're working at Google,
you're working at Patagonia,

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.000
you're working for yourself,
you're not working at all,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.260
it's impossible--

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.000
one of the reasons
we're stuck where we are

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.090
is that we, as humans,
have separated ourselves

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:58.170
from the fact that we're
dependent on the natural world.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.780
So I think that
the big challenge

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:07.370
is, how do you use every
asset of your personal life

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:11.120
toward changing that trend?

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.380
That's really the question.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.190
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:15.398
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
And so when I say assets,

00:39:15.398 --> 00:39:18.350
I think where you
work is an asset, what

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:23.540
your personal strengths
are are your assets, how

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:29.220
you use your spare time
is an asset that you have.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.830
And I think paying your rent
for living on the planet

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:34.970
is a very--

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:39.200
it sounds superficial, but
it's actually quite deep

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.110
if you adopt it--

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:45.080
that I will do
something every day

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.160
that has nothing
to do with myself

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.890
and that's how I'm going to
get out of bed every day.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:55.430
And it's a slogan in
a certain kind of way,

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:59.470
but it's an important
one because we

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:05.680
have to live our lives
with intention to the best

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.610
that we can.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.030
And it's hard, because we
live in a culture that's

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.650
going in the other direction.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.880
We're valued by our
financial means.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:22.330
The values, the criteria,
by which we're measured

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:27.080
don't really reinforce pay your
rent for living on the planet.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:32.540
So people have to
discard or roll back

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.540
the importance of
some of the criteria

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.000
that we've placed on
ourselves and take

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.600
an independent decision to
live your life differently

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:44.370
or a little
differently, at least.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:45.910
Nobody's a saint here.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.920
We're all swimming in
this sea of contradictions

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.980
that we face-- climate change
and these other facts that

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.050
are very clear to us.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:41:00.540
And yet, we have tremendous
technology at our touch.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.440
We have tremendous opportunities
to move around and see

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.990
parts of the world we
wouldn't have otherwise.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:12.680
And somehow, we have to find
a real balance between those

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.290
things or we're--

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:19.310
as Jane says, we're
stealing the future

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:23.100
from those who come after us in
the human and non-human world.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.240
So that's what it means.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.940
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.530
And you really just
touched upon the value

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.610
of an individual action.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.744
What advice do you
give people who say,

00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:34.910
I don't know where to start?

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.284
I want to have a
positive impact,

00:41:36.284 --> 00:41:37.990
but I don't know where to begin.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:41.660
How do you advise people
to get more engaged?

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.690
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Well, I

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.620
used to speak at a lot
of business schools.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.420
And always, the day
would end like this--

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.280
what would you do
if you were us?

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.240
And I always say the same thing.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.900
When I was your age, we didn't
know what we know today,

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.800
so I had it a lot easier
than you guys have.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.270
The problem is, once
you know what you know,

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:10.910
then you can't turn
your back on that.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:16.950
And so this is a really
simplistic answer

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:20.040
to your question, but I do
believe that most of life

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.920
is intention.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:29.610
It is not difficult to decide
what you personally will do.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:33.420
You have to decide that
you're going to do something

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.770
or hopefully plural some things.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:42.490
And then, go out and find
out what should you be doing.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.920
You can make
donations to places.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.050
And they should be
well-thought through.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.710
Are these groups who are really
active and willing to push

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:54.040
the boundaries of
what's taking place now?

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.545
Or you can go out
and chain yourself

00:42:56.545 --> 00:43:02.260
to the heavy equipment--

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.270
I don't know what you
call those things--

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:10.720
and stop big trees from being
plowed down in the Sierra.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.520
The point is to act.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.000
The point is to
participate in a way that

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.010
reflects your own values all
the time-- not all the time,

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.760
but every day something.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.020
Because that's the problem.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:30.190
I think we all get
stuck on, what can I do?

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:31.700
What should be my first step?

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.180
The first step is just
getting out of bed and saying,

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.790
this is where I'm headed.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:40.000
And if I don't know who it is
or where it is or what it is,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.632
I'm going to find out.

00:43:41.632 --> 00:43:43.090
I'm going to try
to figure out what

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:46.060
are the root causes of where
we find ourselves, which most

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.090
of us are really not clear on.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.540
And I would include
myself in that category

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.170
several years ago.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.440
If you don't understand
how we got here,

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.690
you can't really
understand what it

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:06.610
takes to mitigate those things
that have been so horribly

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.120
destructive in the last
couple hundred years

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.250
or however you
want to measure it.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:17.680
I studied the collapse of
civilizations as an avocation

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.250
because I keep trying to
understand, why would we

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:25.970
do this over and over
and over again, when,

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.910
as Jared Diamond would say,
the pattern of civil collapse

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.400
is so repetitive?

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.090
So what is it about
us that we can't

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:40.960
move against those trends?

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.150
Or do we just to
abdicate and say, well,

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.710
this is human nature;
we'll spiral up and out,

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.770
and then evolve again?

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.410
But I say, I don't
think that's--

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.360
I don't think that's
the way to go about it.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.960
You should try to fight
against those things that

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.340
are triggers for this
toward the destruction

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:09.550
of the natural world and
the greatest extinction

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.006
crisis in history.

00:45:12.006 --> 00:45:13.630
And especially, when
you start learning

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:22.860
about the stakes of the marine
systems, it's bloody desperate.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.200
So that's a choice.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.410
We have to make a choice.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:30.230
And it doesn't mean you
run off and live in a cave,

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:35.420
but it does mean that you
have to take a stand somewhere

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.080
along the trajectory
of our daily lives.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.400
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.795
That's wonderful advice.

00:45:41.795 --> 00:45:43.740
Well, I know we have
about 10 minutes left.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.260
And I'm sure people
in the audience

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.460
are eager to ask
Kris their questions.

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.660
So we have a microphone
here in the center aisle,

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.088
so please feel free to come on
up and share your questions.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.700
AUDIENCE: Hi, Kris.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.820
thank you so much for coming
and speaking to Google.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.930
I know that there's
a lot of inspiration

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.840
around the idea of
protecting half of the earth.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.940
And I wanted to get
your thoughts on that.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.020
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS: Yes.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.540
We just met with Dr.
EO Wilson 10 days ago,

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:25.350
who originated the
concept of Half Earth.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.080
And then there's
nature needs half

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.750
and there are various
versions of this.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.160
So we all get stuck in,
well, OK, then Half Earth,

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.780
so which half?

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:37.980
And how would that happen?

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.160
So we immediately
set up roadblocks,

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.130
because it would be insanely
difficult to do that.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.240
However, I think what he's
trying to say and move toward

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.560
is this--

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:56.260
that for healthy ecosystems
for human and non-human life,

00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:00.760
as a rough estimate,
half of the earth

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:08.930
needs to be very well cared
for, maybe not completely

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.670
without some production
in it, but it

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.990
has to be really managed, or
systems begin to collapse,

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:19.140
as they are in the
oceans and so on.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:27.340
So I think that it's a bold
way to describe the necessity

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.700
to move forward from
where we are now to where

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.820
we need to get to in 50 years.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.490
What should we look like
at the end of this century?

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:40.610
I think, for me, it's a
better way to look at this.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.490
And when you have a
circumstance where

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.950
you have rising human
population base,

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:48.230
you have a rising
consumption level,

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.480
and you have a
falling resource base,

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.180
so somewhere, if you
just do the math,

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.750
you have this inherent conflict
that we're speeding toward.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.640
And it has different
manifestations,

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.340
whether it's climate
change or other big moves,

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.590
the extinction
crisis, and so on.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:09.950
So I think that, yes, the
conversation of Half Earth

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:13.660
needs to be on the table.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:20.080
How do you execute that and how
do you move just intellectually

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.360
toward that is a challenge.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:28.320
It's not simple, but
it's probably real.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.670
I think it's real.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.340
And I think that we--

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.430
as these crises begin to
mount, whether they're

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:38.460
through climate change
and other factors,

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:41.490
society will move toward
that by necessity.

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:46.550
So it's not all going to
be volunteer or voluntary,

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.330
but it will be
something like that.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:56.090
It's a lot to wrap
your head around.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:49:00.290
It's a lot for me to
wrap around my head.

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:04.180
But my instincts tell
me that our way of life,

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.730
imagining there are
no limits to growth,

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.130
there are no limits to
the things that we want

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:16.540
and that we can do, is truly
a fabrication of false hope.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.260
It's not true.

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.990
I don't believe it.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.030
I don't think
anybody who's really

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:26.780
thought about the possibility
of economic growth--

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.350
infinite economic
growth-- is possible.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:34.770
And I know there are bazillions
of conversations about this.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:38.340
And I don't pretend to
have the final answer.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:43.230
But I do know that these
are things that individuals,

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:47.960
companies, everybody
needs to be talking about,

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.880
instead of sitting
on them as if there's

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.650
some sort of deep secret
that nobody wants to face.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:58.023
Then, as in all things, that
will knock you off your chair.

00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:04.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming today.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.370
Congrats on 10 million acres.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.380
That's a big number.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.640
What do you consider the
essential pieces of that

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.020
really coming to reality?

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.200
And if you had to
counsel groups,

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.060
such as yourselves,
that were getting

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.280
started in other
places in the world,

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:25.240
and things that come to mind
are, how does the president

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.610
balance all the influences
on then business development

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:34.020
growth with preserving nature?

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.200
What were the hard parts?

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.260
How did you solve them?

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.915
And how would you advise
others in your shoes?

00:50:38.915 --> 00:50:40.540
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Well, first

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.220
of all, which is
the most nebulous,

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.230
and I apologize
for this, but there

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:47.500
are moments when things
like this at this scale

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.820
can take place.

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.250
And there are other moments
when the stars aren't lined up

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:56.810
and the circumstances are
not there for you to do it.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:00.030
So that's a piece of it.

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:01.540
And it's not a small piece.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:08.550
But as we see, even in the
United States now, leadership

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.730
and how it looks at
conservation protected areas,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.820
whether they're parks or
monuments, and the idea

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:19.050
of public lands in general,
varies from administration

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:20.520
to administration.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.490
So it is a matter of
picking your moment.

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:27.990
And it is a matter of
really tying the economics

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:32.400
for the regions that
these parks are located,

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.450
that the economic development
long term is actually

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:40.900
probably best suited to
be tied to, in this case,

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.470
a national park, and as
I said at the beginning,

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:48.160
economic development as a
consequence of conservation.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.050
And a really good
way to look at this

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:53.650
is if you see the
country of Botswana--

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:58.330
15 years, 25 years ago, Botswana
had a big kind of vision plan

00:51:58.330 --> 00:51:59.140
for their country.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.150
And it involved mining
and all sorts of things.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.990
But then, starting with
the Okavango, of course,

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.980
it began to see that
tourism was changing

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:13.090
the story for many
local economies

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:16.600
and it doesn't show
any sign of shrinking.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.610
In fact, it's growing.

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:23.110
So we were able to work
with Chilean leadership

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:28.680
in creating these
parks as a master

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.380
plan for economic development.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:35.230
It is not true--

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:39.120
I don't know of any
case where countries

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.660
who have developed
national parks

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.140
have kicked the bejesus
out of their ability

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.390
to grow economically.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:51.060
It is a myth that company--

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.330
excuse me, that's
a Freudian slip--

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:57.690
countries have to choose
one way or the other.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:00.450
It's just not true.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:04.670
If I was leading a country,
which I never will,

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:07.070
you need to do both.

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:11.270
If you're an
inspired leader, you

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:16.180
have the courage
to insist on both.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:22.300
And this, I think,
was the motivation

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.600
for President Bachelet
because, mark my words,

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.860
anybody can have a great
idea, but you will not achieve

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.200
that great idea unless--

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.910
especially at a large
scale-- unless you

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:39.820
have true partnerships who
will go the distance with you.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.300
And in this case, President
Bachelet and her ministers

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.580
were absolutely the
reason this happened.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.460
I mean, we couldn't
have done it on our own

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.710
because we don't
make national parks.

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:52.630
We don't designate them, I mean.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:55.340
So if somebody wants
to start something,

00:53:55.340 --> 00:54:01.200
whether it's here, wherever
it is, to your question,

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.500
you have to decide what it
is you're trying to save.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.340
You have to know
that area like crazy.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.620
You need to map it.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.880
You need to think about it.

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.200
You need to walk across it.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.890
You need to know who
your neighbors are.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.380
You need to know
if the country--

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:21.140
if this would be an asset
for the country overall.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.900
It's just like building
any big project.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.670
You have to do a
lot of groundwork

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:31.040
first and then take
your first step.

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.670
But before that, you
have to love these areas.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.690
Whatever it is, you
better love them.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.770
And it better be a deep love
because these things are not

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.480
simple.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:45.970
And you have to be willing to
be unpopular sometimes and hold

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:48.820
hopes and dreams
for your land trust

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.960
or whatever it is that
will be challenged.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:59.720
And people will find you're an
intrusion on the development

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.260
of the economy and so on.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.270
So you have to stay the course.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:08.997
That's another point
of advice I'd give you.

00:55:08.997 --> 00:55:09.830
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:11.871
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS:
But I hope you do it.

00:55:11.871 --> 00:55:12.742
[LAUGHING]

00:55:12.814 --> 00:55:14.230
SPEAKER: Well, I
think we're going

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.770
to need to leave it there.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.260
Kris, thank you so much again.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.673
This has just been tremendous.

00:55:18.673 --> 00:55:21.847
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:21.847 --> 00:55:23.680
KRISTINE MCDIVITT
TOMPKINS: Thank you, guys.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.597
And thank you, Google.

00:55:24.597 --> 00:55:25.679
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:55:25.679 --> 00:55:28.200
KRISTINE MCDIVITT TOMPKINS: We
use Google, not on the hour,

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.870
on the five minutes.

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:35.070
So thank you very much for
making our lives much easier.

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:41.280
And I hope that Google, through
its enormous expanse of contact

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.800
in the world, takes
Mother Earth along with it

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:53.520
and does what it can with
this unbelievable population

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.770
of people whom you have.

00:55:55.770 --> 00:56:01.710
And charge yourselves
and the company

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:06.620
with seeing, that
100 years from now,

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:10.820
we have healthy ecosystems
and healthy, dignified human

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.390
populations.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.160
Thank you.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.510
[APPLAUSE]
