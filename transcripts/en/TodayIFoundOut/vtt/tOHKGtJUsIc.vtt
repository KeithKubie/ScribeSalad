00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:16.240
The KV-1 and KV-2 are recognised as being
amongst the most heavily armoured tanks deployed

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.720
during WW2.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.259
At least initially largely impervious to anything
less than a direct, point-blank hit from a

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.119
dedicated anti-tank weapon, the KV series
was so formidable that the first time the

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.140
Wehrmacht encountered them, Soviet soldiers
destroyed dozens of anti-tank guns by simply

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.010
driving towards them in a straight line and
running them over.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.510
Introduced in 1939 and named for famed Soviet
officer Kliment Voroshilov- a man who once

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.540
personally tried to attack a German tank division
with a pistol- the KV series was designed

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.539
to replace the T-35 heavy tank, which was
somewhat mechanically unreliable and costly

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.539
to produce.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.510
The extremely heavily armoured KV series was
first deployed during the Soviet Union’s

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.510
1939 war with the Finnish and then subsequently
used throughout WW2.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.749
The KV series was effectively designed with
a single feature in mind- survivability.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.190
Towards this end, it was equipped with exceptionally
thick armor.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.110
While this thickness varied somewhat based
on model, for reference the KV-1 boasted armor

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.270
that was 90 millimeters thick (3.5 inches)
on the front and 70 millimeters (2.8 inches)

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.000
on the rear and sides.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.140
Of course, there’s always a trade-off in
anything, and the thickness and weight of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.079
the KV’s armor came at the expense of almost
everything else- the tank was slow, had limited

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.250
maneuverability and firepower relative to
what you’d expect from a tank this size,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.220
and, to top it all, had exceptionally poor
visibility.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.759
In fact, it’s noted that Soviet commanders
frequently complained about the tank, despite

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.119
the defensive protection it offered.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.609
These sentiments weren’t echoed by the German
troops who initially encountered this moving

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.609
shield.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.979
The KV-1 and KV-2 (the two most popular models
of the tank) were nearly invincible during

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.689
initial skirmishes with the Germans, as few
anti-tank weapons they possessed could punch

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.509
a hole through the armor, and even the ones
that could required uncomfortably close range

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.509
to do it.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.700
As noted by an unspecified German solider
in a 1949 report compiled by the U.S. Army’s

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.970
Historical Division,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.750
…there suddenly appeared for the first time
a battalion of heavy enemy tanks of previously

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.970
unknown type.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.730
They overran the armored infantry regiment
and broke through into the artillery position.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.050
The projectiles of all defense weapons (except
the 88-mm.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.550
Flak) bounced off the thick enemy armor.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.740
Our hundred tanks were unable to check the
twenty enemy dreadnaughts, and suffered losses.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.620
Several Czech-built tanks (T 36’s) that
had bogged down in the grain fields because

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.160
of mechanical trouble were flattened by the
enemy monsters.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.250
The same fate befell a 150-mm. medium howitzer
battery, which kept on firing until the last

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.250
minute.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.240
Despite the fact that it scored direct hit
after direct hit from as close a range as

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.640
two hundred meters, its heavy shells were
unable to put even a single tank out of action…

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.560
In another account, a German soldier in the
1st Panzer Division noted,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.590
The KV-1 and KV-2, which we first met here,
were really something!

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.720
Our companies opened fire at about 800 yards,
but [they] remained ineffective.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.700
We moved closer and closer to the enemy, who
for his part continued to approach us unconcerned.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.130
Very soon we were facing each other at 50
to 100 yards.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.470
A fantastic exchange of fire took place without
any visible German success.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.650
The Russian tanks continued to advance, and
all armour-piercing shells simply bounced

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.650
off them.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.370
Thus we were presently faced with the alarming
situation of the Russian tanks driving through

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.680
the ranks of 1st Panzer Regiment towards our
own infantry and our hinterland.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.150
Our Panzer Regiment therefore about turned
and rumbled back with the KV-1s and KV-2s

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.530
roughly in line with them.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.720
The former report also notes that a lone KV
tank (the exact model isn’t clear) simply

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.720
parked in the middle of the road blocking
the main supply route and sat there soaking

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.330
up anti-tank rounds for several days.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.130
“There were practically no means of eliminating
the monster.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.430
It was impossible to bypass the tank because
of the swampy surrounding terrain.”

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.110
Among the initial armament brought against
the troublesome tank were four 50mm anti-tank

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.160
guns.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.670
One by one the tank took them all out suffering
no meaningful damage itself.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.519
Frustrated, the Germans commandeered a nearby
88mm anti-aircraft gun, positioning it a few

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.990
hundred feet behind the tank (basically pointblank
range for a gun design to rip planes in half).

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.539
While this weapon was capable of piercing
the tank’s armor at that range, before they

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.400
could fire, the KV turned the gun’s crew
into a pink smear.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.040
Next up, the Germans decided to send an engineer
crew in under cover of darkness to try to

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.960
take it out up close and personal.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.711
While they did manage to get to the KV and
attach demolition charges, it turned out they

00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:45.889
underestimated the needed explosive power
and only a few pieces of the tank’s track

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.120
were destroyed, leaving the tank still fully
functional.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.960
As for the tank crew themselves, they initially
received needed supplies to continue their

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.210
barrage on the Germans via cover of night.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.009
However, ultimately the Germans were able
to cut off supply access to the tank and then

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.289
sent a whopping 50 of their own tanks in to
take it out, or that was seemingly their plan;

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.930
while the massive number of tanks were approaching
and occupying the attention of the KV crew

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.729
with their limited visibility, the Germans
were able to, according to the 1949 account

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.000
from the unnamed German soldier, “set up
and camouflage another 88-ram.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.990
Flak to the rear of the tank, so that this
time it actually was able to fire.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.360
Of the twelve direct hits scored… three
pierced the tank and destroyed it.”

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.960
Of course, all good things must come to an
end and the KV line’s many limitations saw

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.259
it quickly go from a near impervious mobile
fortress to a virtual sitting duck, with German

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.830
forces reacting to it by developing new explosive
anti-tank rounds fully capable of taking the

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.939
KV’s out.

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.750
While still used throughout the war, once
this happened, the KV’s were largely replaced

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.940
by the more well-rounded T-34 tank.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.870
Still, it’s impossible to argue that the
KV didn’t make one hell of a first impression,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:06:16.040
even if, ironically enough, it didn’t have
staying power.
