a lot of graduate unemployment and at
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.319
a lot of graduate unemployment and at
the same time we have a real gap between

do I think it's really important that we
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200
do I think it's really important that we
look at the data we look at the evidence

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
look at the data we look at the evidence
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600
look at the data we look at the evidence
of what works when we're looking at how

solutions we've developed a methodology

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
solutions we've developed a methodology
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.399
solutions we've developed a methodology
for supporting schools in improvement

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
for supporting schools in improvement
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.530
for supporting schools in improvement
and at the heart of that is an

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
and at the heart of that is an
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200
and at the heart of that is an
understanding of how you make a school

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
understanding of how you make a school
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.710
understanding of how you make a school
better

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
better
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.319
better
first of all it's about educational

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
first of all it's about educational
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.539
first of all it's about educational
excellence we need to look at the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
excellence we need to look at the
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.190
excellence we need to look at the
quality of leadership quality of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
quality of leadership quality of
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.249
quality of leadership quality of
teaching the curriculum very importantly

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
teaching the curriculum very importantly
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.810
teaching the curriculum very importantly
how it teachers empowered to plan assess

how it teachers empowered to plan assess
develop their practice and be the lead

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
develop their practice and be the lead

people for taking the profession

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
people for taking the profession
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.069
people for taking the profession
forwards and by doing that we find that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
forwards and by doing that we find that
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350
forwards and by doing that we find that
standards can rise much more quickly but

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
standards can rise much more quickly but
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510
standards can rise much more quickly but
equally important how do we engage the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
equally important how do we engage the
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160
equally important how do we engage the
parents this is a key part of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
parents this is a key part of
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.380
parents this is a key part of
educational effectiveness we know that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
educational effectiveness we know that
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.109
educational effectiveness we know that
children with engaged parents improving

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
children with engaged parents improving
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120
children with engaged parents improving
their educational quality much more

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
their educational quality much more
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859
their educational quality much more
quickly than those with parents who are

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
quickly than those with parents who are
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.959
quickly than those with parents who are
disengaged in education the other side

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
disengaged in education the other side
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.609

of the coin to educational effectiveness

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
of the coin to educational effectiveness
 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.369
of the coin to educational effectiveness
is operational effectiveness and this is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
is operational effectiveness and this is
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.199
is operational effectiveness and this is
something that we in education have only

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
something that we in education have only
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.309
something that we in education have only
recently become

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
recently become
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.280
recently become
to become much better at this is about

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
to become much better at this is about
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.989
to become much better at this is about
how do we efficiently deploy the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:17.999
how do we efficiently deploy the
 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.599
how do we efficiently deploy the
resources that we have it's also about

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609
resources that we have it's also about
 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.089
resources that we have it's also about
how do we introduce the right processes

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099
how do we introduce the right processes
 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.670
how do we introduce the right processes
in our schools and businesses will look

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
in our schools and businesses will look
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.190
in our schools and businesses will look
in detail at their processes what is it

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
in detail at their processes what is it
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.559
in detail at their processes what is it
that we do from top to bottom to deliver

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569
that we do from top to bottom to deliver
 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.410
that we do from top to bottom to deliver
the right result in schools often it can

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
the right result in schools often it can
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.759
the right result in schools often it can
be more intuitive

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769
be more intuitive
 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.979
be more intuitive
however by analyzing the key processes

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
however by analyzing the key processes
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.869
however by analyzing the key processes
in a school and actually making sure

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879
in a school and actually making sure
 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.520
in a school and actually making sure
that each of them is being delivered in

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
that each of them is being delivered in
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.929
that each of them is being delivered in
the most efficient way by the right

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939
the most efficient way by the right
 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.449
the most efficient way by the right
people using the right technology we can

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459
people using the right technology we can
 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.920
people using the right technology we can
actually help to use our money better

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
actually help to use our money better
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.640
actually help to use our money better
and this is the point around financial

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
and this is the point around financial
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.339
and this is the point around financial
effectiveness because if we are

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349
effectiveness because if we are
 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.619
effectiveness because if we are
delivering high quality education and

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
delivering high quality education and
 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:55.789
delivering high quality education and
we're doing it in a way which is

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799
we're doing it in a way which is
 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.559
we're doing it in a way which is
operationally effective then we're

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569
operationally effective then we're
 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.649
operationally effective then we're
making the best use of our resources

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659
making the best use of our resources
 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.059
making the best use of our resources
it's also very important to make sure

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069
it's also very important to make sure
 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.740
it's also very important to make sure
that all of the stakeholders are really

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750
that all of the stakeholders are really
 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.289
that all of the stakeholders are really
engaged in the work you're doing so what

the teachers think what do the students
think how does that all come together to

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
think how does that all come together to
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.629
think how does that all come together to
make sure that we have a school that is
