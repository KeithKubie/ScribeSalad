00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.208
- [Voiceover] Hello, Emily.

00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:02.087
- [Voiceover] Hello, David.

00:00:02.087 --> 00:00:05.455
- [Voiceover] So we're here
today to talk about apoptosis.

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:06.851
I was gonna ask you
some questions about it,

00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:10.995
you were going to explain
what it even is to me.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.421
- [Voiceover] Absolutely.
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.600
- [Voiceover] Let's talk apoptosis.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.294
- [Voiceover] So this word, apoptosis.

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:18.956
I did a little bit of etymology research.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:20.158
I broke the word apart,

00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:24.016
'cause it comes from Greek
particles that I identified.

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:28.250
So we have, here's the limit
of what I know right now.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.586
So it comes from these two pieces,

00:00:30.586 --> 00:00:33.304
the "apo" meaning "away,"

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:37.088
and "ptosis," which
means, like, a falling.

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:38.435
So it's really this kind of,

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:40.732
it means, like, to be falling away.

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:44.319
And my understanding is that
this programmed cell death,

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:45.152
'cause that's what it is,

00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:45.985
that's what you've written,

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:50.497
is kind of analogous to leaves
falling away from a tree,

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:52.837
that it's something
that's supposed to happen,

00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:56.019
and the cells just die
in this prescribed way

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:56.988
when they're supposed to.

00:00:56.988 --> 00:00:58.436
This isn't random.

00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:01.679
This is something that the cell embarks on

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.879
for a particular purpose.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.620
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I
think that's a really,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.688
a good way of putting it,

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:09.453
and I think that is why
it was named apoptosis

00:01:09.453 --> 00:01:12.283
by some of the first folks who studied it,

00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:13.622
is that they really wanted to underscore

00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:15.736
that this is a form of cell death

00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:17.243
that is a normal, healthy part

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.822
of an organism's development,

00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:21.575
its maintenance of its body,

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:23.709
even its prevention of things

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.014
like viral infection or cancer.

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:29.377
So it's very much a
normal and healthy thing

00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:32.015
that your body is
actually doing right now.

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:33.364
- [Voiceover] So, right now?

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:34.420
- [Voiceover] Right now.
- [Voiceover] Oh man.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.253
(laughing)

00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:39.333
So, okay, so what are the
ways in which a cell can die?

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.966
What are, I mean, 'cause
we have this diagram here.

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.032
Here's a normal, healthy cell.

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:45.352
And then here we've got this,

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:48.067
what looks like the aftermath
of some kind of explosion.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:49.626
What is this?

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:51.057
- [Voiceover] So that's sort of showing

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:54.623
two very broad categories
of ways that a cell can die,

00:01:54.623 --> 00:01:56.642
and the simplest way to label them

00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:58.438
would be messy and tidy.

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:00.005
- [Voiceover] Okay.
- [Voiceover] But more,

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.348
more formally, the bursting looking cell

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:04.639
is undergoing necrosis,

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.849
which is a form of cell death

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.147
where the cell basically
swells up and explodes,

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:12.683
and it releases its contents,

00:02:12.683 --> 00:02:14.261
which is not very good

00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:16.716
because those can damage
other cells in the area,

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.369
they can attract cells
of the immune system

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.320
that will cause inflammation.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.652
And then on the flip side,

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:26.030
you have the tidy approach, apoptosis,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.985
and here you actually see
the cell shrinking down

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:32.149
and kind of breaking up its DNA,

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:33.082
breaking up its nucleus--

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.084
- [Voiceover] And that's these
little orange things in here

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.652
are the chromosomes being cut apart--

00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:37.878
- [Voiceover] Yes, so those are, like,

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:39.594
really little fragments of chromosome.

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:40.608
They'd actually be much littler

00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:42.899
even than what I've drawn there.

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:43.979
But what the cell's gonna do

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.195
is it's just kind of going to come apart

00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:50.898
into little fragments encircling
different cell components.

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:53.384
So you can sort of see
those starting to bud off.

00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:56.155
And then cells from the immune system,

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:59.061
whose job is basically
to gobble up debris,

00:02:59.061 --> 00:03:00.947
they're gonna come and eat
those little fragments,

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.523
and it's gonna be like
nothing ever happened.

00:03:02.523 --> 00:03:03.589
- [Voiceover] So this is
kind of the difference

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.779
between disposing of your
garbage in trash bags

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:08.792
and disposing of your garbage

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:12.349
by just dumping it out the
window of your apartment.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.111
- [Voiceover] Yes, I think that's true,

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.583
but maybe even taking it a step further.

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:19.040
If you dispose of your
garbage in trash bags,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.120
or by apoptosis, you can actually reuse

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.417
what was in the garbage.

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:24.250
- [Voiceover] Interesting.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.611
- [Voiceover] So other cells
can use those components

00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:29.034
for their own purposes,

00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:30.491
and they won't suffer any damage

00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.491
from having nasty stuff
floating around outside.

00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:37.220
- [Voiceover] So what
are the circumstances

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.659
under which apoptosis happens?

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.166
Like, how common is this,

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.416
and how common is necrosis?

00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.187
- [Voiceover] So necrosis
is usually something

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.565
that your body does not want to happen.

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:53.569
That's gonna happen when a cell

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.421
is perhaps exposed to a chemical toxin,

00:03:56.421 --> 00:04:00.171
when a cell is actually
mechanically damaged.

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:03.608
So those are circumstances where a cell

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.541
has basically received an insult

00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:08.609
that has caused it to die in
a not very controlled way.

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.059
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:12.500
- [Voiceover] And apoptosis
is kind of something

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.517
that would be going on
basically from the time

00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:20.684
a human being or another
vertebrate is a tiny embryo

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.538
throughout its life.

00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:26.246
So when you're developing,

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:27.849
when you're developing your hands,

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.603
your hand actually kind of starts out

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.252
as this chunk of tissue

00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:33.075
that's kind of like a paddle.
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:34.358
- [Voiceover] And it's actually apoptosis

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:37.653
that is gonna whittle your
fingers out of that block.

00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:41.203
- [Voiceover] So I've
got this hand, right,

00:04:41.203 --> 00:04:43.449
I've got this kind of, like, webby hand,

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.606
and you're telling me
that as the hand develops,

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:50.152
the tissue gets reabsorbed
into the other cells

00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:52.753
that were gonna make
up the rest of my hand?

00:04:52.753 --> 00:04:54.094
- [Voiceover] Yeah, so the cells,

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.374
they'll first die by apoptosis,

00:04:56.374 --> 00:04:59.449
and then basically the
blebs will get scavenged up.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:00.578
- [Voiceover] I'm sorry, the what?

00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:02.087
- [Voiceover] I guess I never
named them, but the little--

00:05:02.087 --> 00:05:03.238
- [Voiceover] These are called blebs?

00:05:03.238 --> 00:05:04.227
- [Voiceover] The little protrusions,

00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:05.770
that's a very technical term.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.020
That's a bleb.
- [Voiceover] Bleb.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.895
I love that. (giggles)

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:09.970
- [Voiceover] You'll
see it in scientific--

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.792
- [Voiceover] That's a
science word, is bleb?

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:12.625
- [Voiceover] Totally scientific.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:13.557
- [Voiceover] I love that, all right.

00:05:13.557 --> 00:05:14.548
- [Voiceover] It's blebs.
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:15.563
- [Voiceover] You can also see them

00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:17.892
in the picture up at right.

00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:20.485
- [Voiceover] So what is this image here?

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:21.783
- [Voiceover] So those
are, that's basically

00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:24.908
just the same thing that
the line diagram is showing,

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:27.159
healthy cells, which is the left panel,

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.853
and then blebby cells
undergoing apoptosis,

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:31.373
which is the right panel.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.017
- [Voiceover] So they're having
all of their cell components

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:36.806
repackaged into garbage bags to be,

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:38.502
or, if we want, recycling bags,

00:05:38.502 --> 00:05:40.341
that'd be sent off to other cells

00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:42.944
where their components
can be reused as stuff?

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:45.323
- [Voiceover] Exactly.
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:48.240
Now what's this tadpole beast here?

00:05:49.822 --> 00:05:50.979
What is this about?

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.100
- [Voiceover] So that's
kind of the same thing

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.082
that we were talking about with the hand,

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:57.167
but another place where you see apoptosis

00:05:57.167 --> 00:05:59.394
happening in development is when you have

00:05:59.394 --> 00:06:02.477
a tadpole metamorphosing into a frog.

00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:05.644
So tadpoles, this is actually kind of

00:06:05.644 --> 00:06:07.379
part of the way they're already,

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.345
the tadpoles have a very long tail,

00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:13.118
and frogs generally don't have
much of a tail to speak of,

00:06:13.118 --> 00:06:15.190
and the way that the frog loses its tail

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.064
is through apoptosis.

00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:20.429
And again, it's said to resorb the tail,

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:22.867
so that it can make use of
the cellular components.

00:06:22.867 --> 00:06:24.576
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:28.543
So a tail just sort of shoots
up and becomes hindquarters?

00:06:28.543 --> 00:06:31.476
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I don't
actually know exactly,

00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:32.705
you know, if it starts from the end

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.256
and eats its way inward,

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:37.775
but somehow it gets
removed developmentally.

00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:39.866
- [Voiceover] Aw man, that's really cool.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.231
So it's not, it's not, it's not

00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:43.794
really like leaves falling off a tree.

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:47.369
It's not like this is a
three-toed skink or something.

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.224
If you grabbed a metamorphosing
tadpole by the tail,

00:06:50.224 --> 00:06:51.910
it would just break off.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.802
It's really more that it
gradually gets subsumed

00:06:54.802 --> 00:06:58.247
into the tissue of the growing frog.

00:06:58.247 --> 00:07:00.177
- [Voiceover] I mean,
at the cellular level,

00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:01.410
I guess the cells do,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.245
they pull away from their neighbors,

00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:05.446
so in that sense it's a falling off.

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:07.005
But it's not necessarily a falling off

00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:09.847
that you see at the
level of a whole organ.

00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:12.817
It would be more a falling
off of an individual cell.

00:07:12.817 --> 00:07:14.001
- [Voiceover] So so far
we've given examples

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:18.168
of apoptosis that are happening
within developing creatures,

00:07:19.177 --> 00:07:22.045
but you're saying that within, like,

00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:25.465
right now, apoptosis is
happening in my body.

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:26.311
- [Voiceover] That's a fact.

00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:27.300
- [Voiceover] So does that mean,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.193
is that just to keep the number of cells

00:07:29.193 --> 00:07:31.184
in my body constant?

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.159
- [Voiceover] That's a big part

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:34.847
of the role that apoptosis plays,

00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:37.247
like your blood system in particular

00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:39.445
is continually producing new cells,

00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:43.596
and if you produce cells but
you never got rid of cells,

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:46.222
you would eventually end
up with too many cells,

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:48.879
and too many cells in
general is not a great thing

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.130
to have in the human body.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.091
That's the kind of thing
that you might get in cancer,

00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:53.141
if you're having--
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:55.988
- [Voiceover] Cells accumulating too much.

00:07:55.988 --> 00:07:58.293
So part of it is just
keeping a healthy balance,

00:07:58.293 --> 00:08:00.738
but since we also just brought up cancer,

00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:03.081
that's actually another wonderful favor

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:05.566
that all of our cells are doing for us,

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:08.152
is if they suffer DNA damage,

00:08:08.152 --> 00:08:12.024
which could predispose
them to become cancerous,

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:13.191
first they'll try to fix it,

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.875
but if they can't fix it,

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:17.611
they will actually, under
normal circumstances,

00:08:17.611 --> 00:08:20.716
undergo apoptosis, so there's no chance

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:24.456
of them passing that damage
on and becoming cancerous.

00:08:24.456 --> 00:08:26.731
And that's actually a really
important protective role

00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:29.877
that apoptosis plays in an adult human,

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:33.071
or in a human at any stage of their life.

00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:36.654
So it's kind of like
a big red button that,

00:08:38.363 --> 00:08:40.160
you know, it's like a
self-destruct button.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.370
If a cell comes to appreciate

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.284
that it is developing cancerous symptoms,

00:08:46.284 --> 00:08:48.073
then it just hits the button

00:08:48.073 --> 00:08:51.347
and begins this cascade of enzymes

00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:54.627
that cause it to undergo apoptosis?

00:08:54.627 --> 00:08:55.494
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I mean, I think that's

00:08:55.494 --> 00:08:59.407
the general way to think of it for sure.

00:08:59.407 --> 00:09:01.432
So there are actually
kind of different ways

00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:03.227
that cells that are progressing

00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:05.380
towards cancer might be stopped,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.548
and some of those involve
internal mechanisms,

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.968
so the cell doing its own surveillance

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.460
and observing, wow, gee,
my DNA does not look good,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.324
and I can't fix it.

00:09:15.324 --> 00:09:16.649
- [Voiceover] Okay.
- [Voiceover] But also,

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:20.758
you could have a cell
that might be observable

00:09:20.758 --> 00:09:23.046
from the outside by another cell

00:09:23.046 --> 00:09:24.743
as a potential cancer cell--

00:09:24.743 --> 00:09:26.489
- [Voiceover] So like an immune cell

00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:30.014
could come by and like, stick
a protein on the outside

00:09:30.014 --> 00:09:32.908
that also triggers the same thing?

00:09:32.908 --> 00:09:35.102
- [Voiceover] Yeah, yeah, I don't,

00:09:35.102 --> 00:09:36.068
you know, I don't know exactly

00:09:36.068 --> 00:09:38.338
what the mechanism of
communication there is,

00:09:38.338 --> 00:09:41.023
but it would be an interaction
between the two cells

00:09:41.023 --> 00:09:42.687
where one of them would
tell the other, you know,

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:45.072
okay, I see there's
something wrong with you.

00:09:45.072 --> 00:09:47.264
You know, time to wrap this up.

00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:48.097
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:50.369
So apoptosis can happen
in a couple of ways,

00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:52.233
but in pretty much all cases,

00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:56.307
it is a normal, healthy
part of the cell lifecycle.

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:58.474
Do all cells die this way?

00:09:59.812 --> 00:10:00.790
- [Voiceover] I mean, there are cells

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.040
that will undergo necrosis,

00:10:04.558 --> 00:10:08.069
so certainly in that sense
not every cell in your body

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:10.486
is going to die by apoptosis.

00:10:11.353 --> 00:10:13.295
I would imagine that there are also

00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:15.535
other ways of recycling used cells

00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:19.035
that are not exactly considered apoptosis.

00:10:20.602 --> 00:10:24.416
Like skin cells, some of them will undergo

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:25.665
kind of a similar process,

00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:28.201
but it's not technically apoptosis,

00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:30.578
even though it is a
regulated form of cell death.

00:10:30.578 --> 00:10:32.120
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.321
- [Voiceover] So I don't
think that I would go as far

00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:35.168
as to say that all of your cells

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:37.489
were eventually gonna die this way.

00:10:37.489 --> 00:10:40.721
But it's sort of a very
common maintenance way

00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:43.435
for cells to die and be replaced.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:44.839
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:45.748
Thanks, Emily.

00:10:45.748 --> 00:10:46.997
- [Voiceover] Thanks, David.
