Merry Christmas Eve--

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.600
What's so merry about it?!

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.280
I have just seen the absolute worst 
Holiday special of all time!

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.800
Worse!

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.960
It's so bad I haven't slept in nights!

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.900
It's kept me awake throughout the entire season!

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.580
If I'm not careful, I might start hallucinating!

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.740
Hey, Critic!

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.100

Hello, I'm Nostalgia Critic. 
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.240
And Merry Christmas Eve to you...

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.780
...Or at least it would be!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.760
Before I found out this unholy abomination existed!

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.140
That's right, I have found it!

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.720
I have found the absolute worst
 Christmas special of all time!

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.180
Hands down, no comparison, YULETIDE CRAP!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.620
It's called....

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.040
The Christmas Tree.

[cheery music plays]

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.060
It's unlikely you've ever heard of it,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.720
but it's getting more and more of a
 following as, you've guessed it,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.060
the worst Holiday Special ever made!

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.600
Its acting, atrocious!

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.560
Its animation, beyond cheap!

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.000
Its story?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.540
What brain operated by a dead hamster on a broken spinning wheel would be fucking stupid enough to greenlight this shit?!

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.260
It might be the only Christmas special 
where literally everything about it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.760
was done completely 100 percent WRONG.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.220
And I mean EVERYTHING!!

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.820
There are no words to describe how bad it is.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.800
It just has to be witnessed!

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.460
And that is why you are here, isn't it?

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.720
You are interested in the unknown, 
the mysterious, the unexplainable.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020
That is why you are here...

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.180
And now, for the first time

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.900
we are bringing to you the full story 
of what happened that fateful day.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.000
We are giving to you ALL the evidence

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.620
based ONLY on the secret testimonials of the 
miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal!

about The Christmas Tree?!

[Thunder clapping]

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.160
Let's find out...

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.900
It opens with a clichéd narrator reading a clichéd book

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.720
that looks more like a dictionary of
Tetris pieces than legible literature.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.400
Narrator: "Our story takes place in an orphanage 
with some children and a pine tree."

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420
"The orphaned children lived under the control 
of the evil rules of a lady named..."

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.000
"Mrs. Mavilda."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.140
D'AAH! Movement!!

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.160
[Narration continues]

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.720
Oh, I'm sorry. That so RARELY happens in this special.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.140
"The children never had toys, new clothes or anything."

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.280
"But they had a friend."

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.000
"The pine tree they named Mrs. Hopewell."

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.140
"Yes, Hopewell."

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.640
"Because the kids believed that the tree was magical!"

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.080
The kids were obviously exposed to too much car exhaust to imagine such a non-imaginative idea.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.880
"She had a pretty dress with bows and
 lace and a new pair of pants and a sweater"

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.920
"to put on whichever child she 
was going to show off to the mayor."

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.600
"This way, every time the mayor came by,"

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.960
"he always thought that Mrs. Mavilda
 was taking good care of her children."

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.900
A thorough inspection, as you can see,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.580
accompanied by the fact that 
direct deposits and business checks

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.620
have now been replaced with... big bags of money.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.280
Hey! Who needs a paper trail when
you have millionaire duck currency?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.300
"Mrs. Mavilda would immediately take off the 
child's clothes and put them away in a closet

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.060
for the mayor's next visit.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.480
Poor children..."

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.800
Well, you're not making the situation better by uncomfortably holding on their naked bodies like that--

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.940
Thank you!

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.960
So, Mrs. Mavilda bets all the money she 
has on poker games with her friends

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.860
and the kids continue to suffer for it.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.400
She doesn't even let them feed 
the street dog named Licorice

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.560
as she tries to have the pound take him away.

Later on, we see a family moves 
into town and is looking for work.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.060
So they go to the mayor...

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.060
... which doesn't really seem like his jurisdiction

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.620
but again, he keeps his bank account in money bags.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.060
And he tells them that the husband can work at the lumber mill but has to live in the boarding house without his family.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.020
However, he offers the family a
 chance to live at "Chateau De Fuckhole"

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.000
where Mrs. Mavilda will take the
 mother, named Judy, in as an assistant.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.420
"We've come from the mayor's."

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.120

"Can we go now?"

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.880
So Mrs. Mavilda explains that

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.520
Judy's kids have to be treated the
 exact same way as the other kids.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.360
"They're going to stay with the other children 
and under the same rules and regulations."

"What the hell did you just say?"

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.520
Yeah... I don't know if this kid is the director's,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.040
the producer's or even the casting agent's

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.480
but there is NO way she got through 
any kind of audition process.

"And besides, I brought some cheese."

She's not... technically killing the 
art of human speech as we know it

but she IS the seed that'll grow a horrifyingly large oak.

the kids show Judy their only friends:

the tree named Mrs. Hopewell and their dog Licorice.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.800
And, to the mumbling girl's credit,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.340
none of these other kids are gonna win

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.580

with THESE performances either.

"Now we have to do something for Mrs. Hopewell too!"

"I've got an idea!"

"We'll decorate her with her dead brethren!"

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.480
So the mayor sees the kids and Judy getting along

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.760

"Here you go, Mrs. Mavilda. Here's the two bags."

 amount; he just said "two bags"!

the money in terms of numbers.

That was awfully quick, I didn't even hear a footstep!

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.660
What, did she just beam herself into the room?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.720
"By the way, where is Judy?"

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.600
[Teleportation sound]

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.040
"Oh! Mrs. Kindell!

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.380
Good that you're here."

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.480
So the mayor wants her to pick out fancy new clothes

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.360
for the children as Christmas gifts.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.640
But the kids don't know what Christmas is.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.940
So Judy explains.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.020
"Christmas is a pretty and happy time of the year."

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.320
"A time when people get together.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.100
Friends with friends,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.740
Children with their parents and grandparents..."

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.740
D'uuuhhhh...

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.400
Ixnay the arents-pay...

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.140
Orphans...ay...

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.020
"Santa Claus is everybody's grandpa."

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.820
"And how can his sleigh fly?"

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.920
"Cause he has special reindeer to pull it and 
each one...has its own special name."

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.840
Okay...

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.340
What's this kid drinking?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.600
She's slurring more than an inebriated Klansman!

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.100
"I wish my little teddy bear

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.080
had his other arm."

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.600
So she tells them that on Christmas
 they can all make a simple wish.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.580
No, not that one! But it would explain a lot...

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.440
So we get a scene of all the kids
 wishing for happy things to occur.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.960
But strangely enough, while this scene is going on,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.160
they keep cutting back and forth 
to Mrs. Mavilda's poker game...

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.900
And it's edited so awkwardly that we're usually only seeing the poker game for just a couple of seconds.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.140
"I guess you've never seen a Christmas tree before."

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.880
What didja-- WHA?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.160
"Let's roll, kids!"

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.460
"I'm feeling lucky tonight!"

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.480
Uh, wasn't done yet but...

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:46.980
Judy: "He's not anybody's grandpa."

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.460
"Mom, can I be the first one 
to make a Christmas... wish?"

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.520
"Think HARD before you do."

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.840
Uh, wait, I think there was more--

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.600
"Good luck, Mavilda!"

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.720
"Let's have another hand!"

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.840
I don't think that we're done yet!

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.320
"I wish that my little teddy bear--"

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.080
Okay...

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.900
Why show these two things at the same time

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.400
if we're not going to show them for
more than a couple of seconds?!

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.740
Can we intercut other sloppily 
edited scenes while we're at it?!

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.680
"Oh, maybe if there's some money left over,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.800
I can convince Mrs. Mavilda to buy some red velvet.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.660
That way I can make some Christmas
stockings to hang on the fireplace."

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.620
"Red velvet? For stockings?"

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.740
"What's that?"

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.120
"Don't you know about Christmas stockings 
that you hang on the fireplace for Santa Claus to fill?"

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.240
"You don't!?"

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.780
"Which one of you knows about Christmas?"

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.540
"I do!"

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.160
"Christmas...

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.280
Christmas...Well, let me tell you about it."

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.580
So it turns out Mrs. Mavilda 
bet ALL the money and lost it.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.000
Meaning she can't get any new clothes.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.340
"I want to tell you something and you better listen!"

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.520
"I don't want the children playing outside anymore."

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.600
"You better make sure out that!!"

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.160
"Because you don't want the mayor 
to see them without new clothes!"

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.800
"How can you dare to..."

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.960
"ALL RIGHT!!"

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.300
"Now you know..."

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.860
"And now that you know, you better 
make sure you don't tell him a thing!"

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.760
"Or you and your children are out in the cold."

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.860
[giggles maniacally]

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.060
"Now you go get those children back inside!"

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.560
"Before my brain gets taken 
over by another personality!"

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.540
[giggles then stops]

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.540
So, Judy lets the kids know the bad news.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.320
"You know the new clothes we promised you?"

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.460
"Well, I'm afraid..."

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.340
"you're not going to be getting them."

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.120
"Oh no..."

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.600
"I know, I know. But there's nothing I can do about it."

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.500
"That's not fair, Mrs. Kindell!"

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.140
"Please, children, don't make it more difficult for me."

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.300
Nostalgia Critic: "I mean, Jesus, 
all you kids ever do is think about yourselves!"

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.000
"Don't you kids ever think about ME
 thinking about you thinking about yourselves?!"

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.840
But Mrs. Mavilda decides that Judy is
getting too much respect from the kids.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.540
So she tries to figure out a way to get rid of her.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.960
"She's changing everything around here..."

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.740
"I got to get rid of her..."

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.140
"But how?!"

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.180
Well, maybe you can start by 
getting out off the fuckin bed.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.940
It's like 1 o'clock, you lazy bitch! Get movin'!

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.540
"What if I make that good girl into a bad one?"

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.000
[giggles maniacally]

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.880
"Yeah!"

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.620
"I'll make her into a thief!"

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.300
"Just like I did with the girl that worked with me before."

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.260
Wh--di--w--When was that?!

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.660
We never saw that!

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.000
Okay, is this, like, a real person

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.420
or are we to assume this is yet ANOTHER 
personality that she has in her head?!

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.260
This woman's making A Beautiful Mind 
look like a simple romp!

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.180
So she calls her henchman...

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.080
Yeah, she has a henchman,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.080
[Brooklyn accent] what with the accents and stuffs,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.140
And asks him to frame Judy 
for stealing something of his.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.880
But one of the girls hears her and tells the other kids.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.200
They all decide to that something has to be done.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.140
"We can't just stay here without doing something!"

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.400
"What can we do?"

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.540
[high-pitched] "What about your mother? 
She's also in danger!"

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.580
The hell is that?!

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.820
"--the only one who knows where his office is."

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.040
"Do you know where his house is?"

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.900
Okay...Zortor. Your impression of a 
small human child isn't fooling anybody.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.880
Curses! I'll get you next time, pitifully dubbed humans!

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.340
[shrill evil laughter]

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.840
Speaking of which, there's a great irony that all of these children are obviously voiced by horrible child actors

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.420
But one girl is clearly voiced by an 18-year-old!

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.820
"You mean you don't think our 
star is gonna make it on time?"

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.740
"What if one of us goes to him?"

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.020
"But where are we and where is his house?"

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.680
Okay, pick one.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.080
Either horrible adult actors, horrible child actors or aliens trying to pose as children to take over the universe!

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.480
[shrill maniacal laughter]

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.060
So the children decide that 
Judy's kids should go and get help.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.580
From who you may ask?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.600
Santa Clause, of course!

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.300
Yeah...why not?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.420
"Look, here in my book! 
It shows that we're not far from his house!"

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.220
Wha...the...

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.680
What decapitated gingerbread cookie do they live on?!

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.820
Even Mario would be looking at this saying:

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.920
"Whoa, that's a fucked up-ah kingdom!"

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.120
"I don't know where the North Pole is...do you?"

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.700
"I don't."
"I don't"

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.600
[yelping bark]

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.100
"He knows where the North Pole is!"

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.360
"He does?"

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.920
Well, he barked. Obviously, that translates 
into knowing where the North Pole is.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.800
Quite a knowledgeable little scamp isn't he?

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.820
Say, I wonder what else he knows about?

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.080
Hey, Licorice! Do you know 
if we're alone in the universe?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.580
[barks]

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.180
Wow! Do you know why smart 
people keep watching The Middle?

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.960
[barks]

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.520
Wow! Do you know who really killed JFK?

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.120
[barks]

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.780
My God! The answers were right there!

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.220
I have to go to the police about this! 
The world must know, damn it!

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.900
THE WORLD MUST KNOW--!

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:16.940
I'll be right back.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.080
[gunshots]

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.380
"What? Another commercial?"

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.740
Well, this one's really quick.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:37.380
I just wanted to tell you that at TheAwesomeStore.com, we are extending our sale on our DVDs

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.140
and also our charity drive pictures.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.780
So, that is going to be going until the first of next year.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.720
So you can still get the good prices on that,

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.100
also, our metal prints are in and they're 
being shipped out even as we speak.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.180
If there's any more left, you can take a look, 
see if you can order some more.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.260
And...that's about it. Back to the show!

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.180
Oh, also uh... you will die if you don't know this--.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.560
So, Judy's kids go with Licorice to find the North Pole.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.320
"Don't be mad, Pappy. I just had to come."

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.880
Uh, she's down there, kid.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.740
You're staring at nothing right now.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.720
Please look down. Please look down. Please look d--

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.180
There ya go!

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.800
But they come across some troubles on their search,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.640
like Baloo from the Jungle Book!

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.020
[screaming]
[loud roaring]

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.440
Nostalgia Critic: [demonic voice] 
"Bare necessities! Your asses are my recipes!"

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.380
"The simple bare necessities of DEATH!"

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.460
[growling]

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.520
[roaring]

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.080
Jesus, they couldn't even make it a polar bear!

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.580
Even Santa Clause Conquers the Martians
 got that one right!

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.620
[dull] "Help me, Pappy! Help me!"

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.500
***damnit, you're hanging on for dear life! 
Show some fucking emotion ya little twat!

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.300
[bear roaring]

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.000
"PAPPY!"

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.200
Nostalgia Critic: "Even in death, I don't care..."

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.060
[growling]

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.240
Nostalgia Critic: "In hindsight, I am a pretty dumb bear."

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.060
[loud thud]

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.220
Pappy: "Lily!"

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.900
[voice echoing] "Lily!"

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.200
"Lily!"

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.840
"Lily!"

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.500
"Where are you? Where'd you go?"

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.160
Oh, Jesus, kid! Will somebody just try?!
SOMEBODY?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:38.020
GOD! I'll juggle porcupines with my buttcheeks if I could just get one production assistant or a cast member

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.740
or the director or SOMEBODY just to say:

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.820
"Maybe, fucking maybe, we should do that take again!!"

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.240
JESUS H. JESUS!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.420
Can we just get somebody
 with some ***damn emotion!?

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.880
Mrs. Mavilda: [yelling] "GET OUT! 
Pack your things right now!!"

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.140
"You're fired!"

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.380
CHRIST!

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.540
Spastic hyenas aren't as loud as you!

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.460
"You're fired!"

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.660
You're blowing out the volume levels! I don't think
the microphone have an Insane Bitch setting on it...

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.020
...except maybe in her case.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.360
"Frank?"

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.160
"Do you still have that electric chainsaw of yours?"

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.920
So, Mrs. Mavilda calls her henchman to cut 
down the tree-- Oh, sorry, "Mrs. Hopewell".

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.440
They've established such a strong presence 
with her, I'm SURPRISED I forgot,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.560
as the kids go out and try to stop them.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.800
"Nobody cuts Mrs. Hopewell until we talk to the Mayor!"

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.000
"Show them the saw!"

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.460
"Whatever you say, Ma'am."

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.900
[chainsaw roaring]

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.300
Mayor: "What is the meaning of this?!"

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.860
Nostalgia Critic: 
"Wasn't there snow here just a moment ago?"

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.720
"Turn that thing off! I can't hear a thing!"

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.680
[barking]
Pappy: "Mommy! Mommy!"

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.240
"But, where's Lily? Where is she?"

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.120
"She's gone, Mommy..."

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.820
"Oh, god! What do you mean?!"

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.740
"Ray..."

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.360
[stuttering] WHERE'D HE COME FROM??

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.360
"Ray..."

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.360
Nostalgia Critic: 
[imitates Ray]"I randomly materialized here just in time."

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.340
"Tell me, son. What happened to Lily?"

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.980
"She fell from a cliff Mommy, Daddy... all the way down."

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.740
[chuckles] Yeah, cuz that's my reaction 
if I just found out my little kid died!

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.080
So, while the Mayor is there, he finds out all the
 terrible things that Mrs. Mavilda has been doing.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.720
"What happened with the money that I've been donating? Why didn't Mavilda buy toys for them?"

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.980
"And look at them! 
They look like they haven't had new clothes in years!"

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.400
"What if the Inspector were to come?!"

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.000
[snickers] I love how he doesn't care that the 
children's well-being has been put in horrible danger,

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.960
But instead is more concerned if the 
Inspector sees him and calls him out on it!

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.100
"What if the Inspector were to come?!"

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.700
"Voters don't like their politicians 
connected to dead children."

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.620
"Uh...they are still alive, right?"

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.840
"Your tree--I mean, Mrs. Hopewell 
is going to be all right."

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.180
Okay, is the mayor slowly transforming 
into an Adam Sandler voice?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.360
Because Sandler already ruined one holiday and I don't think this movie needs any help ruining this one!

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.500
[chainsaw roaring]

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.780
"That's what you think, children!"

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.420
But Mrs. Mavilda grabs the chainsaw 
and is about to finish the job.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.900
Children: "OH NO!"

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.760
[lighting crackling]
[thunder clapping]

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.780
Mrs. Mavilda: [screams]

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.000
HOLY SHIT!

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.860
The moral of the story is 
"Don't fuck with Mrs. Hopewell!"

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.160
[demonic voice] "I am the bark of Satan!"

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.260
"Those who wish to demean my 
evil will be bloodily smoted!"

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.820
[bells jingling]

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.200
Santa Clause: 
"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everybody!"

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.200
Ah, so it was Santa who fried 
the flesh of a weak, feeble woman.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.160
Merry...Christmas...?

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.660
[popping sound]

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.420
Um...I think those lights are supposed to actually be 
ON the tree and not a little to the left of the tree...

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.640
but, I guess it's the thought that counts.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.500
And clearly, none of that went into this at all.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.460
"Mommy!"

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.080
"Oh, Lily! I'm so glad to see you!"

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.200
"I missed all of you, Mommy!"
[shudders]

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.980
And the distrubing Santa Coke ad agrees...

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.160
[shudders]

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.420
"Look! Santa's leaving!"
Santa: "Peace be with you all!"

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.360
Nostalgia Critic: "What's this shit on my shoulder?
Oh! I guess it does that, okay!"

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.300
Santa: "Have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!"

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:29.000
Yeah, creepy-voice Santa has no time for
 individually visiting houses anymore,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.420
he just sort of air-bombs gifts now

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.140
in the hopes that whoever picks it up in
the morning will like it or some crap.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.640
So, everything seems to end happily.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.740
Look, even Mrs. Mavilda somehow 
got out without a scratch on her.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.440
How the flying fuck do you do that!?

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.380
Narrator: "And Mrs. Mavilda...well...
Mrs. Mavilda, she's going to be all right."

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:57.560
"From what I've heard, she went back to work 
in the orphanage as Judy's assistant!"
[laughs light-heartedly]

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.360
Nostalgia Critic: "True, that lightning fucked with her head and she constantly pisses her pants and calls herself "The Chicken God"

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.940
"But aside from that, she's gonna be all right!"

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.840
Narrator: "Well, don't worry about Mrs. Mavilda."

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.520
"She's good now. She learned that 
you always win when you are good."

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.860
"Merry Christmas, everybody!"

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.120
Oh, and I suppose that's your half-assed 
little message at the end right?

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.320
Mmhmm, yeah, no, no, it's good, it's really good, I like it, you did a good job, you did good, good job, Special,

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.380
I-I love this, only 45 minutes, it felt like an eternity but, you know, you did good, I just so love it, everything.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.120
all the characters and everything about it was so good, I just love it, you did so good, I just love it, 
you did so good,

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.140
[incoherent sqeaking]

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.160
FUCK YOOOOUUU!!!!

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.680
Do I even need to say what's wrong with it? Not really.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:47.020
It's pretty obvious. Horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible directing and horrible animation.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:53.000
But, here's the thing. A lot of people are saying 
this is the animated equivalent of The Room.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:58.020
One of those films that's so hypnotizingly 
bad that it's actually good.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.800
And...in some respects...they're actually kind of right.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.460
This can be very entertaining 
to laugh at and make fun of.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.480
Everything is so awkward and strange that 
you can't help but burst out into hilarity.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.440
But the problem is, it's a Christmas movie.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.640
CHRISTMAS. Really think about that.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.440
This is the season where even the worst Holiday Specials at least TRY to give something

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:28.700
either entertaining or heartfelt because they feel
they owe it to such a beautiful time of year.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.460
And, what does this film end up giving us?

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.860
"You always win when you are good."

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:42.220
Yeah, this is the holiday where charities all over the world go up and people give more than ever to those 
who have so little and expect nothing in return.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.340
They do it because they know it's right and this is 
the time to celebrate what's good in the world.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.780
And...what does this film end up giving us?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.020
"You always win when you are good."

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.880
This is the time of year that brought a WAR to a halt!

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.740
Because the message of good 
will toward men was so strong.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:11.620
Because it was a symbol to stop hatred, stop killing, stop everything spreading anything that didn't equal love and respect for everyone in the world.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.820
This is a holiday that is THAT powerful.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:22.300
So, just to reiterate, you Christmas Special that 
clearly understands the holiday you're representing,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.580
What then, is the meaning of Christmas?

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.960
"You always win when you are good."

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.900
Cuz, that's what Christmas is, THAT'S what Christmas is! You got it, Special! You fucking got it!

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.040
No! NO YOU DIDN'T!

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.640
And that's why this is the worst Special! 
I'll tell you why, because Christmas is not about that,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.160
it's not about that dumbass little message 
it was trying to throw in at the last minute.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.180
You know what? It's not even really about giving 
or sharing or love or anything about that,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.980
that's a part of it, 
but there's something even more important!

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.700
You want to know what it is? 
I'll tell you what Christmas is!

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.180
Christmas is EFFORT!

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.020
It's putting effort into that kindness, it's putting effort into that sharing, it's putting effort into that loving

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.340
cuz, anyone can just give something, 
anyone can just BUY something,

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:09.780
whether it costs a million bucks if you're rich or nothing if you're poor, but by God, it's the effort you put into it!

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.640
If you got something someone really wanted, 
then that's effort.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.220
Or if you made something that somebody 
didn't even know they wanted, that's effort!

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.100
That's loving! It's putting the effort into that stuff! And that is something that is clearly not in this special!

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.160
They just slapped it together, didn't give a shit, 
and you can't do that on Christmas man!

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.560
You have to try! You have to try to make this stuff good because that is what we are trying to do!

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.380
It's about putting effort in something 
that is even bigger than yourself

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.560
cuz, when somebody comes up to me and wishes me a holiday from a religion maybe I don't celebrate,

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.520
if somebody said "Happy Haqnnuhka" to
me, I'd wish them "Merry Christmas" back.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.520
You know, what? We'd be fine with it.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.520
You wanna know why? Because we're both sharing something that we believe is bigger than ourselves!

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:55.260
That is putting effort into that. That is celebrating something that's wonderful and loving and unbelievable.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.740
It's putting that effort into Christmas.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.140
Into sharing something so great and fantastic!

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.100
[sighs]

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.300
Let me show you something, 
follow me Mr. Camera Man, follow me!

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.860
You know, it is all about effort, cuz 
that is the what we're trying to do here.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.820
We're trying to all come together 
so that we can celebrate

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.020
and put that effort into everything 
that is good with the world!

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.500
Like these people right here!

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.840
Look at how much effort these 
people put in all the time!

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.340
Unbelievable! Come here, come here, you guys!

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.240
These are people that work behind the scenes, in front of the scenes also, they do such a good job!

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.180
Guys. [sighs] You've been doing so great.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.220
You got the "That Guy With the Glasses"
audience watching right now.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.260
Is there anything you would like 
to say to them this Christmas Eve?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.500
[British accent] God bless us, everyone.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.180
[giggles]

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.700
Marry Christmas, Mr. Potter.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.180
How about you, you got a movie quote?

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.000
Uh...

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:49.220
Not really. But as we approach the new year, just know that always want to get better and don't get drunk.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:49.740
[snickers]

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.760
See, that's effort.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.820
Whether it be a movie quote that means a lot to them

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.240
or, you know, something very sincere, that's effort!

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.240
I love you guys! You guys are awesome!

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.200
But it doesn't stop there because we keep going out here

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.740
showing more of the effort, more of the...

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.100
It's about THIS guy!

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.440
Christmas is about this guy right here, that's right.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.880
The Camera Man, my brother Rob. 
He's been working so hard.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.600
Hey, hey hey! No, no no! Stand up, stand up, come on!

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.640
You've been working so hard, you've 
got everybody watching you right now.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.960
Anything you want to wish people this Christmas?

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.500
Uh...

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.800
Merry Christmas...?

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.800
Oh, come on! You do better than that, come on!

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.420
And a happy new year...

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.160
Come on! Bigger than that!

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.800
...You filthy animal.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.780
Oh, for God's sake, you can't think of 
anything better to say on Christmas Eve!?

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.780
Okay, fine. It's...

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.680
You know, it's a little hard to get into the Christmas spirit

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.280
with the way it's been...over-commercialized and stuff

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.480
but, really when you think deep about it,
 Christmas is not just a bunch of things that you buy.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.260
[stammering] It's about an attitude, a spirit. 
Something you carry with you in your heart!

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:52.980
When 2000 years ago a man was born into a stable, 
not adorned with gifts and presents and stuff and trees.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:28:01.500
But born into poverty and you see that every day. 
When a child does something nice for his grandma.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.200
Or, when, you know, we give things 
to homeless people, you know.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:12.600
It's something that-that lasts, that endures and 
goes on and on though the mountains may fall

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.320
and the hills turn to dust!

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.220
Okay, okay, okay! Take the camera, take the camera. 
Okay, okay. Here. Out here.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.780
Out here, out here, out here! Okay, okay!

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.980
It's about believing in something 
bigger than yourself, like I said.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:28.280
And putting that effort into it. Because you don't have to believe in Christianity or Catholicism or any of that stuff.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.820
You don't have to be in a religion. You just have to believe in humanity and that's what's so great about it!

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.120
It's believing in the best of humanity and
the effort that's put into that bestness!

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.660
It's about...these two.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.660
This is my mom and dad.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.760
They put so much effort into raising me.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.960
Because they are so awesome that way.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.120
This guy joined the Navy so he 
could help support and raise us,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.180
and my mom...

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.860
she was going to be an opera singer!

00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:00.000
But she had two kids and said "You know what? 
I'm gonna spend my life dedicated to that."

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.620
And that is so unbelievable and that is Christmas!

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.320
That is such goodness!

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.060
There's such goodness in these people.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.560
So, Dad, you got so many people watching right now.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.260
Is there anything you want to say to the "That Guy 
with the Glasses" audience on Christmas Eve here?

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.460
Merry Christmas to all of you.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.660
And most importantly, remember...

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.240
We have lots of merchandise in 
the Channel Awesome country store!

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.560
15% off if your name rhymes with Walker!
-Nice, nice, nice!

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.140
It's gonna be really--yeah, yeah, okay.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.260
That's the kind of ham he is!

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.400
That's the kind of guy that my dad is and you 
can see where I got my terrible sense of humor.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.140
But nonetheless, he has spent--

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.780
[stammering] Come on.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.420
But nonetheless, he has worked so hard to raise us and he has just been so positive, so upbeat,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.580
and I love my dad.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.740
And mom...I got a question for you, it's a question I 
really wanted to save for you because your so loving

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.480
and your so heartfelt and everything.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.700
There's a lot of people out there who don't 
associate Christmas with the best stuff.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.480
Maybe they don't have any friends or 
much family and maybe their spending it alone

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.700
or maybe they associate it with a bad time, there's 
so many bad things that happen out there

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.920
and Christmas is such a good time!

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.160
I know you feel it, you feel it like I feel it.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.860
What can you say to people out there who
are not having such a good Christmas?

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:14.440
Uh, you know, this is the time of year to reach out to someone else who is lonely or is having a hard time.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:21.540
And do something nice for them, because when you do that, you'll feel less lonely inside of yourself as well.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.120
It's the perfect time of year to do something 
for somebody else and think of others.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.840
That's really nice, mom. Thanks so much.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.420
This movie sucks balls...but I love YOU.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.820
Merry Christmas.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.260
Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.220
[soft music fades]

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.580
[Nostalgia Critic Theme plays]

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.100
Thanks so much, guys. Merry Christmas to ya.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.180
[chuckles]

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.180
Who the hell was that?

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.640
[mouthing] I don't know.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.640
Mrs. Mavilda: [shouting] YOU'RE FIRED!
