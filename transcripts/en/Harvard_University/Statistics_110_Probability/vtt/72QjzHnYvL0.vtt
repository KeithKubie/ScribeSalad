00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.510
Today is a pretty sad day for Stat 110
because I just saw in the news that

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.390
a judge in the UK has ruled against
the use of Bayes Rule in court.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.960
So at least it was not in the US.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.810
It was in the UK.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.620
I posted a link on Twitter.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.030
Well, that's a very disturbing case.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.290
I haven't read the full legal ruling yet,
but I intend to.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.080
But my impression is that
the judge kind of didn't like,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.190
maybe the judge, I haven't seen
all the details of the case.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.919
So maybe the judge had a valid point
of like kind of the so called expert

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:44.423
witness was just kind of like estimating
some probabilities and throwing them into

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:48.441
Bayes Rule, and as with anything else,
it's garbage in, garbage out.

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:51.860
If you put in garbage probabilities
in Bayes Rule, you get garbage out.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.417
But sounds like he wrote the opinion
in this case in a kind of sweeping

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:02.890
way that others could use as
a precedent against using Bayes Rule.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.170
So normally I don't wanna inject politics
in this class especially not British

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.632
politics but, I strongly oppose that and
I think that that should be overturned.

00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:16.616
So if any of you have any connections
in the British government or

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:18.950
anything, maybe we can
do something about that.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.110
So, sorry I had to bring you that bad
news, but at least it's not a US case.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.495
So to cheer us up, let's talk more
about universality of the uniform.

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:32.010
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.860
we were doing that at the end last time.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.200
I proved the theorem, but
I did not do an example yet.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.972
And it probably looked a little
bit mysterious last time.

00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:45.930
I mean, the math is perfectly correct and
you could reveal what we did last time.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.130
And hopefully, you can follow every step.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.650
And if you were confused by the proof,
you should review that.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.920
But it's a proof, so
you can't argue with it.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.500
But that doesn't explain what
does it really mean, okay?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.275
So I'm gonna talk a little
bit more about universality.

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:02.500
And a couple other odds and ends and then
we'll get to the normal distribution which

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.840
is the other key continuous distribution
that we need at least before the mid term.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.080
So just to remind you of the statement,
universality of the uniform.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.610
We proved it last time,
I'll just remind you quickly what it said.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.880
It said, well that,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.603
let capital F be a continuous,

00:02:31.603 --> 00:02:35.791
strictly increasing CDF.

00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:39.531
So this is a little bit unusual
compared with what we're used to,

00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:44.850
because we've mostly been starting with
a random variable, then finding the CDF.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.870
But we did talk about the fact that

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.100
any function that's right continuous and
increasing.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.350
And goes to zero if you go to the left,
to minus infinity and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.420
goes to one as you to the right,
as you go to infinity, that's a valid CDF.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.200
So here we're starting with the CDF,
not starting with the random variable, and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.820
I strengthen just to, this result can be
generalized to make it easier to prove.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.710
I assumed it was continuous, remember in
general we just need right continuous, and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.510
I assumed it was strictly increasing,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.390
just makes things nicer not
having to deal with flat regions.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.650
But you know in general a CDF could
be flat and then increase, flat and

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.632
then increase.

00:03:22.632 --> 00:03:26.020
I mean just assuming it keep
increasing and increasing, strictly.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.305
Those are the assumptions, and
then the statement of the theorem is that,

00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:36.950
If we let X = F inverse of (u)
that's the definition of X.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.300
If we let X = F inverse of (u),

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.710
that's gonna have CDF F,
if U is uniform 0,1.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.210
So this says so that's the reason I call
universality cuz you just start with

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.650
any uniform 0,1 random variable,
and at least in principle,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.340
we can synthetically create a random
variable with any distribution we want.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.810
So we're interested in, so
this is useful for simulation, right?

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.513
It's saying,

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:11.490
if we're interested in simulating random
draws from the distribution of F.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.210
One approach to doing that is get some
uniforms which are typically it's easier

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.860
to generate uniforms and to generate other
distributions in the continuous case.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.212
Then compute F inverse of u and
then we're done.

00:04:28.212 --> 00:04:31.780
In practice, this,
in some cases this is very easy.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.540
In many cases, it's gonna be very hard to
analytically write down this F inverse.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.030
But at least in principle, this is saying
from the uniform you can get everything.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.080
So that's conceptually quite nice.

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:51.935
This is also the fundamental reason why
remember we talked about these three

00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:56.555
properties of the CDF, but they didn't
prove the fact that those three

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:59.260
properties are enough to describe a CDF.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.550
If we extend this a little
bit it's saying that

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.250
if we have any function F that satisfies
the properties of a CDF, then it is a CDF.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.790
Okay so I wanted to do an example and

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.950
talk a little bit more about
the intuition behind this.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.050
We proved it last time.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.170
There is kind of a flip side to this.

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:22.530
So that's statement one,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.240
there is another way to write this which
is kind of going the other way around.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.020
Here we started with a uniform 0,1.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.396
We computed F inverse of U, and
we claim that that has CDF F, okay.

00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:39.290
What if we want the other way around and
if we already had X?

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.016
So if we start with X and
we don't have a uniform yet,

00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:45.749
we just have X which has CDF capital F.

00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:54.050
And then, Just to kinda get
an idea of what's going on here.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.220
Just apply F to both sides,
it would say F(x) = u.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.740
So we're going in the opposite direction.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.695
If X is distributed according
to F then if you compute

00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:09.765
F(X) that's gonna be
distributed as uniform 0,1.

00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:19.290
And this looks very mysterious to most
people the first time they see this, okay?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.090
Because there's something beautifully and
bizarrely self referential about this.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.850
What did we do here?

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.980
We took a random variable X and
we plugged it into its own CDF.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.662
So that sounds like kind of
a strange thing to do, okay, but

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:42.480
first make sure that it makes sense
to you, what does that actually mean?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.570
What it means is simply
X is a random variable.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.620
We've talked before about the fact
that a function of a random variable

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.660
is a random variable.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.310
F is just a function, so a function of
a random variable is a random variable.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.600
So that's a perfectly
valid random variable.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.450
That doesn't explain why we
wanna plug X into its own CDF,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.490
but we can do it if we want.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.090
That's a random variable.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.640
And the theorem says that that's
actually gonna be a Unif(0,1).

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.370
Notice of course, there could be
a CDF takes values between 0 and 1.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.470
We know that this is gonna always
take values between 0 and 1.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.100
But it doesn't show it's uniform but

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.250
at least that shows it's going
from 0 to 1 which makes sense.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.700
So, notice also that there's some

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.980
notational difficulty that
you could run into here.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.870
I just wanted to warn you about.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:38.226
Remember the CDF F(x) = P(X is
greater than or equal to x).

00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:42.783
So if you kind of just
blindly plug in X here,

00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:47.597
you would get F(x) = P(X &lt; or equal to X).

00:07:47.597 --> 00:07:52.728
But, so X less than or
equal X, that's an event,

00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:57.152
but that's an event that always happens.

00:07:57.152 --> 00:07:58.580
All right?

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.790
You don't need any kind of
not insider information or

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.820
to do anything to know that it's true.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.410
Big X is less than a little big I
actually didn't have to tell me that

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.500
that's actually one.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.157
But that would say that F of capital
X equals one which is not what we're

00:08:14.157 --> 00:08:17.619
trying to say this is so
this step is actually wrong.

00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:22.285
And it looked very natural to
just plug in capital X, okay?

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:24.870
So that's why you have to
interpret this carefully.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.120
The interpretation is best
seen through an example.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:36.470
So, let's suppose that F of x, F of little
x equals 1- e to the minus little x.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.960
That's a little x here just
am writing x so you can see.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:46.306
f(x)= 1- e to the second of -x for
x greater than 0.

00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:50.070
This is an important CDF called
the exponential distribution,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.720
that we will get to later.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.280
Then if X is negative then
we set it equal to 0.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.380
So this is continuous, and it's strictly
increasing on the positive side,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:07.240
it's just flat at 0 on the negative side,
but the same argument is gonna work.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:14.500
Then the interpretation would
be F(X) = 1- e to the -X, right?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.700
So that's very natural, right,
I just Change little x to big X.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.115
This is the intended interpretation.

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:25.730
So the interpretation of this
expression is that we first evaluate

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:31.090
the function f as a function,
something squared or whatever.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.100
Write it as a function,
then replace little x by big X,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.300
then it won't run into trouble.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.950
We're here, it's just a notational Issue,

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.390
but it can be confusing if you
haven't thought it through carefully.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.180
All right, so this results kind of just
looks like a curiosity at this point, but

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.580
the reason I'm talking about about it is
first of all it's just good practice with

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.090
thinking about the difference between
a random variable and a distribution.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.700
Just to take the effort to understand
what this really means is worthwhile.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.660
Secondly, this result is
quite useful in 111 and

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.510
statistical inference and
I'm not going to get

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.360
into that much because I don't
want to steal 111's thunder.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.430
But the basic idea is simply that

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.620
X may have some complicated or
maybe even unknown distribution.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.800
And if we wanna kind of be
testing a certain model or

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.450
things like that, it may be useful, to be

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.840
able to reduce things to uniform is just
a very simple known standard distribution.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.850
And so it may be useful to
reduce things to uniformity.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.330
And if we generate a lot
of instances of this and

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.760
we find that they don't look uniform,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.150
then we conclude maybe there's something
wrong with the model, that kind of thing.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.110
So it's actually quite useful,
but right now,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.170
I'm just thinking of it more as of
a kind of conceptually neat thing.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.330
Similarly this one here.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.590
Well I just think that's a beautiful
result because it says from uniform

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.530
you can get anything,
which is pretty surprising.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.090
But it's also quite useful for simulation.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.132
So just as an example of how
to use this for simulation

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:17.320
Let's use this distribution here
which I introduced over there.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:23.370
So, let's consider that CDF,
I'll just rewrite it,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.000
cuz it's easy,
1- e to the minus x for x positive.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.420
And that's called the exponential
distribution with parameter 1, which will

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.564
be an important distribution for later,
but you don't have to know it right now.

00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:44.322
And suppose that we have access
to a uniform between 0 and 1,

00:11:44.322 --> 00:11:49.610
and we're interested in simulating
from this distribution.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.410
So we wanna simulate X which
is distributed according to F.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.460
Well, all we have to do
according to this result is

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.960
compute the inverse of this function,
so F inverse of U.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:10.260
Well this is just like high school algebra
finding the inverse function, right?

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.550
So if I set this thing equal to little
u and then this is u in terms of x,

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.000
we just solve for x in terms of u, right?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.180
Then we would get minus log one minus u
just by taking the inverse function, okay?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.680
So, therefore the universality theorem
immediately tells us that f inverse

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:39.200
of capital u,
which is -ln(1- U) has the distribution F.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.790
So if we were doing it on a computer and
we wanted ten random draws from this

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.530
distribution we would just
generate ten iid uniforms and

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.690
then just compute, this is just an easy
function, compute this ten times.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.853
And then we'd have 10 iid random
draws from this distribution, so

00:12:55.853 --> 00:12:57.806
that's how it would be useful.

00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:05.829
While we're talking about
this particular function,

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:10.621
this is a good time to
mention something about 1- u.

00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:16.041
1- u is also uniform 0, 1.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:23.901
So if we want to, we could have just
done minus log of u rather than 1-u,

00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:27.837
that's an important
symmetry of the uniform.

00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:35.035
And you check this easily for yourself,

00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:38.779
just simple good practice with CDFs and
PDFs.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.140
But in terms of a picture,

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.750
if we're picking u is uniform between
0 and 1, let's say it's there.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.110
So use the distance from here to here and
its uniform.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.400
And 1 minus u is from here to here, right?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.510
But there is a symmetry going on so
why do we care if we

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.630
are measuring from the left to the right
or from the right to the left.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.490
It doesn't matter,
We just have a random point, okay?

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.750
So that's the intuitive symmetry, but
you should check the calculation too.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:15.080
In general that's gonna be
true that if we take a + bu,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.910
where a and b are constants and
u is uniform between 0 and 1.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.920
So then we're just doing linear
stuff to it, that will be uniform

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.942
still on some interval,
whatever the appropriate interval is.

00:14:28.942 --> 00:14:33.141
So if we start with the uniform 0,1 and
we want uniform 0 to 10,

00:14:33.141 --> 00:14:36.694
just multiply by 10,
that's very straight forward.

00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:40.156
But like an important common mistake
to be aware of that is that if we do,

00:14:40.156 --> 00:14:43.620
this is like a linear transformation,
if we do something none linear,

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.075
then it's usually not
gonna be uniform anymore.

00:14:46.075 --> 00:14:51.326
Nonlinear usually

00:14:51.326 --> 00:14:56.910
leads to nonuniform.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:01.900
For example, if we squared u, you can
check that it will not be uniform anymore.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.000
And to check that, just compute the CDF,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.630
it doesn't look like the CDF of a uniform,
so it's not uniform.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.470
So that's not gonna be careful
if you can't just say, well,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.800
u squared is between 0 and 1,
so therefore it's uniform.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.720
You have to actually check it, and in that
case, if you check it it's not true, okay?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.480
So that's what this theorem is doing.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.178
It's just saying, in this direction
here's how we can simulate.

00:15:27.178 --> 00:15:35.172
And in this direction, it's saying how do
you go back from x to a uniform, okay?

00:15:35.172 --> 00:15:40.970
So you can kinda convert back and
forth between distributions this way.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:46.100
All right, so let's talk a little
more about independence just

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.990
because I said that, sorry, these
boards are very squeaky in this room.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.330
I said that I'd say something
about independents, so

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.100
I'll still say something
about independents.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.980
We've talked already about
independents of, Events.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.819
And I sent an email about this, I wanted,

00:16:02.819 --> 00:16:06.630
I really wanted to elaborate a little
bit about what's the difference between

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.980
independence of random variables
vs independence of events.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.940
So independence of random variables,
they're closely related,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.170
we just define it directly in
terms of independence of events.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.010
So if we have random
variables X1 through Xn, and

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:30.690
we wanna say what does it mean for
these random variables to be independent?

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.391
Then the definition is that.

00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:37.712
Definition is that they're independent.

00:16:45.542 --> 00:16:49.668
If we look at the probability that X1 is
less than or equal to little x1, blah,

00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:53.090
blah, blah, Xn less than or
equal to little xn.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:58.140
So that's an event right,
it's an intersection of n events, okay?

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.220
Now intuitively, remember
independence intuitively means that

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.470
to find the probability of
an intersection, we just have to multiply.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.031
So what this means is that
we can just multiply,

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.119
notice these are just the CDFs.

00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:21.100
So to compute this probability we just
need to multiply the separate CDF's.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.170
This thing here that I wrote
down is called the joint CDF.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.350
Because this is the CDF of all
the random variables considered

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.620
jointly as one probability thing.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.930
In here we separated it
out into the separate,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.850
these ones are called marginal, we'll
come back to that in a later lecture.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:42.181
But these are just the individual CDFs,
okay, and

00:17:42.181 --> 00:17:46.220
that has to be for
all little x through little n.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:53.700
So actually it looks simpler than
the definition of independence of events.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.470
Cuz remember for independence of events,
if we wanna say three events

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:01.740
are independent, we talked about the fact
that we have to the triple intersection.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.490
But that's not enough, right,
we also need all the pairwise ones.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.195
And here I didn't bother writing
any pairwise statements or

00:18:09.195 --> 00:18:11.890
three-way statements,
I just have everything all in one.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.260
So it looks simpler which would
seem strange at first, but

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.860
the way to resolve that is that
this is for all X1 through Xn.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.530
So even though it looks simpler,

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.400
actually I've written down
uncountably many equations.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.070
And then in the case of just independence
of events, it's a large list, but

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.010
a finite list of equations.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.630
Here we have infinitely many equations, it
just looks like one equation cuz it's for

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.540
all X1 through Xn.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:43.724
All right, so that's the definition
of independence in general,

00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:51.330
but in the discrete case, usually it's
easier to work with PMFs rather than CDFs.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.910
And so then we work with what's
called the joint PMF, where,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.360
I'm just going to write
the same equation again.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.760
Except I'm gonna replace less than or
equal by equal.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.660
So that's just the product of the PMFs.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.243
So this thing here is
called the joint PMF.

00:19:19.602 --> 00:19:22.790
And in the discrete case,
these two things are equivalent.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.830
Proving they're equivalent,
there's nothing difficult about it,

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.385
it's just a little bit
tedious to write down.

00:19:28.385 --> 00:19:33.600
Cuz you have to write up the appropriate
sums to convert between these things.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.230
And it works out, and

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.380
the intuition that it should work
out should be very, very clear.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.980
Because what this is saying is,
what this statement says is that,

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:50.570
knowing any collections,
any subcollection of these Xs,

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:55.850
knowing their values tells us
nothing about the other ones, right?

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.530
And this says the same thing.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.385
So this is stronger than
just pairwise independence.

00:20:01.385 --> 00:20:05.080
Pairwise independence would say
if you know one random variable,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.690
doesn't tell you any information
about any other one random variable.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.460
Full independence means
knowing any of them,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.810
any collection of them tells you
nothing about ones that you don't know.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.140
No information whatsoever.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.210
So that's a stronger statement.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:27.540
And just to give you a quick example
where, pairwise independence

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:34.010
doesn't imply independence, here's
the simplest example I know of that.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.610
Let's just let X1 and X2 be iid coin

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.540
flips, that is Bernoulli
one half fair coins.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:50.870
So if you want, just think of
flipping a fair coin twice, and

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.320
then this is kind of like
an old game that people used to

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.020
play called matching pennies.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.540
Where each person like you know pulls out
a penny and see whether it's the same, or

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.570
not one person wins if they're the same.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.190
And if there both heads or both tales
the other person wins otherwise.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.238
I think that used to be a popular game but
not so popular anymore.

00:21:10.238 --> 00:21:15.170
However, that suggests another random

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:20.440
variable which is a natural one to look
at, that is just are they the same or not?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:29.013
So let's let X3 equal 1 if X1
equals X2 and 0 otherwise.

00:21:33.662 --> 00:21:36.588
So that's just saying, 1 if,
if the two pennies match,

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:39.906
0 otherwise that's an indicator
of a random variable, right?

00:21:39.906 --> 00:21:44.087
So okay, these are pairwise

00:21:44.087 --> 00:21:49.320
independent but not independent.

00:21:55.287 --> 00:22:00.667
It's obvious that they're not
independent because if I know X1 and

00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:05.460
X2 I immediately know X3,
X3 is a function of X1 and X2.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.460
So not only does it give me information,
it gives me total information.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.170
So knowing X1 and
X2 give us total information about X3.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:20.450
However, just knowing X1 tells us
nothing about X2 because those,

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.030
I assumed, are independent.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:28.300
Just knowing X1 tells us nothing about
X3 because it's still 50-50, right?

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.570
If we know that X1 is 1,
then this just reduces to saying X2 is 1,

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.570
in order for this to be 1 but
that's still 50-50.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.510
So similarly X2 is independent of X3.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.770
So they're pairwize independent but
they're not independent.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.250
So, I just said in words why that's true,
but you can try

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:51.310
checking what happens with these
equations, why does that agree with that?

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.690
So, pairwise independence isn't enough
in general just to have independence.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:03.130
All right, so, the other thing we
were doing last time was LOTUS,

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.150
and we are gonna talk more about LOTUS,
definitely on Wednesday.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.530
But I wanted to start on
the normal distribution first,

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.720
which is both important and

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.240
also a good distribution to have on
hand when we're doing more LOTUS stuff.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.080
Okay, so here's the normal distribution.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:28.760
Now it's also called the Gaussian but
I don't call it the Gaussian.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.650
Because first of all the Gauss was one of
the greatest mathematicians of all time,

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.030
he has enough stuff
named after him already.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.510
And secondly, he was not the first
person to use this distribution.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.140
So it is not really fair
to give him credit, so

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.760
we call it the normal distribution.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.750
But I'm just mentioning that because
you may see the term Gaussian and

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.520
it's the same thing.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:53.740
The normal distribution
is by far the most famous

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.770
important distribution
in all of statistics.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.830
And There are many reasons for that.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:07.633
The most famous reason for that is
what's called the central limit theorem,

00:24:07.633 --> 00:24:11.751
which we're gonna do towards
the end of the semester.

00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:15.427
But I'm just gonna tell you in words,
intuitively, what it is now.

00:24:15.427 --> 00:24:19.510
Just to kind of foreshadow it, just so
you have a sense of why is this important.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.390
Then we'll go into the details of
it much much later in the course.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:28.201
Central limit theorem,
The central limit theorem is

00:24:28.201 --> 00:24:31.937
possibly the most famous and important
theorem in all of probability, so

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:34.300
we're definitely gonna
talk about it later.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.016
And it's kind of a very,
very surprising result.

00:24:39.016 --> 00:24:44.330
What it says is that if you add up
a bunch of iid random variables,

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.930
the distribution is gonna look
like a normal distribution.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.991
So this is just one distribution,
or one family of distributions,

00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:54.279
cuz you can also shift it and scale it.

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:59.062
Asides from the shift and scale,
it says that adding up the large number of

00:24:59.062 --> 00:25:02.784
iid random variables,
it's always gonna look normal.

00:25:02.784 --> 00:25:06.933
Which is kind of very, very shocking,
I think, because it seems like,

00:25:06.933 --> 00:25:10.211
I didn't say I was adding
continuous random variables.

00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:13.973
They could be continuous, they could
be discrete, they could be beautiful,

00:25:13.973 --> 00:25:14.950
they could be ugly.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.647
They could be anything,
you add them up and

00:25:16.647 --> 00:25:18.639
then it's always gonna
look like the same shape.

00:25:18.639 --> 00:25:21.387
And that shape is the one
you've all seen before,

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:23.960
it's just the standard bell-shaped curve.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.108
But there are different curves you
could draw that look like bell curves.

00:25:27.108 --> 00:25:30.755
So why does this one
particular bell-shaped curve,

00:25:30.755 --> 00:25:35.872
comes up always as the only possibility,
that's what this theorem says.

00:25:35.872 --> 00:25:39.360
So sum of a lot,
I'll make this precise much later,

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.788
when we actually state it as a theorem and
prove it.

00:25:42.788 --> 00:25:50.040
But just intuitively, sum of a lot of
iid random variables looks normal.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.694
And by looks, I mean if you look
at what's the distribution,

00:25:54.694 --> 00:25:57.513
it's gonna be approximately
a normal distribution.

00:26:00.284 --> 00:26:05.410
And there are even further generalizations
of this, going beyond the iid case.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.385
You need some technical assumptions, but

00:26:09.385 --> 00:26:12.855
there are generalizations
even beyond this, okay?

00:26:12.855 --> 00:26:16.490
So that's one reason that the normal is so
fundamental, and

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.354
then there are others as well.

00:26:18.354 --> 00:26:21.590
Okay, so let's draw a little picture.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:26.547
So it's gonna look like,
the PDF is just gonna look

00:26:26.547 --> 00:26:31.275
like this nice symmetrical
bell-shape curve,

00:26:31.275 --> 00:26:34.631
but there are many possible PDFs.

00:26:34.631 --> 00:26:38.274
So as long as this thing is supposed
to be symmetric, it's more or

00:26:38.274 --> 00:26:42.710
less symmetric the way I drew it,
but it's exactly symmetric.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:47.370
As long as the area is 1, I mean, there's
millions of different possible PDFs that

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.450
you can come up with that
look basically like this.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:54.270
The normal is this specific
one that's given by, let's

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.750
start with what's called the standard
normal, which is written as N(0,1).

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.890
This notation means that the mean is 0 and
the variance is 1, but

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.460
we'll prove that later.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.300
Okay, so the normal has two parameters,
which are the mean and the variance.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.924
And we're gonna start
with the standard normal,

00:27:12.924 --> 00:27:17.506
which is mean 0, variance 1,
and let's write down its PDF.

00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:26.359
The PDF is f(z).

00:27:29.497 --> 00:27:34.078
It's kind of a tradition
of using the letter z for

00:27:34.078 --> 00:27:38.730
standard normals,
not that you have to do that.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.990
But often we'll use z for
standard normals,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.460
that's why I'm calling it z rather than x.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.158
So, well,
it's gonna be e to the -z squared over 2.

00:27:49.158 --> 00:27:55.886
If you plot this function,
just using your old calculus techniques.

00:27:55.886 --> 00:28:00.104
Find the derivative, and the second
derivative, and the points of inflection,

00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:01.460
and so on, and plot this.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.560
Or better yet,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.050
just using graphing calculator,
you'll get something that looks like this.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.900
That's not yet a PDF, though,
because it doesn't integrate to 1.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.270
So I'm just going to put
some constant here, c.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:18.796
Where c is whatever constant we need,
that's called the normalizing constant.

00:28:18.796 --> 00:28:22.349
It's whatever constant we need
such that the area will be 1.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.444
So you can plot this thing and you see
it will look like this, that doesn't yet

00:28:29.444 --> 00:28:31.070
show, why do we choose this?

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.030
I mean,
it's a nice looking function, right?

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:40.274
We can see that it's symmetrical, because
if we replace z by -z, nothing happens.

00:28:40.274 --> 00:28:43.576
We can see that it will go to 0 very,
very fast.

00:28:43.576 --> 00:28:46.180
Because exponential decay's already fast,
and

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.540
here it's being squared
up in the exponent.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:55.550
So it's gonna decay to 0 very, very fast,
as z gets very positive or very negative.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.670
So it's a nice enough looking function,
but

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:03.180
it will be much later when we see
why this is the most important PDF.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:09.030
Right now it's just a PDF with
an unknown normalizing constant, okay?

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.980
So before we can get
much further with this,

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.960
it would be useful to know the value of c.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.321
So let's try to get
the normalizing constant.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.618
So that might be a long calculation,
so I'll try to do that over here.

00:29:27.618 --> 00:29:32.540
So we need to know,
in order to make this integrate to 1,

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.142
we just need to integrate this function.

00:29:36.142 --> 00:29:37.990
So let's try to do this integral.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:46.599
We wanna know the integral,
from minus infinity to infinity,

00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:50.715
of e to the -z squared over 2, dz.

00:29:53.707 --> 00:29:59.258
Okay, so that's actually
a famous integral in mathematics.

00:29:59.258 --> 00:30:01.462
Partly because of probability and
statistics, but

00:30:01.462 --> 00:30:02.720
partly just in its own right.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.930
This seems like something we
should be able to integrate.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.472
So of course, you can try doing,
I could use substitution or

00:30:12.472 --> 00:30:16.848
some other kind of change of variables,
it will not work.

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:18.756
You could try doing integration by parts,

00:30:18.756 --> 00:30:21.730
and you know there's many ways
to try integration by parts.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.411
You can try to split it up in some way,
it will not work.

00:30:25.411 --> 00:30:27.512
Anything else you could ever think of,

00:30:27.512 --> 00:30:30.059
let's say we want to find
an antiderivative and

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:34.400
let's use the fundamental theorem of
calculus, the usual way we do integrals.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.930
I can guarantee you that they won't work.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.880
The reason is that there is actually
a theorem that says that this integral,

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.680
as an indefinite integral,
that is without the limits of integration,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.620
is impossible to do it in closed form.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:54.510
And it's kind of pretty amazing, I think,
that someone was able to prove that.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.280
It's not just like,
no one's thought of a way to do it.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:04.610
Someone proved that you can't ever do it,
so don't even try.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.768
And what I mean by, well,
to qualify that a bit,

00:31:06.768 --> 00:31:09.335
there is one way we could do
this integral that will work.

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:14.180
And that is the definite integral,
that is, that's e to a power.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.190
So we've been using the Taylor series for
e to a power over and

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.640
over again,
that series converges everywhere, okay?

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.100
So if we want, we could just expand
this out as a Taylor series.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.073
And the way to do that would not be
to start taking derivatives of this.

00:31:28.073 --> 00:31:31.208
It would be to take the Taylor series for
e to the x, and

00:31:31.208 --> 00:31:33.384
then plug in x is -z squared over 2.

00:31:33.384 --> 00:31:36.699
Well, we'll get an infinite series, and

00:31:36.699 --> 00:31:42.605
then with some analysis you can
justify integrating that term-by-term.

00:31:42.605 --> 00:31:46.506
That is, we replace this by an infinite
sum and then integrate each term.

00:31:46.506 --> 00:31:48.895
And those are all very,
very easy integrals,

00:31:48.895 --> 00:31:51.046
because that's just polynomial stuff.

00:31:51.046 --> 00:31:53.165
But then we just get
this infinite series and

00:31:53.165 --> 00:31:55.610
we wouldn't know what to do with it, okay?

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.554
So when I say this integral is impossible,

00:31:57.554 --> 00:32:00.039
it means that it's impossible
to do it in closed form.

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:04.070
That is, just as a finite sum In terms
of what are called elementary functions.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:08.000
By elementary we mean just the familiar
functions, sine and cosine and

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.660
exponential and log and
polynomials and stuff.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.040
And anything you can write down in terms
of standard functions you can't do.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.620
Okay, so this is impossible
as a indefinite integral.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.580
But that doesn't rule out all hope
that we could do the definite

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.720
integral right that is we might be
able to find the area under the curve

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.330
without first finding anti derivative.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.010
We will not be able to find
an anti derivative enclosed for

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:35.470
them because it's impossible.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.920
Okay but we can try to find an area.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.980
All right so
how do we find the area under the curve.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:46.060
So we have this function here
which looks kinda like that, and

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.730
we want to know this area here from
minus infinity to infinity, and so

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.720
we write down this integral and
we can't find an antiderivative, and

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.670
at this point if I didn't already know
how to do this I would probably be stuck.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.630
Because that seems very difficult.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.220
Though the way we're use to doing this
would be find an anti-derivative, right?

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.658
So we're kind of basically
stuck at this point.

00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:18.410
And so someone, and I wish I knew who,
someone came up with

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.439
an incredibly stupid and an incredibly
brilliant way to solve this integral.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:31.110
This method does not usually work,
but in this problem it does.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.640
And that method is we have this
problem that we can't do, so

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.080
we write it down a second time.

00:33:44.921 --> 00:33:49.673
[COUGH] Now that solution may have just
looked like kind of like banging your head

00:33:49.673 --> 00:33:50.830
against the wall.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:55.040
That you can't do the integral so you
keep writing it down over and over again.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.970
That doesn't seem like it
would help the situation.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.660
Actually, this solves the whole problem.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:05.370
So let me show you why this trick of
just writing down the same thing twice

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:06.790
solves this problem.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.130
Well, let's just change
the notation a little bit.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.090
This letter z here is what's
called a dummy variable.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.230
You can change x to whatever you want.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.570
This is just notation for
area under the curve so just so

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:23.820
I can keep track of this is my.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:28.200
First integral that I can't do and
this is my second integral I can't do.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.190
Am gonna change the notation to X Andy so
I can tear them apart.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:37.060
So this is e to the minus X
to the second over two dx and

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:42.860
this is integral Either -y squared
over two dy it's exact same thing.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.840
Now let's write this as one integral.

00:34:52.247 --> 00:34:56.623
So this is a double integral but if you
haven't dealt with double integrals much

00:34:56.623 --> 00:34:59.070
as they said on the first day of class.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.070
It's nothing to worry about just do
single integrals one after the other.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.860
This also can be written as the double
integral of e to the minus x squared

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.250
plus y squared over 2 dxdy where

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.995
the interpretation of this double Integral
is that first we do the inner integral,

00:35:15.995 --> 00:35:19.665
keeping y held constant, and
then do the outer integral.

00:35:19.665 --> 00:35:24.425
That's the exact same thing because if you
imagine rewriting this as a product again,

00:35:24.425 --> 00:35:28.125
when we're doing this inner integral,
we're holding y constant so

00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.860
we can just pull that out.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.850
And then what we have left here
is one of these intervals, so

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:36.280
you can pull that interval out,
it would be the exact same thing.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.400
So I've written it as a double interval.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:44.030
It still doesn't look so much easier, but

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:48.370
then there's one thing
that is saving us here.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:51.110
That's the fact that we have
this X squared plus Y squared.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.520
Whenever you see an x
squared plus y squared,

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.800
it should remind you of
the Pythagorean theorem, right?

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.080
Sums of squares, so
we draw a simple little picture.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.670
Let's say, suppose x,
y is up here just for simplicity.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.110
Of course, they could be in any quadrant.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:08.965
So here's x, here's y.

00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:13.260
And if we let r^2=x^2+y^2,

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:20.830
I'm using the letter r for radius, that
is just the distance from here to here.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.570
Right it's just the distance formula,
just basic geometry and

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:30.440
there there's some angle theta
The fact that we have r squared

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:36.020
sitting right there is a hint that it may
be useful to convert to polar coordinates.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:40.490
Polar coordinates just says,
represent points in terms of a radius and

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:44.190
an angle rather than in terms of
the cartesian coordinates of x and y.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:49.000
So we're going to convert from x,y to
r theta, that is polar coordinates.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:57.570
So our limits of integration
are gonna change, so,

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.420
first of all what is that thing
that's just e to the- r squared /2.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:04.030
And we we are gonna
integrate as drd theta.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:08.100
We can also do d theta dr,
and theta is this angle so

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.580
that's gonna go from zero to two pi.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.380
And r is this length, so
r goes from zero to infinity.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.760
And then there's one
other thing we need here,

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.740
which is something that, one of the very
few facts from multi-variable calculus

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.880
that we need in this course is what
happens when you transform in more than

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.910
one dimension you You need to multiply
by something here called the Jacobean.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.520
And I discussed this on
the math review handout.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.780
So if you're not familiar with
this you can review that handout.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.480
And I actually do this particular
case of this transformation.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.850
Cuz this is a very common transformation,
convert to polar coordinates.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:53.730
Okay, so if we do that What
the Jacobian here works our to r.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.030
That's just a little calculation.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.170
If you haven't seen it before,

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:02.270
then you can read about it in the math
review handout or in a calculus book.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:03.750
So that's called the Jacobian.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.760
So we don't just replace
dxdy by dr d theta,

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.950
we replace it by r dr d theta
is the correct way to do it.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.130
That is what now makes this from

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.130
go from being a very hard
problem to a very easy problem.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.590
As soon as we have the R here

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.890
then that just suggests well look if
the derivative of R squared is two R.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:30.450
So we have kind of the derivative
sitting right here.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.480
The derivative of what's up in
the exponent is just sitting right there.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.200
Now it's just an easy
substitution integral.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:42.110
So this is the integral
from zero to two pi.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:48.460
Now let's just do this inner integral,
and then we have a d theta at the end.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.730
So just doing this inner integral,

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:59.535
Let's just let u = r squared over two.

00:38:59.535 --> 00:39:01.968
So du=rdr, okay?

00:39:01.968 --> 00:39:09.782
So rdr is what we have there, so

00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:16.100
that's just the integral of zero
to infinity, e to the minus u, du.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.330
Now that's a really easy integral.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:24.600
Integral of e to the minus u is minus u to
the minus u so this integral is just one.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.110
So what are we doing?

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.110
We are integrating one from
zero to two pi that's two pi.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.630
And lastly, we just notice well,
that's not the integral we started with,

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.490
that's the square of
the interval we started with.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.980
So therefore, the integral for
minus infinity to infinity of e to

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:55.040
the minus e squared over 2, dz Since
we've wrote it down twice we got 2 pi,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.130
if we had written it once we would
get the square root of 2 pi.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.170
So that's what we need for
the normalizing constant.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:04.510
All right.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.760
So now we know what the C is.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.382
C = 1 over square root of 2pi.

00:40:12.934 --> 00:40:15.624
Kind of amazing,
first of all that this trick worked.

00:40:15.624 --> 00:40:21.048
And secondly,
we're integrating an exponential.

00:40:21.048 --> 00:40:24.900
And suddenly we get square root of pi,
where did the pi come from?

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.390
Where did the circle come?

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.810
pi makes you think of circle,
where did the circle come from?

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:33.160
Circle came from the fact that
we're using polar coordinates.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.550
So some way the pi appears.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.630
All right, so that's nice.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.920
Now we know the normalizing constant.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.330
So that's the standard
normal distribution.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:47.140
Let's compute its mean and variance and
then we can talk a little bit about

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:51.570
the general normal as opposed
to the standard normal, okay?

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.480
So that's the standard normal.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.010
Let's compute its mean and variance.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.870
I've already claimed
that the mean is zero.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.610
And the variance is one, but
we haven't checked that yet.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.060
So let's verify that, okay?

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.400
So, first of all let's get the mean.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.670
The mean is easy.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:24.110
So we're gonna let z be standard normal,
and sorry for the pun.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.750
We're gonna compute EZ,
which I said is easy.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:27.960
Why is it easy?

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.343
It's easy because of symmetry.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.069
By definition the mean is
the expected value of Z times

00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:45.840
the PDF which we now know is
1 over square root of 2pi.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.411
Which I can take out
cuz that's a constant.

00:41:47.411 --> 00:41:52.395
e to the -z square, where over 2dz = 0.

00:41:52.395 --> 00:41:54.180
That was an easy integral.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:54.898
Why is it 0?

00:41:54.898 --> 00:41:56.690
Well, I just said it's by symmetry.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.740
And the general type of
symmetry we're using here.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.360
Is that if we have an odd function.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.551
Let's say g of just as
a general statement.

00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:17.670
If g(x) is an odd function,
which I'll remind you.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.972
Means that it has the symmetry property.

00:42:19.972 --> 00:42:22.040
That g(-x) = -g(x).

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.590
That's the definition of an odd function.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.220
An even function would be if we
do not have a minus sign here.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.830
That's the definition of an odd function.

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:35.250
Then if we integrate g symmetrically.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:40.380
Let's say, from -a to a,
where that's the same from -a to a,

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.880
not from just any a to b, of course.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.253
We'll always get 0.

00:42:47.328 --> 00:42:51.080
And you can do that by splitting this
up into two integrals and check that.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.880
But the easiest way to see that
is just like, as an example.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.250
For example, sine is an odd function.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:03.987
And if you have something that looks
like that where this is symmetrical.

00:43:03.987 --> 00:43:06.108
And you say,
you integrate from there to there,

00:43:06.108 --> 00:43:08.504
then the negative area cancels
out the positive area.

00:43:08.504 --> 00:43:10.130
And so it's true.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.790
Or you can verify it by
splitting up into two integrals.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.530
The positive area cancels
the negative area.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.890
Well, this is an odd function, right?

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:24.340
Because if I replace z by minus, this
thing I'm integrating, is an odd function.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.090
So if I replace z by -z, nothing
happens to the exponential part, and

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.118
that becomes -z.

00:43:29.118 --> 00:43:30.387
So it's an odd function.

00:43:30.387 --> 00:43:32.709
So just by symmetry,
you can immediately say 0,

00:43:32.709 --> 00:43:34.880
without having to do
some nasty calculation.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.390
All right, so that's good.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.022
But let's try to get the variance.

00:43:42.087 --> 00:43:44.912
Variance is gonna take a little more work.

00:43:49.031 --> 00:43:55.938
So the Var(Z) = E(Z
squared)- (EZ) squared.

00:43:55.938 --> 00:43:59.715
The other way, but
that second part we just showed is zero.

00:43:59.715 --> 00:44:01.626
So that's just E(Z squared).

00:44:01.626 --> 00:44:06.205
So, now is where we're
starting to need LOTUS again.

00:44:06.205 --> 00:44:08.863
I'll remind you,
we haven't proven what LOTUS yet.

00:44:08.863 --> 00:44:10.425
But we'll talk about that on Wednesday.

00:44:10.425 --> 00:44:11.975
Here I just wanna show how to use it.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.026
Lotus says that if we want E(Z squared),

00:44:16.026 --> 00:44:19.271
we do not first need to
find the PDF of Z squared.

00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:22.097
We can directly work on
in terms of the PDF of Z.

00:44:22.097 --> 00:44:23.730
That's what we talked about last time.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:26.866
So we know immediately that
this is just the integral,

00:44:26.866 --> 00:44:29.880
I'll take out the 1 over
square root of 2pi again.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:36.450
Integral minus infinity to infinity
z squared e- z squared/2 dz.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.090
So it was exactly the same integral
except I replaced z by z squared.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.110
That's why it's called the law
of the unconscious statistician,

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.200
cuz that's just kind of an obvious
thing to do, just plug in z squared.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.750
Lotus says that, that is in fact valid.

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.810
Okay, so
now we just have to do this integral.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.940
This integral,
this is now an even function.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.610
Which is nice but
not as nice as having an odd function.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:10.915
So with an even function if we want,

00:45:10.915 --> 00:45:15.411
we can integrate from
zero to infinity instead.

00:45:15.411 --> 00:45:17.980
And I think I'd rather do that.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.130
It's not necessary to convert it this way
but I'd rather integrate from zero to

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:25.830
infinity just so that I can avoid thinking
about negative numbers for a while.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.140
Let's go from 0 to infinity and
multiply by 2.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:33.000
Since it's an even function,
that's perfectly correct, cuz we have

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.720
a positive area, a positive area and so
by symmetry, it's the same thing twice.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.693
So just twice the area from 0
to infinity of the same thing.

00:45:41.693 --> 00:45:46.490
Z squared e (-Z squared)/2 dz,

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:54.083
now here I think we need to
resort to integration by parts.

00:45:54.083 --> 00:45:57.560
Which usually I try to avoid, but
once in a while we can't avoid it.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:04.660
This integral, so
just in terms of the strategy for

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.340
using integration by parts,
remember with your integration by parts,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.320
you need to split
the integrand into two pieces.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.440
One piece that's easy to integrate, and
one piece that's easy to differentiate.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.231
Now Z squared is easy to
do whatever we want with,

00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:22.472
the part we should focus on is this thing.

00:46:22.472 --> 00:46:24.230
And we don't know how to integrate that.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:28.910
We know how to integrate it from
minus infinity to infinity,

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:33.060
but we don't know how to integrate
it in general over some interval.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.090
But we saw over in this
calculation we just did that if

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.860
there were an extra z here,
then it's a really easy integral.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:46.070
So we're gonna split this z squared
into two zs, zz there, okay?

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:51.980
Now we're in good shape because this
thing, we could let this thing be

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:56.840
u and this thing be dv, right?

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.340
Because that's something
we know how to integrate.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:05.070
So in other words,
we're letting u = z, so du = dz.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.750
That's really simple.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:14.129
And we're letting dv =
ze to the -z squared/2,

00:47:14.129 --> 00:47:18.767
so v = e to the -z squared/2.

00:47:18.767 --> 00:47:22.465
And to check that if we take
the derivative of this,

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:25.221
there should be a minus sign in front.

00:47:25.221 --> 00:47:29.900
If we take the derivative of this by
the chain rule, we get that, right?

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.240
So, okay.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.980
So, therefore, now we're in good
shape to do integration by parts.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.210
So this is just your usual
integration by parts thing.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:48.507
It's 2 over root od 2pi times
(uv) integrated from 0 to,

00:47:48.507 --> 00:47:52.825
evaluated from 0 to infinity.

00:47:52.825 --> 00:47:58.964
And then minus the integral of VDU, but
that's minus a minus because of that,

00:47:58.964 --> 00:48:04.037
so we're going to do minus Minus this plus

00:48:04.037 --> 00:48:10.052
the integral of e to the -z squared

00:48:10.052 --> 00:48:15.869
over 2 dz, from 0 to infinity.

00:48:15.869 --> 00:48:19.575
Okay, now we're actually
done with this calculation,

00:48:19.575 --> 00:48:23.910
because all we have to do is say,
that's the integral we just did.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.700
The only difference is that
we're going from 0 to infinity,

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.720
instead of minus infinity to infinity.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:35.030
This part is just 0, because if you look
at what is this near 0, this part is 0 and

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:41.466
this part is close to 1, or close to -1.

00:48:41.466 --> 00:48:46.120
When z is very large,
then this part's exponentially small, so

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:46.920
this part is just 0.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.204
So we only have to concentrate on this
part, but that's what we just did.

00:48:50.204 --> 00:48:53.724
This is one half of the integral
that we just computed, right?

00:48:53.724 --> 00:48:56.969
So it's one-half of square root of 2 pi,
and

00:48:56.969 --> 00:49:01.310
we multiply one-half square
root of 2 pi by this, we get 1.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:07.220
So this whole thing just becomes 1,
cuz it's just this times its reciprocal.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:12.095
So what this showed was that
the variance is equal to 1,

00:49:12.095 --> 00:49:15.955
which is what I said here, so that's good.

00:49:15.955 --> 00:49:19.581
All right, so a couple more very
quick things about the normal,

00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:21.672
and then we'll continue next time.

00:49:21.672 --> 00:49:28.275
Just for an important piece of notation,
this is standard notation in statistics

00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:37.214
The notation is that, is for the CDF,

00:49:37.214 --> 00:49:42.867
capital Phi is the standard normal CDF.

00:49:42.867 --> 00:49:47.433
Because this distribution is so
important, and yet so

00:49:47.433 --> 00:49:53.496
hard to deal with in the sense that
it's a lot of work to do that integral.

00:49:53.496 --> 00:49:57.798
And now it's going from minus infinity to
infinity, then it deserves its own name.

00:49:57.798 --> 00:50:03.545
So in other words,
Phi(z) equals 1 over root 2 pi,

00:50:05.854 --> 00:50:12.250
Times the integral from minus infinity up
to z, of e to the -t squared over 2 dt.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:17.010
I just changed the letter to a t,
to avoid clashing with this z here.

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:19.769
So that's just the CDF, right?

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:27.483
Because this function is so important,
this CDF is very easy to calculate

00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:32.222
using various computer or calculators,
very easy to find tables of this.

00:50:32.222 --> 00:50:35.979
So in a sense, we got around the problem
that we couldn't do this integral by just

00:50:35.979 --> 00:50:39.647
saying, call this Phi(z), and now just
treat that as a standard function.

00:50:39.647 --> 00:50:43.499
And now we can do this integral,
it's just capital Phi, right, so

00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:46.060
that's standard notation for that.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.820
And one other remark about that is,
what happens if we get Phi(-z)?

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.688
This is something you should check for
yourself,

00:50:52.688 --> 00:50:56.565
Phi(-z) equals 1- Phi(z), by symmetry.

00:50:56.565 --> 00:51:00.119
And just for practice in
the concept of symmetry, and CDFs,

00:51:00.119 --> 00:51:02.289
you should check this for yourself.

00:51:02.289 --> 00:51:05.130
Just draw a picture and
see why that's true, it's a useful fact.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.876
All right, so next time we'll continue
with the non-standard normal,

00:51:07.876 --> 00:51:08.990
and that's the standard normal
