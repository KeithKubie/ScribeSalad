00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.940
If you look at the sky after sunset,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.840
and you see something very bright
glowing near the horizon,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.560
and you say:
- Oh my God. What's that?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.400
It's almost certain to be Venus.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400
It's one of the brightest objects in the sky.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.400
We call it the evening star or the morning star

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.040
because it's close to the sun in the solar system.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.600
It tends to follow the Sun,
or precede it, in sunrise.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.078
So the symbol for Venus is
actually a hand mirror,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.060
because Venus was the roman goddess
of love and beauty.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.440
And we see this symbol all over the place,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.900
not just in astronomy, because it's culturally now our symbol for woman,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.680
or for femininity.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.960
And this is counterbalanced by the symbol for Mars,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.460
which people recognize as a symbol for men.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.960
It's a circle with an arrow coming out of it,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.260
and that is representing the shield and the spear,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.480
because Mars was the roman god of war.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.400
So these are the symbols that have come out of astronomy into everyday life, meaning male and female.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.620
It's often called our sister planet,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.640
because it's right next door to Earth.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.720
It's the next planet closest to the Sun.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.500
And it's also almost the same size as Earth,
which is interesting.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.140
And it has an atmosphere,
like Earth does as well.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.540
But it's not a place that
you would want to go on holiday.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.520
Not at all.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.560
Because the atmosphere is actually
almost entirely carbon dioxide.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.940
And so, what we see on Venus is
actually a runaway greenhouse effect.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.160
So, that atmosphere is very good at
trapping the heat from the sun and keeping it there.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.960
So Venus is incredibly hot,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.740
and, in the surface of Venus, the temperatures
are high enough to melt lead.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.040
And, with that, there is an incredible
atmospheric pressure.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.080
So, by standing on the surface of Venus, 
you would feel the same amount of pressure

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.100
as if you were 800 meters
below the surface of the sea.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.740
Above that
(if that's not enough to put off your holiday plans),

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.440
the atmosphere rains sulfuric acid.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.340
So basically it's not a very hospitable place to be.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.660
Even though it's one of the closer planets to us,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.880
it's very unlikely that we're probably going to send human beings there in the year,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.660
or even in the far future.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.120
"Now in an unexplored region of space,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.340
Mariner was placed on its Mercury intercept course by the gravity of Venus."

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.680
So it's hard for us to see the surface of Venus,
or it's impossible for us,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.200
because it has this really thick atmosphere.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.280
So we've actually
(we being humanity,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.080
mostly the Americans and the former Soviet Union),

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.800
have sent a number of probes to Venus,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.080
all way back from the 60s through the 70s.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.400
Some of those orbited and used radar
to pierce the clouds,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.980
and some of them even managed to land.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.200
Now this was a very difficult piece of
engineering to accomplish,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.060
because the conditions there are so harsh.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.900
And, in fact, the earlier landers
didn't make it very far.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.400
They were crushed by the incredible pressure,
or melted by the temperature.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.860
But some of them did actually make it
down there.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.140
So we do actually have pictures
of the surface of Venus.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.060
"Nasa's Mariner Spacecraft, after traveling
four months and 217 million miles,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.660
began fulfilling its mission as it rendezvous with the planet Venus"

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:37.340
This year, in 2009, is the 400th anniversary of Galileo taking a telescope and pointing it at the heavens.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.580
And one of the things that he observed,
which was very important, was

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.140
he managed to observe
the full phases of Venus.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.980
So Venus, like the Moon, undergoes phases,
from our point of view,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.360
because it changes its position relative to the Sun.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.460
And at Galileo's time, we were still working
under this idea of the universe where

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.020
the Earth was at the center.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.260
And his observations of Venus undergoing this full spectrum of phases didn't fit in with that picture at all.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.060
And, in fact, that was one of the greatest pieces of evidence that they had that that system was wrong,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.580
and that we had to move our
understanding of the universe,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.560
away from the Earth being the center
towards the sun being the center.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.480
So for me that observation of Venus, it just
goes to show what astronomy does.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:40.100
Astronomy makes us change the way 
we see ourselves, as part of a larger universe,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.280
And simply by taking a telescope, pointing it at the heavens, and seeing something new that didn't fit,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.700
we had to change our entire worldview.
