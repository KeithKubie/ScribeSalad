00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.170
SPEAKER: The more we
understand the neurochemistry

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.160
of lived experience,
the more we realize

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.320
that we don't get to
ever really sample

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.540
any kind of objective
reality, right?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.790
Reality is coupled
to perception,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.259
and perception can
be mediated, right?

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.040
Certain music can change
the way we process a scene.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.080
A moment can seem
truthful or dishonest,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.910
depending on the tone,
depending on whether it's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.650
cloudy or sunny, depending
on the place in which you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.450
happen to dwell, right?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.500
So again, reality is
mediated by perception.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.850
Perception can be manipulated.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.440
And so brilliant people-- people
who change the world-- leaders,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.910
right-- are said to have
this thing known as a reality

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.430
distortion field, right?

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.810
Steve Jobs was
made famous for it.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.100
His ability to distort.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.830
To italicize perception
in his co-workers, right?

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.920
To inspire somebody to see
the world in a new way, right?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.950
To literally engage the
attention of all these body

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.260
minds, and present with them
an alternative universe.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.690
To make people-- to bring
them into your world,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.170
to suck them into
your trance, right,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.430
and literally engage them to
probe the adjacent possible.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.600
To gnaw at that
shadow future that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.710
hovers over the present, that
provides a map of all the ways

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.480
the present can reinvent itself.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.930
That's what leaders do.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.300
They distort reality.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.270
But here's the thing.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.900
There's nothing fake--
there's nothing inauthentic--

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.670
about distorting reality,
because the distorted reality

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.160
becomes real the moment
that perception becomes

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.760
the main operating system.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.570
The moment you adopt that vision
as truth, it becomes truth.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.970
Mankind decided we would
fly, it became truth.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.570
Mankind creates technology
that folds space and time so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.860
that minds can communicate
instantaneously

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.400
across digital screens, somebody
hallucinated this technology

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.060
into being.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.530
We live in a world where
our thoughts spill over,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.880
and if they can harness the
will of the people around us,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.480
we can labor new
realities into being.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.960
We can usher new
worlds into being.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.230
We can author realities.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.460
Because we, as humans beings,
our greatest potential,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.730
is that we have this
reality distortion field.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.360
We are like Neo in "The
Matrix" when he sees the code,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.110
and he flexes his muscle,
and space and time

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.610
warps around him.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.690
Powerful metaphor,
but that's who we are.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.470
That's what we are.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.120
