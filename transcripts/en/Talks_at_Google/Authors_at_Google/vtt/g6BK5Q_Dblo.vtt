MALE SPEAKER 1: Professor
Harari is a good friend of mine

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.735
and a professor in the
University of Jerusalem.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.190
He's been teaching an
introductory history class

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.620
for undergrads for
quite a few years.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.570
And at some point he decided
that it would be a good idea

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.290
to compile the lecture
notes to a book

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.990
so that the life of his students
will be a little bit more easy.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.080
So he wrote the book and
then what happened later

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.340
was completely unplanned.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.350
The book became a
bestseller in Israel.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.740
It was the top best
seller in the nonfiction

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.570
books for a few months.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.670
Then translations to
foreign languages came.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.590
The book has been
translated to 30 languages.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.750
It's being sold now in most
of the European countries

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.790
and in Canada with
great success.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.710
And now it's coming to the US.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.760
And fortunately
there was our chance

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.590
to bring Yuval here
to visit us also

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.000
and to give the talk at Google.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.558
So I'm really happy
to introduce him.

00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:03.058
Thank you.

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:05.914
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.750
YUVAL HARARI: It's a
pleasure to be here also,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.930
not only to visit
[INAUDIBLE], but also to be

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.530
in Silicon Valley,
which for me is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.660
a kind of special
place as an historian.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.220
As an historian I focus
mainly on the history

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.620
of ideas, ideology,
mythology, religion.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.070
And I think that the most
interesting place in the world

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.700
today, in religious terms, is
Silicon Valley, not the Middle

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.630
East, not Syria, or Afghanistan,
or Israel, or Jerusalem,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.320
but Silicon Valley.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.230
This is where the new religions
that will take over the world

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.220
are being formulated.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.351
And this will also be the topic
of my talk for the next hour

00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:54.750
or so, about the new
religions of the 21st century.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.060
But in order to understand
the future of religion

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.880
we first have to say a few words
about its past and its present.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.660
And I would like to
start with describing

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.940
what is the main religion,
or ideology, worldview

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.950
of the world today in the
middle of the second decade

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.450
of the 21st century.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.790
And I think we can say that the
dominant ideology of the world

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.850
at present is liberal humanism,
or in short, liberalism.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.670
Liberalism is a
worldview, an ideology,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.770
that thinks that a source of
all authority and all meaning

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.080
in the universe is
the individual human,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.130
the individual of the
specie Homo sapiens.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.820
Liberalism has
several core ideas.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.340
First of all, it believes
in the individual.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.240
It thinks that every Homo
sapien is an individual,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.290
which literally means
it cannot be divided.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.450
The meaning of the
term "individual"

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.475
is that you cannot divide it.

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:09.350
The idea is, yes, of course,
you can divide the human body

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.950
or the human brain, but within
each individual there is kind

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.870
of a seed of light, a spark
that cannot be divided further.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.550
Within each of us there
is this inner voice

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.940
and this inner voice in
each and every one of us

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.390
is the source of all the
meaning and all the authority

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.800
in the world.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.840
Whenever we face a
difficult question,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.450
a difficult dilemma,
choice in life

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.650
as individuals, or as
collectives, liberalism tells

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.470
us, listen to yourself,
connect to yourself.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.230
Try to hear this inner
voice within yourself

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.120
and it will tell you what to do.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.480
And listen to that,
not to anything else.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.310
The second main idea or
hypothesis of liberalism

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.990
is that this inner
voice within ourselves

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.200
comes out of a space
of complete freedom.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.600
Yes, there are influences,
constraints from outside,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.100
physical, social, biological,
but if we go deep enough

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.010
within ourselves, we
will come, eventually,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.480
to a space of complete freedom.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.860
And from the space we need to
make our big decisions in life.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.090
Thirdly, based on these two
ideas or two assumptions,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.980
liberalism assumes that only
I can really know myself.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.920
Nobody else, no outside person,
no outside system can really

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.140
know who I am because,
again, who I am really

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.620
is this inner voice which
enjoys complete freedom.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.230
So I'm inaccessible
from outside.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.360
Based on these ideas the
main value of liberalism,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.150
which gives it its name,
is liberty, freedom.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.330
We need to preserve the
freedom of the individual

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.350
to think, to feel,
and to act according

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.510
to what he or she thinks and
feels because, again, this

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.170
is the supreme and source
of authority and meaning

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.400
in the world.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.750
Now all this may sound very
abstract and very theoretical.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.020
So I would like to give
a few concrete examples

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.140
of what liberalism
means in practice

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.340
to our lives as individuals
and as collectives.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.940
If you think about the
field of politics, so

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.390
what is liberal politics?

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.640
What is liberalism translated
into political terms?

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.390
You get a democracy with
elections and so forth.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.410
If we want to know who should
rule this country, what kind

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.240
of economic policies to adopt,
what kind of foreign policy

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.110
to adopt, to make
war or to make peace,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.950
who should we turn to
in order to get answers?

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.370
We should turn to the inner
voices of each individual.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.630
So we have elections and
on election day everybody

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.530
goes by himself or by herself.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.870
And at least theoretically
tries to connect,

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.310
I try to connect to
myself to listen,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.410
what are my deepest feelings?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.090
What's are my deepest personal
thoughts about this issue?

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.110
And I vote accordingly.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.350
And this is how
we know who should

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.470
rule the country, whether
to make peace or war,

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.970
and so forth.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.320
So this is liberal
politics, which

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.170
argues that the
voter knows best.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.930
There is no source of authority
higher than the voter.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.190
You get the same ideas
also in the economic field.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.360
What is liberal economics?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.020
Liberal economics is the view
that the customer is always

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.050
right.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.740
There is no higher
authority than the authority

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.900
of the individual customer.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.830
How do we know if a
product is a good product?

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.360
If the customers buy it.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.130
There is no other method.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.240
There is no higher
authority that

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.200
can say, yes, they didn't
buy it, but it's still good.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.460
Let's say we are planning a car.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.280
And we are organizing
a committee

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.960
of the wisest people
on the planet.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.530
We take Nobel laureates
in physics, and chemistry,

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.850
and literature, and
peace, and whatever

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.530
and they come together
for five years

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.460
with a lot of money,
a lot of helpers.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.600
And they design the perfect car.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.090
And after five years
you start producing

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.780
this perfect car, engineered,
invented by the wisest people

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.780
on the planet.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.470
And it goes on sale
and nobody buys it,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.090
or very few people buy it.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.500
It means that this car is
not a good car according

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.390
to the tenets of
liberal economics.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.457
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:55.457 --> 00:07:56.540
YUVAL HARARI: Oh, perhaps.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.010
But eventually you cannot
blame the customer.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.810
Oh, we produce a perfect
car and we [? build ?]

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.900
a perfect PR campaign, but the
customers, they are stupid.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.560
They don't understand
what is good for them.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.050
This works in
communism, for example.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.170
This is the idea of communism.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.420
You have really wise
people sitting in Moscow.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.350
They plan the car, which
they think is best.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.040
And everybody, at least if they
are fortunate, gets this car.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.630
And if they don't like
it, it's their problem.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.200
But not in liberal economics.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.490
In liberal economics the
highest authority in economics

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.350
is the customer.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:40.110
You have the same ideas in the
fields of art and aesthetics.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.350
Many times in history many
periods, many cultures, people

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.570
had ideas, what is art
and what is beauty?

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.510
And they thought that there
are some objective definitions,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.520
objective yardsticks to
determine whether something

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.580
is art and whether
something is good art.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.720
And then comes along liberal
art and liberal aesthetics

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.140
in the 19th, 20th century.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.580
And just as in politics
the voter knows best.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.180
And in economics the
customer is always right.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.350
So in liberal art, also,
the customer or the viewer,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.440
he is or she is the
highest authority.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.700
According to liberal art, beauty
is in the eyes of the beholder,

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.580
in the feelings of the
person watching or seeing

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.540
the painting, the architecture,
the play, whatever it is.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.470
In 1917, in a very,
very famous gesture

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.690
Marcel Duchamp
took a urinal, said

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.950
this art, called it
"Fountain," signed

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:49.390
his name, Marcel Duchamp,
put it in a museum in Paris,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.810
said this is art.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.140
This is beautiful.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.430
And ever since then in
every introductory course

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.910
to art, to art
history in university

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.500
they bring this image
and the argument starts.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.180
Is it art?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.090
No, it's not art.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.510
Who determines what is art?

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.220
Is it beautiful?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.200
It's not beautiful.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.290
And eventually, if
you are liberals,

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.020
you will reach the
conclusion that art

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.590
is whatever I define
to be art and beauty

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.950
is in the eyes of the beholder.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.120
Whatever I think is
beautiful, it's beautiful.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.870
And nobody out there
can come to me and say,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.150
you think it's
beautiful, but it's not.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.180
There is some higher authority.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.470
If you think that
this is beautiful art

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.920
and you're willing to pay
millions of dollars for it,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.720
and it costs millions
of dollars today,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.330
this fountain, then it's art.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.220
The same idea is also applied
to the field of ethics.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.840
How do you know if an
action is good or evil?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.240
If it's ethical or unethical?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.340
Well, suppose I live
in the Middle Ages.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.640
And I fall in love
with another guy.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.580
And I go to the priest and
tell him in confession this

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.880
and this happened.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.450
So the priest will say, this is
very evil, what you have done.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.890
You will go to hell for this.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.660
Why?

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.010
Because God thinks it's
evil, because scriptures

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.760
say it's evil, because I,
the priest, say this is evil.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.210
And then I say to the priest,
but I feel very good about it.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.150
So the priest would say, but
we don't care what you feel.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.980
Your feelings are unimportant.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.370
You don't determine what is
good or evil by what you feel.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.200
Then came liberalism in
the modern age and said no.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.410
The highest authority
in the field of ethics

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.700
is also the feelings
of individuals.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.490
There's nothing beyond that.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.780
If it feels good, do it.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.360
If you feel good about it, if
everybody feels good about it,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.020
then there is absolutely
no reason in the world

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.990
why it should be evil or bad.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.700
Now, there are, of
course, problems.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.090
What happens if a
particular action causes

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.550
some people to feel good and
other people to feel bad?

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.980
This is when you have arguments
within liberal ethics.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.510
Say, for example, an
extramarital affair.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.800
I have an affair
outside of marriage.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.370
I feel very good about it,
but if my spouse finds out

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.820
he will feel bad about it.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.160
And probably I will
also feel bad about it.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.530
And if we, say, we divorce as
a result and we have children,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.300
they will feel bad about it.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.185
So what is more important,
my good feelings

00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:23.680
at a particular time, or the
bad feelings of my spouse,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.380
or my children?

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.440
Different people have different
views on this question,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.030
but as long as they are
liberal, the argument

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.200
will be done in
terms of feelings.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.940
The question will be, what
feeling is more important?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.860
Even very religious people
today understand this.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.700
And if you think about the
terrorist attacks in France

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.660
on the Charlie Hebdo,
after the attack

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.470
all kinds of organizations,
Muslim organizations and even

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.110
non-Muslim organizations
began to say things

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.460
like, but look,
this newspaper, it

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.200
was not doing something
very wholesome

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.940
because it was causing
millions of devout Muslims

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.380
around the world to feel bad.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.170
It didn't take into
account their feelings.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.700
Now it's very interesting
that they use this argument

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.110
because even those
who try to say it's

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.780
not good to draw a caricature
of the prophet Mohammad,

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.260
they don't say it's not good
because Allah forbade it,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.670
or because it's wrong
according to the Quran.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.350
They say it's not
good because it

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.160
hurts the feelings of people.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.200
So even those
arguments are praised

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.965
in liberal terms of feelings.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.040
And finally, just to
give a last example

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.920
from the field of education.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.010
What is liberal education?

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.270
The main idea of
liberal education

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.530
is that the student or the
pupil is the highest authority,

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.615
not the teacher,
not the professor.

00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:03.000
In liberal education
the main thing

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.350
you try to teach your
pupils or your students

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.240
is to think for themselves.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.860
They are the highest authority.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.790
You go from kindergarten
to the university

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.290
and you ask the teacher,
you ask the professor,

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.510
what are you trying to teach?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.090
And he or she will
say, well, I try

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.560
to teach history, or
mathematics, or physics,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.610
but above all I try
to teach my students

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.350
to think for themselves.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.730
This is the most
important thing.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.460
If he or she are liberal
educators it doesn't always

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.530
work, of course, not all
the universities or schools

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.690
manage to do it, but this is
the general ideal accepted

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.610
by all liberal
institutions of education.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.110
Now when we look at the
world of today in 2015

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.260
we can say that the
liberal package dominates

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.940
most of the world.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.670
This liberal package
contains human rights,

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.010
which are these walls,
defenses established

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.080
to protect the inner
freedom of each individual.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.710
This is the human rights.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:18.360
This package contains
belief in individualism,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.130
in liberal democracy,
in free market economy.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.350
And I think we can say
that not everybody accepts

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.620
this particular
package, but it is

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.600
the dominant ideological
package of the world today.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.320
And there is very little
viable alternatives,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:41.010
or real alternatives to
this package at present.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:45.860
Over the last few years, we have
seen a lot of social protests

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.640
in different places
in the world,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.530
but the vast majority
of the protests

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.800
were done in the name
of the liberal values,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.440
not against them.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.140
People are coming to the
governments and saying,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.130
you don't live up to
the liberal ideas.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.400
We want the politics
to be more democratic.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.400
We want economics, the
economy, to be more free.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.640
The vast majority
of social protests

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.520
did not have any
alternative to this package.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.570
They simply wanted it
to be implemented better

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.330
than it is being
implemented today.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.100
Another potential source
for an alternative

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.340
which more and more
people speak about

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:34.720
is China, the rising
superpower of the 21st century.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.280
However, even though China is
definitely an economic giant,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.660
it is still an
ideological dwarf.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.730
In terms of ideology or
religion China has very little

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.890
to offer the world,
at least at present.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:56.840
In theory and officially, it
is still a communist country,

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.710
but it is very far from
being communist in practice.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.920
And it has no alternative
idea to either

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.190
its official communism
or to the liberal package

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:12.060
of how else to run human
society in terms of values.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.510
Maybe in the next decade,
two decades, three decades

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.130
we will see the rise of
a completely new ideology

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:22.210
in China, but
speaking as of 2015,

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.864
China is extremely good in
business, in making money,

00:17:25.864 --> 00:17:28.680
in making products,
but ideologically it

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.440
seems to be bankrupt.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.440
The third main alternative
to the liberal package

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.580
is radical Islam, or radical
religions in general,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.350
but very often we
focus on radical Islam.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.810
However, even though radical
fundamentalist Islamic

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.200
movements oppose
the liberal package,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.380
they don't really have
any relevant alternative

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.750
that can be offered
and implemented

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.190
in the 21st century.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:05.850
The reason is that most of
their ideas are out of date

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.130
by centuries, by
hundreds of years.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:15.490
The 21st century challenges
humankind in new ways.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.430
We are facing enormous
opportunities,

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.420
enormous new opportunities,
and enormous new dangers

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.510
that we need to confront.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.330
And radical Islam has very
little relevant things

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.690
to say about these new
challenges and new dangers.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.050
To give just a few examples,
perhaps the most important

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.500
question in
21st-century economics

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.610
is what do we need people
for in the economy?

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.730
In a situation when it
is likely that computers

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.030
will be able to do more and
more things better and better

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.570
than Homo sapiens, this
becomes a real question

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.740
for the first time in history.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.670
The most basic economic value
of humans is being put in doubt.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.020
And nobody really has an
idea how the job market would

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.760
look like in 40
years or 50 years,

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.160
and what humans will
still be necessary for,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.690
or least most humans.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.400
What will they do?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.070
If there is a young man or
woman today, say, 20 years old,

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.720
going to college, and
asking himself or herself

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.900
what should I study
today so that in 30 years

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.840
I will have a good job?

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.570
Nobody knows what
to tell him or her.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.540
Nobody knows.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.620
We don't have a clue
how the job market would

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.850
look in 30 or 40 years.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.530
And again, it's not even clear.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.810
It's not that there
will be different jobs.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.460
It's not even clear
that there will

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.770
be any jobs for most humans.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.070
Another very big
challenge and opportunity

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.370
concerns biotechnology.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.860
The possibility of extending
human life and human health

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.810
indefinitely, with
80 being the new 40.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:06.060
What will this do to
society, to sexual relations,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.530
to family structures?

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.090
This is very big questions.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.670
Another very big
question, which emanates

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.910
from this field of
biotechnology is the possibility

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.460
of, for the first time in
history, real biological gaps

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.170
opening between the
rich and the poor.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.270
Previously in history
there were always

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.550
gaps between rich and
poor, but these gaps

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.820
were social, economic,
legal, not biological.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.840
There was no real
biological difference

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.170
between the king
and the peasant.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.700
They had the same basic
physical, cognitive,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.490
and emotional abilities.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.870
Now with the advent
of biotechnology

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.400
we are facing a possibility,
it's not a prophecy,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.110
it's not certain, but
there is a possibility

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:55.640
of real biological gaps opening
and Homo sapiens splitting

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.610
into different biological
castes, or even

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.650
different species.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.720
These are the kinds
of problems that we

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.320
need to confront in
the 21st century.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.740
And the problem of radical
Islam and radical Christianity,

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.030
Judaism, and so
forth, is that they

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.300
have nothing relevant to
say about these questions.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.070
They have no answers
to these questions

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.240
because they don't even
understand the questions.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.080
If you read even very wise books
written thousands of years ago,

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.890
the people who wrote these books
knew nothing about genetics,

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.270
knew nothing about
nanotechnology, or computers.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.340
So how can you expect to get
answers to these questions

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.000
from people who
didn't know anything

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.650
about the subjects in question?

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.760
Now it's true that if you count
heads, if you count people

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.085
there are many more people
today on the planet that

00:21:53.085 --> 00:21:56.180
are interested in
God and scriptures

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.580
than in nanotechnology
or genetics,

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.690
or who understand
these subjects.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.100
But history is not
made by numbers.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.470
It's not that you
need a lot of people

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.870
to make historical changes.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.810
Very often historical
changes are

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.170
made by relatively
few numbers of people.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:20.200
If we go back to the last big
technological and economic

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.940
revolution that swept
the world, the Industrial

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:30.890
Revolution of the 19th century,
it was done by very few people.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.330
Most people in the 19th
century knew far more

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.070
and were interested far more
in the Bible and the Quran

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.380
than in steam engines, or
railroads, or coal mines.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.260
The same thing we see today, we
saw also in the 19th century.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.320
It was also full of religious
fundamentalist movements.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.390
For example, in the Islamic
world, you had in Sudan,

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.040
the Mahdi in the late
19th century, which

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.270
established a
religious theocracy.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:03.050
And also beheaded people and
fought wars and so forth.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.890
Caused a lot of [? steel ?]
in Victorian England

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.970
when the followers of
the Mahdi beheaded,

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:14.590
executed General Charles Gordon,
a famous British commander.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.790
Nobody almost remembers
the Mahdi today.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.280
Similarly in India you
had a religious revival

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.780
led by [INAUDIBLE],
whose main idea,

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:31.910
the main message [INAUDIBLE] had
to India in the 19th century,

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.540
is that all the answers to all
the questions are in the Vedas,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.670
in the holy scriptures
of Hinduism.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.360
The Vedas are never wrong.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.030
All the answers are there.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:46.030
If you have any difficulty, open
the Vedas or ask the Brahmans.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:49.250
Tens of millions of
people followed him.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.900
In the Christian world you
also saw such movements.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.500
Pope Pius IX, the
Catholic pope, he,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.110
in the middle of
the 19th century

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:03.910
had this new idea that
the pope is never wrong.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:04.710
It is a new idea.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.780
It's not an idea
for the Middle Ages.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.210
The Catholic dogma, the Papal
Infallibility, it's called,

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.110
the pope is never
wrong when it comes

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.580
to questions of ethics,
morality, and so forth.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.910
This is not a medieval dogma.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.970
It goes back only to the
middle of the 19th century.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:28.200
And then millions of people
followed Pope Pius IX.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.700
In China the biggest
war of the 19th century

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.850
was not the Napoleonic War,
was not the American Civil War.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.120
By far the biggest war
of the 19th century

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.590
was the Taiping Rebellion,
which started in 1850

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:49.190
when this person Hong
Xiuquan, he had a vision.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:54.420
God revealed himself to
Hong and told Hong a secret

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.890
that Hong was
actually the younger

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.480
brother of Jesus Christ.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.200
And he had a divine
mission to establish

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.240
the kingdom of Heavenly Peace
on Earth starting with China.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.170
Millions of people followed
him and they did not

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.590
establish any peace.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.870
They waged the most terrible
war of the 19th century

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.970
with at least 20 million dead.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.330
These are the
smallest estimates.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:27.020
So you had your full share
of religious fundamentalism

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.300
also back in the 19th century.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.569
Nobody almost today
remembers these people

00:25:32.569 --> 00:25:33.360
or these movements.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.660
They did not change the world.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.620
The Industrial Revolution did.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.270
Well, these people in Sudan,
or in India, or in China

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.450
were concerned about
scriptures, and God, and heaven,

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.380
and so forth.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.430
A few engineers and
a few technicians,

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.110
and bankers, and
financiers in Manchester,

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.990
in Liverpool, and Birmingham,
they changed the world.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:58.900
They shaped the world
in which we live today.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.360
Now there was one ideological
or religious movement

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.690
which began in the
19th century which

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.970
did manage to change
the world and which

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.560
is far more important.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.300
And when we think back
about the 19th century

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.110
and we ask ourselves,
what was the big ideology,

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.820
the big ethical ideas that
came from this period,

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.160
we think not about the
Pope Pius IX, or the Mahdi,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.310
we think about
socialism and communism.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.590
In 1800 there were hardly
any socialists or communists,

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.700
very few.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.820
Even in the middle
of the 19th century,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.660
there was still a fringe
group of bizarre people

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.310
who have such
thoughts, but there

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:45.000
was one crucial characteristic
about these bizarre people,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.300
like Marx and Engels, that
enabled them to really

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.010
change the world and to
create an ideology that

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.940
spread over the entire planet.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.270
And helped to shape
our life today.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.150
The crucial thing about
Marx and Engels, and later

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.650
Lenin and Trotsky,
and all these fellows

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.830
is that they did not just
read old books from hundreds

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.750
of centuries previously.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:15.060
They studied the technology and
the economy of their own day.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.540
And they tried to create
a new ideology, which

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.590
will be suited to
the new opportunities

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.150
and challenges of 19th-century
technology and 19th-century

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.270
economics.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.680
Lenin was once asked in
a very famous occasion,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.490
Lenin was asked
by his followers,

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.470
please, Vladimir, tell us in
simple language what communism

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.602
is.

00:27:41.602 --> 00:27:43.810
We are not going to read
[? "The Capital," ?] a very,

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.220
very dense book.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.240
We don't want to hear now
this long philosophical talk.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.990
In very few words tell
us what communism is.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.090
And Lenin answers,
communism, communism

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:59.050
is power to the workers'
councils, the Soviets,

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.170
plus electrification
of the entire country.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.490
You cannot have communism
without electricity,

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:11.290
without the steam engine,
without telegraph, radio,

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.470
railroads.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.450
The Communist system of
production and economics

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.160
demands these things.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.900
You could not have
established a Communist regime

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.610
in 16th-century Russia.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.710
Impossible.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.450
First you must have an
Industrial Revolution.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.020
Communism and
socialism are custom

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.880
built for the world following
the Industrial Revolution.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.010
This is why they're
so successful.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.560
In a way communism and
socialism were the harbingers

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.640
of the new religions
we see today

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.180
in the 21st century in the
sense that they were based

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.120
on technology and
on the economy.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.860
After thousands of years in
which technology played almost

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:58.030
no role at all in religious
and ideological thought,

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.870
communism was the first
techno-religion, a religion

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.190
or ideology if you
prefer that promises

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:09.920
roughly the same things
that were promised

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.710
by the traditional religions.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:17.300
It promised peace, prosperity,
paradise, but here on Earth

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.060
with the use of technology,
not in the afterlife

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.650
by the act of some divine power.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.560
This is the definition
of a techno-religion.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.080
It promises whatever it
promises here on Earth

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.140
with the help of technology.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.140
And communism was perhaps
the first to show the way

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.560
and it completely changed our
entire ideological discourse.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.770
Previously the
main dividing lines

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:50.600
between people and their beliefs
concerned questions like,

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.640
do we believe in God, what god?

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.700
Do you believe in a soul?

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.750
What kind of soul?

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.260
What happens after death?

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.610
These were the main questions
that divided, say, Christians

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.060
from Muslims and
Shiites from Sunnis.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.540
After communism
everything changed.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.630
Now people more and more
began to define themselves

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.540
by how they think about
technology and economics.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.740
Sounds very strange,
but not very long ago,

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.360
30 years ago,
humankind was almost

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.290
destroyed in a nuclear
war between two camps who

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.050
were divided not in what
they thought about soul,

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.030
or God, or the afterlife.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.130
The were divided in
what they thought

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:35.400
about how economic production
should be organized.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.250
So communism really changed
the rules of the game.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.880
Even if you don't
accept what Marx said

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.651
you started speaking in
similar terms in the questions

00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:45.275
that you asked.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:53.420
And we see indeed that
the traditional religions,

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.540
Hinduism, Islam, Judaism,
Christianity, they

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.330
did not disappear.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.710
It's not that people
stopped believing in them.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:05.830
They just became less and less
relevant, less influential.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.330
They were transformed
essentially

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:13.000
from a creative force
into a reactive force.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.950
In the Middle Ages they
were very creative forces.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.870
Much of the new technological,
economic, political,

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.730
administrative techniques
of the Middle Ages

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.750
were pioneered by
the Catholic church.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:31.530
The best equivalent for Silicon
Valley in the 13th century

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.090
is the Vatican.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.790
This is where all of the new
ideas about administration,

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.790
about information
processing, this

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.760
is where you went,
to the Vatican.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.850
The first archives,
libraries, systems

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.430
for archiving information,
cataloging information,

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.130
this is something the
church was best in doing.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.630
If you are a king
in the 13th century

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.120
and you wanted
somebody who knows

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.760
how to handle information,
to help you run your kingdom,

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.760
you turned to monks.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.390
You turned to priests.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.050
They were the experts.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:08.660
So back then they were
still very creative forces.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.030
But in the last 200 years
they became reactive forces.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.060
They're still there,
but most of what they do

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:20.320
is react to the changes, to the
inventions, to the discoveries

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.190
that other people make.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.480
Like somebody invents
the contraceptive pill

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.420
and completely changes
the sexual [? sphere ?].

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.060
And then the pope
and the priests,

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.735
they scratch their head,
what do we do with this?

00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:34.360
What do you do?

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.449
Is it OK?

00:32:35.449 --> 00:32:35.990
Is it not OK?

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.240
They react.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.070
Similarly somebody
invents the internet.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.420
And then you have all the
Jewish rabbis also scratching

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.310
their heads, what
do we do with that?

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.180
Is it OK?

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.680
[INAUDIBLE] just use it
like this, like that?

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.000
And it's not only technology.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.750
Also new ethical ideas, the
20th century is full of them.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.280
Perhaps the most
important is feminism.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.880
After thousands of years
of patriarchal society,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.930
we have the feminist
revolution completely changing

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.740
social structures,
families, and so forth.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.620
And again, you have all
the rabbis and Ayatollahs,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:15.450
and priests, they think, how
do we need to react to that?

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.270
It's not our initiative, but we
have to do something with it.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.025
So they are reacting in
this way or that way.

00:33:23.025 --> 00:33:26.510
A very good way of
grasping the changing

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.670
place of these
religions in the world

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:33.040
is to ask yourself
two questions.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.570
First, ask yourself what is
the most important discovery

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.000
of the 20th century.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.140
And this is a very
difficult question

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.570
because there is a
lot to choose from.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.040
Perhaps it's antibiotics.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.380
Perhaps it gave each one of you
at least 10 years of your life,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.760
on average, you
owe to antibiotics.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.520
It's a huge difference.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.470
Maybe it's nuclear weapons.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.020
Maybe it's the computer.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.040
Maybe it's not technology,
but some ethical idea,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.050
like feminism.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.650
Perhaps feminism is the
most important discovery

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.500
of the 20th century.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.070
Difficult question to decide.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.620
Now ask yourself
a second question.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.739
What is the most
important discovery made

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:19.790
in the 20th century by
[? faced ?] religions,

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.730
religions that believe in
God, like Islam, or Hinduism,

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.659
or Judaism.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.080
Again, it's a very
difficult question

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.929
because you can't
think about anything.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.590
What did these people
discover in the last 100

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.900
years that changed our lives?

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.820
Yes, they are still
influential in the way

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.929
that they react to the
inventions and discoveries

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:44.170
of others, but what new
things did they discover?

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.080
I, at least, can't
think about anything

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.270
which you can mention
in the same sentence

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.439
with antibiotics, or
feminism, or nuclear weapons.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:00.400
So we see that the
usual challenges

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.550
that we think that
perhaps there are still

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.270
in the world to liberalism
are not really challenges.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.520
Neither China, nor Radical
Islam, nor the social protests,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.710
they don't really have
a relevant alternative

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.680
to the liberal package.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.410
But this does not mean
that liberalism is safe.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:21.670
Just the opposite.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.170
It seems that we
are on the verge

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:27.170
of the collapse of liberalism.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.390
And the collapse of
liberalism will not

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.840
happen because of things
that people are doing now

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.640
in Syria, or Iraq, or in
Libya, but because of things

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.160
that people are doing
here in Silicon Valley,

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.345
and in Stanford University,
and in my university,

00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:45.130
and in the Hebrew University.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.880
What kind of things?

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.310
Well, it starts with
the life sciences.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:55.220
The basic problem of liberalism
today in the early 21st century

00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:00.050
is that the life sciences are
telling us that it is nonsense.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:04.510
The basic beliefs on which
liberalism are built or perhaps

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:08.070
sounded sensible in the
18th century, in the era

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.130
of Locke and Rousseau
and these people.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:16.220
But there is a huge gap between
what liberalism tells us

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.070
about the world, and
about Homo sapiens,

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.660
and what the life sciences
in the early 21st century

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.100
are telling us
about Homo sapiens.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.490
Liberalism believes
in individualism

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:33.380
as we said earlier, that each
one of us is an individual.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.830
We have this ray of light, this
inner core which is individual.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.010
This is our real self.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.670
Well, according to the
life sciences today

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.840
there are no such things.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.880
All animals, including
humans, are not individuals.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.150
They don't have souls.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.640
They don't have any essence.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.780
They don't have any inner core.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:00.660
They are basically a collection
of biochemical algorithms,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.360
all kinds of
algorithmic systems that

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.070
build the brain, that build
the human beings, the giraffe,

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.210
the elephant, whatever it is.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:14.130
And if you peel all the layers,
all the systems that make up

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.812
an animal, an organism
like an onion,

00:37:16.812 --> 00:37:18.270
you peel one layer
after the other,

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.420
one layer after the
other, in the end

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:24.610
you won't get an inner
core of light, or a soul.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.930
You will get nothing.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.950
There is just nothing
left when you take out

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.830
all these different biochemical
algorithms, nothing is left.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.030
There is no individual.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:39.780
Secondly, these
biochemical algorithms

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.380
that make up an
organism are not free.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.120
There is no such
thing as freedom

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.460
according to the life sciences.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:55.190
All systems in nature, including
these biochemical algorithms,

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.910
they work according to just
two possible principles.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:05.540
Either they are deterministic
or they are random.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.020
Perhaps some events
on the quantum level

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:13.300
insert a certain randomness
into the biochemical processes

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.950
of our brain, of our
nervous system, of our body,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.560
but that's it.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.450
The word "freedom"
simply has no meaning

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.610
in the life sciences of today.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:30.360
Taking these two ideas together
that an organism, including

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.960
Homo sapiens-- which
is just another animal

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.590
like the chimpanzees,
and giraffes,

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.570
and so forth-- if
an organism is just

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.000
a collection of algorithms,
and these algorithms

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.910
are not free in any
sense, this means

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.910
that at least potentially
an external system,

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:52.280
an external entity can
understand me perfectly.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.960
It just needs to understand
all the algorithms that

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.010
come together to build this
machine, this structure.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:10.270
And the crucial insight is
that even our sensations, even

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.940
our emotions, even our
feelings, liberalism

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.080
believes above all
else in our feelings,

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.120
how you feel about politics,
about art, about sexuality,

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.440
this is the holy grail of
liberalism, our feelings.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.550
But now come the life
sciences and say, feelings?

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:32.220
Feelings are just biochemical
algorithms calculating what?

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.350
Calculating either
of two things,

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.670
probabilities of survival and
probabilities of reproduction.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.240
That's it.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.150
The Homo sapiens, like
giraffes, like elephants, they

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.070
are calculating all the
time, all their body

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.900
is just a calculating machine
for calculating probabilities

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.490
of survival and reproduction.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.600
This, again, may
sound a bit abstract.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.050
So I will give two
simple examples.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:04.940
First of all,
problems of survival.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.990
Let's say you are a baboon.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.800
And you are somewhere in
the Savannah in Africa.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.790
And you see a tree
with bananas on it.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:18.730
And you ask yourself, should
I go and take these bananas?

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.640
But you also see that
there is a lion nearby.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.910
Now should I or shouldn't
I try and get these bananas

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:32.220
and risk that while I eat the
bananas the lion will eat me?

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:36.080
Now in order to reach a
good answer I basically,

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.790
what I need to do, is to
calculate probabilities

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.870
and I need to take into
account a lot of information

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.050
in order to do it correctly.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.450
I need information
about the bananas.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.580
How far are they from you?

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.300
Are there any
obstacles in the way?

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.480
How many bananas?

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.800
Are they ripe or are they green?

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.570
It's one thing if there
are 20 ripe bananas

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:04.080
and it's another thing if there
are just two unripe bananas.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.600
I also need information
about the lion.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.490
How far is it?

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.410
How big is it?

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.310
Is it asleep?

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:10.390
Is it awake?

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.300
Does it seem hungry?

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.080
Does it seem satiated?

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.560
And thirdly, I need a lot
of information about myself.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.710
How fast can I run?

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.280
How hungry I am?

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.520
If I'm on the verge
of starvation,

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.850
if my energy is so low that
I may die within a few hours

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:33.520
if I don't eat something, then
no matter how big the danger is

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.660
I should try and
get these bananas

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.780
because otherwise
I'll die anyway.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.270
If, on the other hand, I
just know I had a big feast,

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:45.360
there is no reason to risk
my life for these bananas,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.040
even if the danger
is relatively small.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.120
Now to reach a good
decision, a good decision

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.100
means a decision that
will enable me to survive,

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.860
I need to take all that
information into account

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.010
and weigh it together somehow,
calculate all the probabilities

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.210
together.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.560
How do I do it as a baboon?

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.210
I don't take out a
piece of paper and pen,

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.300
or a calculator, or a computer.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.140
I don't have it.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.720
And I don't need it
because my entire body

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.330
is a calculator that was
built for millions of years

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:22.430
by natural selection
to do exactly that.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:26.170
What we call emotions,
sensations, feelings,

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.900
are simply
biochemical algorithms

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.850
that take all that information,
all the huge amounts

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.710
of information from
outside and inside,

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:39.940
and within a split second
reach a certain decision,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.570
a certain probability.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.960
Now the result does not
show up as a number,

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.260
like in some futuristic
science fiction

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.240
movie that the
baboon or the person

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.070
sees a number in
front of his eyes, no.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.230
The result will come
up simply as a feeling.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.500
This is what feelings are.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.550
They are the result
of these calculations.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:06.250
If the result is that I
should try and get the banana,

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:10.280
it will come up as the
emotion of courage.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.050
I will feel very courageous.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:16.520
My chest will be puffed up
and I will run to the bananas.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.370
If the calculations
reach the conclusion,

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.650
reach the result that I
shouldn't risk my life,

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.025
the chances are too small,
then the result again,

00:43:26.025 --> 00:43:26.900
will not be a number.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.330
It will be a feeling.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:31.000
It will be the feeling,
the emotion of fear.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
I will feel very
frightened and run away.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.980
And sometimes the calculations
are just in the middle.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.050
It's not clear if it's a good
idea or a bad idea in terms

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:43.750
of survival to reach
for these bananas.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:48.010
And this too will show up
as an emotion, as a feeling.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.750
I will feel confused.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.230
I will feel I don't know what
to do, to take the bananas,

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.200
not to take them.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.270
This too will be a feeling.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.470
The other type of
calculation problems

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:03.530
that this machine is
built to calculate

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.215
concerns not survival,
but reproduction.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:14.690
And again, if you are a peacock,
you look at the peacock.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.880
If you are a human,
you look at a human.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.230
And you need to make up your
mind, sometimes very quickly,

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.320
is this a good mate or not?

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.460
And again, lots of information
floods in from the eyes,

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.730
from the ears, from the
nose, from within the body.

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.590
And within a split second
you get the result, not as

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.120
a number, but as a feeling.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.590
You will feel this is
beautiful, this is attractive,

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.810
or, no, it's not beautiful,
it's not attractive,

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.240
it's disgusting, whatever.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.175
All of these sexual
feelings, again, they

00:44:45.175 --> 00:44:47.010
are biochemical algorithms.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.320
They are not some
spiritual whatever

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.110
that comes from the sky.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.550
They are the result of very,
very complex biochemical

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.980
algorithms that
natural selection

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.920
has evolved and selected
for millions upon millions

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.070
of generations until
they came to us.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:12.580
Now so far these
biological insights

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:16.820
actually supported liberalism
because liberalism,

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.750
as I said earlier, it
believes in feelings

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.050
as the supreme
source of authority.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.940
What I feel, this is
the supreme source

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.010
of authority on the planet.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:29.090
And biologists
could come and say,

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.940
this is actually a
very keen insight.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.540
This is true because if
you want to make decisions

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.290
about your life and you have two
potential sources of authority,

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:43.840
say the Bible or
your own feelings,

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.210
biologists will tell you,
go with your feelings.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:51.050
The Bible contains the
wisdom of a few priests

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.330
in ancient Jerusalem.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.560
That's it.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.150
Your feelings contain
the wisdom of millions

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.950
upon millions of
years of evolution,

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.210
the algorithms that
are your feelings

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:08.270
have passed the most rigorous
tests of natural selection.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:11.460
Each one of your genes, and
each one of your algorithms

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.310
is here today because it has
succeeded for millions of years

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:20.150
to pass the most rigorous
tests of natural selection.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.680
So if you need to
make a decision

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.140
you better go with
your feelings.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:30.350
This was the situation
maybe until today.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.010
But now things are changing.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.780
In two ways things are changing.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.400
First of all,
biologists decipher

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.700
the biochemical algorithms
that compose our body

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.400
and that are responsible
for our feelings.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.960
They are no longer mysterious
entities as they were before.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.600
We understand them
better and better.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.590
Why I feel this way in
this particular situation.

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:59.520
And secondly, we have
computer scientists

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:05.130
that are creating better and
better electronic algorithms.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.850
Now the question
that arises today

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:13.130
is what will happen once
we create an algorithm that

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.750
knows me better,
that understands me

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:21.400
and my feelings better than
I can understand myself?

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.750
What will happen then is
that authority will shift.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:30.610
It will shift away from
the feelings of individuals

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:34.690
to these outside algorithms.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.500
Our feelings at
present, you can say,

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.280
are the best algorithms
in the universe.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.280
But after all, they
are becoming outdated.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.780
They appeared maybe the way
that we have them today maybe

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:53.710
a few tens of thousands of years
ago in the African Savanna.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.860
So far they have been the
best algorithms around,

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.330
but we are now at the
position to produce an updated

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.070
version, something better.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.940
And when we have
better algorithms

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.680
then the authority
will shift to them.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.350
This is already happening in
at least a few fields of life,

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:15.940
most clearly in the
field of medicine

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.800
and decisions about your own
body, and your own health.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.790
I think it's not far fetched
to say that all of you

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.370
are now listening to this
talk, including myself,

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:32.430
the most important
decisions about our bodies

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:37.370
during our lifetime will not
to be taken by our feelings.

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:41.260
They will be taken by
external algorithms,

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.580
algorithms that understand
our own internal systems

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.820
and that have statistics
about millions

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.340
upon millions of other
humans, and therefore

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.930
can make better predictions
and better decisions

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:58.050
about our bodies than
just my own feelings.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:00.420
To give a concrete
example I think

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.870
it was a year ago, two
years ago that this

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.890
is very famous story came
out with Angelina Jolie

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:10.370
that she had a
double mastectomy.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:11.110
Why?

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:15.030
Not because she discovered
she had breast cancer.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:16.620
She didn't have breast cancer.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:22.150
But she went and did a
genetic test scanning her DNA.

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:28.140
And it showed that she carries
a mutation in one of her genes

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.050
that, according to the
statistical database,

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:36.520
means she has an 87% chance
of getting breast cancer.

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.530
And she had a lot of breast
cancer cases in her family.

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.680
I think that her mother died
at a relatively young age

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.770
from breast cancer.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:48.140
She did not have breast
cancer at the time.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.580
Her feelings told her
nothing, that she is sick,

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.080
that she should do something.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.680
But the external
algorithms told her

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:59.470
you have an 87% chance
of getting this disease.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.210
So she had a double
mastectomy, which

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:05.250
is a very, very big decision
to make in a person's life.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:09.670
And likewise I think most of
the big decisions we will make

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:12.470
about our lives in our
lifetime will actually

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:15.990
be taken by such
external algorithms,

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:18.140
not based on our inner feelings.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:26.780
Now when this will spread to
more and more fields of life,

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:31.380
liberalism will collapse,
not necessarily violently,

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.450
but it will simply
become outdated.

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:39.100
People will move authority
to a different place.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:41.800
This has happened
before in history.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.120
In the transition from the
Middle Ages to the modern age,

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.080
in the Middle Ages at the
time when the dominance was

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:55.090
of [? faced ?] religions, when
people had faced a decision,

00:50:55.090 --> 00:51:00.460
a problem, the practical
guideline they received

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.870
was listen to scriptures.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:05.160
Read what is written
in scriptures.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.500
This will give you an answer.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:12.230
Now the rise of liberalism
was not a theoretical change.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.600
It was not just a
matter of philosophy.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.770
It was a practical matter
of how people actually

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.810
make decisions in
their daily lives.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:24.930
If previously, when they faced
a problem, say, who to marry,

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.880
they opened scriptures
and looked for the answer.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.580
Now, with the rise
of liberalism,

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.660
the guidance was listen
to your feelings.

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:38.070
Go maybe at night,
climb the high mountain.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.070
Look at the moon.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:39.845
Look at the sea.

00:51:39.845 --> 00:51:41.680
Try to connect to yourself.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.700
See what you really feel
and go with your heart.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.890
Go with your feelings.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.990
This was a practical guidance.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:50.110
It was not just theory.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.170
Now we move to the next stage.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.800
When people say, don't
listen to your feelings,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.030
what do they know?

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:58.980
Listen to Google, or listen
to Amazon, or to Facebook,

00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.830
or whatever.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:03.650
They understand
how you feel better

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.390
than you know how
you feel because they

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:08.350
have much more information.

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:10.640
And they have much
better algorithms

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.640
than what natural
selection gave you.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.920
They have information not
only about your emails

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.820
and your books and so
forth, but the latest rage

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:23.960
is all these biometric devices
that you wear on your body,

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.880
and that gets a constant
stream of information

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.580
about your blood pressure
and your sugar levels,

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.340
and whatever.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.570
And, of course, do a DNA test,
and so forth and so forth.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:37.610
And if you have all this
information and these superbly

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:41.430
built algorithms you can
get much better answers

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:44.630
than from your feelings, or
certainly from the Bible.

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:50.490
So we see the potential
rise of a new kind

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:53.010
of religion, a data religion.

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:57.450
If previously God was in the
center of events and then

00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.430
humans were in the
center of events.

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:03.540
Now data or information
becomes the supreme source

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.550
of authority and of
meaning in the world.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.210
It starts with simple
things like, you've

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:11.690
got to an intersection
in the road to turn left

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.590
or to turn right, don't
listen to your feelings.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:18.400
Listen to [? ways. ?] It knows
much better than your gut

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.390
intuition whether to go
this way or that way.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:24.320
Then you move to a more
sophisticated level.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.760
What book to buy?

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.750
I go, I enter the
Amazon website.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.010
I want to buy a new book.

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:33.670
The first thing that happens is
that a banner pops up and says,

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:35.620
I know you.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.380
I know you.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.640
And I know that
you and people like

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.710
you will enjoy this book
or that book, or that film.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:46.000
And the annoying thing is
that they are often correct.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.355
They really know me
better than I know myself.

00:53:48.355 --> 00:53:51.550
They can recommend
the best book for me.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:54.900
So at present it's still based
on something quite, not very

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.460
sophisticated, like they
know the previous books

00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.680
that I've read and bought.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.490
And they try to make an
extrapolation from that.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:04.590
But now we're moving to a
far more sophisticated level

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:10.500
when the books start to
read me while I read them.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.340
If I read a book on a Kindle,
or some other electronic device,

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.070
the device can know
whether I finished

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.350
the book, how quickly
I read it, when

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:24.650
I stopped in reading the book,
which parts I read quickly,

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:26.920
and which parts I read slowly.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.980
This is a wealth of
information, which

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.570
conveys a very good idea
about my experience of reading

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:33.960
the book.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.980
The next stage is to connect
this two facial recognition

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.780
programs.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.670
And the book will know not
only when I read fast or slow,

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:46.820
but when I laughed, when
I cried, when I was bored.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.740
This is an immense device that
can, of course, help Amazon not

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:53.900
only recommend books, but do
many [? more ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.100
more sophisticated things.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.890
And eventually we will
reach even questions like,

00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:00.300
whom to marry.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.080
In the lives of most
individuals perhaps one

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.830
of the most important
questions is

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:08.020
the question of who to marry.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.080
And now instead of
going to the priest

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:14.690
and asking, Father, who should
I marry, or going to my parents,

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:16.760
or trying to connect
to my feelings,

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:22.150
and making bad decisions,
I can ask Google,

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:24.810
dear Google, who should I marry?

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:27.840
And Google will answer,
well, I know you

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.700
from the moment you
were born, at least

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.250
sometime in the future.

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:34.890
I've read every email
you've ever written.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:38.230
I've listened to every
phone call you've ever made.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:41.760
I remember every failed
date you went to.

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.690
If you want, I can show you
the graphs of your sugar level

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:49.720
and blood pressure during every
date and every sexual encounter

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.650
you had in your lifetime.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:56.950
And of course, I also
know your potential mates,

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:59.610
like if I have to choose
between two people.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.160
So yes, I know him and I
know him, or her and her

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.560
just as I know you.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:07.150
And based on all this
information and not only

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:10.780
on all this information,
but based on databases

00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:14.360
off millions and millions of
successful and unsuccessful

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:20.360
relationships, I can recommend
to you at a probability of 87%

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.660
that you had better go
with A and not with B.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.830
And one more thing.

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:29.120
I know you so well
that I also know

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.530
that you are disappointed
by what I just told you.

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:37.130
I told you to choose A, but
secretly you actually prefer B.

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:40.290
And I also understand why
you make this mistake.

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:43.870
You give too much importance
to physical appearances,

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.660
to external beauty.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.630
Now I'm not saying that
beauty's not important.

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:50.220
Beauty is very important.

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.110
But you give it too much weight.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.520
In my calculations,
which are based

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.940
on these enormous
statistical databases,

00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:01.320
I know that beauty
counts for 9.62%

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.300
of the success of
a relationship.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:07.230
But your old-fashioned
biochemical algorithms,

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:10.300
because of things that happened
in the African Savanna,

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:15.060
give this data,
beauty, they give it

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:18.400
27.5%, which is far too high.

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.300
So believe me, even
though you feel

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.540
that B is the right
answer, go for A.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.600
And this is an
empirical question.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.050
If enough people enough
times will consult and get

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:35.590
a good answer that they will
be happy with, then with time

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:38.880
more and more decisions
about small things and about

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.340
big things will be
done in such a way.

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:44.680
Authority will shift
from the feelings,

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.070
from the inner feelings
of the individuals

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:52.070
to the wisdom of these
external algorithms.

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:58.580
This is a very favorite topic
in many science fiction movies,

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.990
and books, and whatever.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.210
The usual plot of science
fiction movies or books

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:05.640
goes like this.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.210
Computers or robots
become very powerful.

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:11.160
Then there is a big war
between humans and the robots,

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.620
or humans and computers.

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.920
And the computers are so
powerful, they know everything.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:18.480
They can do anything,
but they don't

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.270
understand the inner
spirit of humanity.

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:24.820
They don't understand
love or whatever.

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.010
And this is why humanity
wins in the end.

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:31.040
This is a very common plot
in many of these movies

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.730
because their
audience is humans.

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:38.120
So they have to sell
this kind of fiction.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.390
Otherwise people won't buy it.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:40.440
People won't like it.

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.260
But there is a fallacy here.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.950
And the fallacy is that why
do you think that computers

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.550
or robots will not
understand the emotions,

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:51.100
the feelings, love, whatever?

00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:55.650
It's not some otherworldly
spiritual thing.

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:58.350
It's, at least according
to the life sciences,

00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:59.950
it's an algorithm.

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:03.910
So why think that
a computer will not

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:05.950
be able to understand
an algorithm?

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:08.240
OK, it's a
biochemical algorithm.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.900
It's not an
electronic algorithm.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.630
But what's the difference?

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:14.150
The mathematics is the same.

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.935
The calculations are
basically the same.

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.400
Why does it matter
how it is done?

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.850
The second fallacy,
which is part of it

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:27.480
is that most of these
movies, not all of them,

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.420
but most of them
imagine it as a kind

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.450
of war between
humans and computers,

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:33.740
or humans and robots.

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:37.810
When the far more likely
scenario, which we are already

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:41.010
seeing now, is not
a war but a wedding.

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:44.890
We are talking about a merger
of the two kinds of algorithms,

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:48.460
the biochemical and the
electronic, not a struggle,

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:52.130
or not necessarily a struggle.

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:54.360
Now there is one
question that still

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.570
hovers over this
entire discussion.

00:59:57.570 --> 01:00:01.240
And this is whether the
life sciences are right.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.920
Does life really
mean nothing more

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.580
than information processing?

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.520
It may seem like it when
you read the latest articles

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.360
and books on the discovery
of the life sciences,

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.340
but there is still one
big hole in the story.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.690
And this is the question
of consciousness,

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.920
of subjective experiences.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.850
What is called in philosophy the
hard problem of consciousness.

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:30.180
We now understand
very well, we know

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:34.600
how to find correlations
between particular biochemical

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.400
or electrochemical
patterns in the brain,

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.440
and certain subjective
experiences.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.820
But we are very,
very far from being

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.860
able to understand how is
it that a particular pattern

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.730
of electrochemical
signals in the brain

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:57.160
creates a subjective experience
of love, or anger, or hate,

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.760
or whatever.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.620
The life sciences--
or currently most

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.510
of them-- have this
dogma that, OK, we

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.850
don't know how to explain
it, but in 20, or 30, or 50

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:10.280
years with more
experiments, more knowledge

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.930
we will understand how
electrochemical signals are

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:17.980
transformed into
subjective experiences.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.590
But at present in 2015
this is just dogma.

01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:28.130
Still today we don't have a clue
how electrochemical patterns

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:31.490
can turn into
subjective experiences.

01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:35.390
Maybe the life sciences
have got it wrong.

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:38.340
Maybe humans and
other animals are not

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.670
reducible to algorithms.

01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:43.010
This is an open question.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:47.170
However, in historical
terms, it's not as important

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:51.950
as you might think because
a religion or an ideology

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:56.420
does not have to be correct
in what it says in order

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.200
to take over the world.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.400
We have many cases
previously in history

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.410
when religions and
ideologies, which

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:06.920
said what we think today to
be completely erroneous things

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.560
about the world, nevertheless
managed to take it over.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.340
In scientific terms the story,
for example, that Christianity

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.190
tells about the world,
how the world was created,

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:21.980
how humans were created, how
things work in the world,

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.210
it's not true.

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:26.380
It's simply not true, at
least according to science.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.810
But this did not
prevent Christianity

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:31.370
from taking over
most of the world.

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:35.080
So you don't need the truth
to take over the world.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.350
Similarly with these
new data religions,

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:42.790
maybe they are based on a
misunderstanding of life,

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:45.290
but this will not
necessarily prevent them

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.210
from taking over the world.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:48.044
Thank you.

01:02:48.044 --> 01:02:51.432
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.170
My question is a bit random,
but you mentioned feminism.

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:04.980
And how we're now
starting with feminism.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.340
But some of the
other books I read

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.100
talked about how
actually way back when,

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:14.380
like around the agricultural
revolution, I guess,

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.850
there was no patriarchy.

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:17.600
It was equal society
where everybody

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.710
caught small animals, and
harvested stuff, and whatever.

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:27.670
So at what point in human
history did it become uneven?

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.330
YUVAL HARARI: Did
patriarchy arise?

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:30.550
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.160
YUVAL HARARI: Well, the
simplest-- I have a thing.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.720
Do you hear me?

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.930
The simplest answer
is that we don't know.

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:41.230
One of the things I
like most about science

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:43.050
is that when we
don't know something,

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.900
we can simply say we don't know.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:50.290
We have very little idea
how gender relations were

01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:53.110
prior to the
agricultural revolution.

01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:54.970
After the agricultural
revolution

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.610
when we have in mass
of first archaeological

01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.790
and then written
records, we know

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:02.620
that they were patriarchal.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.450
Like you see even
10,000 years ago,

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:07.800
you find the remains of
people from 10,000 years ago,

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.960
after the agricultural
revolution.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.160
You see that in times of famine
they allowed the girls to die

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.420
and kept the boys.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.410
The boys were fed-- you see in
skeletons that girls suffered

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:22.410
far more from malnutrition than
boys in the same community.

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:25.410
So this is a clear evidence
of patriarchy shortly

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.580
after the agricultural
revolution.

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.840
How did gender relations,
or family structures,

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.370
how did they look like 20,000
years ago, 50,000 years ago?

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.470
There are many theories.

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:38.650
We have no firm evidence.

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:43.390
Even if 50,000 years ago there
was a matriarchal society,

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:46.780
or an egalitarian
society, this is not

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.380
the case in the
last 10,000 years.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.020
So even if feminism,
the feminist revolution

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.550
returns things to what they
were like 50,000 years ago,

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:57.380
in terms of the
last 10,000 years,

01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.700
it's still probably the
biggest social revolution

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.980
that occurred.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.900
What is even more
important to realize

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.610
is that not only we don't know
what was the situation 20,000

01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:14.870
years ago, we don't have at
present any good explanation

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.660
for patriarchy.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.780
Many people think that the
domination of society by men

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.960
and the domination
of women by men

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.430
is obvious because men
are physically stronger.

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:30.020
The problem with this
very common theory

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.870
is that in human societies,
and even other ape societies,

01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:38.750
there is no direct correlation
between physical strength

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:40.710
and social power.

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:44.400
In human society, for
example, people in their 60s

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.810
usually dominate
people in their 20s

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:50.390
even though they are
weaker physically.

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:52.090
Or when you look
at organizations,

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:55.470
like the Catholic church,
so the pope is not

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:58.110
the strongest
Catholic in the world.

01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.090
And he did not
become pope by going

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.160
go around beating all the
other bishops and cardinals.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.640
You become pope or
you become president

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.450
by building coalitions
of supporters.

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:13.240
Social skills are the key for
social power among humans.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.060
And it's often argued that women
have superior social skills.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.470
They are better in compromising.

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:23.040
They are better at understanding
how other people think,

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.470
what other people want.

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.930
Whereas men are much
more self-centered

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:29.770
and have difficulty
understanding or caring

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.640
about what other
people think and feel.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.260
So if this is true we should
have got matriarchal societies.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.925
And among our closest cousins in
nature, the bonobo chimpanzees,

01:06:40.925 --> 01:06:44.370
we indeed find
matriarchal societies.

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:46.790
So how come in Homo
sapiens, nevertheless

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:50.300
in most societies in
the last 10,000 years

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.560
women were dominated by men?

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.830
We just don't know at present.

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:58.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it could
have been a survival strategy.

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:00.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.210
AUDIENCE: By the group.

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:03.520
YUVAL HARARI: Which?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.280
AUDIENCE: If you
had other groups,

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.160
like if you have
more men, you were

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.102
more likely to win
over the other group.

01:07:09.102 --> 01:07:11.310
YUVAL HARARI: Ah, but it's
not a question of numbers.

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:14.110
Again, if the main
thing is violence, then

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:17.179
again you get to a situation
in which men are expendable.

01:07:17.179 --> 01:07:18.470
AUDIENCE: I'm not saying it is.

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:20.230
I'm just saying it
might have been, right?

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:22.360
YUVAL HARARI: OK.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.000
AUDIENCE: It's very
dense material.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.550
Thank you for your presentation.

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.730
I have a couple of comments.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:32.730
Maybe you want to expand on
them and then one question.

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:35.920
So on the point that
we don't know what's

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.680
going to happen in the future
with the jobs going away,

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.640
so there are people
thinking about that.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.490
Jeremy Rifkin, for
example, he talks

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:45.610
about the zero marginal
cost economics, right?

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:48.030
So which poses a
problem for capitalism.

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.449
So we have some
ideas about that.

01:07:50.449 --> 01:07:52.740
YUVAL HARARI: Yeah, there
are people thinking about it.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.130
It's not the
Islamic state, which

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:58.420
is leading the world
thinking on the questions

01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.930
of the future of the job market.

01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:01.480
This is exactly the problem.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.910
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.390
The other thing that I
noticed in your talk,

01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:08.810
so when you say communism
slash socialism,

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:12.170
and then say, OK, this is
an ideology, a religion,

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.540
think of it as an
ideology and a religion

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.170
and compare it to
religions, I sort of

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:21.479
disagree there because I think
you can't really compare it

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.710
with religions because
they base their belief

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:29.939
system on irrationality,
whereas socialism was more

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.250
or less based on a belief
system of rationality.

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:35.970
And maybe that's the reason
it collapsed so easily,

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:38.910
so to speak, because
in the end people

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:42.290
were trained to think rationally
about everything else.

01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.410
So, but let's move on.

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:50.680
On the issue of, ask
yourself a question, what

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.609
did liberal society
do for us and what

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:56.670
did the church do
for us, I could

01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.020
think of Gregor Mendel, right,
and his genetics experiments.

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.380
But I will go to something
else, which is to say,

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:07.720
did the United States
invent the nuclear weapon?

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.620
It didn't.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.149
It provided a framework.

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:12.350
It provided the
funding to do that.

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:16.399
So the church provided the
funding for the Sistine Chapel

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.250
and for a lot of other things.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:22.460
So I think we sort
of glanced over it.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:26.680
But my biggest points
in the presentation

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:31.550
is I agree with
liberalism as an ideology.

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:34.020
I'm very liberal myself.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.140
I probably have 10% that
I'm scratching my head over,

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:43.540
but one thing that you
sort of glossed over

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:48.160
is the role of society,
of social interaction

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.630
between humans.

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:53.000
I mean, I don't
believe that it's only

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.130
the question of go
deep into yourself

01:09:56.130 --> 01:10:00.090
and think about what
your decision will be.

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:03.760
I mean, there's the test
for that, or the famous rail

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.230
or track experiment, or
the prisoners in the camp,

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:08.720
or whatnot.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.350
It's also about the bond
between those people.

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:15.480
And I think-- would
you agree that that

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.580
has a factor in [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:21.390
And then speaking of Google and
data stuff, I work in privacy.

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:26.161
So I'm going to fight from
that happening too soon.

01:10:26.161 --> 01:10:28.010
YUVAL HARARI: OK.

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:30.810
So I'll try to answer
in quick succession

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.020
to the different questions.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.030
Well, about social
interaction, yes,

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.690
when you look at
how people actually

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:40.990
make decisions
liberalism is wrong.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.900
We don't really go and
connect to ourselves

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.280
and decide from there.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.650
The impact of society
and culture is enormous.

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:49.950
But, again, as I said
before, the thing

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:52.920
with religions and ideology
is they don't have to be true.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.810
When they tell us connect to
yourself, follow your heart,

01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.590
and make your
decisions from there.

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:00.290
And this is how we
build our economy,

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.140
our politcs-- it's not true.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.760
But in terms of
ideology, and this

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.460
is what they are selling us
and this is what many of us

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.800
believe, that we go
to the supermarket

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.650
and we buy whatever
we want to buy.

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.640
The fact that our brain was
washed for hours and hours

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.756
by commercials and so forth,
liberalism discounts it.

01:11:18.756 --> 01:11:19.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:21.320
YUVAL HARARI:
Liberalism says no.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.190
Within yourself there is
an inner core of freedom.

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:25.802
And nothing can really touch it.

01:11:25.802 --> 01:11:27.010
Nothing can really change it.

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:28.830
Now, we know that it's not true.

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.500
But this is why it's an
ideology or a religion.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.400
Now I will also say
a few words about why

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.980
I call it a religion and
not just an ideology.

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.020
It's really a
question of semantics,

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.470
of how you define things.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:42.620
Many people define
religion as belief

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:46.270
in God or supernatural powers.

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:48.980
Nobody defines it as
believing irrationality.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:51.360
Religious people think
they are very rational.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.530
They never say, I'm
religious, I'm irrational.

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:57.550
Maybe a few of them do, but
the vast majority of them

01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:01.180
don't think that religion is
superstition or irrationality.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.560
Now, if you define
religion as belief in gods,

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.052
then, yes, liberalism
or communism, no,

01:12:06.052 --> 01:12:07.010
they are not religions.

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:09.870
And certainly data
religion is not a religion.

01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:12.460
But this is a very narrow
definition of religion.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.270
There have been
religions in history

01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:18.070
in which gods played a very
minor role like Buddhism

01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:19.750
and Confucianism.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.690
And we still call them religion.

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:24.830
For me the basic
definition of religion

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:27.380
is in terms of the
function it plays

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.530
in history and in society.

01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:36.150
Religion gives legitimacy
to human lows and norms

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:42.510
by hanging on to some super
human power or law of entity.

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:45.650
We come to people and we say,
you have to behave like this.

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:48.120
And they ask, why?

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.610
So you don't answer,
because I said so

01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:53.260
or because a couple of
people invented this law

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:54.470
and now you must obey.

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.890
This won't work.

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:59.510
You must go to some
super human authority.

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:02.480
Now there are two kinds
of superhuman authorities

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.690
we find throughout story.

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:07.600
One kind is gods.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.320
They are these superior
beings with personalities.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.200
If you don't do this,
they'll become angry.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.470
They'll punish you.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:16.490
But there is another
option, which

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:19.420
was common throughout
history and this

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:22.210
is to turn to natural laws.

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:25.950
The argument is human laws,
[? the laws ?] of society

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:27.910
were not invented by humans.

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:31.660
They reflect the laws of nature.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.500
Therefore they
are not arbitrary.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.680
They are not random and
you can't change them.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.580
You have to follow them.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.270
So this is the case with
Buddhism and Confucianism.

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:43.680
This is the case also with
communism or with Nazism.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.900
The Nazis come and
say, look, it's

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.370
not Hitler that invented this
whole racial theory and then

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:53.080
that they should be
exterminated and so forth.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.650
This is the laws of nature.

01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:56.810
Natural selection,
you've read Darwin.

01:13:56.810 --> 01:14:00.460
There are different biological
groups and so forth.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:04.300
Now we can say that
the Nazis misunderstood

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.780
Darwin and the
theory of evolution.

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:11.050
But in their eyes, the laws,
like the Nuremberg Laws

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:15.760
did not reflect some whim
of Hitler and the party.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.710
It reflected the
ultimate laws of nature.

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:22.820
And if we don't
follow these laws

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.650
we will disappear,
like other species

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.390
that have disappeared before us.

01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:30.140
So in this sense I
think that we can

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:34.000
speak about these ideologies
actually as religions

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.700
because they fulfill
the same function.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:42.130
They give legitimacy to
human laws and norms.

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:47.140
And the last question
was about Gregor Mendel,

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.639
that the church did
contribute, say, to genetics.

01:14:50.639 --> 01:14:51.930
But it's not really the church.

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:52.864
I'm not sure that--

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:53.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.321
YUVAL HARARI: Yeah, I'm not sure
that the pope was very happy

01:14:56.321 --> 01:14:58.470
if he knew what Gregor
Mendel was up to,

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.960
or what would come out of it.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.510
Which is not the same
as the United States

01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:06.790
financing the Manhattan Project.

01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:10.480
They knew exactly where they
were heading and they got it.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.940
So I think that there
is a difference there.

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:21.136
AUDIENCE: So a few kind of
questions dash comments.

01:15:21.136 --> 01:15:29.210
One is what is your
take on, I know

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:33.240
of at least a myth or
a fact of one society

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.250
that was matriarchal
in history, the Minoan.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:43.720
And I wonder if it
actually does end up

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.640
being supported by
historical facts, what

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.677
are the reasons that this
culture kind of vanished?

01:15:54.677 --> 01:15:55.510
That's one question.

01:15:55.510 --> 01:16:00.720
And the other one is with
respect to science fiction,

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.610
not all science fiction
is as you've described.

01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:06.570
And specifically--

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:07.445
YUVAL HARARI: I know.

01:16:07.445 --> 01:16:08.835
AUDIENCE: No,
specifically as you

01:16:08.835 --> 01:16:12.260
were talking I was thinking
of Heinlein and Asimov

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:17.870
who exactly have the
stories specifically talking

01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:20.840
about these exact things.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:26.120
And I wonder how you think
they would incorporate in

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.912
our future history, so to speak.

01:16:28.912 --> 01:16:29.620
YUVAL HARARI: OK.

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.630
So about the Minoan
culture, I'm not an expert.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:36.410
As far as I know, but you
have to check it with experts,

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:39.130
as far as I know it was for
a time believed that it was

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:42.690
a matriarchal society,
but no longer.

01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:46.400
Today the archaeological and
the deciphering of the writing

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.690
system show that it was probably
as patriarchal as any other,

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.930
maybe a little less, but it was
still a patriarchal society.

01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:58.430
We have some genuine examples
of matriarchal societies.

01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:01.740
For instance, I think there
is a certain region in China

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:06.050
in the southwest
of China that there

01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:08.350
is a genuine matriarchal
society there,

01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.120
but this is very, very rare.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.630
The vast majority of
societies and cultures

01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:17.210
known to science in the last
10,000 years were patriarchal.

01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:19.490
About science fiction, yeah,
you're of course right.

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:22.380
There are many strands
and not all of them

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:26.705
follow the basic script
that I described,

01:17:26.705 --> 01:17:32.680
like the "Frankenstein" script,
or the "Frankenstein" myth.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:39.710
But even in the case of the
writings of Asimov, for me

01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:42.730
the most interesting
tension and connection

01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:47.050
is between biology
and computer science.

01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:50.850
Very often when people
think about the ideas

01:17:50.850 --> 01:17:54.300
that I raised in the
last part of the lecture,

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:58.010
they give all the importance
to the advances in computer

01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:02.170
science to our ability to create
better and better algorithms

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:03.760
and computer programs.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.800
But in my eyes the
real revolution

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.780
is actually from
the life sciences.

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:10.810
The really big revolution
is when the life sciences

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:13.280
are telling us that
animals are basically

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.240
biochemical algorithms.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.220
If they didn't tell
us this then you

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:20.130
can have all the advances
you want in computer science.

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:22.425
It won't impinge on humanity.

01:18:22.425 --> 01:18:23.800
You will still
have humans, which

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.258
are something
completely different.

01:18:25.258 --> 01:18:28.750
And all the advances in
robotics and computers,

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.720
OK, we'll have better computers.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.130
We'll have better robots,
but it won't really

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.720
make much of a difference to us.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.650
Where it becomes really
amazing and really frightening

01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:42.350
is that once you
realize-- and this

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:44.370
is a contribution of
the life sciences--

01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:48.090
that actually humans
working in the same way,

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:51.160
then you can make
the connections.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.750
And this is the really
frightening stuff.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.930
This is also why I think
more and more companies

01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:01.000
like Google that started simply
as, in the computer business,

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.830
are moving more and more to
the biotechnology business.

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:08.655
And then the two industries
are merging into one.

01:19:08.655 --> 01:19:12.080
The most fundamental
idea in this respect

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.550
comes from the life
sciences, which says,

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:17.440
organisms are algorithms.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.830
This is the most important,
I think, insight of our age.

01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:24.730
And also the most
important question

01:19:24.730 --> 01:19:27.310
because we don't
have any proof of it.

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:29.180
Currently, it's just dogma.

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:35.690
We don't have any explanation
of how any kind of algorithm

01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:38.610
can create subjective
experiences.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:41.340
Indeed, in the field
of computers we are,

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:44.580
as far as I know, we're
not even close to creating

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.900
subjective experiences
in computers.

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:48.890
It's just a dogma that
people will say, yes.

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:50.640
It's the same.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.860
To give another
historical reference, back

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.220
in the 19th century
when they tried

01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:00.560
to understand humans, and the
human mind, and the human soul,

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.670
or whatever you would
like to call it,

01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:07.190
one of the main theories
was that humans were not

01:20:07.190 --> 01:20:08.270
algorithms.

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.850
Humans were steam engines.

01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:13.560
This is the basic
metaphor that stands

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.330
at the basis of
Freudian psychology.

01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:19.520
Humans usually try
to explain themselves

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.340
in terms of the most
sophisticated technology

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:22.840
of the day.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.600
Ah, we are like
this because this

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.690
is the most sophisticated
thing I know.

01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:30.290
In 1900, the most
sophisticated machine,

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:32.400
the most sophisticated
technology,

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.480
which was the basis
for the whole economy,

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.090
was the steam engine.

01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:39.470
So people came and said, ah, the
brain is like a steam engine.

01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:42.570
There are valves and there
are pressures and so forth.

01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:48.120
So even today we say that when
we want to unload our angst,

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.330
like we pick up the telephone
and we release some steam.

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:56.630
The idea is that the human being
is built like a steam engine.

01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:59.070
It has all these
pressures inside.

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:01.290
And if you block it
here it goes there.

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:04.360
And much of Freudian
psychology is built on this.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.140
So today this sounds
childish and silly.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.240
Oh, the human being is
like a steam engine?

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.469
We have a much better
technology is the computer.

01:21:11.469 --> 01:21:13.510
So we say, ah, humans are
not like steam engines.

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:15.120
They are like computers.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.360
But at present at least
this is just a dogma.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:24.920
We don't have the hard
facts to actually prove it.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.360
AUDIENCE: This is sort of, I
believe, a personal question.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.150
So you may skip if you
don't want to answer.

01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:33.210
But reading your
book it appeared

01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.355
to me and one of
friends in India

01:21:35.355 --> 01:21:39.590
that you have absolutely no
bias when I read your book.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:41.130
Is that really true?

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.410
Do you have any
attachments [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:45.860
of any nation, religion?

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.715
You may skip that.

01:21:47.715 --> 01:21:50.560
YUVAL HARARI: Well, it's
a very big compliment.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.250
Maybe the highest compliment
you can give a scientist

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:57.780
is that he or she has no bias.

01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:03.080
I tried to write the book
with as little bias as I can.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.080
I think you can read
between the lines

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.230
that there are some things
I like more than others,

01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:10.670
some ideologies,
religions, and so forth

01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:12.790
that I like more than others.

01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:17.440
But I think that my
aim as a historian

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:23.470
is above all to describe
reality, not to judge it.

01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:26.980
It's very important
afterwards to make judgments,

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.930
to decide what is good, what is
bad, where we should progress.

01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:34.180
But the most basic
challenge is first of all

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:36.230
to describe reality.

01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:41.580
And if you start with a certain
agenda then very quickly

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:44.990
you become blind
to much of reality

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:48.900
because one thing almost
certain about reality

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.970
is that it's complex.

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:53.050
You take any
historical development,

01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:55.760
the agricultural revolution,
the Industrial Revolution,

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.320
you will always find some bad
things, and some good things,

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.000
and some neutral
things about it.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.890
So if you start with
the idea of this is bad,

01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:05.109
you can't see at
least half the story.

01:23:05.109 --> 01:23:06.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much, Yuval.

01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:08.150
It was really, really--

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:11.500
