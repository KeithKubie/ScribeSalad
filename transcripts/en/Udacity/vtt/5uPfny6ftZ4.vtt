00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.290
So this line is a vertical line.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.780
It only contained points, like these,
whose x values are equal to 2.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.420
The way we represent this line as
a linear equation is like that, x=2.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.470
Notice this equation doesn't
say anything about y,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.525
because y can be anything.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:19.280
It can be 0, 3, -3, or
a billion or anything else.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.400
All it says is x=2, and
that describes this vertical line.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.644
If we want to describe
this vertical line, well,

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:30.444
it looks like all the x values are at 1,
2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:34.740
They're all that x=5, and so
that would be the equation.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.870
Now let me ask you a question.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.660
What would be the equation
of this vertical line?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.880
Enter your answer in this box.
