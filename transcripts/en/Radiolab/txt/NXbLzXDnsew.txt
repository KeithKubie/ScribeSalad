Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast podcast. And in this podcast I have learned, no, how would you describe this one? My sense is that

Speaker 2:          00:10          you walk into a wild place and you hear the wind and the trees and you hear these trips and sounds and calls and they're just part of the, they're part of the wild. They're wild life. But there's now a group of scientists who listen much more closely and who are reducing wildlife to wild talk. It's, it's a, yeah, there are words in there.

Speaker 1:          00:34          When you find the words as the people we will meet do in these stories, you end up not just understanding, but actually entering that wild space in a very cool way. So we're going to tell you two tales here, two different places. The first a jungle and the second a prairie right. Jungle gets it started and then the prairie and later, uh, this is a story, this first one that we heard about. Yeah. Yeah. I am from Ari. I'm Ra Daniel Shapiro. I'm a public radio producer in Boston. The Ra recently met a guy, I think a German. Yes. He's Swiss. No. Okay. Yeah. His name is Klaus Zuber, Buhler close and he's a professor of psychology at University of Saint Andrews, which is in Scotland. And where does this story actually take place? Because where's the jungle? Yeah, well I, I'm, I maybe the best place to start is to kind of describe the scene where we are, which is in the Thai forest forest, which is in the Ivory Coast in Africa. So it's not in Thailand. No, it's not. It's t a I, he a I. Okay. Yeah. And Klaus describes the jungle as this thick sensory world. Very dark, very moist and very, very green. And you can't really see for more than 15 to 20 feet. And I mean sometimes you feel like you walk through, you know, the big cathedral of dark trees and you don't see very much because all the animals obviously very shy and runaway Emmy. Is it still a no, it's, it is, it is very, very noisy.

Speaker 3:          02:10          It's just this kind of sonic fails all these insects and birds who bat sea mammals. It's almost as if they compete for acoustic space. So it is very, very loud. I mean, th th the main sensation you have in the beginning really is that you're, you're just completely lost.

Speaker 1:          02:34          So it's 1991 all right. And B figured he had to start somewhere. So he focuses attention on a kind of monkey, very beautiful monkey, a thing called the Diana monkey. This mix of black, white and sort of reddish. Diana monkeys live up in the tree tops, which can be as high as a hundred feet off the ground. Wow. They eat fruits and they eat insects and they're chattering.

Speaker 4:          02:56          Hello. Good coffin. Any of

Speaker 5:          03:00          calls, which to him, of course, you know, as a newcomer to the forest was all just noise. There's a little bit, I imagine like a child trying to learn a language, which initially most just sound like a stream of sounds that you can't really understand. And then you know what? So what did he do? Well, he started provoking the monkeys into making different kinds of noises. For instance, he'd walk out into the forest with a boombox speaker and play

Speaker 6:          03:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:33          it sound of the Diana monkeys most feared Predator. The leper. He would just play the sound into the trees. Yep. Well all of a sudden suddenly he started leaping around the branches. You all who's hopping around motion and they make this one particular call.

Speaker 7:          03:54          Ah, you these very loud alarm calls. Yes ma'am. Ah,

Speaker 1:          04:00          meaning what? Yeah. Are they just saying like run or is it something more specific? Well, here's where it gets a little bit more interesting. Next step. He brought that same cassette player out, pointed as the trees hit, play, all that. Yep. But this time he plays

Speaker 5:          04:14          the shrieks or for Crown Eagle Eagles eat monkeys. Yeah, they do tack from a bowl. I've heard about them. They're very scary. They come flying in with their talons. Are there

Speaker 8:          04:24          beaks and they hit you in the head sharply and kill you instantly and then you fall to the ground. Yeah. And so what are the monkeys do when they hear this? They make

Speaker 7:          04:34          ah,

Speaker 1:          04:35          that sound. Same One. Well, that's what he thought. But when he went back to the lab and started looking at the sounds on the computer comparing one to the other Eagle,

Speaker 7:          04:43          Huh? A Leopard Eagle, a leper, he realized

Speaker 9:          04:52          woo

Speaker 1:          04:52          that they're actually slightly different

Speaker 5:          04:55          in the acoustic details of the calls. And it's something that is very difficult to hear when you're, you really only see it in the spectrogram, which is kind of a visual representation of dis calls. This is on the computer. Yeah. But interestingly once you've seen that and once you know what to pay attention to, you go out into the forest and suddenly you do hear these differences, which you hadn't heard before.

Speaker 6:          05:23          Mm.

Speaker 8:          05:23          So you're saying when they hear, oh call leopard coming, they go up the tree. But when they hear eagle coming, they run down the tree. Exactly. Exactly. So it's really kind of like, oh word. They, they like a word. No, that's kind of amazing. Let's pull up for a second, cause this guy actually got us thinking honestly, how much language actually is out there in the wild. What do we know? What's the state of [inaudible] state

Speaker 1:          05:43          of what we know right now. And that question, let us out of the forest just for a second. And to a place in a creature we just didn't think would be a part of this conversation at all. Um, that creature is

Speaker 8:          05:59          the [inaudible] prairie dog woo. Reverie dogs. So here's the thing. Prairie dogs are these little rodent like animals. They live under the ground in burrows and when their community is invaded, they, you know, pop out of the brewery, right? And they do, Oh, here comes the whatever sounds kind of like

Speaker 6:          06:17          g, G, G, G, g. G. G. G.

Speaker 8:          06:23          So we spoke with this guy. Um, my name is constable Chekhov, professor emeritus at northern Arizona University who spent a whole lot of time sitting out in the colonies according prairie dog calls. And he now believes that these simple little rodents are like nature's wordsmith. Well, the thing is that initially I recorded, for instance, he began by telling us that the prairie dogs have different kinds of cheese for different kinds of predators. For example, humans, coyotes and docks, right? Is this the kind of thing that we would actually be able to hear the difference between the calls? I'm guessing that you could hear the difference. You want to try it? Chat? Yeah. Sorry. Could you just play those samples? All right. So here, here's one.

Speaker 6:          07:04          Yes sir.

Speaker 8:          07:06          This is it. Another one.

Speaker 6:          07:08          Okay.

Speaker 8:          07:11          All right. Hey, here we go. This is it.

Speaker 6:          07:13          Third,

Speaker 8:          07:17          those represent different predators. Yup. I don't, I can't tell the difference. Can you, I mean, do you know what they are? My guess is human dog. Coyote Khan was right. Columbus ride. Wow. Well, naturally we wondered how, how'd he do that? He told us that at first just like you and I, he couldn't figure out how to distinguish between these sounds, but he took the sound back to the lab where we had a machine that allowed us to measure a series of, uh, frequency and time elements in the call. And what this computer does is it takes the sound that the prairie dogs make and it essentially looks inside for the ingredients inside the sound. Yeah. Like, uh, well it's Kinda hard to hear with the Chirp because it's just hard. So let, let me demonstrate crudely with this other sound. I plucked this at random from my library. So this is kind of like a buzz. Okay. Okay. Let me just loop it so we can hear it better. So here you've got this buzz, which is sounds to us like a solid piece of noise, but getting the cue and take away all the highs.

Speaker 10:         08:26          So now you've got just the base. Yep. Now you'll notice that if you add the highest back in real slowly, these little hidden overtones will pop out like a, here's one. Yep. There's another

Speaker 9:          08:40          third, fourth.

Speaker 8:          08:45          So in other words, this sound is filled with a little ghost notes that we can't hear. And certainly the same is true of this sound.

Speaker 6:          08:53          Sure.

Speaker 8:          08:54          Except in the case of the prairie dogs, it seems their ears are tuned to hear all the different sounds within the church. Probably sounds to them like this whole layer cake of tones and calms computer. Notice the noise they made when a human walked through their village was different in tone from the noise they made. When a coyote walked through their village, it was, it was consistently different, but there was a problem when he zoomed in on the, Oh, here come the human calls, you look here, and he looked at them really closely. He saw that from one human call to the next. There was a lot of subtle variation, much, much more than I would expect and that's when it hit him. What if, what if, what if? What if they could be describing the individual humans? Oh, now at that time, no one suspected that this might even be a possibility, but I thought, well, let's try it and see what happens.

Speaker 8:          09:49          So Khan recruited for humans and he had them dress exactly the same. Same boots, same blue jeans, same sunglasses, everything the same except the color of their shirts. We had a person in a blue tee shirt person in green tee shirt, person in a yellow shirt person in a gray shirt. Then he asked each of them to walk through the prairie dog village one by one sprayer downs made their chips. And when we analyze the results, there were significant differences. Like what kind they essentially clustered around the colors. Does that mean you think you can hear them saying, here comes the human in blue, right? Versus here comes the human in yellow, right? Really? Oh, I was astounded. I was astounded. I was like, oh, wait a second. These humans, they're not just different in their shirt colors there. They're different than all kinds of ways.

Speaker 8:          10:40          Some of the humans were taller, some of the humans were shorter. So we went back reanalyzed the chirps looked a little more closely and he realized he could tease out to the prairie dogs were also commenting about the, uh, general size of the human. Essentially. They were saying, here comes the tall human in the blue versus here comes the short human in the yellow. Wow. And then he made another leap and it was just, you know, since he was on a roll, um, off the wall idea at that time, he went back into the prairie dog field and he built two large wooden boxes sitting on stilts, a good distance from each other, 150 feet. And we strung wires between the two towers. His team then made cardboard cutouts of three different shapes, a circle, a square and a triangle. And then they ran them out along the wire, kind of like laundry fluttering above you in the breeze.

Speaker 8:          11:37          Each shape would emerge from one of the tower blinds and fly something like about three feet over the prairie dog town. Literally, you would just kind of go and out would come a triangle or a circle or square. Correct. And what we found was that the prairie dogs could tell the triangle from the circle very easily, but they could not seem to tell the difference between a square in a circle. Huh? Why not? Well, my guess is that triangles kind of look like Cox, mm. Circles and squares kind of look like terrestrial predators. Nonetheless. What you've got here is a little Roden with the remarkably big vocabulary,

Speaker 1:          12:25          including the probably not limited to short fat, skinny, tall, blue, green, yellow, gray, coyote, human hoc triangle. Enter a square, Yay.

Speaker 8:          12:33          Not Bad is the next step that you're going to perform a scene from the winter's tale and see whether the Perry lugs laugh at the right moments. What do you do next? Well, we just are scratching the surface of looking at this. For example, prairie dogs have a lot of calls, which we call social chatters. One prairie dog will be feeding and suddenly lift up its head and go, chitter chatter, Chitter, Chitter, and another prairie dog. Somewhere across the colony will lift up its head and go, chatter, chatter, Chitter, chitter. But what does it mean? We have no way of getting at it. It could be just simply chatter, tutor, tutor, or it could be, do you know where Sam was last night?

Speaker 2:          13:20          Now here's an interesting question. I mean, if a French couple was sitting next to me on the subway and they was saying, do you know where Sam was last night in French? If I don't speak French, I'm outside of that conversation. But a lot of people do speak French and they can listen to French people talking. The questions then rays. If you live in the forest and you speak chimp or you speak eagle or you speak snake, would you ever be able to overhear or learn something from a neighborly species? In other words, is there an equivalent of listening to the other person talking French in the wild? Hmm, good question. And that brings us back to Klaus. You remember class?

Speaker 1:          13:59          The monkey guy? Yeah, the monkey guy. Well, Klaus was wondering the same thing, and that's a Ari Daniel Shapiro again, who introduced us to class. So take those alarm calls, for instance. He wanted to know whether different species of monkeys could understand each other. So, um, and luckily for class there's like at least 10 different primate species living inside that Thai forest. So there's one Calibus monkey two [inaudible] three chimpanzees, four oligos Holbein six, Heidi knows monkeys, seven mangabey species, Prosimians temples, monkey, and then the Diana's 10. Yeah. So it's very, they rich prime at foreigner. So Klaus's question was, could Diana monkeys understand the alarm calls of another one of these monkeys? The Campbell's monkey. Oh, could they go across monkey lines so to speak? Exactly. So he used that same setup from before, the speaker thing where he plays the, into the trees. Yeah. Any played the eagle and leopard alarm calls from the Campbell's money

Speaker 5:          14:55          keys to the Diana's to see if they'd react. And what we found thorough to our great surprise was that the diner monkeys,

Speaker 1:          15:02          they understand it really, really. Yep. Picked it very, very seriously and respond to very strongly. So a Dianna monkey hearing a Campbell's eagle alarm call will respond as though there were an eagle and we'll respond to the leopard alarm call as though there were a leopard and vice versa. And it doesn't stop there. Klaus started playing the monkey calls to birds, the truss hornbills, yellow casked hornbills. It turns out that they understand it. The birds, these hornbills are capable of discriminating these different monkey alarm calls. Wow. So it's a pretty substantial Webb species, basically eavesdropping on, on each other's calls in these forests. But Klaus himself, he was still on the outside of it all. It is,

Speaker 5:          15:49          um, general sense of perhaps not really belonging there. But then he told me about this one day I was uh, working in the forest. He had gone out for the day and he'd gone out alone and it was very far away from camp and it was in the late afternoon and he realized that he should probably be heading back to camp because I still had to walk for a, you know, something like 50, 20 kilometers to back to camp. And he was walking past it, a kind of valley and then [inaudible] on the other side of the valley.

Speaker 9:          16:19          Got It.

Speaker 5:          16:21          A monkey group giving light, put alarm calls, which doesn't happen that often. It was the first time that he wasn't actively listening, but he heard these monkeys make this call and recognized it. It was absolutely striking and he was actually quite excited by this because I was suddenly able to understand what the monkeys trying to say so to speak. Those monkeys had picked up a Lebron Ah, right beneath that sound there. The leopard would be right, but you know, those monkeys were way across the valley. So I didn't really think that more children walked on, perhaps, you know, half, half a mile further down the road. And the next group of Diana monkeys,

Speaker 9:          17:04          I

Speaker 1:          17:05          still across the valley,

Speaker 9:          17:06          okay.

Speaker 5:          17:07          Start giving leopard alarm codes as well. And he kind of took notice of that and then it happened a third time, a few minutes later. What became clear to me very rapidly is that elaborate was tracking him. Of course I couldn't see it because he was, you know, dense for us. But I assume that, uh, the, the lipid saw me of course, that, you know, it's just one of these moments where you're, you know, you're totally alone, um, far, far away from Cam. What does he do?

Speaker 1:          17:42          He, he kept walking. It happened at fourth group called Leopard, fifth group called Leopard. And then the group stopped calling.

Speaker 6:          17:51          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          17:55          The only thing I could think of is to pick up, um, you know, a large branch.

Speaker 1:          18:01          It shouldn't laugh. That's as terrifying. Klaus, would that stick have done anything for you?

Speaker 5:          18:05          Uh, I, I doubt I really would have been able to do very much with the steak.

Speaker 1:          18:10          But as he standing there sticking hand, he realizes he's just entered the forest. He's become, do you 11th primate, the 11th primate because there are those 10 other species of primate. And now

Speaker 5:          18:26          me, suddenly I shifted from being the objective observer to being a, you know, sort of part of the whole crowd in there. Even though, you know, we're separated by 20, 30 millions of years of evolutionary history, you know, these humble creatures, um, you know, were able to teach me something about, you know, what was going on in the forest. And I mean, of course it wasn't intentional. They weren't trying to inform me or anything like that, but, um, it was a, a very emotional experience.

Speaker 10:         19:06          So what happened? I mean, obviously he didn't get eaten. What happened? Well, he, he made it back to camp and he's not sure what happened to the leopard. The Leopard must've slinked off into the forest in the end.

Speaker 5:          19:18          Another story to tell each other over beers in the evening, I suppose.

Speaker 10:         19:23          Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 6:          19:28          Ah,

Speaker 1:          19:32          thanks for that story too. Ari, Daniel Shapiro, our correspondent, and also thanks to um, Klaus Zuber, Bueller and cons. Labatt Ukaf I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
