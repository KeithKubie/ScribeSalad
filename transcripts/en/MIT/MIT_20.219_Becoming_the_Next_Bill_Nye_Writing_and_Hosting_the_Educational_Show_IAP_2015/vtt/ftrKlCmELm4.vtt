00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.710
PROFESSOR: I want to talk a
little bit about producing

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.340
and realizing your
visions, and give

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.080
an example of some of the things
that Chris was talking about.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.170
So we shot a video on how
engines worked, and there

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.766
is a part of the video where
the two creators were talking

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.140
about how a turbine
engine works.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.400
And I think I might have
told this story before,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.642
about how we ended up finding
like an actual Boeing engine.

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:56.100
But there are a
lot of ways that we

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.308
could have filmed this scene.

00:00:57.308 --> 00:01:02.220
We could have animated it, we
could have done a wide frame

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.820
shot with animation overlay,
like I showed you with George's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.050
[INAUDIBLE] videos.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.840
We could have done B-roll,
so we could have just done

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.370
like close up
shots of the engine

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.560
while you heard Luke
explaining how it worked,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.550
with his voiceover.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.380
Or we could have done
a live explanation,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.630
which is what we went with.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.730
So this is how George shot Luke.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.880
We went with the
traditional thirds framing.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.430
Again, this isn't necessarily
a rule that you have to go by,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.200
it just worked really
well for this scene.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.690
And we went with
this because it also

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.070
gave us the ability to do sort
of an interesting point of view

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.570
shot.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.100
The point of view isn't
from the narrator,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.550
it's actually from the viewer.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.670
So I'll show you the
clip in a second.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.860
But essentially, we
did one long take

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.280
where George moved his
camera as Luke was explaining

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.460
the parts of the engine.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.520
So we wanted it to feel like
the camera was basically

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.410
where a person would be if Luke
was explaining how a turbine

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.891
engine works to a
person standing there.

00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:10.339
LUKE: --won't work.

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.880
FEMALE IN VIDEO:
What you really need

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.952
is one engine that can
produce enough horsepower

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:15.660
to fly the plane.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.760
A turbine engine is capable
of much more horse power

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.810
than a piston engine
because of the way

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.805
it uses giant fans
to compress the air.

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:26.180
LUKE: At the front
of the turbine

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.200
engine is an intake
fan which spins

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.800
and brings a huge amount of air
into the front of the engine.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.970
As we move backwards
through the engine,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.460
a series of compressor blades
makes that air more and more

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.850
compressed, until we get here.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.500
And here, fuel is
introduced and burned.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.270
And that hot, high
pressure flow gets sent

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.480
out the back of the engine.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.520
And that makes the
thrust of the engine.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.350
But at the same time,
that flow passes

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.760
through a series of four
or five turbine blades,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.430
and those blades are
connected directly

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.620
to a shaft at the
middle of the engine.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.280
That shaft runs all the
way back to the front

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.420
and spins the intake fan.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.070
That's what keeps
the engine running.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.380
PROFESSOR: So that shot
worked because Luke

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.330
was very comfortable explaining
that in one long take.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.580
He actually ad libbed
that whole thing.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.370
And I can see that it's a
lot of information at once,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.620
so maybe it would have been
better to do an animation.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.869
We certainly could've done
it a lot of different ways.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.450
But what I like
about that shot is

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.570
that if you were
just standing there,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.290
and Luke was
explaining it to you,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.500
the camera would basically
be your eyes, right?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.160
Like you would walk
along with him,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.270
and you would look down at the
engine when he pointed to it,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.160
you would look back up at him.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.090
So that's the type of movement
that Chris was talking about

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.000
that you can introduce
to your video.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.057
It would be really different
if we had just set up a tripod

00:03:46.057 --> 00:03:47.890
and had Luke explain
the whole thing, right?

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.417
Like it would have been a
very different experience.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.371
GUEST SPEAKER: And it's
not random movement,

00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.040
it's obviously very
directed, which

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.187
is the key to many of
these kinds of things.

00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:56.387
It's not [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:57.095
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:01.280
Like we wanted to really follow
what the natural person would

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.095
do if they were just standing
there talking to Luke.

00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:06.970
I want to talk about
the lighting real quick.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.000
So we were in an
airplane hangar,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.790
and it was like
one in the morning,

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.380
so it was super dark outside.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.350
I mean, we mostly relied
on the overhead lights.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.660
I don't actually know if we
lit this with anything else.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.050
Because it's super
bright in there.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.170
So you don't need
super fancy equipment

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.170
to achieve the videos that
you guys are going to do.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.930
So to talk a little bit
more about producing,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.324
when you think of
directing I feel

00:04:35.324 --> 00:04:37.740
like that's what most people
think of when making a video.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.948
And directing is a lot about
thinking in the present.

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:43.500
So you're coaching the host,
you're coaching the talent,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.697
telling them what to do
right there in that moment.

00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:47.530
You're thinking about
what the framing looks

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.690
like in that moment.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.570
Producing is a lot about
thinking about the future,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.420
anticipating what's coming
next, the mistakes that you're

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.240
going to make.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.807
So on a practical level it's a
lot of check boxes, basically.

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:02.390
You're thinking about
where am I going

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.890
to film, what are my backups
going to be, where am I

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.570
going to record voice over?

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.430
My experience filming at MIT is
that it is incredibly difficult

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.730
to find a quiet place on campus
to record clean voiceover.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.864
And if you're having
trouble finding a spot,

00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:19.030
come talk to me at any time.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.429
I can help you with that.

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:21.762
AUDIENCE: What do you mean that?

00:05:21.762 --> 00:05:23.634
Why do you mean that?

00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:25.550
PROFESSOR: So take this
classroom for example,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.050
most of the spaces on campus
have this hum overhead.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.620
And most of you guys will be
relying on the lavalier mic,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.330
so it's not as bad.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.162
But there's just a lot
of background noise

00:05:38.162 --> 00:05:41.420
that is on campus.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.190
So if you're just
recording plain voice over

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.080
that you want to
use in your video,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.580
it would be more
ideal if you could

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.440
get something that's quieter
than this room, for example.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.660
So you're thinking
in checklists,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.920
and some of the boxes
are a little more inane,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.970
like did we shoot
all of the scenes?

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.890
Which sounds stupid,
but I actually

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.850
missed that on my own video.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.520
I forgot to film
one of the scenes.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.910
And then, did we
get clean audio?

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.210
So a tip that I would
recommend for you guys

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.050
is, even after you film
all of your scenes,

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.640
I would sit down and just record
voiceover of your entire script

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.450
in a separate audio file.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.920
Because you never know,
looking back on the footage,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.110
there may be sections where
the audio isn't very clean.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.530
So you may have to rely
on your clean voiceover

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.390
for that section.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.400
And maybe use B-roll to fill in.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.150
If that makes sense to people.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.720
Does anyone have
questions so far?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.570
Yes.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.210
AUDIENCE: Like you are filming,
and then you have a voice--

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.972
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:40.972 --> 00:06:43.305
AUDIENCE: --then you want to
use a voiceover separately.

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:45.444
Then wouldn't the pacing off?

00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:46.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:53.880
So for example we shot a
video, and part of it--

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.770
I'll talk more about it during
the editing lecture next week,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.550
but if you can find a
clean place to transition

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.150
between the live footage
and your voiceover,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.950
that's like the best
way to do that if you

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.040
find that some of your footage
just has really bad live audio.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.030
For every place
that you shoot, I

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.900
recommend that you get room
tone, which is basically

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.660
the natural sound of the room.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.120
So for example, if you were
going to shoot in this room,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.950
you would shoot the scene, and
then you would take your mic

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.627
and just record 30 seconds
where everyone's quiet.

00:07:26.627 --> 00:07:28.460
And it's just going to
record the background

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.150
noise of the room.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.210
And you do that because if
there is a case where you're

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.380
relying on voiceover
that you shot later,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.824
or you're cutting bits and
pieces from the footage

00:07:40.824 --> 00:07:42.240
that you shot in
this room, you're

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.240
going to have this
gap or a hiccup

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.230
where the hum doesn't
exist, and it's

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.080
going to sound really
awkward in the video.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.140
So you layer the room
tone underneath when

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.400
you're editing so that you
don't have those hiccups

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.130
between the cuts that you make.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.800
GUEST SPEAKER: It's
kind of a decision

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.391
that you have to make,
too, based on the room.

00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:04.690
So like with Jeff, we actually
did the voiceover in the room.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.550
Because it had a hum,
so we could have done

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.800
a better job of the voiceover.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.090
But what we decided was that it
would be more jarring if there

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.960
was a major audio quality
difference between the voice

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.650
over and the on
camera, you know,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.560
had we done it in a studio
or in a better space later.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.300
So, you know, it was clean
enough, we accepted it.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.450
And that's why we
had him do everything

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.720
on the spot in the same
place, so that it wouldn't

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.034
have that drop in and out.

00:08:32.034 --> 00:08:32.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.991
Does that make sense to people?

00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:38.059
Like if we took the footage,
like this footage where

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.820
I'm talking here, and then
we cut to something where

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.970
I continue to talk
about this class,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.940
but I was doing it
over a voiceover,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.610
and we had some B-roll
of you guys working.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.157
The first scene, you
would hear the hum,

00:08:51.157 --> 00:08:52.240
and you'd hear me talking.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.010
But in the second
scene, you would just

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.860
hear like very clean dead
space while I'm talking.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.030
And you would see
you guys working.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.250
And it would sound
and look really weird.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.146
It would feel really
weird to watch.

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:06.430
GUEST SPEAKER: So we
just did another video

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.504
not unlike the
[INAUDIBLE] video,

00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:11.670
except that the person is
in Kendall Square talking.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.870
All the on camera stuff
was in Kendall Square.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.600
And that's really
noisy, so we decided in

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.820
that case to do the opposite.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.404
We didn't have him record
everything in Kendall Square,

00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:23.820
because then we would be dealing
with problems throughout.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.280
But what we did is we recorded
the equivalent of room tone.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.800
We just got audio
of Kendall Square,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.780
and then we were able to
sort of slowly fade it out

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.530
after the person was
on camera, so that it

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.790
was more imperceptible.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.810
And then slowly fade it
back in before an on camera

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.028
arrived-- you know, comes back.

00:09:42.028 --> 00:09:43.986
AUDIENCE: There's no way
you can filter it out?

00:09:43.986 --> 00:09:45.880
Just kind of--

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.650
GUEST SPEAKER: Well
you can filter audio.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.640
What I always tell
people is don't.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.220
Especially like,
if you're not going

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.900
to spend thousands
of dollars doing it,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.790
don't think you can do a lot.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.930
There are a lot of consumer
tools that are available.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.760
They generally really
degrade the voice.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.172
Everyone ends up sounding
like I'm Stephen Hawking.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:08.380
PROFESSOR: Because the
frequencies in the room tone--

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.500
GUEST SPEAKER:
Very similar, yeah.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.583
PROFESSOR: --some of the
frequencies in the voice.

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:15.350
GUEST SPEAKER: So very,
very high end, very time

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.890
consuming tools are
out there to do it.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.509
But they're out of reach.

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:23.550
PROFESSOR: Music can help
hide that a little bit,

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.560
and I'm going to show you guys
examples of that next week.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.620
But in general like it literally
takes 30 seconds for you

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.620
to record the room tone.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.660
So that's--

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.350
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
it's definitely worth it.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.730
PROFESSOR: --It's worth it.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.580
So in general, as
a producer you're

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.450
doing a lot of anticipatory
thinking, which

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.170
is to help you
ultimately realize

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.720
your big vision for your video.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.660
So you're doing all
of these checklists,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.240
you're thinking ahead of time.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.573
Even in pre-production, which
is where we are right now,

00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:53.130
where you're scripting.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.800
As a producer you're going to be
thinking about the big picture

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.210
the entire time.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.810
So producing is really
looking at the big picture.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.560
You're looking at how the
microscopic decisions like,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.380
where you're going to
shoot for instance,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.390
or where are you going
to record the room tone,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.810
how that all fits into
your macroscopic plan.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.930
So as Chris said, it's really
important to scout locations.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.180
And when you go scout locations,
the two big things to look at

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.307
are what's the lighting
like at that place,

00:11:18.307 --> 00:11:19.390
and what's the sound like?

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.360
And when you're
looking at lighting,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.830
not only look at
the natural light

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.890
that's available in the room,
if it's indoors for example,

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.730
but how the sunlight
affects the room.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.950
So when we were pre-producing
this OpenCourseWare class,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.700
we came and scouted
this classroom.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.160
And we noticed that there
are all these big windows,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.712
and it was an afternoon class.

00:11:38.712 --> 00:11:40.420
And I knew that the
lighting in this room

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.330
would be really
different at 1 o'clock

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.320
than it would be at 4 o'clock.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.020
So we decided that it actually
wouldn't be too big of a deal,

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.767
because people
watching the video

00:11:48.767 --> 00:11:51.100
wouldn't be like, oh my gosh
it's dark in that classroom

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.720
now, that doesn't
make any sense.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.920
Because obviously we know
it's a three hour class.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.420
GUEST SPEAKER:
You'll notice Billy's

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.500
on that side of the room,
not on this side of the room.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.166
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:01.675
GUEST SPEAKER: That's
because if Elizabeth

00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:03.140
was teaching in
that corner, we'd

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.730
have a problem with the windows.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.780
PROFESSOR: And we thought
about if we should just

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.874
lower the shades the entire time
so we have uniform lighting.

00:12:10.874 --> 00:12:12.290
So those are the
kind of questions

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.248
that you'll ask yourself
during pre-production.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.480
And sound, again,
take room tone.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.720
The biggest sound issues
if you're outdoors,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.990
the wind makes a big difference.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.852
Most of you guys are going to
just rely on your lavaliers,

00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:27.060
and they have the little cap.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.750
And that does a
generally good job,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.678
but just take note of
it when you go scout.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.322
My personal tip is
look for outlets.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:38.030
That's always been
like the biggest thing

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.540
for us is, especially if it's
an outdoor location, scouting

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.120
ahead of time and seeing
how many outlets there are

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.150
helps you anticipate
how many extension

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.150
cords you need to bring.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.390
Which sounds like a silly
thing, but actually makes

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.530
a huge difference.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.300
So for example we
shot this video

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.480
with Jamie in the Stata
Center on computer switches.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.210
And we were with the Digi-Comp.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.770
Or the Digi-Cart?

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.920
Digi-Comp.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.340
Which we couldn't move, so we
had to shoot in this location.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.980
And it was in Stata so we
knew it would be really noisy.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.390
So we shot at like 6:00
in the morning on Sunday,

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.220
when no one would be around.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.090
But the thing that
we didn't anticipate,

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.510
because I didn't scout that
location, which is bad,

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:25.310
is that there's a skylight right
above the Digi-Comp-- I always

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.800
forget what it's called.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.410
So noon hit, and we had to
stop filming because there

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.580
was sunlight directly
overhead that

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.660
completely changed the shadows
on the prop, and on Jamie.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.810
So we basically lost two
hours of shooting time

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.730
because we were waiting for
the sun to pass overhead.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.020
So that's why you should scout
your locations ahead of time.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.630
A quick note on locations,
also look at backgrounds.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.410
And with backgrounds you
should really be deliberate.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.730
And go big or go home.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.460
So for example,
this is a background

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.050
that I think a lot
of people default

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.810
to when they don't really
have anything else to shoot,

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.170
because they just sit-in
their office and they're like,

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.795
I need to record
something really fast,

00:14:06.795 --> 00:14:08.620
I'll just sit here.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.470
Sitting in front of a
window that has blinds on it

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.760
is maybe the worst possible
background that you could use.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.700
And again, this is a
matter of personal taste,

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.450
but I cringe when I see
this for two reasons.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.420
One, it's really back-lit,
which is what Chris

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.990
was talking about earlier.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.400
So you'll have so
much outdoor light

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.180
that it makes your
subjects look really dark.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.560
And having all the
blinds in the background,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.920
I think having all those lines
is really distracting as well.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.240
This is what
happened when George

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.010
tried to change the exposure
setting on the camera

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.120
to light for me.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.180
So I'm lit well, but
now the background

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.690
is completely blown out.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.730
So in general, avoid filming
right in front of a window

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.232
where there is direct
sunlight coming in.

00:14:55.232 --> 00:14:56.940
And please don't film
in front of blinds.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.080
If anyone is
interested in filming

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.160
in front of a green
screen, it's possible,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.825
and I'm happy to help you.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.200
I think you should be very
deliberate with that decision.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.050
Sometimes it works really well.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.082
This is an example.

00:15:14.082 --> 00:15:15.790
FEMALE IN VIDEO: So
in order to turn red,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.260
neurons from the squid's
brain sends signals

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.410
to these muscles, which pull
open all of his chromatophores

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.140
at the same time.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.751
PROFESSOR: So-- oh,
this was the wrong clip.

00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:27.250
Sorry guys.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.090
But there is one
example where she

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.450
says, take note, when I
walk next to the squid,

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.380
he turns red.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.572
And so you actually see
her walking on screen,

00:15:35.572 --> 00:15:36.780
and then the squid turns red.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.900
And so we used a green
screen to film this

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.610
because we like
the actual visual

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:46.980
of seeing some sort of
object stimulating the squid

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.700
to turn colors.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.230
So that's an example of a
green screen working well,

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.310
I think in my opinion.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.370
If you want to do something like
that, I'm happy to help you.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.290
But again, you
don't have to do it.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.910
So more production tips.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.420
Days before, make sure
you scout your locations.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.800
A word about props.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.840
So props don't have
to be expensive.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.000
And I'm not just talking
about props on screen.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.100
I'm also talking about the
tools that you can use to film.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.310
So we're giving you a
tripod, and that's basically

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.880
your only production prop.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.590
But as Chris was saying,
like you can use desk lamps

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.290
with paper over them.

00:16:32.877 --> 00:16:33.960
Let me show you this shot.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.501
FEMALE IN VIDEO:
Let me show you how.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.300
PROFESSOR: So those are
all dolly shots basically,

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.600
of us establishing the
location of this video, which

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.900
is in D lab, which
is where Jack works.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.210
And they're all very smooth
pans of looking around

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.390
at the locations.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.590
And we shot that with
a cart, like a hand

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.800
cart that I just sat in,
and George pushed me around.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.460
So you could buy a
super expensive dolly,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.670
or you can just borrow a
cart from our department,

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:14.390
and sit-in it, and have
someone push you around.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.339
The dolly is always
nicer, but we

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.650
don't have the budget for that.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.108
GUEST SPEAKER: Great job with
steady camerawork by the way.

00:17:20.108 --> 00:17:23.010
It can be an issue if
you're sitting on a cart,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.670
if you start getting
a lot of this,

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.229
it takes away from the
niceness of the shot.

00:17:28.229 --> 00:17:29.700
But in this case it was great.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.690
PROFESSOR: We took a
tripod and spread the legs

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.830
out all the way, so that
it was like really, really

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.330
firm in the cart.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.539
And then I held it just
to add more stability.

00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:41.080
So it's possible
this is another one.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.413
FEMALE IN VIDEO: To figure
out how the entire metabolome

00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:45.220
works, we can use it
to engineer plants

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.520
to create new bio-materials,
medicines, and clean energy.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.190
We might even discover
that plants have

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.050
the secret to living forever.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.211
We just need to unlock
their chemical mysteries.

00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:57.460
PROFESSOR: So that's actually
one of my favorite shots

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.420
from Science Out Loud, ever.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.360
And that was all George's idea,
so I have to give him credit.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.950
But I like it because
it's a reveal,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.160
like Chris was talking about.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.493
It's the way we ended the video.

00:18:06.493 --> 00:18:08.800
We start off on the
plants, focused on it,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.120
and you reveal
Anastasia at the end.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.650
And that's actually-- to
get that smooth movement is

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.760
actually really hard.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.950
You might be able to do
it with these tripods

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.510
because the cameras
aren't really heavy.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.930
And you could probably get
enough friction on them

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.610
to get it to work.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.730
But what we did was, George was
using a camera like that one.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:40.550
So he took the tripod, flipped
the top head of it upside down,

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:44.340
and then he took a boom
pole, which is basically

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.650
this long pole, and put a
weight on one end of it,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.230
and put the camera on the
other, and just slowly let

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.440
the camera come up
from the weight.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.110
So I'm all about MacGyvering
props if you need to.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.260
There are creative ways to
get around things and achieve

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.660
nice effects with
cheaper equipment.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.320
The other thing
about days before

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.390
is that you should make a shot
list, which is something that I

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.200
would like you guys to submit.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.380
I think originally
I had specified

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.940
you to do that tonight.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.490
But it's not necessary to do
it and post it until next week.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.890
So I'll update you
with another email.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.780
But a shot list is
basically what it says.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.020
It's a list of all the
shots that you need.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.540
So it doesn't have to
look a certain way.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.010
It's for your benefit only.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.790
So organize it however
you think is best for you.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.650
But this was my shot
list for the reshoots

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.970
that we did for the snots video.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.280
This is the first page of it.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.810
So I listed out
all the locations

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.680
that we were going to, what
time approximately we were going

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.200
to use it, so that I could
get a good sense of what

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.180
the lighting would look
like in these locations.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.100
And then I listed out exactly
what lines I needed to say,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.330
and what shots we needed
to get at each location.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.690
And then at the bottom I
specified the wardrobe.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.550
So this is a super helpful
organizational tool

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.710
to use when you're
planning things.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.800
When you are thinking
about locations,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.940
definitely go big or go home.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.060
You can e-mail anyone
and just tell them

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.430
you're doing a project
for a class at MIT,

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.510
and you'd be surprised
what you could get.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.520
We shot at a horse
farm in Acton.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.580
We shot in an airplane.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.320
We shot at a skydiving zone.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.720
We shot at the butterfly exhibit
at the Museum of Science.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.120
Most of the labs
here, especially

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.477
since you're students, are going
to be super open to having you.

00:20:36.477 --> 00:20:38.060
And again that's
like your opportunity

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.040
to create a window into a
world that most people don't

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.900
have access to.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.680
So definitely take
advantage of that.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.720
If you have any issues
getting into a location,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.450
just let me know.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.230
The day before, check
all your equipment.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.330
Check the batteries,
that's the biggest thing.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.310
Bring spare batteries.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.890
If you need spare
batteries let me know.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.670
Double check your locations.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.130
If you're meeting
people, make sure

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.566
that they know
that you're coming.

00:21:02.566 --> 00:21:03.482
And check the weather.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.650
And then day of.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.350
So to help keep you organized
I recommend that you use

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.090
camera reports or log sheets.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.900
And what that looks
like, and again you

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.470
can set this up however you
think is most useful to you

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.040
to use.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.770
These are the camera
reports that we

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.180
use for Science Out Loud.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.130
But basically it's
to help us keep track

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.670
of what video file is what.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.180
And when you're shooting
like for six days straight,

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.580
this is really important.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.600
It may not be as vital to you,
but it'll be really useful

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.890
when you go into edit.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.710
But it's basically saying,
this video file was scene two,

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.750
take two.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.962
I thought it was OK.

00:21:42.962 --> 00:21:44.420
There were two good
takes in there.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.610
The last one was the best.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.077
Make sense to everyone?

00:21:49.077 --> 00:21:50.660
Let me know if you
have any questions.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.570
Yeah.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.760
That's pretty straightforward.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.380
And I would also recommend
looking at the dailies.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.006
So I guess dailies
refers to all the footage

00:22:05.006 --> 00:22:06.130
that you take during a day.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.984
Like maybe during a movie
production or a TV production.

00:22:08.984 --> 00:22:10.400
And the dailies
for you guys would

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.730
be like, at the
end of the day look

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.860
through all the video footage
that you have on your camera

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.740
and just take note
of what you shot.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.750
Make sure that it's good.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.820
What you don't want is to
shoot your entire episode

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.280
and realize that the camera
settings had somehow muted you

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.240
and so you didn't
have any audio.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.320
So that's why looking at
the dailies is important.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.297
Also back up and label
all your files like right

00:22:36.297 --> 00:22:37.630
after you get back from a shoot.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.969
So the biggest production
piece of advice,

00:22:42.969 --> 00:22:44.760
or like heads up that
I would give you guys

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.900
is that it takes a lot of time.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.260
Even if the
locations are scouted

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:54.650
and everything's sort of
organized perfectly the day of,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.970
you're going to take-- you're
going to do a lot of takes.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.360
Even if the person says
the line perfectly,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.500
try a bunch of deliveries.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.370
So remember how George
was saying like,

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.420
say it really loud!

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.510
Now say it like however
you want, right?

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.020
And you got a different style.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.407
Try a bunch of deliveries.

00:23:16.407 --> 00:23:18.740
Try a different bunch of point
of views with the camera.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.300
So maybe you shoot
someone straight on,

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.680
then you try something
from the side.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.166
You try a different movement.

00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:29.040
And then like try
different types of framing.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.830
And Chris's piece
of advice, which

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.650
was like, most people tend
to not get enough footage

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.760
than get too much,
is really true.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760
Shoot like you're going
to use everything,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.259
and then when you
edit, you're going

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:43.480
to edit it like you're not
going to keep anything.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.660
But when you're
shooting, you always

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.080
want to have more to work with,
because the worst feeling is

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.530
when you're sitting,
editing, and you're like,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.570
I wish I had shot x y z.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.610
It's the worst feeling.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.187
So it's going to
take a lot of time,

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:59.270
because you want to create
as many options for you

00:23:59.270 --> 00:23:59.790
as you can.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.260
Any questions about that?

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:07.760
No?

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.260
OK.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.550
So I'll show you
an example of this.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.280
No, one more thing.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.140
A note about clothing, because
sometimes this comes up.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.480
So in general you don't want
to have really fine print.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.850
So I always try
to avoid stripes.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:29.630
This is probably like
the closest or the widest

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.380
difference in your stripes
as I would recommend getting.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:37.040
Generally like solid colors
work the best on screen.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.560
And then the material,
bring a couple

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.110
different sets of shirts
with you, because sometimes

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.450
like the silkier material
brushes up against the mic

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.760
a little bit more, and you hear
that actually on the audio.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.470
I will show you some raw
footage from the snots video.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.820
This is super
embarrassing for me, so.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.960
But I think it's good.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.320
And maybe will just
sort of set the tone

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.580
that this is a safe
space where you can feel

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.080
like you can just be yourself.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.860
But this was for
B-roll at the beginning

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.840
of the video that
was literally going

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.660
to last-- it's going to last
one second in the final product.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.230
I literally mean I think it's
going to be a one second clip.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.133
And this is the amount of
footage we shot for it.

00:25:29.586 --> 00:25:31.460
FEMALE IN VIDEO: --little
weight is so funny.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.842
MALE IN VIDEO: OK, thank you.

00:25:32.842 --> 00:25:34.180
And go.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.534
Put it down and get
the little weight.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.830
Both hands.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.860
Do the thing where you
like, you're bringing it

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.620
up with your right
hand, and then

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.590
you're sort of like spotting
it with your left a little bit.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.090
OK.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.867
No, no just two fingers
on the other hand.

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:10.950
On your hand, on your hand,
the back of your hand.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:11.100
Like

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.800
FEMALE IN VIDEO: This?

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.786
MALE IN VIDEO: Higher.

00:26:12.786 --> 00:26:13.660
Turn the weight more.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.400
Yeah.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.660
Just go like this.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.410
Put-- yes, and then like,
as if you're helping it up.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.660
MALE IN VIDEO 2: [INAUDIBLE]
just like, supporting it.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.760
MALE IN VIDEO: Yeah, like that,
but don't take your face out

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.320
of frame.

00:26:28.236 --> 00:26:28.736
Slower.

00:26:37.354 --> 00:26:38.478
Struggle a little bit more.

00:26:46.398 --> 00:26:48.370
All right, good.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.520
PROFESSOR: So the
point of making you

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.110
guys endure that is
that the final clip is

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.640
going to be just, right?

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.460
Literally a second.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.130
This is at least two
minutes worth of footage.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.820
This was like the third take.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.100
So this is what I mean by
get as much as possible.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.120
Try as many different
things as you can.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.689
Because we could have used the
first one where I just like

00:27:11.689 --> 00:27:13.980
lifted the weight, but the
last one was really the best

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.530
take out of all of them.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.880
And it wasn't-- we
didn't achieve that.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.560
Or we achieved that
because George made

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.520
me do it for like 10 minutes.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.670
But don't tell him I said that.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:31.680
So these are all
the day of things.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.200
Now for the day after,
take a step back for now.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.330
It's going to be hard to go in
and edit your stuff like right

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.284
after you finish shooting it.

00:27:42.284 --> 00:27:44.200
You want to give yourself
a little bit of time

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.130
to sort of clear
your perspective.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.070
And I'll talk more about this
during the editing lecture.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.470
But even when you do
the camera reports

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.480
and you're logging sort of what
the best takes are the day of,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.180
you might watch it
a couple days later.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.730
And I recommend re-logging
everything and going

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.480
through footage again later.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.410
And you might find that
the thing that you liked

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.780
during the day of,
maybe you liked it

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.304
because you were
starting to get tired,

00:28:11.304 --> 00:28:13.470
and it's going to look a
little bit different later.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.650
So that's why I just
recommend the day after,

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.017
just taking a step back.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:22.869
Let's see.

00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:23.368
Oh.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.485
With the whole
multiple takes thing,

00:28:29.485 --> 00:28:31.860
I forgot to mention this
before, but I thought of it when

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.340
you were doing your lecture.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.580
I would also
recommend doing takes

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.490
from varying degrees of
separation from your subject.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:44.390
So say your host says, I'm
going to say this line,

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.020
and you shoot it from
where Chris is standing.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.020
Even if the host like
nails the line perfectly,

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.910
tell them to do it again
and shoot it from maybe

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.390
from where Yulia's standing.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.820
And tell them to do it again,
and shoot it from like right

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.530
here.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:01.510
It's just good to have those
varying degrees of separation.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:06.640
It'll be easier to do the
zooming and everything in post.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.272
But again, having those
options to work with.

00:29:09.272 --> 00:29:10.980
You're not going to
know which one you're

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.130
going to use necessarily in
the moment that you're filming.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.172
So that's why it's good
to have a couple options.

00:29:16.172 --> 00:29:18.671
GUEST SPEAKER: The term is--
the technical term, not that it

00:29:18.671 --> 00:29:20.100
matters, is called, coverage.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.460
So basically, you
cover yourself.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.824
I don't really know how I'm
going to edit this together,

00:29:24.824 --> 00:29:26.740
so I'm going to give
myself as many choices as

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.823
possible in the edit room.

00:29:27.823 --> 00:29:33.880
Because even the best directors
don't know exactly what

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.420
they want.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.060
I mean there's Alfred Hitchcock
supposedly only filmed

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.750
exactly what he wanted.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.230
And his editors went insane
because they could only

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.520
do one way.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.910
But pretty much
everyone else who's

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:51.947
ever worked at any level in
film and video does coverage.

00:29:51.947 --> 00:29:53.530
PROFESSOR: Does
anyone have questions?

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.860
The rest of class, we're
going to let you go actually

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.510
film a scene from your script.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.940
And maybe this is a good
time to take a break,

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.520
but Chris and I
will stick around

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.336
if you have questions about
producing your specific scene,

00:30:12.336 --> 00:30:13.960
or actually using
any of the equipment,

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.807
we'll be around to help
you with that stuff.

00:30:15.807 --> 00:30:17.890
AUDIENCE: Can I make one
other suggestion, or just

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.090
reinforce one thing
about producing.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.530
This comes up over
and over again,

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.650
and it was a very hard lesson
for me to learn initially.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.800
And that's being realistic
about your schedule.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.090
You know there's a tendency to
want to pack a ton of stuff in

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.480
and to be very ambitious.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.080
And what happens
is that you have

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.300
to give enough time for setting
things up, breaking things

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.670
down, moving from
this lab to that lab,

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.750
or this location
of that location,

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.430
eating something,
figuring something out.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.069
So if you go like, well, OK.

00:30:49.069 --> 00:30:51.360
This is a 10 minute scene,
this will take me 20 minutes

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.860
to edit.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.960
And then we'll be over at Stata,
and we'll shoot that two minute

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.019
scene in five minutes.

00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:59.060
You know, very, very
quickly get behind schedule,

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.514
and then the panic sets in.

00:31:00.514 --> 00:31:02.680
It's far better to have a
schedule that's realistic,

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.849
where you really think
about, not just what it's

00:31:04.849 --> 00:31:06.390
going to take to
shoot, but what it's

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.680
going to take to set up,
breakdown, figure stuff

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.360
out, and move.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.829
And then execute the
schedule in a realistic way

00:31:14.829 --> 00:31:16.870
so you're not panicking,
you're not freaking out,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.470
you're not calling
people and saying,

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.900
I know I said I would
be at your lab at 3:00

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.150
but I can't get there till
5:00, can you stick around?

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.430
You know, whatever it may be.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.040
So just be very realistic.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.950
PROFESSOR: For the
Science Out Loud episodes,

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.620
we allot at least 12 hours
per five minute episode

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.750
in terms of filming
time with the students.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.960
Now that's a huge number,
mostly because the thing that's

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.650
most time consuming
for us is setting up

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.130
the lights, which is
something that you're not

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:41.730
going to have to worry about.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.470
The lighting
actually-- I mean, it's

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.770
by far the most time
consuming thing.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.740
But it gives you
an idea of-- that's

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.740
a really great point I'm
glad that you made it--

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.198
that it's more than
just the amount

00:31:51.198 --> 00:31:53.840
of time it takes for
you to say a line.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.490
Hopefully you won't
have that panic,

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.880
because the way this
class is structured,

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.870
it's very front heavy.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.390
We've had a lot
of lectures so far

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.990
but after the editing
lecture, that's

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.520
actually the very last one.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.180
And the rest of the
class period will mostly

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.620
be for you to work on
stuff during class time.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.570
So don't worry too
much about that.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.760
We tried to anticipate
that for you guys.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.370
But just to let you know.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.160
I forgot had a couple examples
for you for some of the stuff

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.430
that Chris was mentioning.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.250
And I'll play them real quick.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.277
MALE IN VIDEO: What is the most
awesome place in the world?

00:32:28.277 --> 00:32:30.610
Seems like that would be
pretty much the most subjective

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:31.640
question ever.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.910
But this week, scientists used
a set of objective criteria

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.280
to come up with a list of
the world's most biologically

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.290
important places.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.300
There might be--

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.240
PROFESSOR: So that's an example
of having zooms, but not

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.250
actually showing you zooming
with the camera, right?

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.860
And I think they do it
for a couple reasons.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.590
He probably-- he might have
messed up his line in between,

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.050
and so that was a way to
sort of cut in between

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.800
and not make the cuts
like super awkward,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.570
by having a zoom
in and a zoom out.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.730
And it's sort of like a rhythmic
visual pacing thing, too.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.280
It cuts in like after he says--

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.196
GUEST SPEAKER: It's kind
of equivalent to, oh,

00:33:09.196 --> 00:33:12.190
different angle, pay attention.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.965
It's a different
convention than television,

00:33:16.965 --> 00:33:18.590
but it comes from a
very similar place.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.256
You know, if he was
just standing there,

00:33:20.256 --> 00:33:22.500
delivering without
edits, there'd

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.875
be this-- there's this terror
that you might turn away,

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:26.360
and might not watch it.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.360
PROFESSOR: To
achieve that, though,

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.860
if you wanted to do something
like that, I would say,

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.460
again, you could even
film this with a tripod

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.660
and film yourself.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.270
But I would shoot
yourself-- that sounds

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.590
weird-- I would take the camera
and put it on tripod like that

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.330
far away, deliver
your whole sentence,

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.440
and then move it forward and
deliver the whole thing again.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.940
Because you don't
know exactly where

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:49.975
you're going to cut into that.

00:33:49.975 --> 00:33:50.540
GUEST SPEAKER:
And that's clearly

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.210
what most people--
I mean, this is

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:54.626
a very conventional thing you
see on the web all the time.

00:33:54.626 --> 00:33:55.850
And that's how they film.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.252
You know, a bunch of takes
of wide, a bunch of takes

00:33:58.252 --> 00:34:00.690
of close, medium, whatever.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:01.314
Editing.

00:34:01.314 --> 00:34:02.730
PROFESSOR: But the
point is you're

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.400
going to be saying the same
line multiple times, even

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.350
if you nail it.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.060
This is where a zoom might work.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:16.480
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.730
PROFESSOR: So I say, or is it.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:21.020
But we use the zoom there
intentionally to make it funny.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.120
Which hopefully it'll read
funny in the actual thing.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.760
So again, there aren't
like hard and fast rules

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.409
were you should never
ever use a zoom,

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.200
or you should never
ever center the person,

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.750
or you should never ever--

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:32.389
GUEST SPEAKER:
It's interesting, I

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:33.889
mean, you know, I
was thinking about

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.080
that whole centering thing
after the other day, Monday.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.980
And a lot of times
when people break

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.190
those kind of traditional
rules, is for comedic effect.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:46.283
And center frame stuff
tends to read funny.

00:34:46.283 --> 00:34:47.949
And you see that in
movies all the time.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.239
If you start paying
attention to this.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.790
If you go to a comedy, things
tend to be more center frame

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.389
than if it's a drama.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.159
And I think one of the
reasons that vlogs are often

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.320
center framed is that,
even if they're not funny,

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.680
that's the affect.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.590
It's like this is amusing, this
is light, this is not scary.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.000
And that's why
people center frame.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.416
And you know, you can, too.

00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:08.328
If you want to.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:15.830
PROFESSOR: All right so, at this
point I will let you guys free.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.770
Oh, sorry I have
another thing to say.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.480
The film that
you've seen today--

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.200
the scene that you film today
won't be due until at least

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:26.700
Tuesday.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.250
If you need more
time to work on it,

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.809
we can push it to
Wednesday, too.

00:35:29.809 --> 00:35:31.600
And that's because I
really want your focus

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.260
to be on honing the script.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.900
Because Monday will
be our table read,

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.229
where everyone reads their
script aloud to each other.

00:35:37.229 --> 00:35:39.020
And you're really going
to get the most out

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.650
of the table read when you
come to it with as complete

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.690
as a script as you can.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.950
I'm not saying that
what you have on Monday

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.710
should be as close to
final product as possible,

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:53.770
but it's just really hard
to give concrete feedback

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:56.320
to something that isn't
fully fleshed out.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.710
So do try to come on Monday
with as complete of a script

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.210
as you can, because Monday is
going to be the most useful

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.800
to you if you do.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.800
So that being said,
some people have already

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.940
uploaded second
drafts onto Tumblr.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.520
If you could upload stuff
by tomorrow at noon,

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.370
I can give you feedback on it
so that you can incorporate that

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:19.320
before Monday.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.600
And the best way to
get feedback from me

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.280
is to double post to Tumblr, and
then also write a Google doc,

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.500
and just email it to me, and
give me commenting permissions.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.010
That's how we actually
edit all the scripts

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.660
from Science Out Loud.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:41.788
So I'll show you, real quick.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.236
Season two.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.736
Let's go to this one.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:11.260
Yeah, so this is eventually
how we asked the students

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.040
to format their scripts.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.610
You don't have to
do that for Monday,

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.590
but eventually you're
going to want to do it.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:21.290
I think it makes organizing
things a lot easier.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:23.360
So it's just like a
four column format,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.660
where you specify what scene
number it is, the location.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.700
So OS just means on screen.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.860
It means like you're
not going to B-roll,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.340
you're just going to
be delivering it live.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.360
Just a description of
what the video looks like,

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.805
and what the script is itself.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.680
And if you share it
to me on Google Docs,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:48.520
it just makes it easier
for me to comment for you.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.530
And George also said that we
will give script feedbacks

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:52.470
this weekend too.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:57.350
So if you can e-mail us this
stuff by Saturday at noon,

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.955
we can give you lots of
feedback before Monday.

00:38:01.955 --> 00:38:05.326
AUDIENCE: I have another tip
that I usually forget about

00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:07.700
because I'm not used to talking
for long periods of time,

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.150
and you guys will probably
get tired at some point

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.900
while filming.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.220
Bring a water bottle
and probably snacks too,

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.320
if you get hungry easily.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.860
Just because when your
voice gets really dry

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.910
and starts cracking, that might
ruin a take that otherwise

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.160
went really, really well.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.442
And it helps with the
consistency of your voice.

00:38:25.442 --> 00:38:26.900
And you can edit
together something

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.150
that you did later with
something that you did earlier

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.350
if your voice sounds
like consistently fresh

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:33.420
throughout it.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.150
Because I've had problems
trying to edit audio

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.580
where at the end of it, my
voice is really, really raspy.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.122
And at the beginning
it's still good.

00:38:41.122 --> 00:38:42.705
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a great point.

00:38:42.705 --> 00:38:44.230
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.210
So we try to cram
everything in as much

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.510
as we can, which is purely
because of logistical issues,

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.250
and because of our budget.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.190
But you're going
to have the time

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:54.784
this month to where
you're not going

00:38:54.784 --> 00:38:56.700
to have to shoot your
entire video in one day.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.740
So really try to spread
it out over the course

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.270
of several days.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.436
And that's built
into the class time.

00:39:02.436 --> 00:39:04.310
But I will just say from
personal experience,

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:09.840
it is so incredibly difficult
to film for more than five

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.970
or six hours straight.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:14.520
You just get really, really
exhausted by the end of it.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.070
OK.
