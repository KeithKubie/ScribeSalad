00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.740
So it's pretty clear that this triangle
is half the area of this square.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.950
But what about an example like this one?

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.110
We can show with just a couple of folds
and cuts that the area of this triangle

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.995
is a half the area of the rectangle
that shares the same base and height.

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:26.220
Okay,so I'm just going to fold along
these lines and cut where the lines are.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.310
Okay, so now I have three triangles, and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.920
we can see that they used to
make this nice rectangle.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.370
But if I just flip some things around,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.160
I can see that what I cut out is
exactly the same area as what's left.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.910
So again, the area of
the triangle is half the area

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.840
of the rectangle that shares
the same base, length, and height.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.930
So given what we just saw, what is a
good formula for the area of a triangle?

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.800
Here's a hint, the area of a rectangle
which we normally write as L times W,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.948
is also base times height.

00:00:59.948 --> 00:01:00.991
Please select one.
