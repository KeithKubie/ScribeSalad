1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,120
Okay. Um, we, this is the
sh the slides from the,

2
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:09,060
and last time we didn't quite finish it.
Equilibrium versus residence.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,360
Remember equilibrium is a case where
you have two different species,

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:16,560
different structures and they you go
back and forth between them maybe fast,

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,030
maybe slow.
Okay.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,990
Like the hydrogen could be attached to
the top or it could be attached to the

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,760
bottom I oxygen and those are different.
Two different what's called isomers.

8
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:27,870
We'll get to that later on.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,170
Or You could imagine the same
thing if you take the hydrogen off,

10
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:35,190
you could have a short double bond
oxygen and along single bond oxygen.

11
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,880
Or they could exchange as to which
oxygen was long and which was short.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,070
So you could have an equilibrium there,

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,570
but it turns out you don't write that.
In fact,

14
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:49,590
it's not two different species,
right? It's one species.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,180
It's a single minimum, not a
double minimum. Right. Now,

16
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,080
how do you know this?

17
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:58,890
How do you know it's just one nuclear
geometry with an intermediate bond

18
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,640
distance?

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,200
The only way you know is by experiment
or by some really fancy calculation that

20
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,250
you have to believe.

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,280
A lot of people would believe
experiments before calculations,

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,830
some or the other way around.
Okay.

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,000
But there's evidence from a technique
called Electron paramagnetic resonance or

24
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,960
Epr that shows that indeed this
is one species of single minimum,

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,920
right? Well, if you have
an extra electron on it,

26
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,460
then you have the carboxylase an ion.
Then again,

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,910
it's just one species,
a single minimum. Right?

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,690
And there's evidence from that
from infrared spectroscopy
that we'll talk about

29
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:37,110
next time next semester.
Okay.

30
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:41,610
But don't be disappointed that
you're not able to predict this.

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,200
A lot of really smart,
experienced people couldn't predict it.

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,650
Right?
This is lore.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,770
If you look it up in the
Oxford English dictionary,

34
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:57,771
it says that lore is that which is
learned learning Scottish scholarship area

35
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,880
edition. Also in recent use applied
to the body of traditional facts,

36
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:03,541
anecdotes,

37
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,950
or beliefs relating to some
particular substance subject.

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,600
So a lot of things are Lori,
just have to learn them, right?

39
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:16,140
You can't predict them ahead of time.
There are way too subtle, right?

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,960
So don't be disappointed because
you haven't had enough time yet to,

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,990
to get the law. You're not
supposed to know it yet. Right.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,360
It would be nice if Lewis theory was so
accurate and straight forward that if

43
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,800
you could draw two structures,

44
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:36,060
there are two structures and it's a double
minimum. Right, but that's not true.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,900
Right, and you have to know from something
and you don't have time to know yet.

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,580
As time goes on, maybe you'll
figure it out. This is a,

47
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,170
from a good textbook. It might be the
one that will adopt next semester. It's,

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,410
it's a quote that says empirical rules.

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,530
It's going to give empirical rules for
assessing the relative importance of the

50
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,400
resonance structures,
molecules and ions.

51
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,610
That is if you have two different
pictures that you can draw for the thing,

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,690
does it look halfway in between them?
Almost all like one,

53
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:11,110
almost all like the other or some
fraction of the way between them. How?

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,240
How far is it one way or the other?
Right.

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,870
These are two different pictures you
draw to try to show different aspects of

56
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,690
the same thing,
but there is one real thing.

57
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,220
The molecule doesn't know about resonance.
Right. It just knows what it is.

58
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,420
The problem is with our notation.
Okay? But anyhow, here's what they say.

59
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:33,421
So rules that will allow you to use this
concept more productively by deciding

60
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:38,140
which ones are better, which look
more like the real thing. Okay?

61
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,850
So it gives rules and that number's them.

62
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,500
One resonance structures involved.

63
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:46,120
No change in the positions of nuclei.

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,000
Only electron distribution is involved.

65
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,030
That is when you draw these two
structures, you don't move the Adams,

66
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,200
you just change where you draw a single
bond or a double bond or a dotted bond

67
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,780
or something like that,
right? And in fact,

68
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,810
that's not even true because it's not
the electrons know where they want to be,

69
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,380
right? It's the way we draw
them. That's uncertain, right?

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,320
So when you draw two different resonance
structures, you're not changing.

71
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:16,180
Where are the electrons? Are
you just changing the lines
you draw? Is that clear?

72
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,850
It's our notation that's
at fault. Okay? Number two,

73
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,770
structures in which all first row
Adams have filled octets are generally

74
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:30,280
important. However,
resulting formal charges.

75
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,930
We talked last time about how
you get formal charges, right?

76
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,560
And electronegativity differences.

77
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,380
And of course we have to know
what electronegativity is,

78
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:43,381
but you've heard about it at least can
make appropriate non octet structures.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,830
Comparably important

80
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,140
to have a bad charge distribution.
Even though you have octets,

81
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,850
it still might not be a very good
structure. Okay. Number three,

82
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,770
the more important structures are those
involving a minimum of charge separation.

83
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,470
So you don't want to have
formal charge separation,

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,990
particularly among atoms of comparable
electronegativity structures with

85
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:12,010
negative charge is assigned
to electronegative atoms
may also be important.

86
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,240
So if you're going to get a charge,
put it where it wants to be right now,

87
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,630
look at this more
carefully. Uh, number two,

88
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:23,860
it says generally import.
It doesn't say always important,

89
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,060
but generally,
right?

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,490
That's not such a great rule because you
have to know when there's going to be

91
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:34,570
an exception, okay. Or however,

92
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,980
right? This doesn't
sound like the, the uh,

93
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,710
10 commandments graven in stone.
Right?

94
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,690
Or can make an APP thing that,
not that it will,

95
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:51,691
but it can or particularly
or may also be important.

96
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,010
These are all weasel words
because the rules or not rules,

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,470
right? And at the time, this is all
lore again, so people write these rules,

98
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:07,340
but really the people who are writing
the rules know the answers ahead of time.

99
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,660
And thank God you generally works that
way. And mostly we can get away with it,

100
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:15,490
but these are not rules like the rules
you want to learn in physics. I mean you,

101
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:19,310
you want to learn these because it's, it's
sort of handy, but don't believe them.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,420
Okay. And notice at the top
that it's empirical rules.

103
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,340
It's not a fundamental theory.

104
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,020
These are just ways of sort of correlating
a bunch of the lore that's come in,

105
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,610
right? And what's important is the
experiment's not theories like this.

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,870
They will get better theories later.
Okay.

107
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:43,790
So the goal of this Louis stuff was
from the number of valence electrons.

108
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,320
It would be nice to be able to predict
the constitution that is the valence

109
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,550
numbers for the different atoms.

110
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:54,510
How many atoms of one kind or another
get together to make a molecule, uh,

111
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,710
that reactivity.
And we've seen a little bit of that.

112
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,580
At least that unshared pairs
can get together with Vaco
doorbells and make a new

113
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:06,320
bond. That wasn't something that was part
of the original rules of valence, right?

114
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,470
And maybe something about
charge distribution as well.

115
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,680
Now let's look at the case of o two and
o three and apply some of this stuff.

116
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,610
So o two you can have complete the octets
by bringing two oxygen atoms together,

117
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,660
forming two bonds between them.

118
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,490
So that looks pretty good and it's a
double bond and we can draw it that way

119
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,250
with just lines and forget
that unshared pairs,

120
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:35,420
if we're not particularly concerned
with them at a given time. Okay.

121
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,990
Now suppose you make oh three you could
do the same kind of trick there and make

122
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,010
a three membered ring,

123
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:46,030
or you could make it linear
or bent instead of a of a
symmetrical three membered

124
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,520
ring. So you got to have an
equal lateral triangle like that.

125
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,560
Or You could have it like this,

126
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,730
have o two and bring in another
oxygen on one of the lone pairs.

127
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,880
Right now,
that's not an equal lateral triangle.

128
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,330
It's a triangle of some sort or could,
could conceivably be a straight line.

129
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:06,410
We're not quite sure what the
geometric implications are. Okay.

130
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:10,220
But we could call it an open structure
as a pair as compared to the ring

131
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:12,230
structure.
Okay.

132
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,930
And we could draw it like that and
the formal charges would be as shown.

133
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,983
Why?

134
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,170
Because that pair that originally belonged
only to the original top oxygen of o

135
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,820
two is now shared with the other oxygen.

136
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,430
So it one of them loses
half interest in a pair.

137
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:32,870
The other gains have interest in
the parent that's plus minus. Okay.

138
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,530
So the try Vaillant oxygen as positive
as you would expect right now,

139
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,970
what is the true structure of that
molecule? Ozone o three? Well,

140
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:47,010
you have to do some experiment
to find that out or some uh,

141
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,030
high faluting calculation that you
believe a quantum mechanical calculations.

142
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:57,461
So it could be a ring or it could be an
open and notice in the open structure

143
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:01,500
you should have two resonance structures
because you could draw it that way.

144
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,280
Or You could draw it that way.
And it could be two minimum.

145
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:09,750
It could be a double minima double minimum
situation where it could be distorted

146
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:12,000
one way or the other and
click back and forth.

147
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,320
Or it could be that the tooth structure
is in the true structure is in between

148
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:21,300
with equal bond distances, right? So we
have to find out something about this.

149
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:24,540
Now, one way of finding
that out is to, uh,

150
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,430
is to do calculations and draw a
graph that shows what the answer is.

151
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,630
And that's what we're going to do here.

152
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,590
It's based on some fairly
recent high level calculations,

153
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,320
but the problem is drawing the graph

154
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,760
because if you want to be able to
show the structure you have to, to,

155
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,100
to how many variables do you have to
specify to say what the structure of o

156
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:51,360
three is,
how many numbers would you have to have?

157
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,690
It's a trial. It's three particles, right?

158
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,410
So if you gave this distance and
this distance and this distance,

159
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,790
that would fix the triangle.

160
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,710
Or You could give this distance and
this distance and the angle here,

161
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,450
that would also specify the triangle.
Okay. But at any way you slice it,

162
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:14,451
you have to have three numbers to tell
the structure and then you have have to

163
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:18,360
have another number in your graph to
say what the energy is when it has that

164
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,310
structure.
Okay?

165
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,700
So you have to plot four variables and
that's not trivial on a piece of paper to

166
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:31,560
plot a graph with four variables in it,
okay?

167
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,480
So three distances plus energy or two
distances in an angle and energy you need

168
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,314
to plot.

169
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,270
So if you're good at plotting things
that have had a lot of experience, great.

170
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,850
But if you need a little warm up exercise,

171
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:48,750
you could look at this webpage that you
get get by clicking up at the top there,

172
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,280
right?

173
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,900
And it uses these graphs to give you a
little exercise in plotting things that

174
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:59,190
are in many dimensions day.
But we're not going to do that in class.

175
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,840
That's just to do on your own or
with the discussion section, okay?

176
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,950
And we'll show the specific example of
how we're going to do it in the case of o

177
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:12,951
three so ti does specify oh
three we need four dimensions.

178
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,970
Now here we have a plot
that shows one distance,

179
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,300
the second distance and
the angle, okay, that's,

180
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:25,350
that'll specify where the
three oxygens are. But uh,

181
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,240
Rutenberg and his coworkers here in 1997,
when they did the fancy calculation,

182
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,540
uh, did it a little differently.
They constrained it,

183
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,310
they didn't allow everything to vary.

184
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,020
They said we're going to require
the two distances to be the same,

185
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,200
right?
So now instead of three variables,

186
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:48,200
you have only two and you
can block those two, uh, on,

187
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,780
on a two dimensional paper,
you can plot two things. Okay?

188
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,320
So here's here,

189
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:57,480
we're going to plot the position
of if you know where that,

190
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:00,520
if the two distances are equal,
right?

191
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,560
Then if you know the
position at the top right,

192
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,590
you know the position at the top left
because the original oxygen is at the

193
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,260
origin zero, zero.
Everybody with me on that?

194
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,630
So we're going to look only at where the
top right oxygen is and the other one

195
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:17,560
will be someplace symmetrically
related to it. Okay?

196
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,660
So we're going to blow that up and
here's the plot they give them now. So,

197
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:23,620
so now any point on this,

198
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,610
we'll specify a precise
geometry of the three oxygens.

199
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,830
Everybody with me, we choose a point
that tells where the top right one is.

200
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,130
The bottom one is at zero zero and the
top left is just on the other side and

201
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,330
the corresponding mirror image position.

202
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,750
So any point on that thing
will specify the structure,

203
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,120
but we now have we still that,

204
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,080
but that's used up our two dimensions
of the paper. How do we show the energy?

205
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,450
Can you think of a three
dimensional graph you've ever used?

206
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,513
Pardon me?

207
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,740
You could color code it. You could make
red really high and blue, really low.

208
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,830
That would be one way to do it.
There.

209
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,600
There are earlier ways
before printing made it,

210
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:14,420
our computers made it easy to make
colors. Did you ever go hiking? Have Hud

211
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,520
contour lines like like a
geological map? Right. Okay.

212
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:22,950
So we can draw contour
lines that show where the,

213
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:27,300
what the energy is for every one of
these geometries. And so at that,

214
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,730
notice that at that position that x,

215
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,200
it turns out to be what would the red
structure would be here, which is a ring.

216
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,020
Okay. Equal. Lateral. Okay.

217
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,970
And this structure is open.
Okay.

218
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,450
And I chose those particular ones because
when you do the fancy calculation,

219
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,420
those turn out to be the ones
that are at the bottom of valleys.

220
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,400
Low Energy, okay. And if
you distort away from those,

221
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:00,060
the energy goes up.
Now you can go up any direction.

222
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:02,790
You go from one of the bottoms of
the valleys, you go up in energy,

223
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,430
but there's some particularly
interesting positions.

224
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,820
A particularly interesting position
is that one cause that's the past that

225
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,600
that's the lowest you can go.

226
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,170
The lowest energy that's required
to go from one valley to the other.

227
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,220
Everybody I think has probably done enough
hiking to realize that that's the way

228
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:22,590
you'd like to hike or that if you were,

229
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,390
if you spilled a cup of water up at
the past, it would run down both ways.

230
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,580
Okay. Now, in fact,

231
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:34,581
we can use that concept to make it even
a simpler graph where we don't need to

232
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:40,521
draw contour lines because we could
take the steepest descent path.

233
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:41,911
Okay.

234
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:46,830
If you pour the water out at the pass
and follow how it will trickle down,

235
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,230
it'll take the steepest way to go down.

236
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,240
It turns out it crosses
every tour perpendicularly.

237
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,590
Okay, so you follow that and
that would go down to the bottom.

238
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,030
And then if you kept going,

239
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,000
like if you dropped a marble or something
and it rolled down to the bottom,

240
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,050
it would keep going. So there is
a particularly interesting path.

241
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,970
Not that the true molecule would
necessarily have to follow that path,

242
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,470
but it's a well defined path that
gets from one valley to the other.

243
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,040
So now what you could do is take a knife
and slice this thing along that Green

244
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,770
Line and unfolded so it's flat.

245
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,750
Does everybody see how that would be like?
I remember once we took a,

246
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:30,471
when I was young,

247
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:35,471
we took a family vacation and the AAA
sent you a map that showed you know where

248
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,480
you would go. But it also
showed the, along the, you know,

249
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:42,830
along a particular highway and it also
showed another map that showed how high

250
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:46,730
you were all the time as you went
along the roads. Got The idea.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,960
So this is exactly that kind of thing
where as you go along that green road,

252
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,980
there are different altitudes. So we
could just, we could draw it this way.

253
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,930
Does everyone see how that works?

254
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,960
So it's not quite as specific about
geometry anymore the way the previous one

255
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:07,820
was, but it shows how, how much
energy you need as you go along.

256
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,270
Okay.
And a particularly important one,

257
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,610
there are two things that
are really important.

258
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,180
One is how high much one valley
is compared to the other,

259
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:21,830
how much more stable one is. And the
other is how much higher is the past?

260
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:26,420
How hard is it to get from one to
the other? Okay. So that's uh, so,

261
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:30,500
so there are now is in a two
dimensional graph that you can draw on.

262
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:35,420
A piece of paper is something that
gives you this information. Okay.

263
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,853
Uh,

264
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,990
but this required that we choose our one
two equals r two three in order to make

265
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:46,700
this simplification, right. It, the
guys who did the calculations said,

266
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,700
if we don't make our one
two equal to r two, three,

267
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,090
then it turns out that all the
structures are still higher in energy.

268
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,580
So these are the lowest energy structures,
right?

269
00:16:55,581 --> 00:17:00,440
Although they can't plot them
on a piece of paper. Okay. So,

270
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,453
uh,

271
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,580
so the lowest energy structure is this
open form and it does have our one to

272
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:13,160
equal our two three. It's a
resonance structure halfway between,

273
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:16,760
not one double bond in one single bond,
but a symmetrical one.

274
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,060
Okay. So it's a symmetrical single
minimum found by calculation and there's

275
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:26,300
experimental evidence that supports
that too, but it's more complicated.

276
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,350
Now how about the charge distribution?

277
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:34,760
What would the Lewis structures that
we've drawn here predict about charge

278
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,860
separate, uh, separation?

279
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:40,250
Would there be charged any place do you
think on the basis of this and the real

280
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:44,390
molecule, which is symmetrical, what
do you think? Anybody got a suggestion?

281
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,890
Yeah.
Oxygen.

282
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,500
Regardless of which to
structure that time. Yeah.

283
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,420
Both structures have it
positive in the middle.

284
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:59,890
So that looks like a good
prediction, right? And then, uh,

285
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,640
partially negative and equally negative
on the two ends. Now is that true?

286
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,720
Well, here's a picture that
the based again on Quan.

287
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,470
So the prediction is positive in the
middle, negative on the ends. Is it true?

288
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,480
Well, there's the truth.
There's the structure,

289
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,020
the minimum energy according
to calculation, right?

290
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,730
Quantum mechanical calculation.

291
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,270
And we can draw what's called the
surface potential of that structure,

292
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:29,870
which again comes from calculation.
So you put a proton,

293
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,900
you define the molecular surface and
that is a little bit of a problem,

294
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:38,270
but we'll talk about that later
where the molecular surfaces,

295
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,540
but then you put a proton at a point
on it. And we talked about this before.

296
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:47,300
And for ammonium chloride you put
a proton on and you find, or no,

297
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:51,830
it was the, the uh, uh, Bnh six we
talked about the surface potential.

298
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,510
Here's the same thing for o three,

299
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,050
and you'll notice the surface
potential is high in the middle,

300
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,360
a bad place to put a proton
because there's positive
charge there and it's low.

301
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,870
On the two ends at least
someplace on the two ends. Right.

302
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,520
So more or less that Lewis
structure predicted this. Right.

303
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,160
So that's great. Okay. We're not
confident that we'll always work,

304
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,650
but maybe the law will build
up that way. Okay. And it does.

305
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,730
Okay,
so charge distribution also.

306
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,880
So reactivity we saw was a special
attribute of this nice Lewis Theory and

307
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:33,380
charge distribution at
least qualitatively,

308
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:37,700
if not in detail for o three
and also for the Bnh six.

309
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,950
Now how about specific
distances and specific angles?

310
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,780
We'll get into that later on as to whether
you can do that from something like a

311
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:48,890
Lewis structure.

312
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,860
And how about the energy content?
Wow,

313
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:58,580
that's not so good actually
for with just Lewis structures,

314
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:03,290
but we'll test it later. Okay,
so the Lewis dot structures,

315
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,570
it attempts to provide a physical
basis for the valence rules based on

316
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:12,470
completing octets and
sharing electrons for bonds.

317
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,590
What it gives us new is reactivity due
to unshared payers where both of the

318
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,680
hooks in the bond come from the same Adam,
you might say,

319
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,490
and it's convenient for
electron bookkeeping.

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,320
It certainly tells you what the
molecular charge is. The uh,

321
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,210
formal atomic charges are qualitatively
realistic as we've just seen,

322
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,520
at least in the case of o three.

323
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,430
And there's this question
of stability and resonance,

324
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:46,940
but resonance actually is not
something nature knows anything about.

325
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,310
It's just a correction.

326
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:53,311
We try to apply to having made
drawings based on Lewis Theory.

327
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,550
It's not something serious.
No,

328
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:03,370
but this leaves us with some serious
questions. Why does Lewis Theory work?

329
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:07,690
What's so great about octets? Why
not have a different number? Right?

330
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,030
Or if you have assessed tete
instead of an octet, how bad is it

331
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,860
or how bad or structures that have
charged separation had said in those rules

332
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,980
that you don't want to have charge
separation. Well, how bad is it?

333
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,330
Suppose you had a choice.

334
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:28,600
You either had to have a sextet instead
of an octet or you had to have charge

335
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,210
separation,
which one would win?

336
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,703
Okay.

337
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,680
How bad is bad charge separation?

338
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,960
Remember it said that if
you put the negative charge
on an electronegative atom,

339
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:43,330
that's not so very bad.
But how bad.

340
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,060
Yeah.

341
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,960
Now, last year in the Wiki, there came
an interesting comment. Somebody said,

342
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,630
I have a question.
When drawing these structures,

343
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,190
is it more important to try to fill
the octet or to have the lowest formal

344
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,850
charge on as many atoms, especially
carbon as possible? And why?

345
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,500
That's a good question because
Lewis doesn't tell you that at all.

346
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,990
Okay. And there's further the
question, is this at all true?

347
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,140
Are there electron?
This is a really important question.

348
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:15,400
We're going to spend some time on it.

349
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,320
Are there electrons in between the
nuclei that hold them together?

350
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,300
Pairs of electrons.

351
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,580
It'll take us several lectures
to get to answer that question.

352
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,820
Are there electron pairs between
Nuclei and, and, and are,

353
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,710
are there unshared ones on
some atoms? What, what's the
nature of the forest laws?

354
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:36,540
That's what we're after.
Remember here altogether

355
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,800
now as to whether Lewis theory is right.

356
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,830
There's a very fundamental theorem in
physics that was developed in 1839 by

357
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:52,730
Samuel earn Shaw, who was a
tutor at Cambridge. Uh, and the,

358
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:58,050
the statement of the theorem is that in
systems governed by inverse square force

359
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:03,220
laws, things like gravity, magnetism, uh,

360
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,070
electrical,
electrostatic interaction,

361
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,550
there can be no local minimum
or maximum of potential energy.

362
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,550
He proved it mathematically.
It's not our business to repeat his proof,

363
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,930
but that's the statement of it.
But we want to understand what that means.

364
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,290
That one thing that means is that you,

365
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,350
if you have Coolum bake
interaction positive, negative,

366
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,560
you can't have a minimum energy structure
that has a nucleus here and eight

367
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:37,021
electrons at the corner of a cube because
they're inverse square force laws.

368
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,290
And that can't be a minimum energy.
If it distorted, it would keep going.

369
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,160
Now can visualize

370
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,720
earn cias there. I'm here in terms of, uh,

371
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,690
electrostatic for electrostatics by the
analogy that you've all seen of magnetic

372
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:57,640
lines of force. Everybody's seen
something like this, I think, right? Uh,

373
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,640
and the idea, if it's
electrostatic rather than magnetic,

374
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:06,641
the idea is that lines of force emerge
from a positive charge and converge on a

375
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,510
negative charge.

376
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,530
And then you'd make them continuous
by drawing these lines of force,

377
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,080
which iron filings of
course did in that case.

378
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,650
And this was the idea
of Michael Farah day,

379
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:22,890
whom we met a little while back and
he thought these lines of force,

380
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:26,270
we're real physical things,
right?

381
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:32,150
Most people don't think that now they
think they're just graphs of that involve

382
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:36,510
inverse square forced laws.
But he thought they were real.

383
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,620
And the neat thing about them is they
not only show the direction of the force

384
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:44,520
that upon that,
uh,

385
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,050
charged body would feel because
of the other charge body,

386
00:24:49,051 --> 00:24:52,050
the one that created the lines of force,
they not only show the force,

387
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,670
but they show the direction of the forest.

388
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:57,540
They all show should also
show how strong the force is.

389
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,370
And the strength of the force
is by the density of lines,

390
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,700
the denser the lines,
the stronger the force.

391
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,980
Everybody's familiar with this idea.

392
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,090
Okay,

393
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,410
speak up if things are not
familiar because I'm assuming
they are. If I say so.

394
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,730
Okay, so you've seen that. Now let's
just think about that a little bit.

395
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,840
Suppose you look at the line density
here through that little line there,

396
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:24,820
three lines of force that pass.

397
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:29,821
So let's say that means they're three
for the force is three at that and it's

398
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,740
obviously pointing to the right.
Okay.

399
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,620
Now suppose you check
that out at that distance.

400
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,200
Stronger force or weaker force,

401
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,610
weaker in fact only one or one
and a half or something like that.

402
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:46,990
Lines of forests are going through that.
Now how does it depend on distance,

403
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,630
the number of lines going through this
standard length line, the blue one?

404
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,030
Well you see that in flat land,
we're just doing this in two dimensions.

405
00:25:58,031 --> 00:26:01,720
We'll get to three in just a second.
In flatland in two dimensions,

406
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,920
the circumference through which
all of these lines of forest pass,

407
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,510
the length of the circumference is
proportional to the radius, right?

408
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,740
So if you go out twice as far,
there's twice the circumference.

409
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,900
So the density of lines passing through
it is half as big. Everybody got that?

410
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,290
Okay,
so that means the forest,

411
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:27,310
which is proportional to the line density
must be proportional to one over R.

412
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,463
Okay.

413
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,740
So then as you move out twice,

414
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,270
there'll be half as many lines move out
three times a third as many lines. Okay,

415
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,740
but this is just in two dimensions.

416
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:42,980
Now let's think about how's it going
to be different in three dimensions?

417
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,703
Kaitlin,

418
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,530
speak up a little bit.
I buy or hearing isn't so great.

419
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:53,840
I said I wanted my 50th
high school reunion. Right?

420
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,720
Set up a line.
It would be more,

421
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,860
yeah, it'd be. It would be
a two dimensional area that
the stuff's going to be.

422
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,920
Now how if you have a certain number
of lines passing through at a certain

423
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:09,900
distance and you go out twice as far how,
what's the density?

424
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,520
The line's going to be.
Can you think?

425
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,270
Anybody help? Yes.
That'll be inverse square,

426
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,520
inverse square,

427
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:21,370
because now we're not talking about
the circumference of a circle.

428
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,260
We're talking about the area of
a sphere as we go out, right?

429
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,490
So if we go to three dimensions here
and take your area and move it out,

430
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,930
it's got the surface is going to be
proportional to our square as you go out.

431
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,780
So the line density is going
to be one over r square.

432
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,830
So if you have an
inverse square force law,

433
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,130
then you can draw lines of force.

434
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,840
The lines of force won't work if you
don't have an inverse square forest law

435
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,240
because they have to drop off this
way in order to, uh, in order to give,

436
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,160
uh,
lines of force.

437
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,340
So in three d such diagrams work
only for inverse square forces.

438
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,530
You can't draw thing like
that for a Hooke's law.

439
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,773
Okay?

440
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,500
Right now.
So here's a whole bunch of charges,

441
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:14,040
positive and negative in the lines
of force between them, right?

442
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,290
And notice something interesting.

443
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,180
The lines of force start
on positive charges and,

444
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:23,070
and on negative charges,

445
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,670
there's no other place in space where all
the lines go away from it or go toward

446
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:30,630
it.

447
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,630
Everybody see that it's only at the
charges that they all go away or all go

448
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:36,534
toward,

449
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,253
right.

450
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,990
And that has a very important
meaning that you can't have, uh,

451
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,700
some place, often free space where all
the lines of force, we're converge.

452
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,930
Notice if you were to have something
that was positively charged, right?

453
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,150
And it's at a minimum of energy
than any place you displace it.

454
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:02,560
It'll get pushed back, right? If
it's at the lowest point in energy,

455
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,050
you push it any direction
that'll come back.

456
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,880
That is all the lines of force
must converge on that point. Okay.

457
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,230
Everybody with me on that,

458
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,750
but it can't be the only place that
all the lines of force converge is on a

459
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:21,730
negative charge. It can't be any place
in. If you have inverse square laws,

460
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,710
you can't have some place in space,

461
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:28,711
which is the lowest energy place for the
charge to be except on another charge.

462
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,850
The same is true of,
you can't have a maximum either.

463
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,060
That's that's a visualization
of Earnshaw is therapy.

464
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,410
So if you have inverse square forest
laws or any combination of inverse square

465
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:44,860
force laws, like a combination
of gravity and electrostatics,

466
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:48,370
then magnetic.
You can't get a minimum energy structure

467
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,400
unless everything just falls
together or blows apart. Okay,

468
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,960
so we're gonna chose theorem in systems
governed by inverse square forest laws.

469
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:04,550
There can be no local maximum or minimum
of potential energy in free space.

470
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,390
Okay. Now. Does everyone do that then?

471
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,740
That's why I don't just float here.
Right. I have to be on the floor.

472
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,330
All right. Did you ever see
anything truly levitating?

473
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,133
Yeah.

474
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,180
Something that just sits in space and
doesn't move, not touching. Anything else

475
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,410
that's been levitated
Ian for 10 or 15 years.

476
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,130
It's not plugged into anything.
It's just this thing right here.

477
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:44,860
Right.

478
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,540
What do you conclude from seeing that
about the forest laws that are involved?

479
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,430
There must be some force involved in that.

480
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:58,360
That's not an inverse square force law.
Otherwise it wouldn't work.

481
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,350
Okay. Now it's not our best. If you can
read about it on the web if you want to.

482
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:03,850
It's not the business of this class.

483
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,530
There is a non inverse square force law
involved in that little magnet sitting

484
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:09,364
there.

485
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,583
Okay.

486
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,440
Uh, the only stationary points allowed
by Earnshaw is they are immersed saddled

487
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,850
points where you move,
wonder it where it's, it's,

488
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:23,160
it's flat in energy for all directions,
but you go one direction,

489
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,980
then you go down, you go the
other direction, you go up.

490
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,840
That's like a potato chip or saddle.
So you can have saddled points.

491
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:33,900
But you can't have absolute
minimum or maximum of energy.

492
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,240
There's the picture of that thing.

493
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,760
Uh, let me, let me do the, uh,

494
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,070
this reminds me to get
back to seeing who's here.

495
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:52,180
I'll call the people who weren't here
earlier. Anthony Anderson. Uh, that,

496
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,230
where are you? There you go.
Alright. Uh, Maria Baruch Java.

497
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,550
Is it, is that how you say your
name? Bureau? Cova. Okay, good.

498
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,470
Uh,

499
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:09,390
Sebastian colleary colleary
is that in the Italian name?

500
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,760
Do you know what that
says? You know what? It's,

501
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:16,470
it's a sort of upon like thing,

502
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,250
you know what Galileo is supposed
to have said after the inquisition

503
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,370
and still it moves a poor war movie,

504
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,560
but this is, and still it
stands there despite or in Shaw.

505
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,010
So there's a little joke
there. Okay. A young Cho.

506
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:41,330
Okay. Uh, Ryan daily. Yeah. Good.

507
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,930
Uh, let's see. Let's put this here. Uh,

508
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,610
Chris ally saw you come
in, uh, John Greenwald.

509
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,683
Ah,
Gotcha.

510
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,170
Uh,

511
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,420
oh, being a bulk way. How do
you say your name? Okay, good.

512
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,520
Uh,
Serena ire.

513
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,940
No. Ginger Jang? No.

514
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,480
Uh,

515
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,890
Genu Lynn?
No.

516
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,660
Uh,
Ben Leo

517
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,313
here.

518
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,740
Uh,

519
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,180
Maxima.
Kaylee mchaley Macaulay.

520
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,290
Macaulay,
is that originally a Scottish name?

521
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,783
Cutting.

522
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,200
They're, they're Polish names
that are mixed. Some, you
know, like an ice McBride.

523
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,310
I'm interested in it. They're, they're uh,

524
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,900
Catholics from Scotland after
the reformation fled to Poland.

525
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,910
Is there Poland names that are Scottish?

526
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:50,210
Actually like McCawley McCawley would be
such a thing but it's not. It's Italian.

527
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,730
Okay. Kelly. Thank you. Uh,

528
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,740
Jackie perilla there Ar uh,

529
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,750
Ryan Park.

530
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,133
Gotcha.

531
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,150
Uh, Angela, she is it Shay? She HSA. What

532
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,853
she

533
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,690
okay. Devin Smith. Yeah.

534
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,630
Uh, Naomi Woo. Yeah. Gotcha.

535
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,600
Uh,
South Yang.

536
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,060
Good. And Kevin? John?

537
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,190
Nope. Good. We're getting
there. And Sherry Jo

538
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,380
now, how do you say your last name? Joe.

539
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,420
Joe Zo.

540
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:48,120
Zo Good.
Right on

541
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,333
Zo.

542
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,330
Okay,
great.

543
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:58,040
And is there ever been a buddy been
able to sign up for lab that so far?

544
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,570
If not, you can talk to talk to across
the hall after the class. I don't have,

545
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,200
don't send me anything that has to do
with labs cause I'm not involved in it.

546
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,410
Okay, great. Thanks. Now we'll continue.

547
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,850
You've got a few more minutes
here and yet it stands still.

548
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,200
So there's must be something that's not
an inverse square force law there. Okay.

549
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,210
So Jay Jay Thompson in 1897
discovered the electron.

550
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,200
So the idea is maybe electrons have
something to do with bonds. You know,

551
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:29,600
that's what,
that's what brought Louis into the game.

552
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,710
But Thompson himself came up with what
was came to be called and I don't know by

553
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:40,410
who first. I've tried to find out
in camp the plum pudding. Adam,

554
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,380
has anyone ever heard of that? Yeah. Okay.

555
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,520
And I suspect that when people told
you about the plum pudding out them,

556
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:51,720
they sort of snickered. Am I right
that this was sort of a naive idea?

557
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,880
It's not that naive at all. Let me show
you what, here's, here's the book by uh,

558
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,740
by uh, Jj Thomson called the
corpuscular theory of matter.

559
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,010
And if you look in there,
you'll find out what he's talking about.

560
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:09,810
He says he has a model of
electron configuration. He says,

561
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,880
consider the problem of how to arrange
one, two, three, up to end core puzzles.

562
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,430
That's what he called electrons.
He called them core puzzles.

563
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,820
Consider the problem as to how they
would arrange themselves if placed in a

564
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:27,480
sphere filled with positive electron,

565
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,780
the positive electricity
of uniform density.

566
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,150
So that's the idea that plum pudding,
you have this,

567
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:38,080
this sphere of uniform positive density.
Why it should be that that is not,

568
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,240
nobody knows.

569
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,010
But suppose you have a sphere and you
put the electrons in it like plums in a

570
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:48,420
plum pudding, which is like a
fruitcake and England. Okay. Okay.

571
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:53,421
Now notice that he said placed in a
sphere filled with positive electricity.

572
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,570
Why did he do that? Why didn't he
just have like Ruth Rutherford all?

573
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,730
We did a nucleus.

574
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:06,570
Which positive charge in electrons
around them about why did he put the

575
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:10,410
electrons inside the positive charge?

576
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,190
Zach,
I can't hear very well.

577
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,270
No,
yes,

578
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,490
no, no. They weren't
thinking about things moving.

579
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,080
They want him just sitting there.

580
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,593
Yeah.

581
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,360
Yeah, but that's well known.
Cool. Ohms law. Yeah. Keith.

582
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,633
Kevin,
right?

583
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,000
A
positive spirit.

584
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,430
Yeah, but that, that
could be, if it didn't,

585
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:52,910
it wouldn't have to be a big
sphere of uniform density.

586
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:56,750
You could have a little particle of, of,
of positive charge of the same charge.

587
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:58,790
Right. It'd be the same deal. Yeah.

588
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,250
No, none of this is it. It's what
we've just been talking about. Yeah.

589
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Claire Accounting for the bonding
between the electrons and the protons

590
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,050
contained, no bonding hasn't come up yet.
This is something very fundamental. Yeah.

591
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,583
Pudding.

592
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,870
He probably liked plum pudding at
Christmas. Yeah. Probably hit here.

593
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,810
Did he have experiment?

594
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,260
No.
Yeah.

595
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,153
Ah.

596
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:39,250
Earnshaw you can't have an energy
minimum for separate particles.

597
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,270
But if you put the negative
ones inside the positive one,

598
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,220
then you can get a stable structure.

599
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,360
It's Earnshaw is there of that
required it to be a plum pudding.

600
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,400
Okay.
Now why a sphere?

601
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:59,020
Why not a donut or a or some other
shape of barbell or something?

602
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,470
Right.
And he said their district,

603
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,500
that the positive charge is distributed
in a way most amenable to mathematical

604
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,380
calculation. He chose a sphere.
So it would be simple. You know,

605
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,090
if you've heard about spherical
cows and so on like that,

606
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:17,170
that physicists like to calculate,
let's suppose there's a cow,

607
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,940
let it be a sphere. Right? So that's what
he did. That's why the, it's a sphere.

608
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,243
Okay.

609
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:29,370
We can solve the special case where the
core puzzles are confined to a plane.

610
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:30,850
If you could do it in two dimensions,

611
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,370
it's difficult mathematically
in three dimensions,

612
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,690
but you can do it in two dimensions. And
he gives a picture in this book, right?

613
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:38,141
Like this,

614
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:43,141
which is a solenoid magnet that attracts
little needles that are magnetized.

615
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,640
And those needles are stuck into corks,
which float in the water,

616
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,970
right?
So they have to,

617
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,710
the corks have to stay at the
level of the surface of the water.

618
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:57,870
So it's a two dimensional problem.
The needles are parallel to magnets,

619
00:39:57,871 --> 00:40:02,410
so they repel one another, but the big
magnet attracts them to the center.

620
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:03,940
Okay?

621
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,990
So what he does is toss a certain number
of needles in corks in there and see

622
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,940
what pattern they form.
Okay.

623
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,950
So here are some patterns.

624
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:17,190
You can get these on the webs
at Greg Blinders website here.

625
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,840
So if you have just one, it goes to the
center. No big deal. If you have to,

626
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,480
you get a line,
there's no big deal about that.

627
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,440
Three make an equal lateral triangle
put in for, they make a square,

628
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,600
put in five. You make a Pentagon. No
one's surprised so far, I suspect,

629
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,660
except that sometimes when you
put in Vive and shake it up,

630
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,950
you get a square with one in the middle.
Can you see where this might be going?

631
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,403
Yeah,

632
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,260
let's keep going. I'll say, okay.

633
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:51,520
If you put in six you get
one inside of Pentagon,

634
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:56,200
seven one inside a hexagon,
eight one inside a Hep to God,

635
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,830
nine two inside,

636
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,810
10 to inside.
And sometimes it's like that.

637
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,710
And sometimes it's like that.
These are experimental,

638
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,483
right?

639
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:17,830
And if you put 11 it's three
inside and then three inside nine,

640
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,460
although sometimes you get to,
pardon me, I, I'm screwing up here.

641
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,040
Sometimes you get,
there are two different patterns.

642
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,540
Sometimes you get three inside eights
on as you get to inside nine. Okay.

643
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,050
For that number. Okay. And then you
get four inside, nine, four inside,

644
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,040
five inside 10 and then after five,
if you put in more,

645
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,440
if you put in 16

646
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,000
you get one inside five inside
10 what does this remind you of?

647
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:50,950
Yeah.
The shell structure of atoms,

648
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,880
right? As you go down the periodic
table, you complete a shell.

649
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,170
So it's a model of shells, right? And then
you can get, uh, more and more and more.

650
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,770
Okay. So this is what
Thompson was thinking about,

651
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:08,050
but that's just two dimensions, right?
Three dimensions is a bigger problem,

652
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:13,051
but he could say he was able to say
something mathematically about eight.

653
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,480
The equilibrium of eight core puzzles at
the corners of a cube is unstable even

654
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:23,320
if you have this vertical charge.
So it's not exactly Earnshaw. Still,

655
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:27,970
you can't get eight at the corners of
a cube. Now, Louis came, comes along,

656
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,900
and in 1923, as I told
you before, he writes,

657
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,410
I have ever since regarded the cubic
octet as representing essentially the

658
00:42:37,841 --> 00:42:42,220
arrangement of electrons in the atom.
This is long after,

659
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,610
uh, Thompson had written this
about not being able to do that.

660
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,420
So was Louis ignorant
of earn Shaw's Theorem?

661
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,060
Because by 1923,

662
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,610
they know that the nucleus
is not a plum pudding. The,

663
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,570
that is the positive
spear that it's a point,

664
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,903
right?

665
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,900
So was Louis just naive?
No.

666
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,930
Look what he wrote in 1916 the electric
forces between particles which are very

667
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:15,910
close together do not obey the
simple laws of inverse squares,

668
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:20,140
which holds at greater distances.
So cool ohms law breaks down.

669
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,210
You don't have inverse square,

670
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,810
so then you don't have
earned Shaw's therapy and you
don't have to worry and you

671
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,510
couldn't get a structure if it's
not an inverse square force law,

672
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,350
no trouble. But what is
the forest law? Well,

673
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,060
Thomson thought the same thing in 1923
in his book, the electron on chemistry,

674
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:40,760
he wrote if electron nuclear attraction,

675
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,610
we're to very strictly
as the inverse square,

676
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,300
we know by Earnshaw is there and that
no stable configuration is possible with

677
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:50,300
the electrons at rest are oscillating
about positions of equilibrium.

678
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,370
I shall assume that the law of force
between a positive charge and an electron

679
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:57,170
is expressed by this equation.

680
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,020
Then a number of electrons
can be in equilibrium about
a positive charge without

681
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:05,630
necessarily describing orbits around it.
And look at the,

682
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,620
we're going to end right now by looking
at this equation. What's that bit of it?

683
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:14,420
The first bit, the one
part that's cool. Ohms law.

684
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,950
He's got a correction to cool
ohms law here at the end,

685
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,250
c over r where C is a distance,

686
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,280
you divided by r and you get a number
and see as a distance that's on the scale

687
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:30,920
of atomic lengths, right? And that,

688
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,280
that as long as C is, is, is very small,

689
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,590
uh, per partner as long as, uh, uh, I
said, what if I got this right? Okay.

690
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,610
So when distance are gets smaller than C,

691
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,610
then the force changes sign.

692
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:50,943
Okay?

693
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,200
So what was attractive becomes repulsive.

694
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:55,750
And then you can have the electrons
sitting around the nucleus.

695
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,753
Okay?

696
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,650
So we'll see what happened
three years later. Next time.
